[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.240 --> 00:19.780]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.780 --> 00:33.900]  Alex Jones Al Jorgensen of ministry the schedule to join us via video link from
[00:33.900 --> 00:39.960]  his command center in El Paso Texas coming up in the third hour to say he's
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.820]  eccentric he is he is a whitewash very interesting fellow listener of the show
[00:46.820 --> 00:51.620]  I'm a big fan of obviously ministry's music very informative and also very
[00:51.620 --> 00:59.300]  good and so he should be on the transmission with us today that said I
[00:59.300 --> 01:08.540]  am in a controlled rage today not just over the state of the world and the
[01:08.540 --> 01:14.660]  globalist programs but just assessing people in general most people grown up
[01:14.660 --> 01:22.980]  without any real challenges in their lives and with no organizational skills
[01:23.980 --> 01:31.140]  and we are a nation in a Western world that loves to pass the buck and I just
[01:31.140 --> 01:35.060]  can't imagine what it's gonna look like when things really unravel you know Ron
[01:35.060 --> 01:38.820]  Paul was on two weeks ago and he's warned of impending economic doomsday
[01:38.820 --> 01:43.420]  because there's no way that it's not gonna come it's engineered that way the
[01:43.420 --> 01:47.900]  Washington Post is a lead today Rand Paul courts donors while father talks of
[01:47.900 --> 01:54.500]  impending doomsday and Rand Paul was being demonized more than Ted Cruz more
[01:54.500 --> 01:58.780]  than anybody else out there because they know he's a good guy they know he's
[01:58.780 --> 02:03.660]  pro-gun pro sovereignty he's been a little bit more hawkish than his father
[02:03.660 --> 02:09.180]  and things to differentiate himself politically so they can't demonize him
[02:09.180 --> 02:14.500]  and stop him from one of the nomination the fact that they're attacking Rand
[02:14.500 --> 02:17.860]  Paul is all you need to know same thing with Sarah Palin now Sarah Palin's a
[02:17.860 --> 02:23.900]  big hawk but I don't think she's a bad person and I know the system has come
[02:23.900 --> 02:27.460]  after her and demonized her and I said yesterday a successful ticket would
[02:27.460 --> 02:34.140]  obviously be Rand Paul Sarah Palin her as the VP Ted Cruz Sarah Palin if she
[02:34.140 --> 02:37.700]  was better than a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul I would say put her on as the
[02:37.700 --> 02:43.580]  presidential candidate but I just think they're they're better than her better
[02:43.580 --> 02:47.100]  on their voting records better in their understanding Rand Paul's not as big a
[02:47.100 --> 02:50.620]  warmonger but you're gonna get warmongering out of any administration
[02:50.620 --> 02:54.420]  and I'm not a lesser of two evils guy I don't think the presidency is the end
[02:54.420 --> 02:57.580]  all be all of everything we take things back at the state and county and city
[02:57.580 --> 03:01.460]  level and just start saying no also unconstitutional garbage but in the big
[03:01.460 --> 03:05.900]  horse race it is the presidency obviously a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz
[03:05.900 --> 03:17.620]  presidential run is a whole universe better a whole universe better than a
[03:17.620 --> 03:22.020]  Hillary Clinton or a Jeb Bush president I mean that's not rocket science so
[03:22.020 --> 03:26.580]  you've got all these purists out there that sit on the bench every four years
[03:26.580 --> 03:31.780]  or they'll support some third party that has no chance of winning and then get
[03:31.780 --> 03:35.500]  mad when they don't win you've got to take over one of the two big parties now
[03:35.500 --> 03:39.540]  I'm all for a libertarian movement regional wins getting independence and
[03:39.540 --> 03:43.340]  libertarians in the Congress that can be done but that's still a long shot you've
[03:43.340 --> 03:48.540]  got to build coalitions at regional levels first that's where third party
[03:48.540 --> 03:54.260]  movements can really historically have their biggest effect and still it's
[03:54.260 --> 04:00.220]  it's tough but in this atmosphere it can be done but that's where I stand it
[04:00.220 --> 04:05.020]  doesn't mean I endorse Sarah Palin it means they demonize her still every day
[04:05.020 --> 04:09.380]  for a reason the power structure doesn't like her that ought to tell you
[04:09.380 --> 04:17.620]  something right there I've known Rand Paul since 1995 he's been here to awesome
[04:17.620 --> 04:22.180]  of interviewing I'm one of the first people to ever get him on air probably
[04:22.180 --> 04:27.540]  the first I know Rand Paul and they know he's for real that's why even though he's
[04:27.540 --> 04:30.660]  played politics with them and come out and said something they want to hear
[04:30.660 --> 04:33.940]  they're in the Atlantic monthly and others saying don't believe him he's nuts
[04:33.940 --> 04:37.820]  like his father because yeah he is a constitutionalist Patriot like his
[04:37.820 --> 04:45.740]  father and they know that okay so he's playing politics with him like Clinton
[04:45.740 --> 04:50.020]  played politics and say that didn't want your guns or Obama did well he's doing
[04:50.020 --> 04:53.540]  that on the opposite end and they know it and they don't like it they're coming
[04:53.540 --> 04:57.940]  after Rand Paul is awesome

[10:49.660 --> 10:54.980]  that's right he went out and almost every person he talked to in California
[10:54.980 --> 11:02.300]  wanted to repeal the bill of rights if you use the words Obama supports it
[11:02.300 --> 11:08.340]  Obama supports feeding little kittens in the wood jippers Obama supports making
[11:08.340 --> 11:12.180]  men sit on the toilet and not stand they're trying to make men do that in
[11:12.180 --> 11:17.180]  Germany that was in the news over the weekend some not being sarcastic they're
[11:17.180 --> 11:21.300]  just throwing it in our face but saying it's for Obama so you should support it

[11:59.140 --> 12:05.060]  after Google hands staff emails the US government Barack Obama films anti-oil
[12:05.060 --> 12:13.300]  drilling video from a jet but then meanwhile don't forget that he in the
[12:13.300 --> 12:17.060]  state of the Union bragged about incentives for oil drilling in the US
[12:17.060 --> 12:22.020]  when he cut the permits by 40 something percent two months ago so see he knows a
[12:22.020 --> 12:25.700]  mainline audience wants drilling but then he goes to his audience and says
[12:25.700 --> 12:30.300]  we're not gonna allow drilling we're gonna stop it while he is on a huge
[12:30.300 --> 12:36.420]  wide-body jet aircraft with a whole string of support aircraft there's
[12:36.420 --> 12:42.420]  another big story daddy issues are Ron Paul's hardcore stands a problem for
[12:42.420 --> 12:47.020]  son's presidential bid kit Daniel's got an audio interview with the former
[12:47.020 --> 12:51.300]  congressman this weekend at the very speech they're taking out of context
[12:51.300 --> 12:56.100]  he's gonna have an article out in the next few hours specifically with Ron
[12:56.100 --> 13:01.220]  Paul addressing that issue he does not believe secession is going to happen he
[13:01.220 --> 13:04.860]  simply just ask questions about it and talks about it and the media tries to
[13:04.860 --> 13:09.540]  spin it like he's some radical to demonize Rand Paul we're going to be
[13:09.540 --> 13:17.140]  talking about that coming up Rand Paul has had some mildly hawkish rhetoric but
[13:17.140 --> 13:22.100]  he does say get rid of all foreign aid he said if we get attacked we'll fight
[13:22.100 --> 13:26.860]  back stuff like that I don't even see that as hawkish so he's been attacked by
[13:26.860 --> 13:32.980]  a lot of the libertarian stalwarts and others for not being a total purist like
[13:32.980 --> 13:37.180]  his father he's got a real shot at winning the presidency he's positioning
[13:37.180 --> 13:45.100]  himself it's very clear to not be eclipsed by his great father and to be
[13:45.100 --> 13:50.060]  able to have more of a mass appeal and to say I'm my own person from a
[13:50.060 --> 13:53.300]  disinformation campaign they're gonna put out they're gonna misrepresent what
[13:53.300 --> 13:57.540]  Ron Paul has to say they're gonna use info wars and that their relationship
[13:57.540 --> 14:01.100]  it's already being done every week to demonize him as well he has to
[14:01.100 --> 14:06.860]  differentiate and to say I'm my own person here's what I stand for not that
[14:06.860 --> 14:13.340]  he isn't going to carry out a pro america free market great agenda if he was
[14:13.340 --> 14:19.020]  to be elected president he's simply positioning to be able to defeat their
[14:19.020 --> 14:25.420]  false attacks by saying well I don't know if they really said that or you're
[14:25.420 --> 14:31.500]  taking out a context but I'm my own man here's what I stand for and in Atlantic
[14:31.500 --> 14:34.260]  Monthly and a bunch of other publications they have made that point
[14:34.260 --> 14:41.220]  that they know that Rand Paul really is a horrible constitutionalist patriot like
[14:41.220 --> 14:46.380]  his father and it's so horrible now I think he's gone a little too far in
[14:46.380 --> 14:52.460]  positioning himself away from the hardcore constitutionalist stance for
[14:52.460 --> 14:56.180]  political points because I believe that bites him in the butt bigger with his
[14:56.180 --> 15:00.780]  base but I get some of the softening because you're talking to a completely
[15:00.780 --> 15:06.900]  dumbed-down population when you talk about the general electorate and he also
[15:06.900 --> 15:11.940]  wants to scoop up a bunch of democrat votes who are anti-surveillance
[15:11.940 --> 15:16.300]  anti-police state so Rand Paul's been really speaking out against the
[15:16.300 --> 15:20.420]  militarization of police and other issues so I don't know if I totally agree
[15:20.420 --> 15:25.540]  with their political strategy up there at the Senate office and in the new
[15:25.540 --> 15:28.860]  presidential office they're getting ready to launch and we told you here
[15:28.860 --> 15:32.980]  first years ago he's running I personally on the phone a private phone
[15:32.980 --> 15:38.460]  call to before he was senator to his home in Kentucky said listen you're
[15:38.460 --> 15:42.780]  going to end up winning if you run for Senate and I know there's a bunch of
[15:42.780 --> 15:46.580]  politicos out there telling you can't win you're gonna get the money they're
[15:46.580 --> 15:50.220]  gonna love you in Kentucky do it and the last time he was on the show about a
[15:50.220 --> 15:55.180]  year ago he said yeah it was you and others that said I should I should run
[15:55.180 --> 15:59.220]  and you were right and he had people dressed up and racist outfits claiming
[15:59.220 --> 16:02.540]  they were his supporters we identified them as democrats and helped expose that
[16:02.540 --> 16:06.660]  I could get senator Paul back on the show quite frankly it doesn't really
[16:06.660 --> 16:10.580]  even boost ratings we can play clips of what he has to say I just leave him
[16:10.580 --> 16:16.060]  alone because in a way I don't even like the fact that we're gonna get a bunch
[16:16.060 --> 16:20.540]  of attention and a political season coming up as they take stuff I've done
[16:20.540 --> 16:25.940]  out of context and try to project it on to Ron Paul and Rand Paul but she got a
[16:25.940 --> 16:31.700]  dance with the people that brung you and our ideas of freedom that are seen as
[16:31.700 --> 16:36.980]  radical or just classic Americana and they are gaining steam on every front
[16:36.980 --> 16:41.980]  but at the same time the mainstream media can still distort and so that's why
[16:41.980 --> 16:48.380]  he's distanced himself a few degrees from his father and from this show you know
[16:48.380 --> 16:51.260]  he would sit and talk to look radowski great guy from we are changed the
[16:51.260 --> 16:55.020]  founder of it and talk about Bilderberg group and say I'll talk to Alex Jones
[16:55.020 --> 16:58.700]  about that but then after he got chased around I'm not saying looks a bad guy I
[16:58.700 --> 17:01.820]  could just see wrong Rand Paul's position got chased around a few times
[17:01.820 --> 17:04.700]  inside the Senate he just started saying hey you know what I'm not doing
[17:04.700 --> 17:08.060]  interviewing unless it's scheduled because if you start doing that every
[17:08.060 --> 17:12.300]  time then you can't even get through the building to where you're going so I've
[17:12.300 --> 17:16.020]  had reporters show up at other people's offices or people's houses and they'll
[17:16.020 --> 17:19.140]  call and say people are here demanding to talk to you and you please come here
[17:19.140 --> 17:22.140]  they say they're here to interview you must talk to them it's like coming to my
[17:22.140 --> 17:27.180]  house and saying I demand that you have dinner with me now that doesn't mean if
[17:27.180 --> 17:29.740]  somebody won't answer questions that you shouldn't go out and ask them a
[17:29.740 --> 17:34.620]  question I mean that I mean that's a good guerrilla journalism hell I'm one of
[17:34.620 --> 17:38.300]  the modern pioneers of it and when I say modern pioneers it's kind of like new
[17:38.300 --> 17:44.740]  wave I certainly didn't invent it but that's what's going on with Rand Paul and
[17:44.740 --> 17:49.420]  then once you're a senator you've got so many forces attacking you from all
[17:49.420 --> 17:54.540]  around that you end up going into kind of a fortress mentality and believe me I
[17:54.540 --> 18:01.100]  understand that I don't really have security I don't ever really over the
[18:01.100 --> 18:04.220]  years get on a power trip about how many people I reach but at a certain point
[18:04.220 --> 18:07.660]  you realize hey I have a mission to complete I've got to go into a little
[18:07.660 --> 18:11.340]  bit of a fortress mentality just because there are people that will use your
[18:11.340 --> 18:17.140]  accessibility to attack you or to make stuff up about you or to claim they had
[18:17.140 --> 18:21.740]  entrance into your life to then make up a story or who'll want to pose with a
[18:21.740 --> 18:26.140]  photo of you just to then create a legend out of it it's a very sick mentally
[18:26.140 --> 18:31.740]  ill society of narcissists out there it doesn't mean even a large minority but a
[18:31.740 --> 18:36.820]  goodly minority a sizable minority of people are completely sociopathic and
[18:36.820 --> 18:40.700]  mentally ill I got to say something like 30% of people are completely out of
[18:40.700 --> 18:44.140]  their minds now mental illness is growing this is the Bible said it would
[18:44.140 --> 18:49.460]  during the degeneration of any society and we're a curse nation we're a curse
[18:49.460 --> 18:53.620]  planet and we could have these curses lifted even if you don't believe in
[18:53.620 --> 18:59.940]  curses spiritualism you should understand that when you write off 55
[18:59.940 --> 19:02.940]  million babies and you start writing off old people and you're right off
[19:02.940 --> 19:07.540]  veterans and have secret death panels and well they're a the system's gonna
[19:07.540 --> 19:12.820]  write you off that's what this is all about that's what this is all about it
[19:12.820 --> 19:19.980]  and that's where this is all going now and so there's no way to paper over the
[19:19.980 --> 19:22.700]  degeneration of society when we come back I'm gonna play this marked ice

[25:43.020 --> 25:47.300]  mark dice the full videos on info wars.com Americans want Obama to repeal
[25:47.300 --> 25:51.620]  the bill of rights as long as you say it's for Obama and that Congress is for
[25:51.620 --> 25:55.820]  it oh well if they're for it I better be for it imagine if they set a new cough
[25:55.820 --> 25:58.900]  in this country which they're now saying Al Qaeda or ISIS is getting ready to do
[25:58.900 --> 26:02.500]  well everybody's got to get rid of the bill of rights why hundreds of thousands
[26:02.500 --> 26:06.620]  died when the nuke went off in Chicago here it is think about Obama deciding to
[26:06.620 --> 26:10.900]  repeal the bill of rights in the face of the new ISIS threat to make sure that
[26:10.900 --> 26:14.700]  we don't have a Charlie Hebdo type of incident here in the states should we
[26:14.700 --> 26:18.700]  should we get behind Obama and the Congress to support the repeal the
[26:18.700 --> 26:23.580]  bill of rights to make sure that we're safe these days I'm not sure I haven't
[26:23.580 --> 26:28.420]  studied enough to make an honest educated comment about he has announced
[26:28.420 --> 26:31.820]  that he's going to repeal the bill of rights to help make sure that we can
[26:31.820 --> 26:35.300]  keep everybody safe here in the whole mall is that the right this that guy
[26:35.300 --> 26:42.020]  looks like FBI or CIA or something and notice he sees it and it wants to be a
[26:42.020 --> 26:45.140]  yes man because he feels like he's part of the power structure and he goes along
[26:45.140 --> 26:51.540]  with it decision should we get behind Obama to make sure that the ISIS
[26:51.540 --> 26:55.260]  threat doesn't rear its head here in America yeah I would agree with that
[26:55.260 --> 27:02.580]  yeah yeah yeah end of day yeah you know I mean Obama probably knows he's in a
[27:02.580 --> 27:06.100]  better position to know if we should repeal he's probably got two right to
[27:06.100 --> 27:10.260]  keep everybody right you would hope so right okay right wish I can give you
[27:10.260 --> 27:16.860]  more but hey he knows what's best but I think he's depending on an awful lot of
[27:16.860 --> 27:21.260]  people that he's got some insider and help him make the best decisions right
[27:21.260 --> 27:25.700]  sometimes they might seem so from the beginning or from the surface but only
[27:25.700 --> 27:28.300]  time will tell whether now was the right or wrong decision right he is
[27:28.300 --> 27:32.540]  surrounded by a bunch of economic and political advisors and if they're
[27:32.540 --> 27:36.420]  saying we should repeal the bill of rights they probably know what's best
[27:36.420 --> 27:40.940]  for us right you would hope so yeah absolutely Obama has announced that in
[27:40.940 --> 27:44.980]  the wake of the new rise of the ISIS the terrorist threat we're gonna repeal the
[27:44.980 --> 27:47.700]  bill of rights should we get behind that just to make sure that we don't have
[27:47.700 --> 27:52.060]  another 9-11 style attack oh shoot my husband would be the one to ask this
[27:52.060 --> 27:56.660]  quite I don't follow it close enough to know really if we should repeal the
[27:56.660 --> 28:01.380]  bill of rights well they have insiders and experts so I mean if they're saying
[28:01.380 --> 28:05.500]  Congress is saying we should do it we should probably just get behind that we
[28:05.500 --> 28:09.180]  don't want to both sides you said are supporting it both sides Republicans and
[28:09.180 --> 28:12.780]  the Democrats support them if they're if they're agreeing on something then maybe
[28:12.780 --> 28:17.540]  it is a good thing get then get behind the repeal if they're both they don't
[28:17.540 --> 28:20.300]  ever agree on anything so if they're agreeing on something maybe it's a good
[28:20.300 --> 28:24.340]  thing it's what's best for the new roller okay well let's do it let's do it
[28:24.340 --> 28:28.700]  get behind it thank you very much you're welcome the the Republicans and the
[28:28.700 --> 28:34.220]  Democrats finally have agreed with on something that Obama has announced his
[28:34.220 --> 28:38.860]  decision to repeal the bill of rights in the wake of the rise of ISIS and you
[28:38.860 --> 28:42.620]  think that we could get behind the Congress and and understand that they
[28:42.620 --> 28:46.760]  probably know what's best in this phase of the I would think so yeah I would
[28:46.760 --> 28:52.780]  think so I mean especially what happened overseas and in Paris and if they are
[28:52.780 --> 28:56.380]  saying with their experts that it's time to repeal the bill of rights we could
[28:56.380 --> 29:00.140]  probably get behind that yes sir yes sir does that help us dumbass are you an
[29:00.140 --> 29:05.060]  American citizen oh yes sir I am yes well thank you very much thank you as
[29:05.060 --> 29:08.380]  you probably saw in the news both the Republicans and the Democrats have
[29:08.380 --> 29:12.860]  united bipartisan effort to support Obama's plan to repeal the bill of
[29:12.860 --> 29:17.620]  rights to make sure that I'm coming attack us on the homeland we as the
[29:17.620 --> 29:26.500]  people get behind that that bipartisan effort to write as long as men are made
[29:26.500 --> 29:33.620]  to sit on the toilet that's what I care about men are to control I want them in
[29:33.620 --> 29:37.660]  that run things have a dictatorship absolutely absolutely the bill of

[33:52.780 --> 34:01.660]  like the wicked witch under the house wizard of Oz go ahead and let's listen
[34:01.660 --> 34:04.900]  a little bit of Dave Mustaine a megadeth
[34:04.900 --> 34:22.780]  in my hour of need no you're not there and though I reached out for you
[34:22.780 --> 34:38.380]  in my hour of need no you're not there and though I reached out for you
[34:38.380 --> 35:08.340]  would you ever think you ever think that I need to
[35:08.340 --> 35:15.980]  play this part then I'll shut it down to get back into the news
[35:27.380 --> 35:30.420]  who's gonna stand up for all the innocence being chewed up by the
[35:30.420 --> 35:35.700]  globalist right now or all the men too busy playing at being men playing at
[35:35.700 --> 35:41.540]  posturing and pretending they're on a mission no it's not a mission men to
[35:41.540 --> 35:44.860]  just make money or just watch football or just drive the best car in that cool
[35:44.860 --> 35:49.500]  the mission is build a civilization and the reason we're so unhappy is we
[35:49.500 --> 35:54.660]  don't have real goals even those that seek out God go to big glitter bug
[35:54.660 --> 35:59.260]  establishment churches on average that are government run in fact the entire
[35:59.260 --> 36:05.140]  system is set up to ensure that men never become real men that we just
[36:05.140 --> 36:10.460]  dawdle and totter and fritter our way through life never actually having an
[36:10.460 --> 36:15.020]  effect while the real engineers of the planet decide the destiny of humanity
[36:15.020 --> 36:23.180]  that's no destiny at all you look at the one guy in this Mark Dice interview
[36:23.180 --> 36:27.780]  where he doesn't go out and cherry pick you can do this in 15 minutes we've
[36:27.780 --> 36:31.020]  done it ourselves in California same place he goes we've done it in Austin
[36:31.020 --> 36:35.860]  you just got to go where trend these are liberals are you go where conservatives
[36:35.860 --> 36:39.580]  are you get about half of them to say stuff like this you go where liberals
[36:39.580 --> 36:44.580]  are you get about 95% you'll see somebody think when you ask the question
[36:44.580 --> 36:50.340]  will go I need more info said of no way repelable rights no way put gun owners
[36:50.340 --> 36:54.780]  in forced labor camps dice went out a few years ago and talked about was it
[36:54.780 --> 36:59.620]  15 people or so and all of them but one said yeah let's put them in forced
[36:59.620 --> 37:04.460]  labor camps and take their guns and dice like yeah cuz they're troublemakers and
[37:04.460 --> 37:07.820]  the guy goes you don't tell me buddy he's like a 65 year old guy looks like he
[37:07.820 --> 37:11.540]  has a college degree well-spoken smart dressed nice he's like I hear you let's
[37:11.540 --> 37:18.340]  put him in camps right now you call that a liberal no that is a sicko that like a
[37:18.340 --> 37:23.740]  moth to flame just trust the system and gets a feeling of power out of imagining
[37:23.740 --> 37:28.900]  getting rid of freedoms you got the low-level you know executive manager
[37:28.900 --> 37:32.140]  probably makes $20 an hour
[37:32.420 --> 37:37.500]  lady in her little business outfit you can analyze each one of these people
[37:37.500 --> 37:41.380]  she's like yeah let's pull Bill writes right now uh-huh yeah let's do it now
[37:41.380 --> 37:45.580]  another woman is why they target women with most of the propaganda it's not that
[37:45.580 --> 37:49.820]  women are stupid they want to comply they want to get along that's just
[37:49.820 --> 37:55.500]  genetic on average it varies on average though first you get the women then you
[37:55.500 --> 37:58.540]  got the children so follow them in Adolf Hitler just go take a marketing class
[37:58.540 --> 38:02.500]  they'll tell you target women in the general media that's who they target
[38:02.500 --> 38:08.380]  they make most of purchases they make most of major decisions and they're
[38:08.380 --> 38:13.780]  very easy to make comply if you sell it in a herd mentality talks to her she's
[38:13.780 --> 38:18.300]  like better talk to my husband I don't know about politics well well everybody's
[38:18.300 --> 38:25.340]  doing it oh I'm for it she's not evil but she got the first guy that well the
[38:25.340 --> 38:29.380]  second one he talks to but the first to agree with it the first guy wouldn't go
[38:29.380 --> 38:33.660]  along with it he's like oh absolutely you know we don't know what they know we
[38:33.660 --> 38:37.180]  need to just go ahead and trust them and just get rid of the Bill of Rights
[38:37.180 --> 38:43.100]  because Obama he has the advisors yeah the foreign special interest that when
[38:43.100 --> 38:49.220]  they get control of a country they just start murdering everyone I mean if the
[38:49.220 --> 38:52.820]  globalists could get full control here they do what they've done in Libya or
[38:52.820 --> 39:00.100]  Syria or Iraq right now in Greece they're four years in to people dropping
[39:00.100 --> 39:03.380]  their babies off every day at hospitals and just leaving them there little
[39:03.380 --> 39:09.020]  children being dropped off collapse of civilization all signing the public on
[39:09.020 --> 39:14.780]  the debts that weren't even theirs billionaires taking over Greek islands
[39:14.780 --> 39:19.780]  on quote debt Greece owes them because Greece bailed out their funds then they
[39:19.780 --> 39:24.380]  get islands and those very people go to Davos and then lecture everyone on not
[39:24.380 --> 39:28.740]  having a high standard of living and how it'll save the earth just total
[39:28.740 --> 39:34.300]  hypocrites and no media will call him on it let's go back to the last couple
[39:34.300 --> 39:37.780]  people Mark Dice talked to here it is as you probably saw in the news both the
[39:37.780 --> 39:42.300]  Republicans and the Democrats have united a bipartisan effort to support
[39:42.300 --> 39:46.980]  Obama's plan to repeal the Bill of Rights to make sure that ISIS doesn't come
[39:46.980 --> 39:50.420]  and attack us on the homeland should we as a people get behind that that
[39:50.420 --> 39:58.980]  bipartisan effort to make sure that position to know whether we should
[39:58.980 --> 40:07.380]  you know repeal these they would come over here right I'm drinking shouldn't
[40:07.380 --> 40:14.700]  do this we as a public get behind Obama's decision to repeal the Bill of
[40:14.700 --> 40:20.060]  Rights as a response to the new rise of ISIS and the the radical terrorist
[40:20.060 --> 40:23.700]  threat I think that'd be the best for the country just to help keep everybody
[40:23.700 --> 40:28.060]  safe yeah we could repeal the Bill of Rights and sort of modernize this new
[40:28.060 --> 40:33.180]  world order that we're in and yep and just you know help help unroll the the
[40:33.180 --> 40:39.580]  plan yeah that sounds great to me all right thank you very much thank you the
[40:39.580 --> 40:43.220]  Republicans and the Democrats have finally agreed on something and they're
[40:43.220 --> 40:47.780]  all supporting Obama's decision to repeal the house that woman is in the
[40:47.780 --> 40:52.580]  wake of the rise of the ISIS terrorist threat so we get behind Obama and the
[40:52.580 --> 40:56.740]  repeal sure we don't have another 9-11 or like Charlie Hebdo style a terrorist
[40:56.740 --> 41:02.220]  attack here I mean I I guess I don't really know too much about it though so
[41:02.220 --> 41:07.060]  obviously we need to give them the power right yeah repeal the bill rights and
[41:07.060 --> 41:11.340]  really you know to help remedy this this terrorist threat that we're facing I
[41:11.340 --> 41:16.460]  guess I guess so yeah that's probably the right decision yes yes whatever he
[41:16.460 --> 41:19.940]  wants to do it's probably the best for the country repealing the bill of
[41:19.940 --> 41:25.460]  rights yeah take your education for them both go for it go over now though
[41:25.460 --> 41:32.060]  thank you very much should we get behind Congress and Obama to support this
[41:32.060 --> 41:37.380]  new phase in the war on terror to help keep everybody safe to repeal the
[41:37.380 --> 41:46.100]  rights absolutely not that's crazy so we got one person wouldn't answer and then
[41:46.100 --> 41:50.220]  one person that said that's crazy that's the normal response by anyone half
[41:50.220 --> 41:55.380]  sane and then I think it was eight other people agreeing to it so that's 80%
[41:55.380 --> 42:01.300]  there so that's a low number you know usually it's 95% out there say put gun
[42:01.300 --> 42:07.740]  owners and FEMA camps forcibly abort babies I mean they'll sign anything if
[42:07.740 --> 42:15.700]  you say it's for Obama this is a cult this is a cult 90 plus percent of people
[42:15.700 --> 42:22.980]  in Austin signed a petition to ban the hydrogen monoxide for the earth and
[42:22.980 --> 42:28.860]  people say well that's crazy to ban water well a lot of folks want to ban what
[42:28.860 --> 42:36.540]  comes out of power plants and it's not smoke it's carbon dioxide and water
[42:36.540 --> 42:42.300]  vapor but see carbon dioxide sounds scary just like the hydrogen monoxide or
[42:42.300 --> 42:48.340]  you can go out and get most people to say banned salt if you use the technical
[42:48.340 --> 42:55.260]  name sodium chloride that's just the way it works and they love their ignorance
[42:55.260 --> 42:58.860]  and they'll argue with you too like we ought to do some videos where we go
[42:58.860 --> 43:03.340]  further start arguing with them and go hey listen the bill of rights is all of
[43:03.340 --> 43:07.140]  our basic freedoms and checks and balances that's what separates us from
[43:07.140 --> 43:11.100]  North Korea and once they've said they want to get rid of it they'll bow up and
[43:11.100 --> 43:18.420]  buck up and start defending themselves Leanne was doing that one on water and
[43:18.420 --> 43:21.340]  this guy's bragging hitting on her these got a degree in chemistry from Cornell
[43:21.340 --> 43:27.060]  and yeah he wants to ban it for the earth and she starts really you know
[43:27.060 --> 43:31.220]  repeating herself to me goes listen I got a degree it's like okay well it must
[43:31.220 --> 43:35.860]  have done you a lot of good in chemistry that you don't know what water is buddy
[43:35.860 --> 43:42.980]  without it we'd be dead and and and really taxes on carbon dioxide our taxes
[43:42.980 --> 43:48.820]  on oxygen because everybody knows knows where the everybody knows where the
[43:48.820 --> 43:54.340]  oxygen comes from right oxygen is a very low percentage of trace gas like
[43:54.340 --> 43:59.100]  like carbon dioxide and does everybody know where the where the oxygen comes
[43:59.100 --> 44:04.780]  from of course they've gone back in an ice core samples and things and they
[44:04.780 --> 44:08.740]  know that first it was low then it built up now it's going low again in the
[44:08.740 --> 44:16.660]  scheme of time on this earth it comes from plants and photo plankton and they
[44:16.660 --> 44:21.820]  take in the carbon dioxide and then they put off oxygen and we have a symbiotic
[44:21.820 --> 44:32.140]  relationship plants and animals it's a very racist relationship though and oh
[44:32.140 --> 44:42.060]  my god how do I reach out to it's scary though because most people I talked to
[44:42.060 --> 44:51.180]  even executives don't know what's going on when I talk about executives I mean
[44:51.180 --> 44:56.180]  people that are making $5 million a year not the new executive female class
[44:56.180 --> 45:00.060]  where they make $40,000 a year and have a bunch of guys under them and go
[45:00.060 --> 45:03.740]  absolutely absolutely and then they end up making $100,000 a year and they go
[45:03.740 --> 45:09.460]  out and get their trophy husband who's an artist I say that in quotes who you
[45:09.460 --> 45:15.660]  know bought her a taco one time so she buys him a car the difference is though
[45:15.660 --> 45:20.020]  those families don't have babies so they're not families biologically and
[45:20.020 --> 45:26.380]  so that's all coming to an end it was all engineered so enjoy the one season of
[45:26.380 --> 45:30.540]  the women getting most the executive jobs and being 65% of the college
[45:30.540 --> 45:34.820]  graduates and you know the guys out there mowing your lawn because by the
[45:34.820 --> 45:41.980]  time you figure out biologically what they did to you it's too late all a
[45:41.980 --> 45:47.420]  battle plan I don't care less if women were executives I'll hire a woman I'll
[45:47.420 --> 45:54.380]  hire a man I'll hire anybody get the job done it in the commie but it's just
[45:54.380 --> 45:59.620]  this I'm a woman and so you don't know anything Obama likes me you don't need
[45:59.620 --> 46:06.060]  your guns I told you I was at the gym the other day this woman's like she obviously
[46:06.060 --> 46:11.580]  knew who I was in my trainer she's like yeah I just don't think people need guns
[46:11.580 --> 46:18.220]  I just want to say this to me I don't I really agree with Liam Neeson and I was
[46:18.220 --> 46:22.740]  just like really you do you know where the crime rates are crime rate I don't
[46:22.740 --> 46:31.820]  know what I'm talking about and I didn't want to say it I was in Whole Foods
[46:31.820 --> 46:35.820]  yesterday which I hardly ever go to but I wanted to get some epsom salts and some
[46:35.820 --> 46:42.900]  other things and I was there and two or three times I decided to get some stuff
[46:42.900 --> 46:46.260]  for meatballs and spaghetti for the kids last night so I was by a few things
[46:46.260 --> 46:52.100]  and I came over and I said where's the French onion soup mix a mix of meatballs
[46:52.100 --> 46:57.300]  was real nice I came over to stalkers twice they go we don't work here I was
[46:57.300 --> 47:01.580]  like oh thank you I know but you're on this aisle and I'm having trouble and
[47:01.580 --> 47:04.340]  that's why Whole Foods moment said oh hi Alex Jones hey don't it's you know it's
[47:04.340 --> 47:07.580]  over on the chip aisle actually I was like thanks but the next time I asked
[47:07.580 --> 47:10.820]  one of the stalkers they were all in there in middle of the day on a Sunday
[47:10.820 --> 47:16.540]  that's where I came down here to the Sunday show and I said that's okay because
[47:16.540 --> 47:20.460]  a robot's gonna replace you soon and I know you play on your iPhone all day and
[47:20.460 --> 47:24.660]  don't like to talk to people and that's your power is to be flip it and rude and
[47:24.660 --> 47:30.620]  go whenever you know someone asks you a question about three people around me
[47:30.620 --> 47:41.220]  laughed and the person was like they didn't even understand that humans are
[47:41.220 --> 47:45.460]  just supposed to talk to each other and help each other that studies came out
[47:45.460 --> 47:50.180]  two years ago a government study in Canada where environmentalists are six
[47:50.180 --> 47:54.660]  times more likely to steal and environmentalists are I forget how many
[47:54.660 --> 47:59.700]  times less likely to give money and conservatives are the most likely to
[47:59.700 --> 48:03.420]  give money to charity see their people real conservatives not your
[48:03.420 --> 48:05.860]  establishment conservatives the fake ones that control the conservative
[48:05.860 --> 48:10.540]  movement but real conservatives want to keep their money and then they want to
[48:10.540 --> 48:14.540]  give it to who they want to give it to that's just a fact you can pull the
[48:14.540 --> 48:21.460]  studies up the so-called liberal is a self-centered nobody who is a control
[48:21.460 --> 48:25.620]  freak and hates anyone who's successful there it is how going green may make you
[48:25.620 --> 48:30.540]  mean the Guardian ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to
[48:30.540 --> 48:38.260]  steal study fines we'll see my memory serves right it was six times when Al
[48:38.260 --> 48:41.780]  Gore was caught running up huge energy bills in a home at the same time as
[48:41.780 --> 48:44.780]  lecturing on the need to save electricity it turns out he was only
[48:44.780 --> 48:50.940]  reverting to green type yeah Canadian psychologist and it goes through the
[48:50.940 --> 49:00.580]  whole government-funded university study again I'm not saying there aren't real
[49:00.580 --> 49:03.700]  people that would call themselves liberals who voted for Obama because
[49:03.700 --> 49:07.100]  they didn't want to vote for a war mongering Republican but see you notice
[49:07.100 --> 49:12.100]  you got even more war mongering under him later in the honor system in which
[49:12.100 --> 49:15.420]  participants were asked to take money from an envelope to pay themselves their
[49:15.420 --> 49:21.420]  spoils the greens were six times more likely to steal than conventionals and
[49:21.420 --> 49:24.140]  if you drill down in that study and others conventionals or conservatives
[49:24.140 --> 49:28.580]  libertarians are just non-control freaks honorable people I mean let me tell
[49:28.580 --> 49:34.340]  you something the problem is the best men and women out there are prideful and
[49:34.340 --> 49:38.060]  don't want to get in your business don't want to run your life and quite
[49:38.060 --> 49:43.580]  frankly don't want to hang around with you see those of us that produce are so
[49:43.580 --> 49:49.700]  successful and so happy in relationships and money and an art and
[49:49.700 --> 49:54.980]  literature and poetry that we don't need to walk around and get the trendy look
[49:54.980 --> 49:58.660]  of a trendy haircut and and and sycophantically act like a bunch of
[49:58.660 --> 50:06.380]  snobs a bunch of wine snobs I like wine myself I'm saying that it's just it you
[50:06.380 --> 50:09.940]  know the archetype I'm talking about these are people that have nothing
[50:09.940 --> 50:13.380]  they're super stupid they would vote to get rid of the Bill of Rights and told
[50:13.380 --> 50:18.220]  to do so they would put me in a FEMA camp and would love a job to kick our
[50:18.220 --> 50:23.460]  guts in and I'm serious that happens in every culture in every society you end
[50:23.460 --> 50:28.180]  up having the nobodies for a tiny elite who want to rape our wives take our
[50:28.180 --> 50:33.580]  houses take our kids and kick us till we die they usually do it in a major to
[50:33.580 --> 50:37.060]  take over now they do it through agenda 21 through regulations through
[50:37.060 --> 50:42.420]  bureaucracy and they hate the old traditional honor guard the police who
[50:42.420 --> 50:45.700]  have their own problems but they want to wage war on them and us at the same
[50:45.700 --> 50:49.820]  time while they take over with their new system and so that's the lay of the
[50:49.820 --> 50:55.380]  land I mean we're in deep trouble demonic jibbering control freaks want our
[50:55.380 --> 51:00.740]  guts because they know we're better than them attention Alex Jones listeners

[54:47.540 --> 54:56.340]  there's a quote by Rodney Atkinson the structure of the European Union today
[54:56.340 --> 55:02.180]  is based on the Nazi plans published in Berlin in 1942 that's up on info wars
[55:02.180 --> 55:08.060]  calm in the graphic and then I just see something like that and it tortures me
[55:08.060 --> 55:13.660]  because then it opens up a huge data file in my brain of how the Nazis had a
[55:13.660 --> 55:19.100]  plan to manage the Europe through a European Union and then have a global
[55:19.100 --> 55:24.820]  government competing with the British model with sub directors sub governors
[55:24.820 --> 55:30.820]  puppet viceroys and how they would use what they called soft kill poison in the
[55:30.820 --> 55:35.380]  food and water to first dumb down the population and anesthetize it like a
[55:35.380 --> 55:40.540]  spider first bites its prey to immobilize it and then feed on us later
[55:40.540 --> 55:44.140]  because the Nazis said well you know we're only gonna have like 40 million
[55:44.140 --> 55:49.020]  Germans they even estimated after the war which they did lose 20 million once
[55:49.020 --> 55:52.540]  we take over how are we gonna control several billion people at that time and
[55:52.540 --> 55:58.260]  they said through soft kill ops and we're under soft kill ops I mean I'm
[55:58.260 --> 56:04.380]  living in a twilight zone here and I just it's so stupid I don't want to fight
[56:04.380 --> 56:08.740]  with the cops I don't want to fight with the tough guy at the grocery store I
[56:08.740 --> 56:12.540]  don't want to fight with my neighbors I don't want to sit here and henpeck

[56:36.620 --> 56:40.300]  murdered half the population hell half the population doesn't even know what

[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:30.420]  Alex Jones look at this disgusting headline of Politico Bushes gave

[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:42.180]  that's from Politico that's the drudges headline linking into it God Almighty you
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.140]  know earlier we came in with that Rolling Stones song Shattered and you
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.740]  notice I let it roll about 40 seconds just because I was trying to control
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:53.540]  myself this is not an act when I blow up on air and I probably just need to
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:58.620]  probably leave the day I got Al Jorgensen coming up from ministry though
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:10.260]  and I can't sit here and just act normal while this is going on and I looked at
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:15.180]  that headline info wars.com and I know I've seen all the documents it's public
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:20.460]  it's admitted that the EU was a Nazi plan but the Nazis themselves were just
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:27.140]  a globalist plan they were set up to blow up Europe bringing in an EU model so
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.940]  that then the British Empire could come in and take it over that's what
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:35.100]  Bilderberg was all about and that's Bilderberg attendees like Helmut Schmidt
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.380]  German Chancellor that wrote books I mean I read the books written by them this
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:50.460]  is not my opinion do you understand that and all we've got so a bunch of idiotic
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:55.700]  fight with the cops black on white white on black I'm gonna throw up with that
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.340]  top Spanish news anchor lecturing everyone how dare you don't open the
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.460]  borders up to Latin America how dare you don't give us everything in Latin
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:09.420]  America it's just all all over the top just just all over the top I'm glad
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:14.140]  Mark Dice is coming up because I had him on for like 10 minutes last week and I
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:18.140]  wanted to get him back up about his book for a whole hour this week and then he
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:28.860]  happens to be coming on today when when he's got a new video out all I know is
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:40.460]  I'm just I'm just normal it's normal for any mammal seeing an orchestrated take
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:44.620]  over attack to be upset but see the average person is like an animal that
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.980]  can't look over the horizon and only a response to what they see directly in
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.940]  front of them and the globalist have moved so slowly with institutional
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:54.740]  systems that the average person can't see it and has been acclimated to it but my
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.780]  god when you read the books written by him 50 years ago and we're living it
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.620]  today and then you read the book they wrote 30 years ago and you see what
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:08.700]  they're gonna do next and then you read what they said a week ago I mean if they
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:18.460]  get the next phases in man I don't know what to say to people anymore and then
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.860]  so many people go yeah you're right about this but we're not gonna stop it
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:26.900]  I'm just gonna have a good time they don't even care about their wives their
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:32.540]  children nobody and so you know what you do deserve to die not not at my hands
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:37.580]  I'm saying you've rolled over you forfeited yourself you want to be
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.500]  destroyed and metaphysically than the new world order needed you to have that
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:47.500]  opinion before they could defeat you here's a news flash my spirit my soul
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:52.860]  call it resistant immune whatever you want to this stuff just cries out and
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:59.180]  burns to fight this I hate myself that I can't figure out the levers to move the
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:04.300]  world faster I hate myself that I'm not strong enough and focused enough to be
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.580]  able to just come up with ways to just hit the zeitgeist and smash the enemy I
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.620]  know we've already had a big effect but I just cannot stand these people in the
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:16.580]  way of humanity in the way of progress in the way of honor in the way of
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.860]  strength
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:27.300]  they just have no idea how good it is to be honorable I could pick up on the
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.900]  wavelength the spirit of evil people that are into it I just see them and
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:39.460]  they're all crazed and they hate everybody and I just I just can't
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:44.780]  believe we're gonna turn the world over to these people can't believe that the
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:50.900]  lowest scum on the earth that would shudder the windows of perception would
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:55.700]  be given power over the planet but that's the way it is God of this world

[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:30.540]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:38.300]  to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war the
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.820]  social engineers of the planet gained control of central banking and the
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:45.820]  issuance of currency and credit once they have that they have everything else
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:49.180]  I'm Alex Jones your host thank you for joining us in the second hour we're
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.940]  going to Mark Dice best-selling author media analyst here in just a moment he
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:57.620]  joined us last week I want to give him for most of an hour this week inside the
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.260]  Illuminati is his new book bring into some of the secrets of the Illuminati
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:07.900]  with him here today and also his latest video that we aired last hour where 80
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:11.100]  plus percent of the people in California he talked to want to ban the
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:15.020]  bill of rights for Obama and we should just quote trust him and do whatever he
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:21.180]  says kind of a repeat of Britney Spears saying that about George W. Bush so he's
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:27.860]  joining us in a moment private interest have used our open society against us
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:34.660]  we were built and designed to face a British threat or a quote native
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.620]  savage threat of you use the parlance of the time I'm not calling him savages
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:44.420]  I'm using the parlance of the time the nomenclature of the time or the Spanish
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:53.260]  threat from Spain fighting over Florida or the French threat or the Nazi
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:58.620]  threat then the Russian threat but but what about suits and ties and corporate
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:06.380]  systems and corporate boards and maritime law administrative law already 83%
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:12.460]  this is in the BBC of British laws are made by the EU though they're not allowed
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:20.860]  to vote on that that's how we've been conquered and the average person cares
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.700]  about football stars and movie stars you don't have the people magazine of
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:33.220]  politics or really exposing bad guys why we hear in the news today that Hillary's
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.540]  pro-gun and wants to shut down the border of course she's the total engineer of
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:41.380]  most of what we see that she doesn't know if she likes Obamacare now this is
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:50.980]  what she tried to pass back in 92 93 94 94 this is all just the mind control they
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:57.940]  engage in because people don't seem to have long-term memories it's very very
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.060]  frightening to see this unfolding we're having our borders usurped our
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.460]  sovereignty usurp the news is announcing our kids belong to state we're
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:11.300]  being bankrupted while the feds themselves occupied by the globalist
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:16.940]  bureaucrats are preparing the police and the military for war with the American
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:24.020]  people we couldn't be in more dire straits there's an article out
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:31.940]  criticizing Ron Paul Rand Paul via Ron Paul that oh he wants the session and
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:36.380]  he's crazy cooking actually we have the speech recorded from Saturday our
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:39.300]  reporter was there and we interviewed Ron Paul that'll be up the next hour so
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:43.620]  info wars calm he actually didn't endorse the session he just talked about
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:48.740]  succession but it just shows the type of disinformation that's out there daddy
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:56.580]  issues are Ron Paul's hardcore stands a problem for son's presidential bit that's
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:00.740]  just some of the news we have look at this flashback drudge has it we should
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:05.180]  do a story on this flashback the New York Times an article called the end of
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:11.580]  snow I remember covering this a few years ago well guess what's going on
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:19.540]  today see there's the original article the end of snow from February of last
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:25.500]  year talk about asinine talk about ridiculous but then up above it record
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:31.860]  snow governor vows subways will not close the mayor says could be the biggest
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:39.220]  in history Al Gore said the ice caps would be melted north and south by 2013
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:48.900]  they are the biggest ever recorded this winter and the winter last most of the
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.740]  northern passages that are used for shipping to get from the US or Russia
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:59.860]  to Asia quicker it's like a third the distance said having to go down around
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:06.380]  the Horn of Africa or the Horn of South America this would be the Cape or the
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:10.780]  horn depending on which one you talked about they haven't able to use that even
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:13.700]  the icebreakers can't make it through there doesn't matter Al Gore still
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:19.780]  everywhere saying that penguins can't swim polar bears are dying it's just
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:25.940]  total crud but they say every scientist agrees and Congress voted the Senate 98
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:31.300]  to 1 last week that man made global warming is real in a crushing blow
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:40.420]  Republicans cave in and admit the science is overwhelming 98% vote every
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.860]  Republican but one votes with the Democrats in the Senate with one
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:48.260]  abstention I knew those headlines were coming in there they were it's the
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:52.060]  debates over man made global warming is real they tagged it on to the keystone
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:57.140]  pipeline vote and said admit climate change is real well of course climate
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:00.020]  change is happening all the time that's the only thing that is constant change
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:05.900]  and in Hoff comes out says oh we made fun of them yeah because it you know the
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.460]  language was written where we could vote for it because of course change is
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:15.300]  happening oh really see those are the little games they play and they're
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.740]  playing them on people like this let's go ahead and play a little bit of Mark
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.860]  Dice's video again I won't play the whole thing the whole thing's up on
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:29.100]  info wars comm imprisonment on a dot com meet the people who want Obama to
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:33.700]  repeal the bill of rights these are the people that really believe the polar bear
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:38.020]  population is near extinction when it's five times what it was in 1956 here it
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.820]  is as you probably saw in the news both the Republicans and the Democrats have
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.300]  united bipartisan effort to support Obama's plan to repeal the bill of
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.740]  rights to make sure that Isis doesn't come and attack us on the homeland should
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:56.060]  we as a people get behind that that bipartisan effort right absolutely
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:00.180]  absolutely make sure that we're safe there in a little let's go back to the
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:03.540]  second really creepy one if you can cue that up so I don't have time to play the
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:06.860]  whole five minute video and again I want to explain something we've been to the
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:10.820]  same pier and on the same thing with Mark we've gone to the trendy areas in
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:16.300]  Austin I can bite bridge and UT and they're even dumber they call for
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:21.500]  killing children up to age three of the parents want to post both abortions and
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.460]  then they have a whole bunch of national publications and local newspapers say
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:29.980]  that we basically lied and that didn't tell people what was on the petition
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:39.780]  bull bull bull this is who you are okay this is who you are here's that clip of
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.620]  a really creepy guy he has announced that he's going to repeal the Bill of
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:47.300]  Rights to help make sure that we can keep everybody safe here in the homeland is
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:52.820]  that the right decision should we get behind Obama to to make sure that the
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:56.860]  Isis threat doesn't rear its head here in America yeah I would agree with that
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:04.020]  yeah that's yeah yeah and today yeah you know I mean Obama probably knows he's
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.900]  in a better position to know if we should repeal the Bill of Rights to keep
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:11.820]  everybody's safe right you would hope so right okay right which I can give you
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:15.540]  more but hey he just knows what's best that's whatever I wouldn't say
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.420]  necessarily he knows what best but I think he's depending on an awful lot of
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.780]  people that he's got some insider and help him make the best decisions right
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:26.980]  that's enough I see see this is the fake intellectual argument I run people all
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.100]  the time they're lazy this guy watch a sports center all day and then he goes
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.620]  to work at his IRS job or his FBI job I mean that guy's a fit I'll bet my pinky
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:40.100]  let's let's do a search I mean I I'm here to tell you that might even be in
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:44.620]  an intelligence agency they go and put out their fake intelligence they go out
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.900]  and do their little compartmentalized deal their yes man they go to the top and
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.620]  then anyone that they argue with they just go oh I'm sure there's experts that
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:57.580]  know more than you and then that Trump shoe just oh you know what buddy you
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:02.740]  didn't know that that they're hadn't been a caller pillabilla rights they've just
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:09.100]  been doing it by piecemeal and doing it by fiat by conquest but remember when
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:13.260]  they shut off the nuke in this country let's let's play that clip prisoner who
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:18.260]  escaped ISIS captivity tells NBC they want something bigger than 9-11 when
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:23.020]  they shut off the nuke in Dallas Cincinnati Chicago Denver council on
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.300]  farm relations said that that's what they believe will be hit they like till
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.700]  everybody know who did the hitting it's a little open bright kind of like leaving
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:33.820]  the ace of spades when you carry out a knob and I think they'll probably hit
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:37.860]  where they said you know let's go ahead and when once they hit us you can you
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:44.340]  imagine the sheeple they'll be begging for anything let's go to that clip to the
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:50.340]  ISIS fighters seem worried by the US bombing campaign no it was happy about
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:55.380]  it because he says being attacked by the US meant that they were now just as
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:00.340]  important as that old American enemy al-Qaeda they want to be more better than
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:04.180]  al-Qaeda islamic state this is why they need to do something more brutal than
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:09.940]  the war trade center when you saw that's enough what did you think what they are
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:13.500]  as a group of idiots being funded by the west on record and allowed to operate
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:17.060]  and they said a name change their leaders are Western intelligence assets
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.900]  that's on record and then now they're getting you ready for another attack in
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.380]  the US mark dice we're going to break in a moment appreciate you joining us like
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.260]  I'm gonna skip this network break right now just to give you more times I got
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.140]  you on late you're not out there because I've talked to you off here a lot and
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.460]  we've and then we've talked on there about this but I'm not putting words
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:37.220]  in your mouth I want you elaborate I don't take pleasure you don't take
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:42.980]  pleasure in how systematically evil and dumb the public is just evil to be that
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:47.940]  dumb when I started this series in the petition series a few years ago the
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.500]  intent wasn't to actually get people to sign the petition I never really thought
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:55.380]  that they would sign these petitions or agree with these insane claims that I
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:00.300]  was making the Obama repealing the Bill of Rights idea the idea my idea was to
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.940]  actually get them to argue with me how crazy it was as I pretended to be a
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:09.380]  typical brainwashed Obama supporter and I was stunned to find that the vast
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:14.220]  majority of the people were agreeing to the insane ideas and so this is sort of
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:18.740]  a spin-off of my Obama petition to repeal the Bill of Rights you saw a few
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:23.020]  years ago that you had on info wars and so this one I wanted to actually get the
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:27.140]  people's reaction so for the audience for the radio audience they can't see but
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:32.900]  I'm wearing an Obama t-shirt in the video and it's clearly not edited in any
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:37.380]  sort of deceptive way you can see that I'm mentioning repeal the Bill of Rights
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:42.820]  multiple times two or three different times in the same conversation so this
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:48.220]  isn't some daily show style editing trick where they're answering a different
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.660]  question you can see the unedited footage where I'm mentioning it multiple
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:57.580]  times and reminding them and this just goes to show that since I'm holding a
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:02.100]  microphone it's a symbol of authority it's a symbol of power and I'm stating
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.900]  that Obama has done this which I mean essentially he has really so I mean it's
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:09.540]  that's that's not really even it's not really deception you're just overstating
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.660]  it to illustrate it but the part of the point is that not only the public to so
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:16.780]  dumb down they'll go along with anything but this also demonstrates as you know
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:20.260]  as much of this audience knows that when somebody who's in a position of power or
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:24.140]  authority with these symbols of power the microphone a wireless microphone a
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:28.140]  very big symbol of power an expensive piece of equipment and an Obama shirt
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:31.220]  and they're just mindlessly agreeing and you can just see me nodding my head
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:35.180]  like a bobblehead and they just follow right along to get into rapport with me
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:40.020]  very scary this just goes to show why Obama can get on the television or Bush
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.300]  you know a lot of people get trapped into that they'll they'll start cross
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:47.540]  complaining and start pointing out what the opposing political party has done
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:53.060]  or they've done a similar thing and yes they they have this this would go very
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.860]  similarly along both lines but the liberals and the Obama supporters
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:02.300]  overwhelmingly tend to be a much more you know I've been nonpartisan forever
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:08.180]  but let's face it hardcore liberals are the dumbest most mindless people I mean
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:12.180]  my dog is smarter than them I mean these people really are helpless victims and
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.500]  and they've been raised from birth in a trance state with television to be
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.060]  highly suggestible top magicians who are you know old have been on records
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:23.820]  saying that 50 years ago they might find one person on a 20 that was highly
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:27.900]  suggestible now half the crowd when they do the sampling before a show are
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:33.620]  highly suggestible these people are in a trance yeah and like I said when I
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.540]  first started these series that I never thought that people would actually be
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:40.620]  agreeing I thought it would be funny to have them argue and get angry with me as
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:47.540]  I pretended to be the you know fringe lunatic Obama and supporting zealot but
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:51.300]  it was completely opposite of what I thought of the vast majority of the
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.540]  people go right along with it and you can see some of the people in the video
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:59.740]  they just they didn't support it but they just didn't know and I'm sorry I mean
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.740]  that's just as bad they don't know what the bill of rights is or what the word
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:06.820]  repeal is but I guarantee you they know what American Idol is or how to apply
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:11.980]  lipstick or how to be say I'm a feminist I bet you money that woman that you that
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:15.460]  we just had on screen I guarantee she's go I'm a feminist I like Hillary but what's
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:20.700]  wrong with Hillary it's just this vapid not even shallow it's beyond shallow I
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:26.620]  mean these people just have nothing inside their heads and this goes to show
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:30.340]  to a bigger issue how and we can get into it later in the next segment the
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:34.140]  the Illuminati sort of emanating and becoming a part of pop culture and the
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:38.420]  vast majority of Americans now instead of despising them as being the criminal
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:43.900]  puppet masters behind the the false flag war-starting provocateur events and
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:46.940]  the crashing the economy and pulling the strings behind the Federal Reserve
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:51.860]  etc the vast majority of the people now see them as attractive and want to be a
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:55.500]  part of that power structure as a party group you want to get involved and with
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.900]  all the movie stars and and hip-hop and rock stars talking about it and that was
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:03.660]  a plan if you go back to professional wrestling right after George Herbert
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.060]  Walker Bush gave his new order speeches there was a big opposition to global
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.860]  government they came out with Hulk Hogan in the New World Order and they would
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:15.860]  make similar statements and then I would get calls almost every broadcast going
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:22.300]  you got that from the WWE or the WWF and it just shows exactly what you're
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:26.700]  talking about how they take something and make it pop so now when I talk about
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:31.100]  you know Kim Trails or something that they'll say oh that's in a Hollywood
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:36.260]  movie it's the same or oh and winner soldier Captain America fights Nazis
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:40.340]  that infiltrated the government so see Operation Paperclip doesn't matter now
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:44.900]  because we just made it up from Captain America the Illuminati of the New World
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:48.820]  Order have gotten so whitewashed that the average American just has no idea or
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:53.260]  that the people who would be able to comprehend it have seen so many of the
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:58.220]  lunatic fringe conspiracy theories that people have tweeted out and posted that
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:03.900]  they just dismiss any idea having just seen a bunch of Illuminati idiocy and
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:08.860]  Cass Sunstein said seven years ago that was the plan to promote and finance and
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:14.540]  push mentally ill but also operatives to trigger schizophrenics and others to
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:18.060]  believe the moon's made out of cheese that you're a movie star double identity
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:21.980]  that I'm Bill Hicks so that they flood everything with so much mental illness
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:26.020]  they can then point at that some people are so paranoid I was reading the
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:29.780]  comments of my video that is some people or some person thought that the people
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:34.300]  the video were fake and they were actors from my free Masonic Lodge I'm not a
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.260]  free Mason what they just thought that this is all staged and these are
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:41.940]  actors from my Masonic Brotherhood and even if that weren't true they wouldn't
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:47.100]  do it because the point of the video is 99% of the your audience and people who
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:53.020]  see it know is to illustrate the the absolute ignorant state of America to
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:57.580]  spark a thought process so that people will go and look up well sure but I mean
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:01.060]  what's going on here this is like a medical test we've done you've got the
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:05.260]  mainline dumb down people that in previous videos yeah let's put the gun
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.220]  owners in forced labor camps yeah I agree with their their big problem let's
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:12.220]  arrest them all I mean these are real people you're talking to so you've got
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.820]  that extreme of yes men to the system you've got us in the middle that
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:18.940]  historically are questioning big government exposing government drug
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:22.700]  dealing the private Federal Reserve there's videos out of our troops fighting
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.900]  the Russians in Ukraine we told you that was happening hell the CIA admitted it
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.620]  six months ago and then you've got the extreme of people that know they don't
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:35.420]  believe the government but now they don't believe anything because they never
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:40.100]  had a rudder they never had a belief they don't have any core destiny so all
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:44.620]  they can do then is kind of try to make up their own reality that's what we get
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:50.620]  accused of we're trying to find the real reality not make up a reality but you
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:54.380]  can't blame those that have just come out of the matrix they see the social
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:58.660]  engineers with Carl Rose saying we control history we're history's actors we
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:03.300]  control reality whatever we say it is goes so of course these schizophrenics
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.660]  and others that are coming out of the matrix they're going to then emulate
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:12.380]  what they saw from the top believing that it's a I guess mumbo jumbo magic
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:16.900]  where you just make things up it just goes to show how detached people have
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:21.460]  become from reality so so distrustful so paranoid that they don't know what to
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:25.620]  believe and they believe nothing in a sense you know I mean you have for
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:31.140]  years sent out a pocket Constitution with any order from info wars calm just
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:34.140]  showing that you care about the Constitution the Bill of Rights
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:36.940]  everybody who doesn't have one should get one read them it's just that you know
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:42.900]  the 10 the first 10 amendments in the is the Bill of Rights basically a simple
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:48.460]  10 restrictions against the tyrannical government anybody could memorize them
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:52.900]  within a matter of minutes or after a few repetitions but this has been
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:57.740]  supplanted the importance of such issues by the world wrestling entertainment
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:01.780]  now has had an outcome that the fans don't like and now everybody's boycotting
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:08.260]  and threatening to cancel their WWE subscription the deflated footballs is
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:13.100]  really the biggest conspiracy and the cover-up that's right they always you
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:17.140]  know George Arwell wrote in 1984 as an allegory a real stuff he'd seen in
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:21.100]  England how they would fight all day about the local lotteries and had all
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.820]  these complex systems and could remember all these amazing numbers and he's
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:28.300]  looking at the pros saying what if they would take that energy and put it into
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.740]  understanding how the world worked they'd be financially successful we'd
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:36.500]  have a free society but you can't get them to stop caring about fake lotteries
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:42.700]  gambling deflated gate or the WWE you can't get them to do it mark the
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:46.940]  television teaches them the television tells them what is the number one story
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:52.700]  I mean when you have the NFL Commissioner and the quarterbacks breaking into
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:57.460]  live press conferences on all the major networks that's what the American public
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:01.900]  believe is the number one story and it's incredible how everybody was talking
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:06.020]  about and still talking about the deflated footballs deflate gate but if
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:13.060]  people actually cared as much or even partially about actual cover-ups actual
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:17.900]  conspiracies but we wouldn't be this far down Niagara Falls I'll tell you what's
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.220]  gonna happen when we come back I want you to give a brief history of the
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:23.820]  Illuminati that's mainline history then when you get into the secrets that are
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:27.700]  in your book inside the Illuminati available at Amazon.com mark dice.com
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:32.740]  and some bookstores we intended to carry it at m4store.com haven't set that up yet
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:36.260]  mark dice is our guest we're going to come right back to him here in just a
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:43.900]  moment but specifically as we go to break speaking to the listeners out there
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:48.380]  I will give you my football conspiracy and it's from watching them carefully
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:52.580]  few years ago you had like 10 minutes of the power outage which gave them 10
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.940]  more minutes of people totally paying attention as they went to commercial and
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.940]  came back we're talking 50, 60, 70 million dollars more profit you better
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:04.500]  believe that was staged now you better believe that when they bring up a
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:08.620]  deflate a gate that they know they're not going to punish the Patriots that's a
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:12.700]  way to get more attention to the Super Bowl coming up this is nothing but drama
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:16.580]  nothing but stunts just like we predicted and turn out to be true that
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:20.020]  it was an inside job at Sony and that North Korea who couldn't tie their shoe
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:25.300]  laces had not hacked them that all came out later I mean you just learn how the
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:29.460]  enemy operates and nine times out of ten you can predict it I'm gonna get mark
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:33.980]  Dice's take on that is he think this is an NFL conspiracy themselves claiming the
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:39.660]  balls were deflated straight ahead is it so important isn't it as Obama
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:43.860]  announces in the state of the Union plans to steal your education 401ks
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:48.060]  that's not important though deflate a gate is did he did he deflate those balls
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:56.540]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:42.300]  competitively priced very competitively priced in fact way under their
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.700]  competition but the ingredients are super proprietary in some cases so
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:51.220]  expensive that you know you're talking $45 for supermail vitality it's just
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:54.220]  because the ingredients are cold pressed they're so concentrated it's you
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:59.980]  know similar to stostarone booster type stuff is does more than that but it was
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:04.220]  like $100 but still I wanted to be less than that and I wanted an herbal
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:09.540]  immunity with all the well-known herbs and extracts that have been proven safe
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:15.340]  and effective for thousands of years and that have been known to massively
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:18.380]  boost the immune system and just give you more energy you name it and that's
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:25.660]  what's in the ancient defense herbal booster and it's it's got a whole bunch
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:28.060]  of stuff that's in major studies we covered it last week to boost your
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:33.140]  immune system so many other things and it's 1495 it's normally 1995 leading

[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:41.460]  high-quality organic you can get two bottles of the x2
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:46.740]  nasa iodine right now and get a free bottle of ancient defense or get a
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:51.180]  bottle for 1495 you cannot get a better deal on any dietary supplement out there
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:54.900]  in my view this this is really a cut above the rest is what I give myself my
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:58.860]  children and we haven't gotten the flu or gotten sick yet had a little bit of
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:05.060]  allergies but that's basically been it so info wars life calm find the ancient

[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:21.020]  that's how you fund this independent organization and if you just try the
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.380]  products I believe you'll come back and get more because they're the top of the
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.420]  line the best that are out there thank you so much all of you for your support
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.740]  okay I want to get into inside the Illuminati you know they talk about the
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:34.980]  occult that just simply means hidden and the Illuminati came around in the 1775
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.940]  or so promising to fight the corruption of the church and the royalty they got
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:42.260]  the best people to join them believing they were fighting in a conspiracy of
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:45.540]  liberty but we got the Illuminati documents you're about to talk about and
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:49.620]  the truth was it was in more even more evil plan not to bring liberty but to
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.860]  bring the ultimate tyranny and you've read a lot of books about it you've
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:56.660]  written a lot of books about it you've republished old manuscripts on it like
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.180]  proves of this conspiracy that includes you know some of the transcripts of
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:04.940]  federal trials on the matter this has been proven so get into proves of this
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:10.140]  conspiracy in your new book inside the Illuminati Mark Dice yeah and then we can
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:14.100]  get into how it's sort of morphed into this mysterious pop culture phenomenon
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:18.620]  but back in the late 1700s a law professor Adam Weissop at Ingolstadt
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:23.900]  University started the Illuminati what was originally called the perfectabilists
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:28.540]  Illuminati of course means the enlightened ones as you said supposedly to
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:33.460]  help fight the tyranny of the Catholic Church which nobody can doubt was and
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:37.620]  continues to be extremely tyrannical particularly back then but what's
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:41.420]  interesting about Weissop instead of being like the founding fathers and
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:47.060]  wanting to establish a free democracy or republic with equal rights and personal
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:52.140]  liberties he basically wanted to replace the power of the Catholic Church and
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:58.860]  through deception he spread the Illuminati infiltrated into Freemasonry spread
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:04.060]  around you can track it as I do in the book to the various modern secret
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:07.780]  societies like the Skull of Bones Society the Bohemian Grove the Bilderberg
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:13.620]  group etc and the original writings multiple stashes of them were discovered
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:20.220]  by former members an individual named Joseph Uchneider came forward in 1784
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:26.220]  to the Duchess to the Duke of Bavaria's sister-in-law and gave him some of the
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:30.900]  information they raided some individuals houses found some of the actual
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:36.380]  writings published them in German and you can get them today in my book inside
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:40.820]  the Illuminati in English some individuals back then John Robison in
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:45.700]  proofs of a conspiracy other individuals Seth Payson in his proof of the
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:49.860]  Illuminati published English translations and when you read them it's an
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:54.300]  exact blueprint of the tyrannical power structure that we're seeing today so
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:59.580]  unlike the founding fathers of America who put out their grievances who listed
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:03.500]  them and listed what they wanted signed their names to it and sent it over to
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:10.460]  the king or like Martin Luther you know 250 years before Adam Weiss opt in 1517
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:15.220]  he nailed it on the door he listed his grievances with the Catholic Church and
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:20.700]  publicly nailed it on the door risking his own life and liberty so Weiss opt a
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:25.060]  lawyer and we all know the reputation that lawyers have the chair of the
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:29.100]  University over there the law department is spread his Illuminati through
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:33.540]  various cells through deception we have individuals that when they started to
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:38.860]  find out that it wasn't just for a free society to spread a person liberty that
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:45.100]  he basically was an acting as inspired by the the tyrannical Jesuits using
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:50.780]  their methodology of the ends justifies the means people defected there were
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:55.060]  court hearings and if you read some of the writings which are you know over 200
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:42:00.820]  years old it's incredible how they ring so true today talking about taking over
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:05.140]  the government using the media which the media at that time obviously there was
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:08.340]  no radio or television but it was newspapers and books and a lot of
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:12.260]  people actually read books back then as you know so there were reading clubs and
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:16.940]  reading societies I mean here's a quote actually from Adam Weissop's own pen
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:21.140]  where he says by establishing reading societies and subscription libraries and
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:25.340]  taking these under our direction and supplying them through our labors we may
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:29.780]  turn the public mind which way we will meaning which way we want because I
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:33.860]  said that in like manner we must obtain influence in the military academies the
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:39.020]  printing houses bookseller shops and in short all offices which have in any
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:45.940]  effect either in informing or managing and directing the mind of men one of them
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:49.860]  goes on to say that we will get all the literary journals we will take care by
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:54.180]  our carefully timed pieces meaning articles to make the citizens and the
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:58.540]  princes a little more noticed for their certain little slips meaning to talk
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:01.900]  highlight some of the issues when they speak about something that they
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:07.780]  disagree with a certain little more notice for their certain little slips of
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:11.020]  course to reinforce anything that the officials have said that can be used
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:16.060]  against them it's it's just incredible to see the blueprint and the actual
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:19.020]  connections you know people will go to Wikipedia as their number one source of
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:22.180]  information which says that the Illuminati was discovered which they were
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.620]  when there were trials and people were arrested and there were edicts which was
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:30.120]  a decree of law well it all started when one of the carriers got struck by
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.780]  lightning and they found some of the documents yes on his person one of
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:39.660]  us Weissop's good friends was killed and some writings were found in a secret
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:44.140]  pocket but that's just one of the stashes of writing so even people who doubt
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:49.180]  that there were actual two other main sources of the documents that were
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:53.740]  discovered after police raided individuals houses after being tipped off by
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.220]  Joseph Utschneider for my member but one of the major points people go to
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:00.420]  Wikipedia as the number one source of information which says well the
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:03.860]  Illuminati were discovered and they they were just stamped out and they ceased to
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:11.980]  exist after 1787 failing to take into mind that in 1793 years later the Duke
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:16.180]  of Bavaria issued his fourth edict which meant the statement of law
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:20.060]  denouncing the Illuminati and saying that they continued to exist they
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:24.020]  continued to spread obviously they infiltrated Freemasonry which is
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:30.260]  admitted by Freemasons Albert Mackey who wrote one of the most popular Freemason
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:36.380]  books about the symbols of Masonry the lexicon of Freemasonry admits and all
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:41.260]  Masonic scholars do that Weissop infiltrated Freemasonry in one of the
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:47.740]  biggest international conferences in 1786 and then let's expand on that
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:51.980]  because George Washington not just the Duke of Bavaria decried them in a whole
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:55.180]  bunch of letters that we've shown here on air at the Library of Congress he was
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:59.660]  one of the top Masons in the US and he said they're using the Masonic halls to
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.700]  take over these people want total overthrow of order and themselves as
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:07.220]  gods they must be stopped and I say that because I'm sick of people telling me
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:12.820]  George Washington was part of the Illuminati Thomas Jefferson was Benjamin
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:16.100]  Franklin was when he went to France because they believed it was a society
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:20.860]  of liberty once they found out it wasn't they turned against it now that's
[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:24.860]  what the real history shows even though it's not popularized or put out there
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:28.860]  so I just want to point that out I'm not saying they were perfect either but
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:32.900]  George Washington actually after he was president wrote a bunch of letters and
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.140]  spoke out against them yeah and you can read those right on the Library of
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:42.420]  Congress in the George Washington archives in these in his 1790s letters
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:47.540]  well after the Illuminati was supposedly stamped out he did write that they were
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:52.100]  infiltrating lodges in America and he's makes it clear that he didn't think that
[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:56.300]  all the lodges were a part of it but they were using the lodges to spread their
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:01.060]  information it's a perfect cover and the man who took over the Illuminati after
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:06.940]  Adam Weissop the man named JJC Bode who was a publisher again a propagandist he
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:11.780]  was basically the second in command and then rose to the top ranks after Weissop
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:17.660]  fled Bavaria once he was discovered in his own journal he wrote that he traveled
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:21.820]  to France shortly before the French Revolution and met with his Masonic
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:26.700]  brothers and introduced the Illuminati to them and changed it to the name of the
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:31.300]  Philadelphes so it doesn't matter what name it is when people say well is it
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:34.660]  really the Illuminati what's it called is it the Brotherhood the the Mystery
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:38.700]  Schools it doesn't really matter what they're called it's sort of like the
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:41.700]  Italian mafia didn't really have a name doesn't really have a name
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:45.820]  Locosa Nostra this thing of ours they don't need to call up each other and say
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:49.820]  hey we have an Illuminati meeting they know hey we have to do our thing our
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:54.660]  goal it's really an agenda more than a conspiracy but if you really take the
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:59.660]  time as I've done to and if you've done some others have to separate the facts
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:04.180]  from the fiction to clear up this terribly muddied water now with everybody
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:07.900]  thinking everything's connected to the Illuminati you can really get down to the
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:12.980]  core documentation to verify it sure let's break some of that down because
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:18.340]  then in 1832 you have this trust set up out of Germany and England to set up
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:23.140]  Skull and Bones to take over the dominant college at the time then it is
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:29.260]  declassified sets up the CIA in 47 out of its members and gets the National
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:33.300]  Security Act passed so you have the Illuminati creating secret shadow
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:39.580]  government in 1947 people to buy Skull and Bones and British intelligence and
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:43.180]  again we're not just saying that Skull and Bones was created by the Illuminati
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:47.060]  we can get down to the specific details to the evidence verifying this one of
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:52.980]  covers it yeah William Huntington Russell traveled to Germany the hotbed of
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:58.980]  the Illuminati activity just before returning in 1832 and starting Skull
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.300]  and Bones some people might say that that's conjecture but there was actually
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:06.900]  a break-in into the Skull and Bones headquarters to their clubhouse called the
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:13.940]  tomb in 1876 by some fellow students who literally used a crowbar and a file to
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:17.220]  break into the place in the middle of the night obviously this is before
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:22.580]  security systems and alarms and wrote a newsletter and printed it up and spread
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:26.060]  it around campus about what it was that they found inside I'm certainly not
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:31.700]  advocating burglary this is what happened inside but just to expand on that
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:38.620]  Charlotte Isherby's father was Skull and Bones and she was able to confirm she's
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:42.220]  the one that gave Anthony Sutton all his documents that what they said basically
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:46.580]  in that break-in was accurate yes and what they did they said that they found a
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:51.500]  plaque on the wall that was from their German brothers one of the interesting
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:55.660]  things there was a series of human skulls a picture of human skulls and then in
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:49:00.260]  German it was written translated into English which one is the wise man which
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:04.780]  one is the beggar which one is the king and which one is the fool okay and then
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:09.940]  this is an allegory that they teach to their members to illustrate their their
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:14.380]  belief in no afterlife and what's interesting is this is the same allegory
[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:20.620]  the same sort of riddle that was told to original Illuminati members back in
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:27.660]  Germany back in the day it is it is club 32 3 2 2 on the door for the year that
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:32.860]  they founded it but also the Masonic 32 it's just in everybody's face and then
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:36.180]  helmet Schmidt as I mentioned wrote a book men in power is a political
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:40.660]  retrospective where he says oh I love your skull and bones I love your
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:43.920]  bohemian grove but we have our own groves but I go to theirs and we do the
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.660]  rituals and I love our Germanic rituals so I mean this is just all over the
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:52.300]  place they're admitting this and of course skull and bones one of the more
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:58.620]  well-known secret societies people somewhat familiar with the symbolism but
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:02.340]  now just think that it's a fraternity just for college kids skull and bones
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:05.540]  certainly not a fraternity fraternities as you know are just party houses
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:09.860]  brotherhoods there's no alcohol allowed you know this in the skull and bones
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:14.540]  tomb so what kind of a fraternity doesn't allow alcohol in their club this
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:18.820]  is not a fraternity this is a postgraduate organization a stepping

[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:16.340]  who helped expose 9-11 as an inside job and other big moves has been on the show
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:20.420]  before I know he tunes into the broadcast he says I said how long you
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:23.180]  gonna be on the show he was in there on Skype they were talking to him and he said
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:30.660]  until Alex surrenders I mean he's a feisty fellow so we should see he'll
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:34.100]  probably attack me when he first comes on I've hung out with some record
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.620]  executive some of the biggest in the country when I was hanging out with some
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:43.500]  other folks and they tell me nobody's as wild as Al nobody and I was told that by
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:47.260]  one of the probably the biggest record executive in the country how household
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:49.980]  name for folks that know about that stuff I'm not gonna tell any of those
[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:57.580]  stories but the point is the Wildman the Iotola of Rock and Rolla is gonna be
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:04.300]  joining us coming up now going back to Mark Dice I want to invite back to an
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:07.540]  hour-long commercial free I left commercial at the start in front but
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:11.860]  uninterrupted is the proper term I guess to use to be to use media parlance to
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:19.420]  the precise degree uninterrupted hour-long special with myself in the
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:22.820]  next month we can tape it in the air on the nightly news talk about inside the
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.780]  limonade because I want to go through the entire history of it with him we've
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:29.340]  just scratched the surface here the last four minutes we have left here other
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:33.420]  points you want to add about inside the limonade that I think is the best book
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:37.900]  condensing everything that's known about it you have really put together a real
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:43.260]  real tour de force here you know Richard Nixon wrote in his book in his
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.820]  memoirs that quotes if I were to give a speech that would give me the most or if
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:51.020]  I were to choose a speech that would give me the most pleasure and satisfaction
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:54.540]  in my political career it would be my lakeside speech at the Bohemian Grove
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:59.100]  in 1967 because this speech traditionally was off the record it
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:03.940]  received no publicity at the time but in many important ways it marked the first
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:10.020]  milestone on my road to the presidency there is Richard Nixon in his own book
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:14.540]  in his memoirs admitting that the road to the presidency was kicked off in the
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:20.260]  Bohemian Grove and of course he also called it the most gd faggy thing he'd
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:24.820]  ever seen we have the tape of that but I'm not gonna play it yes now there's a
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:28.700]  photograph of him of course at in the Berkeley University archives showing him
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:33.220]  sitting down with Ronald Reagan inside the Grove where they were discussing who
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:37.020]  was going to run for president and when planning their future political careers
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:42.500]  and we have a long list of people from George Washington to Richard Nixon to
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:48.580]  Henry Kissinger to Winston Churchill the Rothschilds the former mayor of New
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:52.460]  York John Highland British Royalty back when the Cold War was supposed to going
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:56.780]  on in the 50s they would have the foreign minister of Russia there all
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:01.340]  either also publicly talking about either the Illuminati or referencing them
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:05.300]  I mean you know as you know you played the clip Dick Cheney joking about not
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:08.380]  mentioning that he was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations Hillary
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:12.660]  Clinton saying that she goes there to get them to get orders to be told what to
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:17.620]  do we have a long list of people that have hinted at or openly admitted that
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:21.460]  there is an establishment inside we shouldn't be concerned with that we
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:26.500]  should worry about deflighted footballs and little distractions and the
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:31.580]  issue is these aren't loving altruists that want to help us in secretly like
[01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:35.500]  Batman or you know these aren't you know the billionaire philanthropist that
[01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:39.740]  wants to help you know they want to kill you and merge with machines they
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:43.140]  believe it's their only chance of living forever and creating this AI
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:47.340]  nightmare and again I'm not against technology I'm against these people like
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:50.660]  I love a ring of power if you want to use that fable that could help people know
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:56.060]  this was made by Soran it ain't gonna be nice yeah I mean transhumanism is
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:58:00.020]  really one of their ultimate goals to evolve into gods as you know which goes
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:04.900]  perfectly in line with the Luciferian philosophy with this satanic secret the
[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:10.100]  royal secret as they call it that one day we'll be announced and you can see
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:13.340]  it being prepped with the celebrities to prepare the public to worship their
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:17.580]  Illuminati masters as holding the key to the secret to success and that's
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:21.900]  ultimately they'll offer mankind the supposed ability to become immortal
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:24.500]  gods and that's what you're and that's what we'll cover in the hour-long
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:27.900]  special coming up is we'll recap this and then spend most of it on the
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:32.340]  celebrities and how that's the image you sell out to the devil you sell out to
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:35.780]  the Illuminati you get all the power the truth is these people just want to

[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:17.660]  the world was gonna end in one year and that did not happen but with us trips

[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:11.220]  lyrics and he's also got a autobiography coming out louder than hell
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:16.500]  the definitive oral history of metal he is the guy that started industrial rock
[02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:22.620]  and so much more you can also see his music and a lot of big movies and the

[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:45.860]  west coast last time he was on he was down in south Texas or I guess down in
[02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:52.980]  El Paso Al it's good to have you back on with us Alex you crazy bastard well I

[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:09.500]  thank you for coming on with us where are you right now I'm in La La Land well
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:14.620]  that's awesome yeah what are you coming back to Texas I'm on the left coast now
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:21.260]  man it's it's all going good here I think I have an appearance coming up in
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:31.540]  glee oh man I tell you what I'm not even kidding I don't know what he is what is
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:40.340]  glee it's some homosexual teenage angst drama or something I've never seen it
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:46.660]  but apparently I play a demented substitute teacher all right well you
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:52.380]  played a lot of roles you know I like your role in artificial intelligence yeah
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:57.780]  Spielberg put up with me for a couple weeks it's okay it was all good it's all
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:04.980]  good good fun and games what was that like well he was kind of freaked out
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:11.180]  because Stanley Kubrick wrote the movie and and when the band actually got to
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:16.500]  meet him three days after being on set they brought us up like we were
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:21.460]  meeting the goddamn Queen or something you know like don't talk to him unless he
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:27.420]  talks to you first kisses ring this and that kind of stuff and and I was at the
[02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:33.940]  end of the lawn and he gets to me and I said look man Steven baby here's the
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:41.260]  deal I thought like Kubrick hired us to play a porno movie called AI which stood
[02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:47.140]  for ain't okay okay and now you've got this like damn teddy bear and this kid
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:52.780]  this Joel Haley Osmond thing running around like pack rats I was just like
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:58.540]  I'm out of here I can't deal with this now it's just kidding you know but apparently
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:03.060]  he took offense to it but anyways over the next few days Spielberg came up
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:08.900]  wore my cowboy hat did some jams with us on stage he actually got the jam with us
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:12.780]  and stuff like that so it it all worked out good in the end but at first it
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:18.260]  wasn't a very good meeting now going way back into the 80s and into the 90s you
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:21.820]  wrote about the New World Order global government all the stuff that's now
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:27.180]  started to unfold and actually happen what was your views back then versus
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:32.540]  what they are now or have they not changed no they have not changed at all
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:38.740]  this is like even more global order than what we bargained for man this is
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:47.540]  like I'm as paranoid as you are this is a creepy stuff man all I know is like the
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:53.020]  Saudis decided to take the world hostage and the good news is they dropped oil
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:13:00.100]  below $50 a barrel but the bad news is they dropped oil below $50 a barrel so
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:06.100]  I mean this is some really wack job stuff man absolutely Al Jorgensen of
[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:10.460]  ministry is our guest right now there's so much to get into instead of me asking
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:14.500]  some of the questions looking at the world right now do you still think we're
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:20.620]  gonna be here in five years yeah I'll be happy if we are because that means I
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:27.700]  can make some damn money but I'm not really sure I'm not really sure I mean
[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:32.940]  can you tell if it's gonna be around in five years I can't well last time you
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:36.180]  were on you predicted gold would go down and and you were correct but you also
[02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:40.660]  predicted we wouldn't be here in one year do you remember that yeah I do
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:46.020]  remember that I was really I sat out there with this Norwegian kid from a
[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:51.300]  band called Celtic Frost and we sat on my porch and at the exact time that it was
[02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:56.260]  supposed to be the apocalypse we sat out there drinking a beer just go on bring
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:14:05.180]  it and it didn't happen so I don't know but I'm yeah my my Notre Dame us crystal
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:09.700]  ball is a little bit foggy this morning I can't predict for five years for you
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:14.140]  what the hell's gonna happen around here all I know is that all hell's breaking
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:20.380]  loose look at Yemen look at look at Obama having to fly to Saudi Arabia to
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:26.340]  kiss the new like you know energy provider for us look at look at everything
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:30.820]  in the Middle East look at the Ukraine look at the oil prices look at this and
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:35.140]  there is so much stuff going on right now that people don't realize about and
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:40.180]  I'm sure you know sure why we know Obama I wish Obama would bow down to the
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:43.580]  Constitution Bill of Rights or just libertarian ideas of freedom I don't
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:47.220]  think of him as much as a liberal and and and why does he bow down to the
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:52.180]  Saudi Kings I mean he might even be grim in their stool well you just answered
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:56.700]  your own question man we bow down to the Saudi Kings because we are dependent on
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:59.020]  them
[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:04.380]  absolutely would you like to bow down to Saudi King are you are you telling me
[02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:09.700]  that conservative folks wouldn't bow down to the Saudi King right now the new
[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:16.300]  guy Salman I mean really we got to kiss his ring because that's what we're doing
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:20.780]  we're heading down a final path man that's all I got to sit I agree with you
[02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:24.180]  we have a clip we'll play later have you seen this new clip where there's US troops
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:31.300]  clearly they're battling Russians in Ukraine yes I've seen that clip and you
[02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:37.380]  know what it is true and usually the stuff I see on TV is not true but this
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:42.980]  one is pretty good I like it well yeah I mean they pretty much I don't like it but
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:49.100]  I'm just like the truth sure sure I get you the smell passes the smell test well
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:52.940]  sure I mean they admit there's a proxy armies they're fighting that sounds
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:59.540]  pretty reckless to be starting a war with the Russians to me well you think
[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:03.580]  this is reckless wait till we start a war with the Chinese when they come crawling
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:09.900]  for their debt to be repaid then we're in a world heap of trouble now I agree
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:13.020]  Al I mean you really are pretty smart guy when it comes to geopolitical stuff
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:17.020]  that's why your music so popular it's not just I mean good on the ears I enjoy
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:21.500]  it it's got a lot of energy but the lyrics are extremely powerful from a
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:27.980]  political perspective how did you begin to Russia Russia's the least of our
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:33.060]  problems right now you think it's right now I really think the Middle East and
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:38.460]  the Far East are our big problems Russia's just like a bump in the road
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:43.460]  whatever go ahead take over goddamn the Ukraine or whatever the hell they're
[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:50.220]  taking over now now I'm telling you the big battles coming up ahead I agree let's
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:55.660]  break down that big battle how do you see that unfolding well I see it's like
[02:16:55.660 --> 02:17:00.780]  using every weaponry that we've ever developed at area 51 and other black
[02:17:00.780 --> 02:17:06.740]  spots and just kicking some ass around this world enough with the like spare
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:11.700]  the civilian population these people are going to go bonkers and start Dresden
[02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:17.980]  bombing everyone you can see the building up and the hardening of things
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:22.540]  here domestically in the homeland and all the fascist iconography and both
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:28.540]  parties getting in line and in my gut I can just pick up on the ominous doom
[02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:35.180]  that is beginning to approach it's I'm with you Alex I'm with you this is some
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:41.340]  pretty but gnarly gnarly stuff man gnarly this is not good when we come back
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:45.780]  we're gonna play from beer to eternity song punch in the face and want to get
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:50.180]  your take on your a new album but before we go any further what are some of the
[02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:52.780]  other issues you want to get into because we didn't do any pre-interview I
[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:56.100]  like to just bring you on raw what else is on your radar screen and what's
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:18:02.780]  ministry up to well I'm like I said before the good news is that oil is
[02:18:02.780 --> 02:18:09.500]  below $50 a barrel the bad news is oil is below $50 a barrel this makes the
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:15.940]  speculators rich and nobody else and on top of that it shows how much Saudi
[02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:22.580]  sway they have in the world because they can drop the price and still grab
[02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:28.340]  oil out of their grounds out of their sand pits for cheaper three times
[02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:35.620]  cheaper than canadia or these other places sweet if you just noticed all

[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:58.300]  year now if Saudi Arabia wanted to they could have us on our knees and one
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:03.780]  minute and right now it's all kind of kosher everything's under 50 bucks a
[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:08.220]  barrel and this and that and blah blah blah blah but I'm just telling you it
[02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:14.100]  just shows and it just goes to show you the power of the Saudi regime with this

[02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:47.060]  that's George H.W. Bush bringing us in I'm your host Alex Jones Al
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:53.100]  Jorgensen the founder in 1980 of ministry is our guest and still the front
[02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:57.180]  man and owner of the whole operation has a new best-selling autobiography out
[02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:02.140]  we'll be telling you about he wants to play a clip from his album from beer to
[02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:06.380]  eternity punch in the face but coming up in the next segment now this is a short
[02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:11.900]  segment I'm gonna play a clip that was censored the last time I played this
[02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:15.220]  clip and I'm not gonna tell you what it is until we get there but I'm gonna
[02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:19.820]  illustrate what you said about the Saudis and what I've run into because I've
[02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:25.740]  never hit censorship like I do when we talk about the Saudis so that really
[02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:29.300]  goes to what you're saying and nobody ever really talks a lot about the real
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:33.500]  power this group of hoodlums have or how they're behind trying to take down
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:37.380]  Syria or Libya and they're behind ISIS our media claims they're fighting them
[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:41.620]  what is your view of ISIS in this whole radical Islamic movement I mean pretty
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:45.700]  clearly they admit our own military's been ordered to fund them to turn them
[02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:50.740]  loose where do you think that's all going well I'll tell you what I think
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:54.580]  about ISIS first of all the Saudis don't like them because they have such a
[02:25:54.580 --> 02:26:00.780]  repressive regime that the last thing they want is Islamic fundamentalist the
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:05.740]  rest of it the whole ISIS thing the beheadings and all that look they just
[02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:10.140]  asked for 200 million dollars would from Japan which would have funded enough
[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:15.260]  weapons to take down so many American planes that are hovering above the
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:20.780]  Middle East I mean these people are not like going away I hear you they're not
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:25.420]  going away I hear you now as usual you know all the general facts surrounding
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:29.580]  it but here's the issue Saudi Arabia did fund al Qaeda in Syria which is the core
[02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:36.180]  right now of ISIS yeah they funded al Qaeda they fund ISIS they don't want that
[02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:39.740]  kind of crap in their neighborhood let me tell you no I agree so they're
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:46.820]  exporting it yeah they just want to sell their damn oil that's it why do you know
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:53.460]  ISIS whatever it's like you know it's just a bunch of poor folks that are just
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:59.140]  disillusioned and bummed out that they have to live under Israeli control a
[02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:04.540]  checkpoint they have no money even know like the sultans are living like kings
[02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:10.580]  or whatever and and these people are pissed off good for them I'd be pissed
[02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:15.380]  off too if if like all of a sudden I stop getting royalty checks from like
[02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:20.380]  these damn people that send me checks I'd be pissed you know and they're pissed
[02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:24.660]  they have no future they're pissed and they're beheading people and this and
[02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:30.060]  that but this is not new we've been doing colonialism for a couple hundred
[02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:34.500]  years we got a pretty perfected off the British and we're gonna keep going for
[02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:39.020]  it I agree with you they get a bunch of disenfranchised people that are ignorant
[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:43.500]  to be part of the al Qaeda and ISIS brigades but above that the West wants
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:47.260]  to stir these groups up and let them attack or let them take the blame for
[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:51.060]  further false flags I'm really worried about another stage terror attack what
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:57.780]  do you think I think you're spot on on that one except for one thing listen
[02:27:57.780 --> 02:28:02.620]  I'm on the no-fly list zone I mean these people hate me and I'm doing a whole
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:07.780]  flight tour and you're the kind of person you want on your plane I'd be on
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:12.340]  there in Malaysia Airlines saving people right and left and I would make
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:16.620]  sure whatever bastard went up to the cockpit would be tackled and beaten
[02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:23.060]  thoroughly okay you're the kind of person that I want that you want on your
[02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:30.700]  flight but no the TSA just goes crazy over my piercings and shit and sorry
[02:28:30.700 --> 02:28:36.300]  about that word okay something but it's as if anyway exactly I mean you don't
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:43.700]  look like an al Qaeda operative well if I was would I look like this it's just
[02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:46.540]  ridiculous but I mean they put congressmen and women on the no-fly list
[02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:50.020]  it's a way to set up domestic internal checkpoints by the way we're going to
[02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:53.340]  break but I want to talk to you in the long segment coming up about the
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:56.340]  Malaysia airline I know you've been doing some research into that give us a
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:29:04.300]  little bit of your ideas on it now all right my idea is that aliens really I'm
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:09.140]  serious no I'm dead serious I don't think this was a governmental attack
[02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:13.660]  whether it was over Uzbekistan or whatever or wherever the hell they flew
[02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:17.900]  they're never gonna find that plane I really think this is an alien
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:25.140]  intervention well let's break down that hey the last one went down okay we know
[02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:30.540]  that but that first one I don't know man I think they just got sucked up into
[02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:34.500]  like some kind of 3d sphere or something I want to hear what you think of David
[02:29:34.500 --> 02:29:38.620]  Ike maybe the planets run by aliens and I say that for the sake of debate and
[02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:41.700]  argument I'm not saying that for the New York Times I don't believe that but but

[02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:33.180]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show and our guest Al Jorgensen of ministry
[02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:48.580]  Al Evans Jorgensen.com and that's just the first amendment in action I'm more
[02:33:48.580 --> 02:33:52.740]  concerned not with cuss words but with the vets now caught on secret death
[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:59.060]  panel list across the country and secret experimentation on the children you
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:04.780]  know Al Jorgensen is the founder of what you call industrial rock one of the top
[02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:09.500]  rock bands across the board out there and I'm a big fan of the music itself a
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:16.060]  lot of the political messages in it I really don't know where to start he was
[02:34:16.060 --> 02:34:21.660]  born in Havana Cuba in 1958 they relocated the United States with his
[02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:27.700]  mother Norwegian stepfather and I should get Al on sometime just about his
[02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:34.940]  interesting personal life very very interesting but before we spend a few
[02:34:34.940 --> 02:34:38.900]  minutes on that and the Malaysian aircrafts and the rest of it and the
[02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:44.620]  police state with Al Jorgensen I wanted to play this clip and get his take on it
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:49.620]  now it's from the dark crystal came out back in the early 80s I think or maybe
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:53.100]  late 70s I don't remember I think it was the early 80s I remember seeing with my
[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:59.460]  dad and it's a Muppet movie I think Henson was involved basically and you've
[02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:03.260]  got these evil sketches only care about materialism and are corrupt they remind
[02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:09.940]  me of Dick Cheney and Al Gore you know together at a bohemian grove you know
[02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:16.580]  gay party or something and when the emperor dies there's a scene well the
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:20.700]  last time a few years ago that this Saudi king's brother died and he took
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:25.980]  over now it's the other half brother just took over there's also very ill I
[02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:30.700]  said we have footage of him dying here it is an exclusive and it was footage of
[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:35.940]  the Skexi dying and I mean it's a children's movie it was fair use it was
[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:39.540]  a one-minute clip they didn't take it down for copyright they took it down
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:43.180]  because the Saudis complained and they said that I committed a hate crime and
[02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:48.100]  I had to threaten to sue YouTube just to get our channel that then had like
[02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:51.340]  300 million views got like 500 something million views now that's just one of our
[02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:57.180]  many channels we've got like it's something like a billion plus views or
[02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:02.020]  something is ridiculous but this shows the censorship ISIS can run around and
[02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:05.540]  recruit online all these other groups do whatever they want but but we're
[02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:09.780]  censored when we do this so you know what this is my radio show and they
[02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:13.540]  can't censor this we have the video streams in prison planet TV so they
[02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:16.740]  can't censor it on places like YouTube we're gonna play it right now and I'm
[02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:19.420]  gonna get Al Jorgensen's take I mean this is not a radical move to make a
[02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:23.780]  joke about a Saudi king but you can make all the jokes you want about the Queen
[02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:27.980]  of England but you can't make them about these people and I know Al is a huge
[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:31.940]  first amendment guy so let's go ahead and play this clip of the Skexi dying
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:43.700]  well the footage of the King dying here it is
[02:36:43.700 --> 02:37:07.460]  out of Spielberg it looks like Hillar that's his brother
[02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:30.220]  there's the King of Saudi all right ladies and gentlemen let's go back to
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:35.140]  Al Jorgensen a ministry Al what is your take on the censorship of that video
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:43.500]  clip on YouTube man I couldn't see it on my inner webs thing here I understand
[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:47.820]  but it's a bit I mean it's a muppet dying it's not that scared listen I heard
[02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:52.620]  the audio and it sounds about right I mean it just sounds about right it's
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:57.700]  that's the way it is the Israeli lobby and the Saudi lobby are the two most
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:04.700]  powerful lobbies that we have period bar none so that sounds about right with all
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:12.300]  those noises and stuff I heard I didn't see it though but I will look it up
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:15.780]  tonight absolutely if I got somebody's got an iPhone or something just have them
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:22.820]  Google death death of Skexi and it hits the clip but it doesn't matter the
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:26.780]  point is what are they doing censoring I get more censorship when I talk about
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:30.260]  Saudis than anybody else that tells me they're pretty close to top of the
[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:36.980]  pyramid I'm with you I'm with you Alex I'm with you all the way on that one
[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:41.180]  they are pretty close to the top of the pyramid if you want to go to build a
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:45.900]  burgers and Illuminati and all that stuff these are the people these are the
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:52.820]  new Rockefellers okay and you know how much of a douchebag he was so these are
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:59.020]  the new overlords that we have to deal with all right these Saudi people man and
[02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:05.300]  and the Israeli lobby spends over three and a half billion a year on lobbying
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:09.740]  Congress so these pockets are lying no wonder you want to be a congressman
[02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:14.580]  because I sure wouldn't be not only that I have too many Polaroids in my closet
[02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:19.620]  that says that I can't run for like office okay I was told by one of the
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:23.100]  biggest record executives in the country that you are of all the rock and roll
[02:39:23.100 --> 02:39:27.200]  people he knows the wildest and they said that if there's nuclear war two
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:31.580]  things will be left in the world cockroaches and Al Jorgensen that's
[02:39:31.580 --> 02:39:41.660]  about right so so go ahead no no no I'm sorry your skype was breaking over a
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:48.940]  minute go ahead and repeat yourself yeah I agree fully agree me cockroaches
[02:39:48.940 --> 02:39:56.420]  that's it that's what you have to live for some asses oh my goodness well tell
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:59.260]  us about your last record and your autobiography and then tell us what's
[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:04.500]  coming new with ministry well we got a tour a big tour coming up and we're
[02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:10.780]  gonna do songs from from beer to eternity and it's a pretty good record I
[02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:16.620]  like it I think it's in the realm of ministry it's gotta be in the top three
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:22.460]  come on just give it up for for that this last one's pretty good we do this
[02:40:22.460 --> 02:40:30.260]  tour and then I'm doing some active parts on Glee and some other zombie movie
[02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:36.060]  or some I don't know walking dead or something like that I don't know they
[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:44.580]  just keep calling me whenever they needed an anti or no a villain a misanthrope
[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:49.820]  they always call me they want me for their misanthropic qualities so you're
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:56.500]  the king of dystopia are you gonna be a zombie apparently so yeah so you're gonna
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:01.580]  be like some mega powerful zombie in the show walking dead I don't think I'm
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:06.260]  that mega powerful because I read the script and I die at the end so I'm not
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:12.100]  that powerful well that's okay cuz I'm in a truck Norris a movie coming out
[02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:20.180]  there you go man dude I could just see you right now because well I can't see
[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:24.820]  you because they wouldn't put your feet on but I'm sure you're naked sitting in
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:29.340]  your office absolutely covered in honey no no no seriously the reason we don't
[02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:32.580]  send you the feed as we've noticed if the connection isn't really good and
[02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:36.620]  yours is okay for some reason sending you a connection back your phone then or
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:40.700]  computer has to calculate that and we've just learned that it ends up messing up
[02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:44.980]  the feed but bandwidth may have gone up the last few years so maybe we should
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:49.780]  start sending a feed but look you're not missing anything not seeing me no no no
[02:41:49.780 --> 02:41:53.740]  I know you're touching yourself in inappropriate places right now how do

[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:45.620]  just trying to freak everybody out and be politically incorrect and hey let's
[02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:48.700]  shift yours of some really serious issues if you if you really go over the
[02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:51.620]  grass I know I would love to come interview you at the grass you know
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:57.980]  you know 20 minute video interview you want to do it you're on but you have to
[02:42:57.980 --> 02:43:04.660]  promise you have to promise to eat an entire bag of a psilocybin mushrooms I
[02:43:04.660 --> 02:43:10.540]  promise we're just joking we're just joking for in there I've been there
[02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:16.580]  done it oh I bet you've never done anything I bet it's all a big act yeah
[02:43:16.580 --> 02:43:22.340]  something like that just hey me I'm a little lily lily I've done I am I am as
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:28.420]  pure as a driven stone my friend but that's my friend you are sincerely
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:35.460]  disturbed I've seen you go off on from Larry King on down and I've seen you you
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:43.820]  are just a disturbed person I love you man every day you are awesome you make
[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:48.180]  my day man I was disturbed this morning I am more and more disturbed I think it
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:52.060]  is actually true you know what disturbs me how crazy the world is and everybody
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:55.740]  just goes along acting like nothing's happening what do you make of the fact
[02:43:55.740 --> 02:43:59.540]  that it came out that they secretly had death list of troops that had stuff they
[02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:02.420]  could treat and we're killing them and not giving them treatment and then
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:05.900]  nobody gets in trouble and then what do you make of the militarizing the police
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:10.500]  and at the same time trying to finance battles with the police I think you're
[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:14.980]  trying to start a civil war what's your take on that I think it's business as
[02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:21.100]  usual man this is nothing new are you serious this is nothing new these people
[02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:28.980]  have made up a complete point of putting their jack old boots over our necks
[02:44:28.980 --> 02:44:35.380]  and keeping the populace down okay so this is no news to me and I'm sure it's
[02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:40.980]  no news to you either well I agree that they want to create a paramilitary force
[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:44.860]  to keep a boot on our neck but at the same time they want us to then hate all
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:49.460]  the cops to then create more friction they're trying to create social unrest
[02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:53.300]  towards even a bigger police state crackdown in my view and I want to try
[02:44:53.300 --> 02:44:58.740]  to avert that somehow or maybe it's maybe it can't be stopped I don't know man I
[02:44:58.740 --> 02:45:05.820]  don't think can be stopped because you have power versus unenpowered and that's
[02:45:05.820 --> 02:45:11.380]  always a bad mix you look at the New York Police Department and you know I'm
[02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:15.980]  glad that all the cops turn their back on the Blasio and I'm glad to blast you
[02:45:15.980 --> 02:45:22.220]  turn the back on them I'm just sick of it all just figure it out just like stop
[02:45:22.220 --> 02:45:29.300]  frisking Negro people just for like being Negroes I mean really enough just
[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:35.420]  get over it they have pot on them so what look Colorado Washington it's legal
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:40.500]  why doesn't New York just legalize it and pave some fucking roads sorry for the
[02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:47.740]  fucking but uh pave some roads educate some people and you can make all this
[02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:52.740]  money off pot I mean what what is your problem here I mean this is a 70 year
[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:57.260]  old band on something that shouldn't have been banned that was done through
[02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:04.580]  reefer madness craze I mean enough just get your get your stuff together in
[02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:07.900]  New York man I hear there's all these conservatives that say get out of
[02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:15.100]  people's lives well then they need to get other people's lives exactly you're
[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:19.460]  a good man Alex Jones well well let me look I see it like Obama's a fake liberal
[02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:22.020]  and the Republicans are fake conservatives what we need is really
[02:46:22.020 --> 02:46:24.820]  libertarian ideas that you can do whatever you want as long as you don't
[02:46:24.820 --> 02:46:28.940]  hurt somebody else doesn't mean I have to agree with it but it's just building
[02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:32.780]  a big government is a nightmare it only gets bigger and bigger only special
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:35.740]  interests can control it I mean it's like a steering wheel that weighs a
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:39.460]  trillion pounds little guys can't move it so we've built a world where we're
[02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:44.100]  like not even midgets I mean we're not even bugs to this system and as the
[02:46:44.100 --> 02:46:48.020]  elite become more and more disconnected from reality I see disaster coming
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:52.300]  because I you say business as usual I agree but things are coming to a head on
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:59.260]  so many fronts Al I agree we see mr. Alex Jones and I'm here in La La Land and I
[02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:03.740]  see this on a daily basis I know you all think we're a bunch of liberals out
[02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:10.660]  here with gay homos and pot and stuff like this but I'm telling you something
[02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:16.180]  man these people are there they're as whack as we are man it's it's crazy out
[02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:22.820]  here it's I don't even know what to say yes I see it coming to a head soon are
[02:47:22.820 --> 02:47:29.860]  you in northern central or southern California I'm in so Cal man I'm in the
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:35.580]  home of Jay Leno I live in Burbank California for whoever's wondering and
[02:47:35.580 --> 02:47:42.420]  here's my problem with the whole thing in Hollywood I know there was Hollywood
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:47.540]  land that was 13 letters they discussed that it was bad luck to have 13 letters
[02:47:47.540 --> 02:47:53.340]  so they shaved it off to 9 and Hollywood or whatever here in Burbank I live
[02:47:53.340 --> 02:48:00.300]  right underneath the beestine they couldn't even come up with the cash to
[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:08.340]  spell the urbank and Burbank so I live in the city of because that's all I see
[02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:14.220]  is just a big deal of my house yeah I hear you know my problem with it was
[02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:20.220]  Southern California will not it so much Sandy LA the smog I mean it really gets
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:26.780]  to me I just get physically ill but isn't that the funniest paradigm and
[02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:33.700]  paradox of all is that the people with the most environmental protection
[02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:41.220]  agency rules here have the worst small pollution in the United States it just
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:49.340]  freaks me out I get on this damn 405 or 5 or the 134 or whatever and it's just
[02:48:49.340 --> 02:48:55.660]  like a parking lot oh yeah people with road rage that are ready to go off I know

[02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:54.020]  Ventura show when he quit it but I just don't want to do it because it's it's
[02:52:54.020 --> 02:52:58.140]  it but but imagine a reality TV show with Alex Jones and Al Jorgensen
[02:52:58.140 --> 02:53:02.860]  crashing skull and bones crashing the Republican Democrat conventions crashing
[02:53:02.860 --> 02:53:07.980]  Bohemian Grove jumping in off helicopters with parachutes can you
[02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:14.900]  imagine that would be a popular show I would jump out of a helicopter with you

[02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:35.820]  coyotes here and in buh which is where I live and last night I was visited by two
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:41.100]  bobcats I had to throw a chair at one of them it was not a good fucking thing man
[02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:47.540]  it was not sorry for that word but it was not good man I understand in fact I
[02:53:47.540 --> 02:53:53.300]  hear that the wildlife is encroaching pretty fast and mightily into a lot of
[02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:56.580]  those areas you got bobcats you name it coming into your house or by your house
[02:53:56.580 --> 02:54:02.460]  hey man I sound like a tree hugger but I'm telling you this environmental
[02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:07.980]  disaster is going nuts right now there's like animals that shouldn't be here
[02:54:07.980 --> 02:54:14.900]  that are in my backyard that I have to deal with on a nightly basis so you know
[02:54:14.900 --> 02:54:20.820]  I'm I mean I'm up for the task but it's just like it's really becoming a pain
[02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:25.260]  you know it makes it fun really they've got high-powered Nerf guns now that
[02:54:25.260 --> 02:54:28.500]  won't hurt them but shoot pretty hard and you can just sit back there with a
[02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:33.300]  semi-auto Nerf gun and just shoot them when they come up and run them off Alex
[02:54:33.300 --> 02:54:39.420]  I'm with you I'm a half step ahead of you we just bought a Nerf gun yesterday

[03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:03.220]  picked him because they knew people would try to give him slack hoping to
[03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:06.980]  bring unity and stuff and all I've seen is the establishment use him to create
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:14.740]  division and to get their fascist agenda past business as usual meet the new
[03:01:14.740 --> 03:01:18.420]  boss same as the old boss let me ask you this you know I got a chance to meet
[03:01:18.420 --> 03:01:23.540]  Stanley Kubrick's daughter his protege an amazing lady Vivian Kubrick and we're
[03:01:23.540 --> 03:01:26.940]  actually gonna work on some stuff together but I know that Kubrick likes
[03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:29.980]  you Stanley Kubrick and you actually got to talk to him at least according to
[03:01:29.980 --> 03:01:34.860]  Wikipedia before he died and before artificial intelligence got made and
[03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:39.980]  they got handed over to Spielberg what was your conversation like with Kubrick
[03:01:39.980 --> 03:01:45.380]  well first I hung up on him two times and I thought it was a prank call I would
[03:01:45.380 --> 03:01:52.860]  do yeah it's like what yeah you're right Stanley Kubrick is calling me in
[03:01:52.860 --> 03:02:00.820]  Austin Texas yes sure later click and after a couple of those I figured out
[03:02:00.820 --> 03:02:06.340]  these people were persistent and they wanted me to be in their movie this
[03:02:06.340 --> 03:02:12.020]  weird American guy living in the countryside of England was like a big
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:18.580]  ministry fan you yeah I mean I just couldn't believe it freaked me out well
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:21.340]  I've learned a little bit about Kubrick that folks don't know from his daughter
[03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:24.420]  and it I'm not allowed to talk about it obviously it's like talking to John
[03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:27.780]  Lennon's family and I can't talk about it but it's just unbelievable this guy
