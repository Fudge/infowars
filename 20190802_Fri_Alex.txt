[00:00.000 --> 00:10.800]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:10.800 --> 00:23.280]  the date is Friday August 2nd 2019 I'm your host Alex Jones I'll be co-hosting today with Owen
[00:23.280 --> 00:30.160]  Schreuer who'll be live in studio he'll cover all the latest breaking news and information coming
[00:30.160 --> 00:36.000]  up in segment two and three and throughout the broadcast today but at the bottom of the hour
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.360]  due to massive requests from radio stations TV stations listeners my family the crew I will get
[00:43.360 --> 00:53.280]  into the full spectrum analysis of Jeffrey Epstein and how we were able to accurately lay out many
[00:53.280 --> 01:00.320]  years ago that he was an informant for Robert Mueller and the deep state and that he was part of
[01:00.320 --> 01:08.720]  a larger intelligence agency grid carrying out occult activities we said that also obsessed
[01:08.720 --> 01:15.760]  with world government eugenics depopulation cloning secret breeding projects we said all
[01:15.760 --> 01:24.000]  that no one else did how did we know I'll break it all down coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.240]  today I will also then later get into some of the good news concerning President Trump and his
[01:32.240 --> 01:39.120]  executive order from a few months ago that now has universities settling every week a new one
[01:39.120 --> 01:44.640]  just settled in florida with conservative libertarian and christian groups pro-life groups pro-gun
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.920]  groups you name it who've been barred from having student groups or having events or having speakers
[01:49.920 --> 01:56.640]  come to their colleges the colleges because of trump's action are having to back off so I encourage
[01:56.640 --> 02:01.600]  more people to get with student groups to try to book your own event your own speaking event and
[02:01.600 --> 02:08.480]  then let them try to bar you and then sue them and you will end up winning and again it's not that
[02:08.480 --> 02:14.560]  we're litigious but we're exercising our first amendment and the left is trying to bar it everywhere
[02:15.680 --> 02:20.160]  so it is beyond essential to do that as well that's just some very good news we're going to be
[02:20.160 --> 02:25.520]  breaking down also there's a very powerful piece from Tucker Carlson dealing with Cory Booker
[02:25.520 --> 02:33.520]  who comes from one of the richest widest places in the united states lying and talking about how
[02:33.520 --> 02:38.160]  he's been oppressed by the white man just like Colin Kaepernick who was raised by two white people
[02:38.160 --> 02:43.600]  that adopted him and the man has made what almost a hundred million dollars that's going to be coming
[02:43.600 --> 02:48.080]  up the deteriorating situation in the south china sea with hong kong taiwan the chai kong set to
[02:48.080 --> 02:53.440]  invade we're going to break that down we're going to look at so much more today but if you don't know
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.280]  the roots of the entire situation and if you don't know what makes the globalist tech and
[03:01.280 --> 03:06.800]  understand their psychology their modus operandi really their criminology and how their very ocd
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.400]  and how they follow the same operations over and over again nothing will make sense but as soon as
[03:12.400 --> 03:19.120]  you understand their cult and what their objective is and then what comes after that objective then
[03:19.120 --> 03:25.360]  you will have all the intel that only their highest level operatives have and then we could
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.680]  decompartmentalize the second third fourth fifth rungs of their compartmentalized intelligence
[03:31.680 --> 03:36.880]  agency secret society model because their own minions are compartmentalized and believe they're
[03:36.880 --> 03:45.520]  working for another goal that's actually good than the actual diabolical transhumanist posthumanist
[03:45.520 --> 03:54.160]  exterminist malthusian neo malthusian neo galtian eugenics agenda so you're gonna learn how do i
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.360]  know he was in the occult how did i know they're into eugenics how did i know they're into satanism
[03:59.360 --> 04:04.960]  how do i know they're into because that's all they're into that's all they've ever been into
[04:04.960 --> 04:11.440]  and now they're attempted claim uh that he is that is of course jeffrey ebsting only just some weird
[04:11.440 --> 04:18.560]  coop that was into this off of the side no he was heavily funded by the foundations to integrate more
[04:18.560 --> 04:29.200]  of this into a lower level ebsting was second room below the central hub he was outside the
[04:29.200 --> 04:34.960]  committee of 13 if you would and there is a committee of 13 ladies and gentlemen so again
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.840]  tomorrow's news today stay with us bottom of the hour i'll lay it out again thank you all for your
[04:39.840 --> 04:46.400]  support please don't forget we've got store-wide free shipping double patriot points 50 to 60 off
[04:46.400 --> 04:50.560]  part of this mega sale to raise money for the info war your money could not be spending a better
[04:50.560 --> 04:54.560]  place the products could not be better and i could not thank you more please stay with us
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.880]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.760]  thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not
[05:09.760 --> 05:14.320]  backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.040]  not being funded by secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[05:19.040 --> 05:24.640]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[05:24.640 --> 05:28.880]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[05:28.880 --> 05:33.760]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[05:33.760 --> 05:38.320]  wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.720]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views
[05:42.720 --> 05:47.760]  the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.720]  the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.640]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[05:56.640 --> 06:10.560]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[06:12.080 --> 06:17.840]  it's been said millions of times because it's true the democratic party just like socialist in europe
[06:17.840 --> 06:24.560]  creates systems of dependency so they have client groups that they can manage but who never get out
[06:24.560 --> 06:31.280]  of poverty and that was the admission of the great society was to domesticate black people and break
[06:31.280 --> 06:36.720]  their families up in the united states as a beta test for all other communities that are now seeing
[06:36.720 --> 06:43.520]  the exact same process take place but president trump last night really called them out we're
[06:43.520 --> 06:48.640]  going to play the clip in a moment and said that no one has paid a price worse than people living
[06:48.640 --> 06:54.960]  in inner cities due to the leftist program of controlled dependency and here's a great example
[06:54.960 --> 07:02.720]  in austin texas i heard the globalist mayor on the local radio this morning saying we've got to get
[07:02.720 --> 07:08.000]  more funding for the homeless and we had to pass this ordinance saying they can sleep in your yard
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.600]  so we don't ignore the problem so we get more money so there he was admitting what i said on
[07:13.600 --> 07:19.360]  air a month ago problem reaction solution of gillian dialectic now they admit it the lefts just come
[07:19.360 --> 07:24.160]  out of the closet on everything that they're communists they want our guns that they hate america
[07:24.160 --> 07:28.880]  they want a race war that white people are inherently bad but the people saying that are white people
[07:28.880 --> 07:35.200]  it's incredible and there was the austin mayor this morning saying oh we you know we can't just
[07:35.200 --> 07:40.240]  hide the homeless we need to have a law they can sleep in your yard so that we get more funding
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.280]  and the host went but like seattle and and and all the other places that keep getting more and
[07:45.280 --> 07:51.840]  more funding for the homeless it just is a magnet to bring them there and encourages people to get
[07:51.840 --> 07:56.800]  on welfare not have a job and then live under underpasses and collect money there are some
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.920]  homeless that are mentally ill down their luck they need to be targeted and helped with funding
[08:02.480 --> 08:07.120]  local state churches federal you name it but not this general roll out the red carpet
[08:07.120 --> 08:12.320]  i tell you i drive around austin looks like san francisco or portland or one of these other blue
[08:12.320 --> 08:17.280]  city toilet bowls in many areas feces everywhere bombed out of their brains on drugs drunk
[08:18.560 --> 08:23.120]  and they're white they're black they're hispanic but they're mainly white and what it is is a
[08:23.120 --> 08:30.320]  bunch of freeloading lazy jackasses you know most whites aren't lazy in this country like max
[08:30.320 --> 08:37.680]  boot and william christel say but it is true that the vast majority of homeless that i see in most
[08:37.680 --> 08:45.680]  cities are drug addict bombed out of their brain really mean nasty white people now some i've run
[08:45.680 --> 08:50.160]  into or admit their drug addicts and said they won't help uh some are nice but but most of them
[08:50.160 --> 08:56.960]  are really really vicious and that's a microcosm entitled and vicious that's a microcosm how the
[08:56.960 --> 09:02.320]  left brings these people in and then incentivizes more to come creates a crisis and says give us
[09:02.320 --> 09:08.320]  more money but the good news was the talk show host was on five down eam i guess about eight
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.120]  o'clock this morning they totally tore the mayor up to his face and after and said you notice
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.080]  they always want more money and it always makes the crisis worse they know exactly what they're
[09:18.080 --> 09:25.520]  doing it's leftist formulas to again demoralize and bring down civilization and these guys know
[09:25.520 --> 09:34.800]  exactly what they are doing here's the president the democrat party is now being led by four left
[09:34.800 --> 09:45.360]  wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear no one has paid a higher price
[09:46.480 --> 09:53.280]  for the far left's destructive agenda than americans living in our nation's inner cities
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.560]  they have paid a dear price you see what's happening you see our inner cities we spend
[09:58.560 --> 10:05.680]  billions and billions and billions for years and years and years and it's stolen money and it's
[10:05.680 --> 10:16.400]  wasted money and it's a shame for decades these communities have been run exclusively
[10:16.400 --> 10:25.520]  by democrat politicians and it's been total one party control of the inner cities for
[10:25.520 --> 10:31.440]  a hundred years it's been one party control and look at them we can name one after another but
[10:31.440 --> 10:40.960]  i won't do that because i don't want to be controversial the homicide rate in baltimore
[10:40.960 --> 10:51.680]  is significantly higher than el salvador honduras guatemala i believe it's higher than
[10:52.720 --> 10:59.840]  give me a give me a place that you think is pretty bad give me a place the guy says afghanistan i
[10:59.840 --> 11:08.000]  believe it's higher than afghanistan in our country think of that i believe we'll check the numbers
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.360]  and if we're wrong they will tell us tomorrow it'll be headlines trump exaggerated for the last 20
[11:15.360 --> 11:20.960]  years china's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country and now
[11:20.960 --> 11:30.160]  we're stopping the theft of american jobs we're stopping the theft of so many other things happening
[11:30.160 --> 11:36.560]  including intellectual property and you know i think they want to try and make a deal with us but
[11:36.560 --> 11:44.960]  i'm not sure because the word is i feel they want to wait till they get oh they're praying they're
[11:44.960 --> 11:51.040]  praying they would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue
[11:51.040 --> 11:55.840]  to rip off the united states like they've been doing for the last 25 years
[11:59.040 --> 12:05.280]  all right ladies and gentlemen welcome in now to the info wars headquarters here in austin texas

[18:00.160 --> 18:02.880]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[18:02.880 --> 18:07.360]  hey alec yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[18:07.360 --> 18:12.000]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.880]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.840]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[18:21.840 --> 18:25.760]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i
[18:25.760 --> 18:29.680]  think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree
[18:29.680 --> 18:33.680]  entirely and the last thing i just want to say alec is i know they're trying to shut you down but
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.640]  the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love
[18:38.640 --> 18:43.040]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into
[18:43.040 --> 18:48.560]  this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who
[18:48.560 --> 18:52.880]  are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen
[18:52.880 --> 18:58.160]  to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank
[18:58.160 --> 19:05.040]  you sir for calling before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and
[19:05.040 --> 19:09.680]  enforce dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product
[19:09.680 --> 19:14.800]  that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna
[19:14.800 --> 19:19.600]  force plus now i remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[19:19.600 --> 19:25.360]  telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what
[19:25.360 --> 19:32.000]  telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres so
[19:32.000 --> 19:38.320]  i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.640]  and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[19:42.640 --> 19:49.520]  telomere support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite
[19:49.520 --> 19:54.880]  supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you
[19:54.880 --> 20:00.000]  should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com
[20:02.720 --> 20:16.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:20.400 --> 20:24.640]  i feel like that's the theme song for james comey running through like the halls
[20:24.640 --> 20:29.680]  like like he's in this doorway he's in this like where'd comey go
[20:32.880 --> 20:39.760]  somehow avoiding justice welcome back to the alex jones show oan schreuer here in the seat
[20:40.320 --> 20:44.720]  in the info wars world headquarters in austin texas alex jones is going to be back joining us for
[20:44.720 --> 20:50.480]  the rest of the hour after the segment but i got a ton of news to get to i've got two exclusive
[20:50.480 --> 20:55.520]  breaking news stories i'm gonna have in the second hour with bob barnes but before i do that i have
[20:55.520 --> 20:59.840]  to tell you i am not happy i'm irked in fact i was talking to darin mcgreen about this today
[21:02.160 --> 21:10.160]  james comey just oh he's guilty but we're not gonna prosecute and it's the hillary clinton
[21:10.160 --> 21:14.240]  story all over again and so i'm i have to come out here and i i have to admit i mean i'll admit
[21:14.240 --> 21:22.160]  when i'm wrong i'll admit when i'm fake news i am now fake news because i assumed that when you
[21:22.160 --> 21:29.040]  got caught breaking the law that you would be prosecuted so i'm sorry i reported yesterday
[21:29.040 --> 21:33.280]  james comey would be prosecuted because you know of all the felonies he committed the perjury
[21:33.280 --> 21:41.760]  the classified uh leaking of documents uh so i am sorry i'm fake news i thought james comey would
[21:41.760 --> 21:48.560]  be prosecuted for the crimes that he was guilty of that investigations found to be true
[21:50.640 --> 21:58.560]  uh amazing but i'm fake news because i assumed we had justice so here is lindsay graham
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.800]  talking about the clinton effect on james comey getting off without prosecution well we've
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.760]  been waiting for the ig report we hear now it's mid august we understand there's reasons for the
[22:11.760 --> 22:17.440]  delays that are far bigger than the issue of the violation of the espionage act that he's
[22:17.440 --> 22:23.760]  referring comey for prosecution for and of course being less than candid lack of candor
[22:23.760 --> 22:29.520]  but we can't have a two-tier justice system either i understand that the ag is looking at these other
[22:29.520 --> 22:35.120]  issues first but the decline prosecution if he believes the laws are broken i think we really
[22:35.120 --> 22:40.480]  have to reevaluate that yeah number one i want to see the report i like john solomon he's a good
[22:40.480 --> 22:47.440]  reporter but if it's true the inspector general has referred the fbi director for criminal prosecution
[22:47.440 --> 22:54.240]  it's true that's stunning okay we'll know in a few weeks it's stunning now if bill bar decided not
[22:54.240 --> 23:01.280]  to prosecute on disclosing the memos i accept his judgment i've known him for 20 years and i have no
[23:01.280 --> 23:05.440]  desire for him to be like muller i want him to do what he thinks is right by the law and not
[23:05.440 --> 23:10.880]  prosecute anybody if you don't think the case is there because somebody else got mistreated there's
[23:10.880 --> 23:16.720]  no reason to continue that practice so if it's true and we'll know pretty soon it's stunning
[23:17.280 --> 23:24.880]  beyond stunning it is to me here's my interpretation up the top of what do i know i'm just a talk show
[23:24.880 --> 23:32.320]  hopes right i don't know a whole lot of anything but i'll just guess it i kind of see bar as a as a
[23:32.320 --> 23:38.160]  really thorough extraordinarily bright human being i think two of the best picture for me would be
[23:38.160 --> 23:44.880]  black pompeo the kind of the adult between that was that was like he's right my head and i'd say
[23:44.880 --> 23:50.480]  that probably bar is recognized the fives abuse issues that we have talked about and if james
[23:50.480 --> 23:57.040]  combi was warned that it's unverifiable never verified hillary paid for it oh and uh by the way
[23:57.040 --> 24:02.240]  steal as an agenda and he signed it anyway and we now know according to the grassy gram memo the bulk
[24:02.240 --> 24:08.400]  of that information was in fact the dossier with russian lies or as the new york times says was from
[24:08.400 --> 24:13.280]  the get go russian disinformation that would prove number one the russian favoring hillary and number
[24:13.280 --> 24:19.040]  two would prove that attorney general bars being a little bit more he's playing chess and long ball
[24:19.040 --> 24:24.160]  he's not playing checkers and that he sees that there are bigger fish to fry down the road and he
[24:24.160 --> 24:29.280]  could always revisit that issue but what do i know i'm not only a host well i think you know a lot
[24:29.280 --> 24:37.520]  about this and if bill bar said they may be a case there but i think is uh out of abundance of caution
[24:37.520 --> 24:43.760]  i won't bring it good that's what you want prosecutors to do yeah i mean but the point is
[24:43.760 --> 24:48.480]  if you've got some doubt about the the validity of the case just don't throw it up against the
[24:48.480 --> 24:54.400]  wall and see if it's would you want the first case you brought in jeopardy of not winning that would
[24:54.400 --> 25:00.240]  be in my consideration as well when you know these other cases are stronger yeah you know a lot about
[25:00.240 --> 25:06.080]  prosecution even though you hadn't been one the worst thing you can do is overcharge somebody
[25:06.080 --> 25:12.080]  it began to fall apart then it takes the thing that really is strong you're the lawyer i'm learning
[25:12.080 --> 25:21.600]  from you there's two ways to do this so everything uh the kitchen sink at the accused and hope he
[25:21.600 --> 25:28.400]  pleads to something or make sure that when you charge them it will not be undermined because
[25:28.400 --> 25:34.880]  you overcharge this would happen with muller they tried to scare people into writing on trump it
[25:34.880 --> 25:39.200]  didn't work they were overcharged muller made things up trump wasn't guilty of anything he's
[25:39.200 --> 25:45.600]  revisited he's guilty the fact that that bar is showing some prosecutorial discretion that is evened
[25:45.600 --> 25:52.000]  and reasoned is a step in the right direction and if he does bring a charge against combi after doing
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.760]  this i'd hate to be combi i think i'd hate to be combi i would try to be a good guy and warn
[25:57.760 --> 26:03.520]  james combi i told him before a stupid book came out that he has the right to remain silent i advised
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.960]  him to take that right aside they're not going to prosecute because there's no intent that's the
[26:08.960 --> 26:18.160]  hillary clinton argument however superpays this one down guys because on cnn even cnn is admitting
[26:18.800 --> 26:26.720]  that there was intent for combi to leak this emma uh memo in clip 17 fired the former fbi
[26:26.720 --> 26:31.920]  director made a remarkable effort to shape the investigation asking a friend to leave the
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.320]  investigation contents of the memos documenting his meetings with the president to spark the
[26:36.320 --> 26:42.240]  admitted he asked his friend to leak it i asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo
[26:42.240 --> 26:46.960]  with a reporter didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons but i asked him to because i thought
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.320]  that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel and then result that combi got with the
[26:52.320 --> 27:03.840]  appointment of robert muller ah isn't that just wonderful now let's conclude the clip if we can
[27:03.840 --> 27:07.600]  do we still have that time keyed up if not it's it's no big deal but let's conclude the gram clip
[27:07.600 --> 27:14.400]  because i just wanted to put that in perspective because they're saying no intent just like hillary
[27:14.400 --> 27:21.920]  had no intent well what do you mean no intent she knew she had an illegal server there's the intent
[27:21.920 --> 27:32.640]  right there that's the intent just like cnn admits yeah combi leaked the memo to shape
[27:32.640 --> 27:38.000]  a public opinion yeah yeah so let's go back to lindsay graham saying oh no intent but maybe borrow
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.680]  come back and get him next time i think i'd hate to be combi i was trying to be a good guy and warn
[27:43.680 --> 27:48.720]  james combi i told him before a stupid book came out that he has the right to remain silent i
[27:48.720 --> 27:54.160]  advised him to take that right seriously now i'm just going to advise him not only do you have
[27:54.160 --> 27:59.600]  the right if i was you uh super patriot jim combi i just shut the hell up because you're hurting
[27:59.600 --> 28:03.920]  yourself every time you open your big fat mouth i can't be any more blunt than that because i'm a
[28:03.920 --> 28:08.400]  talk show host and i'm not a senator this one just from a from a prosecutor's point of view you
[28:08.400 --> 28:14.240]  don't want to undermine a big case by throwing out some stuff that may be as if he costs that only
[28:14.240 --> 28:20.080]  hurts you down the road so if there was an abuse of the fizer process if there if there was a
[28:20.080 --> 28:27.680]  misleading of the court by the fbi director that is a monumental crime and i would focus on that if
[28:27.680 --> 28:33.120]  that's what happened all right so basically the reasoning here that the gram is is kind of standing
[28:33.120 --> 28:39.280]  up for bar and protecting bar as bar is protecting combi really in an extent is he saying look maybe
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.960]  this is wishy washy this case against combi here but we can come back and get him on this this or
[28:42.960 --> 28:49.120]  this and it's much a stronger case so but i'm just sick of these people i'm sick of clinton
[28:49.120 --> 28:54.720]  breaking the law and not being punished i'm sick of combi breaking the law i mean it's just america
[28:54.720 --> 29:01.280]  sick of it we want justice here we'll be right back with alice just fellow patriots my name is

[32:04.880 --> 32:08.960]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[32:08.960 --> 32:13.280]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[32:13.280 --> 32:17.280]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[32:17.280 --> 32:20.640]  members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real social
[32:20.640 --> 32:24.960]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[32:24.960 --> 32:28.800]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[32:28.800 --> 32:33.120]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.920]  recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[32:37.920 --> 32:43.040]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[32:43.040 --> 32:47.360]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[32:47.360 --> 32:51.760]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[32:51.760 --> 32:55.120]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the
[32:55.120 --> 32:59.680]  ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just
[32:59.680 --> 33:17.760]  thought you're listening to the alex jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to
[33:17.760 --> 33:29.200]  the alex jones show the jeffrey abstein scandal could bring down the entire establishment you see
[33:30.240 --> 33:36.720]  for over a hundred years western intelligence agencies themselves infiltrated by secret
[33:36.720 --> 33:46.480]  societies out of britain used sex operatives to compromise targets who weren't just agents of foreign
[33:46.480 --> 33:54.320]  governments but who were in outside power structures that this group didn't control
[33:54.320 --> 34:00.960]  but was seeking to get control ceso roads wrote about this in several books on his plan for world
[34:00.960 --> 34:09.600]  government he had the main british empire behind him and supporting him they set up roundtable
[34:09.600 --> 34:16.800]  groups across the world like the council on foreign relations in 1921 in new york to take over our
[34:16.800 --> 34:23.920]  governments using payoffs using sex operatives and more they found quickly that if you tried to set
[34:23.920 --> 34:30.000]  somebody up or blackmail them over cheating on their wife it wouldn't work but if you could induce
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.160]  them to have sex with an underage person or a child you had them buy the short hairs for the rest
[34:36.160 --> 34:43.920]  of their lives so simply put i was able to know that jeffrey abstein was a operative because of
[34:43.920 --> 34:50.080]  who he was associating with because of his background and because of the mo jeffrey abstein
[34:50.080 --> 34:57.760]  was recruited by these systems in new york city more than 30 years ago to begin recruiting little
[34:57.760 --> 35:04.320]  girls as a pimp on an industrial scale he reportedly had recruited hundreds and hundreds
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.080]  and hundreds a year that's thousands over the years to go out and then set up other people and
[35:10.080 --> 35:18.800]  bring them under his control but jeffrey abstein is only the second tier he's not the core group
[35:18.800 --> 35:25.440]  and so i want to spend some time today looking at their operating system looking at how they
[35:25.440 --> 35:34.560]  they not just dominate and control society but what their in game and goal is their goal
[35:35.360 --> 35:42.560]  is a post human world and in their own words a post human world means the classical human
[35:42.560 --> 35:49.600]  independent strong family based with a relationship with god just as the french revolution with the
[35:49.600 --> 35:58.320]  prototype of this they want that system removed and a centralized corporate computerized
[35:58.320 --> 36:04.720]  technocracy in their own words that will then manage and control every facet of life that's
[36:04.720 --> 36:13.280]  what the carbon tax is you'll need total computer and human surveillance over every action and then
[36:13.280 --> 36:20.240]  you can control people track and trace them and also tax them notice that we just witnessed
[36:20.240 --> 36:25.760]  zuckerberg come out yesterday announced you're going to have a social credit score just as we
[36:25.760 --> 36:33.760]  told you years ago and you can pay us to fix your social credit score but it gets worse you're going
[36:33.760 --> 36:40.000]  to have a global internet id run by facebook attached to the new global digital currency
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.920]  and if you don't play ball if you don't take all your inoculations if you if you're not a
[36:45.920 --> 36:51.440]  vegan if you don't teach your three-year-old how to transition and be chemically castrated
[36:52.240 --> 36:58.960]  well then you're going to be downgraded a lot of folks will say well that's black mirror exactly
[36:58.960 --> 37:06.800]  but we reported on this plan a decade before tv shows like black mirror which are called predictive
[37:06.800 --> 37:15.040]  programming to prepare you for the future now let's get back into jeffrey epstein the media is
[37:15.040 --> 37:20.160]  asking how do we know he was an operative well it was incredibly obvious plus if you go back to the
[37:20.160 --> 37:25.920]  court filings at the time there was clearly a cover-up by the fbi at the highest levels because
[37:25.920 --> 37:32.720]  again he was going out on a mass scale on an industrial scale recruiting sometimes hundreds
[37:32.720 --> 37:41.520]  of young women and girls a month to frame people to dial them in to compromise them and that's just
[37:41.520 --> 37:49.920]  phase one then as people get deeper into the cult they start getting them into religious rituals
[37:49.920 --> 37:56.400]  they become more and more dark more and more satanic then the children get younger and through
[37:56.400 --> 38:02.240]  that process it's basically trauma-based mind control of the children and the adults the cult
[38:02.240 --> 38:09.040]  finds out who is truly twisted and dark and who will carry out certain operations no matter
[38:09.040 --> 38:16.080]  how horrible then those cult members are sent to higher rooms of the secret society slash
[38:17.040 --> 38:24.720]  secret governmental agency program that's all intelligence agencies are in the last 200 years
[38:24.720 --> 38:30.720]  is the modern equivalent of ancient secret societies that's why when you're hearing all of this you're
[38:30.720 --> 38:34.560]  saying i read about this in the bible i've read about this in history books i read about this
[38:34.560 --> 38:40.960]  in ancient Rome ancient Greece how these evil cults would slowly take over society get control
[38:40.960 --> 38:49.120]  of governments and then do what start sacrificing children and so that's really what is at the
[38:49.120 --> 38:56.080]  bottom of the rabbit hole now i would direct viewers to the wall street journal a decade ago
[38:56.080 --> 39:02.480]  i would also direct you to london guardian a decade ago with their headlines elite meet in new
[39:02.480 --> 39:11.600]  york to discuss over population elite meet in new york david rockefeller and bill gates and
[39:12.320 --> 39:17.200]  all these other elitists and all these other big decision makers people i go from winfrey
[39:17.200 --> 39:26.000]  to discuss world government to carry out depopulation and here my friends is the rest of
[39:26.000 --> 39:33.760]  story when you hear about jeffrey etstein and these billions of dollars that came from nowhere
[39:34.320 --> 39:40.480]  and setting up huge medical style compound ranches in new mexico and occult compounds and
[39:40.480 --> 39:46.240]  buying of islands in the caribbean these are facilities where they had women's retreats
[39:46.240 --> 39:54.160]  men's retreats children's retreats uh disney cruises would pay to land on the little island
[39:54.160 --> 40:01.360]  looked us up here's a cult compound and quote have snorkeling trips and go on the shore again
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.480]  that was just disney which is a pedophile group at the top chipping in money to help the organization
[40:07.120 --> 40:13.280]  all a giant cult scratching each other's backs so how did i know
[40:13.280 --> 40:18.240]  how did i know the jeffrey etstein was into the occult how did i know the jeffrey etstein
[40:18.960 --> 40:23.280]  was into eugenics how did i know that he was working for intelligence agencies because
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.360]  every one of these groups when you research them you actually dig into them you find is the same
[40:29.360 --> 40:35.920]  group doing the exact same thing so let me explain the big secret the truth is the journey for these
[40:35.920 --> 40:43.840]  people is the destination as o brian torturing wenson in 1984 says winston there isn't a goal
[40:43.840 --> 40:48.160]  except tearing down humanity and making us dumber and stupider and not living as long
[40:48.160 --> 40:52.800]  and torturing you to death for pure satanic enjoyment a world that gets more evil more
[40:52.800 --> 41:00.000]  destructive more out of control until everyone's dead winston and so they tell outside groups
[41:00.000 --> 41:07.200]  groups porch minions people that aren't actually in the cult those being recruited that oh we're
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.480]  saving the earth it's a world government to save the animals and oh it's a great loving thing but
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.640]  we've got to do some really mean stuff for the greater good and we've got to give them these
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.680]  vaccines with chemicals to lower their iqs and the fluoride because we'll have wars if we don't
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.640]  dumb them down and if we don't make them manageable and we've got to do all these things for the
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.520]  greater good but when you get into the deeper rooms then you learn what the plan is really about
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.720]  so that's all that epstein was doing at these elite dinner parties where he was giving five
[41:36.720 --> 41:42.320]  million six million ten million dollars a pop to establish all these different institutions
[41:42.320 --> 41:50.080]  inside harvard other organizations was externalizing the method and taking this race-based eugenics
[41:50.080 --> 41:57.360]  cult first envisioned by play-doh first implemented by malthus first codified to a global scientific
[41:57.360 --> 42:04.640]  system by sir frances gallton 170 years ago with the full weight of the british empire behind it
[42:04.640 --> 42:10.800]  since the time of cesil roads and then you understand oh it's a unified project and all
[42:10.800 --> 42:20.240]  jeffrey epstein was was a super pimp highest level second tier administrative to frame and set up
[42:20.240 --> 42:26.080]  as many people as he could a month to get them into the cult to induct them when i say frame
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.160]  they'll tell you oh this woman's 20 they're really 16 now they've got you oh it's okay
[42:31.040 --> 42:36.240]  you know here's some more 16 year old girls and oh here's a 12 year old girl oh this little girls
[42:36.240 --> 42:42.800]  and talk their mommy come help me bury the body you understand just like eyes wide shut is fiction
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.120]  but it's not fiction that's real stuff that goes on oh the prostitute died by accident during the
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.920]  ritual no they just killed her in front of you so it's all about corrupting individuals it's all
[42:51.920 --> 43:01.840]  about taking over society it's all about compromising humanity the globalist are hyper competitive
[43:01.840 --> 43:07.200]  scientific dictators they are technocrats they are control freaks in their own words and they believe
[43:07.200 --> 43:12.240]  allowing you to live your own life make your own decisions get to the way of their great destiny
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.200]  to merge with ai gods now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here
[43:17.200 --> 43:21.600]  in the third dimension but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've
[43:21.600 --> 43:26.400]  really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies if i wasn't taking the highest quality

[45:16.960 --> 45:22.240]  started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.680]  with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can
[45:27.680 --> 45:33.680]  improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force
[45:33.680 --> 45:39.840]  plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other
[45:39.840 --> 45:45.680]  competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[45:45.680 --> 45:52.480]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on

[47:13.360 --> 47:19.600]  but you can slow it all down you can write notes you can research it for years this is the operating
[47:19.600 --> 47:27.760]  system of these people so they sell recruits on we're saving the earth we're saving the animals
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.040]  we love humanity but we've got to do some really bad things and be worse than the bad people
[47:33.760 --> 47:39.040]  to make sure we secure this future and that's how they begin the first level of compromise
[47:39.920 --> 47:47.120]  but then as you get deeper into it they discover that no this is really just all about abusing people
[47:47.120 --> 47:53.600]  drugging people controlling people and mind control just like these cults got control of the cia
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.960]  hell they helped set it up in 1947 and what did they do
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.360]  drugging prostitutes drugging businessmen doing mind control tests kidnapping children
[48:03.360 --> 48:08.560]  drugging them up electroshock until they were totally new personalities completely programmed
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.880]  and that's just what they declassified that dr ewing cameron had over 10 000 children
[48:14.880 --> 48:23.040]  in canada in the u.s. kidnapped from the 50s into the 80s and actually programmed them innocent
[48:23.040 --> 48:29.760]  children that did nothing wrong but you see they're now externalizing their system they have mainline
[48:29.760 --> 48:35.600]  gay parades that now admit actually were for pedophilia that's in bri bar today they have
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.680]  mainline groups saying we're going to put microchips and wires in your brain and the ai is
[48:41.680 --> 48:47.920]  going to take you over they've now gotten the point of saying yeah we're going to keep babies alive
[48:48.560 --> 48:54.080]  harvest their organs keep them comfortable and then kill them who would have ever imagined they'd
[48:54.080 --> 49:00.880]  be admitting stuff like this just 20 years ago but this is the process of searing our conscience
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.560]  the process of showing us millions of simulated murders and people being tortured on tv programs
[49:06.560 --> 49:14.560]  and in horror movies until our subconscious mind at the bare minimum is numb to it but in many cases
[49:14.560 --> 49:21.600]  actually likes it and has been artificially converted over into a form of synthetic psychopathic
[49:21.600 --> 49:31.200]  lust and that's all jeffrey afstein is is a rinfield he is a nightmarish evil looking evil
[49:31.200 --> 49:41.360]  acting evil living minion and just as bram stoker's rinfield delivered men women and children to his
[49:42.160 --> 49:48.800]  royal boss in reality we learned that bram stoker was only telling us in an allegory
[49:49.360 --> 49:56.400]  about how the real world worked because past the sandustries and past the
[49:56.400 --> 50:03.360]  individuals at penn state and past the jeffrey abstinence and all of this and all these elite
[50:03.360 --> 50:09.440]  organizations and sports organizations entertainment organizations that are quote helping disadvantaged
[50:09.440 --> 50:16.640]  children and having these galas and these events where they funnel the children in to have sex
[50:17.200 --> 50:24.400]  with these pedophile rings but that itself is only one part of the equation it's part of a communal
[50:24.400 --> 50:33.760]  corruption so that none of them can ever come out of it again and in the final equation there is
[50:33.760 --> 50:41.840]  again a vampiric draining off of the energy when they abuse women when they abuse children
[50:42.560 --> 50:46.960]  when they don't take care of the veterans when they poison the water when they poison the food
[50:46.960 --> 50:54.800]  food all of it is creating an atmosphere that allows this evil force to spread they are turning
[50:54.800 --> 51:00.400]  our environment into their environment and of course if you saw it 20 years ago and warn people it
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.280]  sounded insane because back then something like that could never happen something like that could
[51:05.280 --> 51:12.800]  never be going on but all these years later you learned that every major state has thousands of
[51:12.800 --> 51:18.880]  catholic priests not just raping little boys but actually carrying out satanic ceremonies
[51:18.880 --> 51:24.240]  and it's in the newspaper but a minor footnote and you find out it's the big baptist churches
[51:24.240 --> 51:28.800]  and the evangelicals you find out it's the colleges and you find out it's the sports physicians
[51:28.800 --> 51:34.880]  and it's the doctors and it's the trainers and it's everywhere because the enemy is going out
[51:34.880 --> 51:43.200]  and seducing people and converting them it to it and baptizing them in the abuse of innocent
[51:43.200 --> 51:51.200]  children so just as in christianity you are baptized in water they are baptized in the satanic
[51:51.200 --> 51:59.120]  filth of abusing children and again star wars episode four written by james lucas george lucas
[51:59.120 --> 52:06.080]  what does he tell you right there darth vader is not darth vader yet he's committed himself to the
[52:06.080 --> 52:14.560]  dark side he's helped kill his former religious leader mace window now he has to go kill hundreds
[52:14.560 --> 52:21.520]  of children because only then will you be powerful enough in the dark side they are telling you
[52:22.400 --> 52:27.520]  precisely what they're doing in the revelation of the method and the fact that these groups are
[52:27.520 --> 52:32.880]  being rolled up right now shows that trump and others in our government are aware of these
[52:32.880 --> 52:39.200]  corrupt satanic intelligence agencies and are now moving and working against it i'll speak a lot
[52:39.200 --> 52:43.280]  more about this we need to make some special reports about it and show you more evidence of it
[52:43.280 --> 52:48.080]  but this is the reality they want the power to exterminate humanity they want the power to kill
[52:48.080 --> 52:53.120]  still and destroy and pose as the saviors while they do it they're not the guardians of the earth
[52:53.120 --> 52:58.160]  they're the destroyers of the earth here's a few minutes from my three-hour film in-game blueprint
[52:58.160 --> 53:04.480]  from global enslavement now 11 years old where i lay out just some of this information but having
[53:04.480 --> 53:09.200]  the enemy's operating system is absolutely critical for the general public to know and resist and say
[53:09.200 --> 53:16.080]  no but also for those that have been recruited into the outer rooms of this system you will be
[53:16.080 --> 53:21.120]  destroyed along with your masters but if you still have any connection to god it's not too late for
[53:21.120 --> 53:26.880]  you to turn back now here's a few minutes from in-game blueprint for global enslavement which is
[53:26.880 --> 53:44.800]  still free online for now at youtube eugenics dominated the 20th century its ruthless spirit
[53:44.800 --> 53:52.320]  has now metastasized into the fields of genetics nanotech and robotics but that's not surprising
[53:52.320 --> 53:57.040]  from their inception all three disciplines have been dominated by eugenicist
[53:59.120 --> 54:05.200]  the billionaire founder of sun microsystems bill joy courageously went public in 2000
[54:05.200 --> 54:10.800]  to warn of a cancerous consensus among the technocratic elite that it best humanity would
[54:10.800 --> 54:17.920]  be completely enslaved by the year 2030 and at worst mass extermination of everyone but the elite
[54:17.920 --> 54:26.240]  would take place a who's who of the techno elite are members of what is known as the transhumanist
[54:26.240 --> 54:34.080]  or post-humanist movement many of its adherents see only the beneficial aspects of technology's
[54:34.080 --> 54:42.480]  exponential rise like bringing sight to the blind sound of the death and longer life for all
[54:45.840 --> 54:52.240]  but what many of them don't know is that master eugenicist julian huxley founded transhumanism
[54:52.240 --> 54:58.640]  and that society's controllers openly admit that the new system is designed to progress into absolute
[54:58.640 --> 55:09.520]  tyranny leading transhumanist ray Kurzweil boasts that technological advancements will allow those
[55:09.520 --> 55:15.520]  that can afford it to live forever but admits that most won't be able to keep up with the new master
[55:15.520 --> 55:25.280]  race the drive for world government is now all about who will control and have access to radical
[55:25.280 --> 55:34.720]  life extension systems biological evolution is too slow for the human species over the next
[55:34.720 --> 55:42.160]  few decades it's going to be left in the dust transhumanists believe that they will attain
[55:42.160 --> 55:47.920]  the fountain of youth by merging with technology now it may be within their reach
[55:47.920 --> 55:57.360]  decades ago transhumanists said that if you do not accept augmentation or enhancements you would no
[55:57.360 --> 56:08.000]  longer be able to get jobs and now it's happening today the elite who occupy the commanding heights
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.080]  of digital reality are suicidal nihilists suicidal nihilists know that there is no longer any
[56:14.080 --> 56:19.040]  substantive purpose to their willing but they would always prefer to go on willing than not to
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.480]  act at all they can very happily ally themselves with a notion of nuclear holocaust or perfect
[56:24.480 --> 56:32.240]  exterminism technology has become so powerful in its capacity for destruction that free humanity
[56:32.240 --> 56:38.480]  cannot afford to let psychopathic technocrats with delusions of grandeur repeat the mistakes of their
[56:38.480 --> 56:44.720]  forebears because it is highly probable that this time they may destroy everything including
[56:44.720 --> 56:55.840]  themselves in their mad rush for godhood in this film we have chronicled the overlords bloody
[56:55.840 --> 57:02.080]  orgy of experimentation which already claimed the lives of more than 150 million people in the 20th
[57:02.080 --> 57:11.600]  century and now they are promising to deliver an invincible tyranny that will dwarf their past
[57:11.600 --> 57:20.240]  exploits in the days of world war two there were sovereign nations and armies to stand against
[57:20.240 --> 57:30.000]  hitler's final solution once world government is in place no one will be able to stop the new
[57:30.000 --> 57:37.440]  world war's plans for global population reduction for those immune to psychological program hundreds

[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:25.440]  on this august 2nd 2019 friday edition olyn is taking over live in just a few minutes
[1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:30.640]  and we'll host the rest of the transmission but i want to just be clear and summation of the last
[1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:36.640]  two segments you heard that we're going to combine and post to info wars dot com and news wars dot
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:44.000]  com that really needs to get out there so that people understand that people like sand dusky at
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:49.920]  penn state and people like epstein working for the clinton's and others all work for the same
[1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:58.320]  organization compromising groups to control them is a private corporate takeover system
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:04.800]  that is in control of almost every western intelligence agency there are a lot of people
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:10.480]  inside the agencies who call themselves on the light side the white hats who've been aware of this
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:15.920]  for a long time they're very very upset but the fact that epstein has been caught and the fact
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:22.640]  that this is a major window into this system could bring down this entire private intelligence
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:29.920]  network that is the enforcement arm of the world government and the chai comms are openly funding
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:37.200]  sex operatives as well they're funding demoralizing us on the whole hollywood system and the global
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:42.880]  axis humanities fighting is good versus evil but the main governmental and corporate forces on the
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:51.280]  other side are the chai comms the eu hollywood the left and orthodox radical weaponized islam
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:56.560]  that's why they're all unified together targeting the west targeting christians targeting families
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:02.080]  targeting children and again trying to make us give up trying to make us be demoralized
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:07.520]  that once you understand the attack profile once you understand the overall system then it all makes
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:13.680]  sense but understand i didn't dream all this up people keep asking why is everything this guy
[1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:18.560]  says keeps coming true why do they want him off air why are they so scared i'm gonna explain this
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:27.680]  again this is all in mainline history books until the 50s now it's phd level stuff but
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:33.040]  when i was a kid my dad gave me all sorts of books about how all this worked i remember my dad having
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:39.440]  a zabina brzezinski book i think it was the technotronic era and he was when i was like
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:44.400]  five years old he's saying it's just incredible son zabina brzezinski is the national security
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:49.920]  advisor uh to the president and he's admitting that the government runs the drugs and the government
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:55.600]  runs the child porn and the government runs it all to control criminal groups in the name of
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:00.240]  controlling crime but in truth they actually run the whole thing he told me about secret societies
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:05.440]  departmentalization and again my dad had history books about this and then he had books about the
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:10.320]  french revolution and he had books about the occult and black magic that are like the real
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:15.760]  ones not the not the ones they sell at the bookstore and this is stuff that all these
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:20.960]  professors and everybody knows and my dad they directly tried to recruit him in college because
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:26.880]  he was top of his class a lot of people just skip right direct to the end of this thing and say no
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:32.160]  and my dad chose not to be part of this crap but i'm here to tell you folks this is the real world
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:36.960]  and so i was a teenager i was rolling my eyes at this stuff that i already learned when i was a
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:42.720]  kid until i found out it was all true and then i had retired generals and fbi agents telling me all
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:48.640]  the exact same stuff that my dad had told me so folks there's no longer any denial there's devil
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:53.760]  worst burst satanist pedophiles all over the place in high places they are mainlining this
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:58.160]  in the culture in the society right now and you wonder why the democrats are so vicious and so
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:06.000]  hateful and so evil it's because they work for people that are trying to break our will that's
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:12.240]  why in closing if you don't financially support us you're not supporting yourself you are insane
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:15.920]  if you don't spread the word about our local stations and how people can tune in you're insane
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:20.960]  i'm not mad at you i'm just saying folks this is do or die and we've proven we're dead on we've
[1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:24.960]  proven we know what we're talking about we got straw wide free shipping double patriot points

[1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:45.280]  a stand against their attempt to overthrow civilization and reality because it's the only
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:50.240]  way these satanists can win now you've heard this key transmission back to oh and shroyer and the ATX
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:57.360]  please stay with us big breaking news with bob barns and myself on the other side of this short break
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:03.520]  pilot yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180 dollars so far this year
[1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:07.680]  and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:10.720]  get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:14.640]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality product the
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:19.440]  products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:24.160]  lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used
[1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:28.640]  to get these little sore throat so he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:33.520]  throat well let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a good price
[1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:38.240]  but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:42.800]  dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:47.360]  the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot of
[1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:51.280]  times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10 off because you're on
[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:55.920]  autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh we have patriot points we
[1:05:55.920 --> 1:06:10.080]  lose money but that's okay thanks for the support the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to
[1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:19.440]  the alex john show and now your host owin shroyer
[1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:25.840]  bob barnes joins me here on the alex john show and you know i gotta say bob before we get into the
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:31.760]  big exclusive that you're about to break here on the alex john show and then in the next segment
[1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:37.280]  i'm gonna break an exclusive with you uh it's all big breaking news but bob i gotta say
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:46.240]  we're four for four on our democrat political debate coverage and our basic odds making of who's
[1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:50.400]  gonna win who's gonna get the google search who's gonna get the drudge pool and so i just gotta
[1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:55.280]  say bob in fact the kind of one way i gauge things is how much response am i getting organically
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:06:59.760]  from friends and family people are reaching out saying you and bob barnes have the best
[1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:06.320]  political debate coverage bar none that they've ever seen so tip of the cap to you tip of the cap

[1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:29.280]  wide at infowarstore.com we wouldn't be able to have bob barnes on here breaking exclusive news
[1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:37.280]  we wouldn't be able to do the extended broadcast covering the two night two rounds so far of democrat
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:43.360]  clown show debates laughing and frolicking through the clown world as we break it down so we thank

[1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:27.040]  people we get paid by you shopping at infowarstore.com we cannot thank you enough so this is big now
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:35.840]  sometimes we have to go back in time and make stories relevant again because they never really
[1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:41.760]  go away and one of those examples is what happened to the covington catholic boys where they send
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:47.200]  who now nathan philips is totally exposed as a punk and we're being polite here this this guy is a
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:52.640]  punk and so there have been some other suits out there but there's been some people trying to
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:58.240]  attribute some suits to to robert barnes here not his suits but he does have breaking news
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:03.920]  exclusively right now in regards to lawsuits being filed against the fake news for coming after
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:10.960]  the covington catholic boys so bob barnes take it over what is the latest so yesterday afternoon
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:15.920]  we filed suit on behalf of eight covington families there's likely going to be four more
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:19.280]  who are going to be at it so ultimately it's likely going to be an even dozen
[1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:25.760]  12 covington kids who filed suit for defamation per se libel against a range of defendants
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:31.680]  including 10 prominent high-profile social media personalities people that are prominent in the
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:36.960]  press prominent politicians so the people that were sued yesterday include kathy griffin
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:43.760]  include senator elizabeth warren include congresswoman deb howland include a matthew dowd
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:48.240]  include in a navarro and include a range of other so they're going to be receiving those
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:53.920]  suits in the coming weeks uh but those suits were formally filed in state court in uh covington
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:59.760]  kentucky yesterday those suits are moving forward those claims are strong claims we believe they
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:04.000]  will survive most of the dismiss and that ultimately each of those defendants if they
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:09.040]  don't confess if they don't reach some form of contrition if they don't retract correct and
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:14.080]  apologize for what they did they're going to face a kentucky jury to determine what the
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:19.840]  amount of damages should be for their action and all the uh the family members are not seeking
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:25.600]  the lawsuit as a lottery ticket they're solely seeking it for recovery to remediate from the harm
[1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:30.000]  and to deter other people from doing the same thing so each of the plaintiffs each of the
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.360]  covington kids is only seeking the cost of a four-year tuition at the university of kentucky
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:40.240]  that's less than 50 000 dollars now in aggregate between all of the claims of all the plaintiffs
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:45.440]  and all the defendants it's in multiple millions of dollars the potential liability that these
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:50.560]  individuals face for what they did collectively and aggregate but what they're seeking is something
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:55.840]  reasonable something necessary and as part of the case we're launching a something that there'll
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:01.040]  be more news about on info awards in the coming weeks as we'll get into more detail but the free
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:07.680]  america law center is free america law center dot com uh is a subscription driven membership driven
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:12.240]  organization that is supporting the covington kids it's also going to be supporting other
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:17.840]  cases that are going to be high profile cases in the news to help democratize and equalize
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:24.480]  access to the law for ordinary people in cases of defamation in cases of deplatforming in cases
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:29.120]  of deep state whistleblowing because right now the legal system doesn't serve those people
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:34.240]  particularly if you're not on the political left you have we need a counterpart to the southern
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:40.400]  poverty law center we need an aclu that's for everyone not just ideological causes on the left
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:44.560]  and that's the goal of free america law center and the goal is for it to be membership driven
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:49.760]  and subscription driven so that ordinary people can fuel it and empower it in the same way that
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:55.520]  ordinary people keep info wars alive by supporting it by going to the site by going to info wars
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:59.440]  store by buying products that they're already going to buy the light they're just placing in
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:03.760]  their kitchen cabinet with something that's directly sold to them that has a higher degree of
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:09.760]  quality that has a higher degree of reliability that has a higher degree of authenticity because
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:14.560]  it's been personally and individually vetted as something alex jones uses himself they keep the
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:19.360]  independent free press alive and info wars is the biggest scale biggest scope of the independent
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:23.840]  free press in the world and so we're mirroring that with the free america law center the goal
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:28.240]  is something that ordinary people can have access to the legal system because what all of these big
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:32.880]  media personalities were depending upon what senator elizabeth warn was depending upon congress
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:39.600]  woman allen was depending upon what kathy griffin was relying upon what former cnn contributor
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:44.880]  raza aslan who called these faces so punchable was depending upon was that most ordinary people
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:52.160]  cannot afford a lawyer to bring a long extensive difficult suit an underdog case that's why i stepped
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:56.960]  up and said i would do all the legal work for free and free america law center is going to cover all
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:02.720]  the court costs service fees expert witness fees all of that jazz so the so ordinary people across
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:07.520]  the country could help make this suit a reality and keep it alive but also support cases like it
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:12.080]  but this is the beginning of something that's going to revolutionize the legal system in the
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:18.400]  united states by making it accessible to ordinary everyday people so that the big tech and big media
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:24.240]  and big government rogue agents cannot suppress speech cannot censor speech cannot stop speech
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:29.120]  cannot use their their the superior size of their platforms and their political and perceived
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:34.480]  prestige to lie and libel people like they did the coveton kid we need real remedy real remedy
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:38.880]  that's going to be enforceable real remedy that's going to be impactful real remedy that will be a
[1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:43.280]  deterrent to future people from doing this and that's why this suit was filed these families are
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:48.320]  not seeking a big payday they're not seeking a glamorous occasion they try to seek less notoriety
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.880]  and less publicity not more what but what the reason why they brought suit is because each of
[1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:58.080]  these people were afforded a 48 hour notice all the way back in february that we talked about right
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:03.680]  here on info wars back in february that said all of them if they will retract or correct or do some
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:09.840]  sort of action of deletion or apology they won't be sued yet months later they refuse to retract
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:15.680]  refuse to correct refuse to delete refuse to apologize and this includes maggie haberman
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:20.800]  so maggie haberman the lead political reporter for the new york times was sued today in covington
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:25.600]  kentucky and the reason she was sued is because she lied and libeled about these kids effectively
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:30.400]  called for their expulsion kids she never met based on an incident she never witnessed khaki
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:35.200]  griffin as we were just looking at on the screen publicly called for these kids to be docked for
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:40.240]  them to be named and chained and after that they were docks they were subject to personal threats
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:45.040]  on their phones personal threats in their homes personal threats on the school personal threats
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:49.200]  they receive in the mail personally said they mean look at that she's talking about name them name
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:53.280]  them and she explains why she says she wants to shame them and she wants to docks them and she
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:58.560]  wants to hurt them here it is why is that tweak still up there today well because it's still up
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:03.840]  there today khaki griffin got sued today and she got sued by eight covington families and there's
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:07.760]  going to be more covington families joining the suit because they're sick and tired of these kind
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:12.880]  of lies and libeled by people who use their social media celebrity their public profile their public
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:18.400]  platform to try to destroy a bunch of kids they didn't know based on an incident they never saw
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:23.280]  and so it's time for real remedy it's time for enforceable remedy it's time for applicable remedy
[1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:27.600]  and that's why the lawsuits it was filed the lawsuits are going to move forward people can
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:33.360]  read about it at freeamericalawcenter.com they can look at it read about it at info wars.com

[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:15.360]  billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government it is completely independent
[1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:21.120]  of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:25.440]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:30.160]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:33.760]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:37.920]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:43.200]  control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:48.000]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:51.760]  to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:57.040]  unprecedented onslaught of the black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:03.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:24.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show brought to you by info wars store
[1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:30.080]  dot com oren shroyer sitting in for alex bob barnes on the line with me i've got big news i
[1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:33.920]  want to break that bob was just teasing last segment but but i want to let's let's postpone
[1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:38.320]  that another segment uh robert let's postpone that news for another segment because i want to
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:44.160]  focus on this lawsuit that you have right now and i also kind of want to bring a little personal
[1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:51.200]  touch to it um from myself because i grew up i was raised catholic and i went to a catholic
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:58.400]  grade school and then i went to a christian high school christian brothers in saint lewis
[1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:04.960]  and and i'm very proud of that upbringing i'm very proud of the values that i was raised with
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:10.880]  the values that were instilled upon me by these uh christian and catholic institutions but
[1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:16.480]  specifically the high school one and the reason why i'm bringing this up bob is because i went to
[1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:22.480]  the pro life march with my high school three out of my four years in high school and you know me
[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:29.280]  i'm a bit of a rebel rouser and so i got into it a couple times with protesters out there and we
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:34.000]  even me and a couple friends of mine even made front page news i forget all the different uh
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:38.880]  but there's an epic photo of us facing down with some of the leftist you know abort your baby
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:45.120]  protesters out there was front page news on a couple stories but i remember and this was a
[1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:50.000]  different i mean this was back in like you know 2006 2007 2008 so totally different world you know
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:55.520]  you're not a bigot just for smiling at a guy in a hat like you are now but there were some attacks
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:59.680]  there were people that that were found out where we went to school and wanted to make a thing out of
[1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:05.840]  this but i remember because like i said they instilled good values upon us good behavior
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:10.000]  and discipline upon us we never did anything inappropriate we never cursed we never did
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:13.520]  anything and so the school was always like no we're proud of our boys they have the right
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:18.480]  to free speech they're up there standing for life and so when i see what happened to these
[1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:24.960]  covington catholic kids where i because here's thing i see what they're doing laughing smiling
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:28.960]  they start cheering like i i relate to them like man that's what i would have done this guy's in
[1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:33.520]  my face banging on a bongo drum like trying to make me upset yeah i'm gonna sit here and i'm
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:40.560]  just gonna laugh and smile and we're all gonna have fun but to see what the media did is it's
[1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:46.320]  so scary honestly is it not just scary to see what these degenerates in the media will do
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:52.640]  and and just talk about how important it is for this lawsuit for for conservatives to have legal
[1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:57.840]  groups like the left does to fund lawsuits like this because we can't have these bullies in the
[1:22:57.840 --> 1:23:06.160]  media targeting children targeting high school students for who knows what i mean doxing terrorism
[1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:11.360]  i mean that's what they're doing so talk about the importance of these lawsuits and letting
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:18.080]  the media know you're not going to be attacking children smearing children engaging in and really
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:26.080]  just hate against people for their political views i mean talk about how important it is this
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:31.520]  lawsuit coming through that the media knows you're not going to get away with these lies and these
[1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:37.520]  slanders anymore exactly i mean imagine these are kids who came from a small town covington is a
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.080]  very small town in kentucky northern kentucky likely have never been to a big city before most
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:46.080]  of them have definitely not had never been to washington dc before their first trip to the
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:50.800]  nation's capital to the beauty and the majestic nature of the architecture of our capital the
[1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:55.680]  center of power the center of history things like the washington monument the lincoln memorial the
[1:23:55.680 --> 1:24:01.360]  capital the national gallery of art the spessonian all of these extraordinary institutions that we
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:06.160]  respect and revere in america where our history was built where the history of the freedom of the
[1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:11.440]  rest of the world really was founded and established and they first get to come to this trip and they're
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:16.480]  doing it so with other classmates with colleagues with kids from all across the country and they're
[1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:22.320]  doing it solely for the purpose to march for the most vulnerable life in the world to march for life
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:28.000]  the most unprotected life in the world is what the march for life is about they do the whole
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.760]  protest with the they go through the march for life they're they have people yelling things at
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:36.160]  them on the side no problems they go through it they end up at the lincoln memorial where they're
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:40.240]  waiting for their bus to take them home and they're just hanging out together and all of a sudden
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:45.680]  there's subject to this onslaught of vitriol by the black humor israelites and a few other folks
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:52.720]  that were there calling them incest babies calling them future school shooters attacking anyone who
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:57.280]  might be gay in their group attacking anyone who might be african-american in their group they
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:01.040]  try to defend themselves and they realize there's nothing they can do with this crazy group called
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:06.560]  the black Hebrew israelites that is notorious for being sort of trolls on steroids and the
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:10.960]  way they approach people and so instead they start doing their own chants and their own cheers
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:16.080]  internally they do what we would want our kid to do if our kid was in that position and they do
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:20.800]  their own cheers and part of their cheers is the hockey dance which is a native american tradition
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:27.120]  that's actually a new zealand native tradition of the hori tribe and so they do that as part which
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:34.720]  is a very popular tradition in sports to do it's respectful it recognizes it it's empowering and
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:38.560]  then right at the end of that all of a sudden native america comes up and he's he's drumming and
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:43.280]  there's people and it seems like he's joining in that he's participating that he's having fun that's
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:47.200]  what all the kids are into like wow this is just crazy fun this is just glee these other people
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:51.680]  are joining in they seem to like it they start to realize something's a little weird and unusual but
[1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:55.840]  they just go along with it think everything's cool that there's no problems there are no complaints
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:01.440]  to them at the time they get in their school bus they're to go back home and by the time they reach
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:08.320]  home they have been subject to a social media lynch mob and that lynch mob was led by people
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:15.120]  like senator elizabeth warren led by the new york times political reporter naggy haverman led by
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:21.040]  prominent celebrities in the social media space like kathy griffin led by former cnn contributor
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:28.400]  raza aslan led by current cnn contributor anna navarro led by current abc contributor matthew
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:33.360]  dowd and many of these people purport to be conservative proclaimed to be republican and here
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:37.520]  proclaimed to be catholic and here they are attacking these kids attacking their families
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:43.280]  attacking their parents calling them to be named and shamed calling for them to be docs and expelled
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:48.400]  calling for them to not have college admissions and even suggesting and inciting physical violence
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.800]  against them we raise aslan putting the face up and saying aren't they isn't this the most
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:57.920]  possible face and what does it lead to it led to hollywood directors showing these kids being
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.880]  pushed through shredders and their physical bodies being torn apart physical violence being
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.120]  threatened against them as soon as they return home within days their school is being subject
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:11.680]  to arson threats their homes are being subject to arson threats they're being subject to threats
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:15.360]  that they're going to be beat up if they go out in public that they're going to be exposed and
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:20.000]  attacked and defamed and destroyed in ways that they will never recover their reputations ever
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.840]  again that their college admissions are in jeopardy their school employment their school
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:28.560]  admission is in jeopardy at the covington catholic high school their entire future is at state
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:33.120]  that people want to put a scarlet letter on them that calls them names that have nothing to do with
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:38.480]  who they are or what they're about and these and so what we did they are the families retained me
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:42.880]  i went out and told people i would represent these families for free i would give them my own free
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:47.600]  legal services because what's happening here is horrendous and outrageous and so i went out on a
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.400]  wide range of media places including info wars and it and went on the twitter and other social media
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:57.760]  and told these people that they need to add 48 hours to correct 48 hours to retract 48 hours to
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:02.800]  delete 48 hours to apologize and many of the big institutional media ultimately did but the people
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:08.480]  that were sued refused to to this very day how you how can you have the lead news reporter political
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:13.040]  reporter for the new york times continued to lie and libel these kids and implicitly call for their
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:17.520]  expulsion kathy griffin continued to call for their doxing raza aslon continued to call for their
[1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:22.640]  physical assault implicitly by his nature of violent incitement and the kind of where post he
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:29.280]  is posted so these kids had to take remedial action because if they can come after kids minors people
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:33.920]  they've never met based on an incident they never witnessed knowing they're just kids and minors who
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:39.040]  are private citizens imagine what they will do to anyone else that was the mess the message is they
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:44.560]  could shut up anybody anywhere any place you know exactly exactly and here's the message and we're
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:48.240]  going to break this news on the other side we've got more breaking exclusive news we'll get in the

[1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:15.360]  actually hated it but now they're trying to take it out of schools they're taking it down off of

[1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:04.880]  and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements
[1:32:04.880 --> 1:32:09.040]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:12.800]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why
[1:32:12.800 --> 1:32:16.640]  they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:20.560]  few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people
[1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:23.760]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the
[1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:29.600]  left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements and he claims are supplements
[1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:35.760]  no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because
[1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:39.680]  they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:44.240]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it
[1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:48.240]  and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:53.840]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info war store dot com or
[1:32:53.840 --> 1:33:03.360]  triple eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:20.960]  and now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's
[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:25.360]  olyn shroyer you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:37.520]  so bob barnes representing covington catholic students suing cathie griffin and others
[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:45.920]  for their lies and verbal attacks against the innocent boys and just all the trouble that
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:51.440]  came to those boys because of it it's key because it's all about going for justice
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:56.640]  and really demanding justice because here's the thing we as conservatives as as trump
[1:33:56.640 --> 1:34:02.800]  supporters as patriots as americans as independent people as sovereign citizens we don't really
[1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:08.640]  demand justice from our government because to us justice is just our own justice we're independent
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:12.960]  we don't even want the government to get involved but we have to understand that we have to turn
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:17.840]  the engine on that mindset and start demanding justice when you get assaulted in the street
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:22.000]  for wearing a trump hat you need to file a police report you have to do it it doesn't
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:27.920]  matter how inconsequential or petty it seems you have to do it we have to demand justice
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:31.920]  this is the only way we're going to stop all the political violence all the fake news lies
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:37.840]  and highlight it so you just got the exclusive from bob barnes on the covington catholic lawsuit
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:46.160]  but i am now breaking an exclusive and it's not been fun dealing with this quite frankly but
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:50.800]  it is done and there is a huge relief and people have been asking so i now have the answer the
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:57.600]  story is at info wars dot com woman's march protester found guilty of sex abuse against
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:03.040]  info wars reporter so folks you may remember from the women's march
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:13.120]  march the young woman that came up grabbed my genitals mocked me laughed about it and
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:19.680]  admitted she sexually assaulted me on camera is all on hd film i've been dealing with the
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:28.800]  litigation and we have a verdict and she has been found guilty now it was such a relief
[1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:33.600]  because i've been assaulted so many times from my political speech and i've never got any justice
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:40.080]  ever and so this really was a big relief to me and you know it's sad government workers get
[1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:45.280]  such a bad rep because there's obviously a bunch of bad eggs and lazy people and and just the
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:51.200]  nature of government work is just like uh but i want to thank the people that helped get this
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:56.880]  verdict i want to thank the attorneys i want to thank the detective and it really was such
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:00.560]  relief because these were great people that helped this and it was never political for them
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:06.320]  it was just about justice and so justice was served here again the story is at info wars
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:12.160]  dot com please share it we need to celebrate this we need to use this as an example for
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:16.640]  other trans supporters again when you get assaulted when you get hit when you get your
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:23.280]  hat ripped off file a police report man you have to go through this otherwise it's never
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:29.680]  gonna stop you have to demand justice and so i just tweeted it out as well share that tweet
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:34.000]  that's the last place i'm allowed to exist in fact now promo videos i do are getting banned
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:40.800]  across the board uh we'll talk about that later but uh robert barnes do you agree
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:46.080]  that it's time for conservatives or trump supporters for americans to stand up and
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:54.000]  demand justice and demand justice not worry about how inconsequential it seems at the time this is
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:00.640]  what has to be done do you agree oh absolutely i mean for a long time the left has effectively
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:06.640]  weaponized the law and used its disproportionate access to the law to make real and meaningful
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:11.440]  chains that benefits the political causes and ideals of the left and this stems whether you're
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:16.720]  talking about the NAACP legal defense fund who only were able to achieve civil rights by using
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:22.000]  their access to the legal system to do so or you're talking about the ACLU which effectively
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:27.120]  use the legal system against the president repeatedly so we should not continue to forfeit
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:31.920]  the entire legal system and all the remedies the legal system offers to the left we can't
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:36.640]  allow them to dominate that and monopolize that and so we need to take meaningful we need to
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:41.680]  start using the legal remedies that the court system and judicial system and jury system and our
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:47.440]  constitutional system affords us and we need to use utilize them we need to exercise our right
[1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:52.320]  that's why the important to report any degree of violence because these degrees of violence tend
[1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:57.200]  to escalate the way to think of it is is how Rudy Giuliani cleaned up new york city and took it
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:02.240]  from one of the most violent cities in the world to one of the least violent cities in the world
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:07.200]  how that came about was because they recognized that if you took action the moment somebody broke
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.800]  the law even if it seemed relatively minor like graffiti in the subway or jumping not paying the
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:17.520]  tokens and jumping the subway little things like that a broken windows in the neighborhood that's
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:22.080]  how the theory became known as the broken windows theory but what it was is once you tolerated any
[1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:27.440]  degree of criminality then what happened was the criminality didn't tend to de-escalate it escalated
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:31.840]  it got worse people realized oh if I get away with this I bet I can take it a step further and
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:36.480]  a step further and a step further and that's how you get to the place where somebody like Andy
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:44.160]  know a small asian-american vietnam his family were refugees from the communist regime of vietnam
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:49.680]  who's just a little reporter goes to a place like portland just to report on what's happening in
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:54.240]  portland and what and what happens to him he is physically assaulted repeatedly right there on
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.040]  camera in the presence of the police who do nothing at the time that is only coming about
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:04.240]  because people hadn't been taking action before this hadn't been taking action that preceded that
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:09.040]  point and that's why the problems continue to accelerate that's why the problems continue
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:13.840]  to uh let's go forward and unless people take action for example why did baggy havernon think
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:18.160]  she could get away with lying and libeling these kids why did others think they could get away with
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.800]  why did tactic griffin think she could get away with calling for doxing these kids why did all of
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:27.440]  this happen it happened because in the past they've never been sued well and let's be clear too about
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:32.000]  this because at a certain point you know you can understand you know the police officers they don't
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.680]  want to do the paperwork they don't want to go through the process they don't want to deal with
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:41.520]  this immaturity anyway but at a certain point you have to realize too every time someone comes up
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:46.080]  and knocks your trump hat off or spits at you for having it every time you go and file a police
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:51.840]  report that makes the police more inclined to do their job at the source so that they don't have
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:55.280]  to deal with the backlog and they don't have to deal with the paperwork or whatever so instead
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:59.920]  of saying okay this guy just got his hat knocked off i'm not gonna do anything and hopefully that's
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:04.800]  gonna be that no now the police are gonna know okay that person just got his hat knocked off
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:08.400]  they're gonna come at me i'm gonna have to do paperwork i'm gonna have to do a bunch of backlog
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:15.520]  or i can go arrest that individual right now exactly it's a use them or lose them when it comes
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:20.400]  to your rights and because people haven't been using them because they've taken a tolerant approach
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:24.880]  hope that it would not accelerate hope that it wouldn't get worse they've been indirectly
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:30.800]  and unintentionally incentivizing it and encouraging it and facilitating it and so for example so many
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:36.080]  people with the trump rallies in 2015 were subject to all kinds of verbal abuse then that accelerated
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:40.960]  into physical violence but many of them didn't do anything about it and because of that it just got
[1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:46.400]  worse and worse and worse and worse so or someone like andy know gets beat up on video while everybody
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:50.400]  watches it happen and the police don't do anything about it because they've been accustomed and
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:54.640]  conditioned to discarding it and disregarding it because the person who had been the victim in
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:59.920]  the past never followed through the number one thing police and prosecutors will act upon is
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:03.840]  someone they have confidence will follow through that's what was critically important for you to
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:08.880]  follow through in your case not only that it establishes a record of these other people these
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:13.600]  people are then put in the system that's when they look yeah yeah no no that's key i'm sorry just go
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:18.800]  on with that exactly because that way when the police look them up in the future then they realize
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.440]  okay this person has a history of doing this they've done it repeatedly in the past they've
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:28.320]  done it to this individual this set of individuals this fits a modus operandi and the number one
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:33.920]  thing police operate off of this criminal arrest arrest record or criminal police report record
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:37.520]  and that's when they they know how to filter and frame because what they know is they know if this
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:42.880]  person has had a prior report then that means they're a lot more likely to be worth their time
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:47.280]  to investigate because they know that person is posing a unique threat of continuing the bad
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:52.480]  behavior and even accelerating and escalating the violence of the behavior unless the police take
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:57.760]  action that's how they like the cops are used to ignoring domestic violence calls for a long time
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:02.480]  because often the person wouldn't follow through once a person followed through police would take
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:07.200]  it much more seriously be much more proactive and much more protective every americans got to
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:11.920]  start doing the same thing because if they don't that person may that they victimize them may
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:17.440]  victimize somebody else far worse so it's critical to take action assert and exercise your rights
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:21.600]  use them or lose them when it comes to your first amendment freedoms and that is critical and
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:25.920]  essential of every truck supporter in the country to start doing and that's what free america law
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.560]  center is all about the reason why free america law center started is to create a member okay okay
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:35.120]  you know what let's pause it right there because that's key the left has all these different groups
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:42.240]  funded by billionaires they the victims of these these whatever left want to cry about they don't
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:46.240]  have to pay their their for lawyers folks it's all paid for by billionaires conservatives don't
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:49.520]  have that we need to create that to fight back against us so let's talk about the importance
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:52.880]  of that and then i know the audience is going to want to know some of the details about how this

[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.840]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:09.840]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:13.840]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:17.680]  members of the public and the audience that care about this has to bring real social political
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:21.680]  economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:26.080]  become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century ran american
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:30.320]  politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:35.200]  the great depression the info war's audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:40.160]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:44.960]  promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working
[1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:48.960]  with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:53.120]  whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:59.600]  what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what we just saw the globalists are hyper
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:04.880]  competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats they are control freaks in their own
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:08.640]  words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions

[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:24.240]  neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies if i wasn't

[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:13.040]  so
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:24.560]  welcome back to the alex jones show owin stroyer robert barnes here with you
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:33.200]  we broke two exclusive stories one bob barnes drops new lawsuits against those that slandered
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:38.160]  the covington catholic kids the names include kathy griffin and former cnn reporters that
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:44.880]  exclusive can be found at info wars dot com in the last segment we just broke news the
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:52.640]  woman that came up to me at the women's march in dc and grabbed my genitals has been found guilty of
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:48:02.000]  sex abuse and that story is also at info wars dot com and so well first let's do this bob let me
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:05.360]  just kind of go through some of the details now there's some things i can't share about what
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:09.680]  happened here um but there are some things i can share that i think the audience would find
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:14.080]  interesting and probably yourself included one and i'm sure you've probably experienced similar
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:22.320]  things as a lawyer the legal interest if you will in this in this case as it was going down and
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:28.160]  literally as i was being grilled by the defense for my witness testimony there was a lot of interest
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:33.360]  and the courtroom uh let's just say had some intrigued ears and minds and eyes
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:40.240]  volunteering to pop in and and and observe what was going on and the other interesting thing is
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.400]  i won't go into all the details but you know they uh they the defense tried to pull a bunch of clips
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:52.640]  to make me look bad and politicize the thing which was crazy honestly i'm sitting there
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:56.880]  with the tape and everything she admits it and i'm sitting there and the defense is trying to
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:04.160]  politicize this whole thing and uh and again i won't get on to some of other details i'm trying
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:11.760]  to say only the things that that should be said here but basically the people that were watching
[1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:16.080]  in in the audience and other people that you know maybe didn't know who i was or about enforcers
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:20.400]  or stuff are hearing these things that i'm saying seeing the clips that they're playing and they're
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:27.600]  like like wide-eyed like oh my gosh like what is this stuff it's like i mean and it is shocking
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:31.040]  stuff i mean you know getting sexually assaulted i admit i say some crazy things on air but
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:35.760]  i have reasons i have logic behind them but so there's this whole weird thing of like
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:42.160]  it's like it's still to people like info wars is like not even in their purview and when they
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:47.360]  see it they're like oh my gosh this world exists like holy smokes like this is oh my gosh people
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:51.920]  actually say this stuff and so there was that aspect of it there was the aspect of it being
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:56.880]  politicized by the defense which had me worried but i'm glad this is the verdict that was reached
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:01.120]  but here's the problem bob and i think that you're highlighting this with this new legal group
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:10.880]  the left has the aclu uh the left has all these uh big funded groups and i can't even think of all
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:16.560]  the names i mean there's multiple legal groups they have and so oh you're guilty uh or oh you're
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:20.720]  a victim of this and you're a liberal progressive they rush and they get you an attorney they're
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:26.080]  paid for the conservative movement doesn't have that so all these conservatives that are getting
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:31.120]  assaulted and everything unless it becomes a big case like the covington catholic deal
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:37.280]  you just you just don't hear about it so so tell me though what is your what is your uh
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:43.760]  game plan here with this new legal group to kind of group fund crowd fund a source for
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:49.280]  conservatives trump supporters patriots they're they're a victim of whatever hate crime because
[1:50:49.280 --> 1:50:54.480]  whether their hat gets ripped off assaulted denied service whatever the case may be uh
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:59.200]  an option for them to go to now uh luckily my whole thing was caught on case and i could
[1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:04.720]  file a police report so i had uh you know uh prosecuting attorneys but sometimes it doesn't
[1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:10.720]  work like that and you need a legal team and now there's a source for people that are conservative
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:16.000]  Trump supporters and victims of what i think are political hate crimes oh exactly i mean the whole
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:20.960]  point of free america law center free america law center dot com the website where people can read
[1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:26.160]  and read about other cases they can read about uh they can get see videos they get other information
[1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:29.440]  and they can see what they want to do with it whether they want to join it's basically going
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:32.800]  to be up to them it's going to be up to the audience it's going to be up to the public
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:37.840]  to decide what kind of suits suits get brought and whether we can form a legal organization
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:42.480]  that can counterbalance what the southern poverty law center and the aclu and everyone
[1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:47.440]  is done for the left we need something that protects all americans protects patriots particularly
[1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:52.320]  against defamation particularly against deep platforming particularly again for deep state
[1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:57.120]  whistleblowers who expose corruption in government because of our legal system there's no effective
[1:51:57.120 --> 1:52:02.320]  means for lawyers to be affordable for most people when they are the victims of those things
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:07.360]  in an automobile accident or medical malpractice there's contingency lawyers but there really are
[1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:13.440]  no contingency lawyers in the deep platforming destination deep state whistleblowing uh role
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:17.520]  and so there needed to be a organization and the goal was not to have the organization
[1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:22.880]  dominated by just a few rich donors not have it run by a secret agenda of a couple of millionaires
[1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:28.560]  or governments or corporations or foreign corporations not to have it be a public government
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:33.680]  controlled irs regulated charity that could that could determine deny certain benefits
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:37.680]  so that they can litigate what needs to be litigated it's a limited liability company
[1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:42.640]  it's member driven it's a monthly subscription the monthly subscription amount of 17 dollars
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:46.960]  and 76 cents a month and the reason for that is to have something that's affordable and that's
[1:52:46.960 --> 1:52:52.080]  accessible so that we can make the legal system affordable and accessible for ordinary people of
[1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:56.160]  all political stripes so that they won't be subject to discrimination they won't be subject to
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:02.320]  discriminatory defamation discriminatory deep platforming discriminatory deep state whistleblower
[1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:06.480]  being attacked by the system there will be some remedy out there someplace they can go to the
[1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:11.040]  legal system and this includes using the freedom of information act this includes using the privacy
[1:53:11.040 --> 1:53:17.120]  act this includes uh moving to intervene in cases as to place in the epstein case and helped lead
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:22.160]  to epstein being put on the public profile for future prosecution being we can help facilitate
[1:53:22.160 --> 1:53:26.800]  that uh moving to enter intervene in other cases to promote certain policies that are not being
[1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:30.800]  promoted in the legal system because there's no voice for so many in there well that's exactly
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:37.360]  it and let's let's explain the greater philosophy here too because i mean folks look i've had to
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:44.800]  deal with a bunch of lawsuits uh bob barnes is well aware of this um and so i i mean we understand
[1:53:44.800 --> 1:53:52.560]  you know legal help is not cheap good legal help especially is expensive and you know i mean i i
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.200]  understand that i've seen this i have had to deal with it and so we could sit here and we do it's
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:54:02.080]  like hey look we need funding we're getting sued all day long new lawsuits trying to be filed against
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:06.800]  all they like i mean hell folks they tried to plant child porn on alex jones and and blame him for
[1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:10.720]  that i mean you can only imagine the stuff that goes down here you really just see the tip of the
[1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:16.960]  iceberg but my point is like so yeah we are so grateful to the info wars audience for going
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:21.520]  to info wars store dot com supporting this info wars store dot com so that when these lawsuits
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:27.440]  come in we can have a legal team ready to to to deal with it so that i don't have to sit here
[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:33.360]  and get bogged down and not be able to do my job but i understand most people don't have that luxury
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:39.280]  so that's why this is so key and so we understand the philosophy here is a rising tide raises all
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:44.000]  ships the info wars audience has lifted us to this point we want to go higher we want to keep
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:48.800]  raising that tide and part of that is this new legal group that we want to promote part of that
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:53.680]  is promoting other groups so that let's say that they destroy the ship of info wars well the tide
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:59.280]  is still up here now so if you launch another ship you're already up here and there's other ships at
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:03.760]  that sea level battling and so that's why we're promoting this stuff that's why your support
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:08.240]  at info wars store dot com is always key and that's why we bring up other groups to say hey look this
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:13.440]  is how we're fighting this is how it's a tide raising all ships uh but before we break another
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:19.760]  news story coming up in the next hour uh let's get your just legal take on my case with the lady
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:25.840]  that came up and grabbed my genitals bragged about it found guilty of sexual abuse um i mean seeing
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:31.920]  that and i mean look the verdict was great you can probably go through the uh legal analysis
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:37.120]  in your head about how we ended up with these charges and here instead of going after some other
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:44.240]  things uh with the verdict of guilty being the main goal here but i mean just analyze this
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:50.800]  from a legal perspective about where we're at right now in society and and what people have
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:56.240]  to do to get justice it shows the importance and relevance of it i mean it takes time out of your
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.360]  life you're subject to uh cross examination you're subject to having your life cross examine
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:05.040]  your cross your your life investigated into and this is part of the reason why a lot of people
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:10.000]  don't bring action why they don't seek out police i'm telling you the defense was relentless on me
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:15.760]  a lesser man would have cracked and and and and my uh you know the people that were on my team were
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:20.480]  like wow like you know that was brutal we're glad and i'm like look i have people coming up and
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:24.240]  spitting on me threatening my life doxing me this is like the least of my concerns but yeah it's
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:29.920]  brutal man oh absolutely and they they do that because it works so for example you look at all
[1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:34.400]  these in t-fact and you look at these other attacks on people in the defamation campaign
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:39.440]  like they've been trying to de-platform alex jones and info wars so that they can defame
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:44.160]  him with immunity and impunity because he's not able to defend himself in the court of public
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:48.800]  opinion because he's been de-platform and so these things work together big tech and big media are
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:54.080]  colluding with each other to be able to control the thought process of ordinary people to control
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:59.440]  what people see to control what people think to control what people say and we need to fight that
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:05.280]  and we can't we do have constitutional legal remedies to protect ordinary people and all
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:10.080]  americans against this onslaught and the point of free america law center is to be able to be an
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:16.000]  organization that we can join that we can subscribe to to make sure that it outlasts me it keeps going
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:22.080]  you know that it's beyond me it's outsized me and it supports independence and freedom and patriotism
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:27.280]  of all americans so that free speech can remain free free press can remain free americans can
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:32.880]  maintain their liberty because unless we get we have to reinstate you know the answer to 1984
[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:38.160]  is 1776 that's what the free america law center about i think that's what alex jones and info
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:45.360]  wars is about and we got to restore 1776 now today here and that's what the coveted case is all about
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:50.960]  that's what free america law center is before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan
[1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:55.840]  of alex jones and info wars dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:01.360]  product that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:05.840]  dna force plus now i remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special
[1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:11.920]  guests tele mirrors and tele mirror support with your dna and so i started to look into the science
[1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:18.320]  and what tele mirrors were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:24.560]  tele mirrors so i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:29.520]  supplement and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:36.400]  tele mirror support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite
[1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:41.760]  supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:49.680]  should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com there are thousands of
[1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:55.120]  ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:59:00.960]  info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are obsessed
[1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:06.080]  with it trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance
[1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:11.280]  americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and
[1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:16.560]  behold it's super popular like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it

[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:42.560]  and the whole info wars family i want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you
[1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:50.560]  info wars is nothing you are the info war and i salute you
[1:59:51.120 --> 2:00:02.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:08.560]  all right
[2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:15.760]  welcome back to the alex joneshow oh and shroyer sitting in for alex today we do have more from alex
[2:00:15.760 --> 2:00:23.680]  jones coming up this hour nick begger's gonna host the fourth hour time is flying today i got a
[2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:27.760]  bunch of news i i'm gonna get to i got video clips i want to get to that are more important than this
[2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:33.760]  but this i just got to see because it really just sometimes it's the old kiss method keep it simple
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:40.480]  stupid and so sometimes the most powerful hard hitting clips or or statements or whatever are just
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:48.880]  simple blunt frank short statements that just hit the nail on the head and nothing more needs to be
[2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:55.200]  said and so here uh here you have uh charles barkley who's uh one to share his opinion
[2:00:55.200 --> 2:01:02.560]  in here is charles barkley um talking about black people voting democrat
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.880]  now i believe you've been pretty outspoken about democratic party
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:12.720]  sort of neglecting black voters right no taking black folks with ram's right and what do you feel
[2:01:12.720 --> 2:01:17.840]  like it's different this summer i do not i know i think all politicians take black folks with
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:22.800]  ram's they talk to black folks over four years and that's what i did how they go make our lives
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:28.720]  better and they do nothing about it and both parties something in that aspect and that is not
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:34.400]  a republican or a democrat thing it's not a liberal or conservative thing it's an economic thing
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:40.240]  economic opportunity uh and that's what both parties have been neglecting especially the
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:45.360]  democratic party because every black person i know has always voted democratic and with the
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:51.040]  certain a few guys who can place force all the people still for them so that's really the clip
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:57.600]  right there every black person i know votes democrat and they're still poor now obviously
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:04.880]  i i think take that with a a grain of salt perhaps and some blurred lines but but the point is
[2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:11.760]  and yeah i mean look i'm no republican i don't like either party but here's the thing and i wish that
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:17.840]  charles and others would give trump credit and it's not even about black communities it's just a
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:21.600]  fact that trump has helped black communities i mean trump is helping all american communities but
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:26.000]  if you want to sit here and highlight one sector the other i mean yeah unemployment record low that
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:32.160]  means black unemployment record low and it will be even lower if we can bring jobs back to these
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:36.240]  inner cities that have been shipped over to china and other countries for cheap labor and manufacturing
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:41.600]  because you know in america you pay a living wage here china you pay a bag of rice
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:50.640]  but you see that's why they shipped all the jobs away and so i wish a charles would give trump credit
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:55.200]  for being the only politician to actually do something for these communities but what is
[2:02:55.200 --> 2:03:00.160]  the highlight what is the takeaway what does he say every black person i know has always
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:05.760]  voted democrat and still poor what does that mean black people have been indoctrinated by democrats
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:13.280]  democrats have sold them a victimhood status sold them a bill of goods about identity politics and
[2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:20.400]  who's out to get them and who's not which is all just politics and then what happens when the
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:26.480]  rubber meets the road what happens in the real world what happens socio economically nothing
[2:03:27.440 --> 2:03:30.480]  and so that's what charles barkley is saying here but when are people going to take the next
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:37.120]  step now they already are and you can again if you want to just sit here and talk about one
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:43.520]  identity group of people and talk about black people if black people have always voted democrat
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:51.920]  for let's say 30 years that trend is changing you can't find groups of black people going to
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:57.920]  democrat events doing viral videos wearing democrat hats celebrating democrat candidates
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:02.960]  and democrat policies you won't find it but you will find thousands of black people
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:06.640]  celebrating trump you will find thousands of black people wearing trump hats you will find
[2:04:06.640 --> 2:04:11.280]  thousands of black people doing viral videos going out talking about conservative policies
[2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:15.840]  talking about trump policies talking about the real issues doing things in their community
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:22.320]  and so that's the difference and i understand if you don't like the republican party fine
[2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:29.440]  i understand if you hate politics fine let's talk about results throw away all your political buzzwords
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:35.040]  and talk about results donald trump is getting results for the american worker the democrats
[2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:42.080]  have been making promises for 30 years and never delivered never trump is actually delivering
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:47.680]  say whatever you want his policies are delivering and they could deliver even more if america would
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:52.160]  get behind him but the damn democrats what are they doing again they're keeping the black man
[2:04:52.160 --> 2:05:00.560]  down just like the democrats always have it's never been easy to figure out the essentials

[2:06:56.480 --> 2:07:04.080]  market share i guess because most men have beards now that they need to target the young millennial

[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:59.600]  uh myself uh every once while david night and then we had some other reporters that
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:05.840]  have that have passed now uh i mean gone on to their places and so i just look at everything

[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:18.960]  and it was all built off of the audience we didn't get big billionaire donors we don't

[2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:57.360]  dash night dash show
[2:19:59.040 --> 2:20:05.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:05.360 --> 2:20:18.080]  from the front lines of the information war it's owin shroyer you're listening to the alex jones
[2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:24.320]  show ladies and gentlemen there's a lot of important news i need to get to here and i plan on getting
[2:20:24.320 --> 2:20:28.640]  to it before i hand over the rands of the alex jones show to nick veggage but here's the deal
[2:20:29.760 --> 2:20:34.480]  if we don't promote our own stuff and our own ideas that are unique in the media
[2:20:34.480 --> 2:20:40.720]  no one else will so you've heard alex jones with his expertise on the jeffrey eppstein story and
[2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:46.640]  the transhumanism and him wanting to cede the human population and the pedophile island and all of
[2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:51.840]  it that he's been covering and studying for decades you're only going to get that here
[2:20:52.560 --> 2:20:57.840]  we then gave you the exclusive with bob barnes the new covington catholic lawsuit against
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:03.840]  kathy griffin and other liberals out there we just gave you the exclusive the woman that sexually
[2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:12.080]  assaulted me at the women's march found guilty of sexual abuse all these stories are at info wars
[2:21:12.080 --> 2:21:16.240]  dot com only so yes there is other important news the good news is info wars has broken the
[2:21:16.240 --> 2:21:21.280]  dam for news coverage so most of the other stuff people will probably get to like kamala harris
[2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:27.920]  just had california scrub her arrests legal record because talsy gabber destroyed her
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:32.320]  and it's all true about kamala harris so they scrubbed it from the record so we'll get to all
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:40.000]  that but here's the latest exclusive this is now the next most banned video i did a promo video
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:44.320]  because we don't do it enough here and we really should promote ourselves it's just we're so busy
[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:47.920]  and we're literally living and existing in the future we don't ever go back and dwell on the
[2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:53.440]  past about stuff we've done stuff we've said but i put together a promo video finally for
[2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:58.640]  the show i host here at info wars the war room thanks to your support building info wars and alex's
[2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:04.880]  vision so i finally put a promo together just all the crazy stuff that we've done uh me going on

[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:14.960]  on our ppx microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:19.120]  off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:23.200]  right on the east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our
[2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:27.840]  inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd
[2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:32.160]  offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:37.520]  waters backstory so here's what you should do right now check out the ppx microgrid system at my own

[2:29:56.000 --> 2:30:01.920]  before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and in force dot com but
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:07.280]  also the products at info store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info store dot com
[2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:12.800]  that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when alex first
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:18.080]  started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:23.520]  with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can
[2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:29.520]  improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force
[2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:35.680]  plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other
[2:30:35.680 --> 2:30:41.520]  competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[2:30:41.520 --> 2:30:48.080]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is
[2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:54.320]  on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus
[2:30:54.320 --> 2:31:00.480]  at infowar store dot com alex yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180
[2:31:00.480 --> 2:31:04.880]  dollars so far this year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store
[2:31:04.880 --> 2:31:07.680]  because i mean i don't want to get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people
[2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:11.600]  are going to donate it to causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm
[2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:16.160]  getting quality products the products that i do for steve have changed my life i mean the x2 has
[2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:20.800]  really done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i made my kid they use
[2:31:20.800 --> 2:31:25.680]  the toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it
[2:31:25.680 --> 2:31:29.760]  and it gets rid of his sore throat uh well let me break this down for you i want high quality
[2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:34.480]  stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys
[2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:38.640]  when it's 50 off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing
[2:31:38.640 --> 2:31:42.960]  like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[2:31:42.960 --> 2:31:47.520]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're
[2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:52.080]  already getting 10% off because you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something
[2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:57.200]  like that uh we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support last night
[2:31:57.200 --> 2:32:04.480]  i'm on info wars dot com and i read chris pratt criticized for t-shirt choice it is literally the
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:09.520]  shirt that i envisioned a betsy ross but also another just classic american flag all 50 stars
[2:32:09.520 --> 2:32:15.520]  with the gads and snake super imposed over and on the back america's back info wars dot com but
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:19.360]  what's better than just an american flag about a don't tread on me under the flag saying don't
[2:32:19.360 --> 2:32:22.720]  trail the american flag it's a perfect combo so great minds think alike i mean whoever designed
[2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:27.440]  that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar design it is the don't tread on me
[2:32:27.440 --> 2:32:33.600]  american flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by chris pratt let it
[2:32:33.600 --> 2:32:37.680]  say you know battle tattered flag like the one that flew over for something and again on the back
[2:32:37.680 --> 2:32:44.880]  it says america's back info wars dot com four thousand of these babies and that's it so we've
[2:32:44.880 --> 2:32:49.680]  got the betsy ross version and the american flag version at info wars store dot com be
[2:32:49.680 --> 2:32:54.240]  imprinted in the usa right now info wars store dot com they'll be right back the most banned

[2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:02.880]  history to manipulate public perception kamala harris is a dirt bag and i'm being kind
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:13.440]  you know kamala harris is one that stirs that that that nausea that that just any goodness in your
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:19.360]  soul just churns when you see a kamala harris that is just pure evil but here's what it is she's a
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:25.520]  she's a descendant of slave owners so she has that domination i own you mentality i mean you can see
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:33.600]  it but talsy gabard calls her out on her history in california arresting people for smoking marijuana
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:37.680]  while she laughs about smoking marijuana which he probably lied about she said she used to smoke
[2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:44.080]  marijuana listen to snoop dog before snoop dog ever made now so she's a liar on top of it but
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:51.920]  talsy gabard calls her out on her arrest record history when she was the attorney general california
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:58.960]  and so what did the state of california do they removed the reports to protect kamala harris

[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:11.520]  unbelievable but it's fine kamala harris has no choice they can try to put makeup on an arrogant
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:16.720]  pig all day like they did with hillary clinton it's not going to work talsy gabard will defeat
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:24.720]  kamala harris despite the fact the media is all on kamala harris's side but the fact that they've
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:29.920]  removed the arrest records from kamala harris's years in california it just shows you she was
[2:36:29.920 --> 2:36:39.680]  engaged in such illicit behavior such sorted behavior potentially criminal let's move on
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:44.400]  alex jones broke down the jeffrey eppstein stuff this is a headline from years ago cfr
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:50.400]  trilateral pedophile jeffrey eppstein's corporate philanthropy tied to trans humanist neo eugenics
[2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:58.000]  from the intrepid report dot com in 2015 it's all coming out jeffrey eppstein hoped to seed human
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:07.600]  race with his dna in a post human world twitter suspends accounts using hashtag demand voter
[2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:12.640]  id yeah because you see it's all about russian interference it's all about voter integrity
[2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:18.160]  it's all about election integrity until the democrats want to cheat then it's all good
[2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:27.200]  then it's all legal but yeah protect election integrity but no voter id i can't go by a beer
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:34.720]  i've got a full beard i've got sadly some gray hairs in my beard i'm a 30 year old man i can't
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:43.440]  buy a bud light without showing id but if i want to go vote no id necessary because that's racist
[2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:49.280]  in fact oh my gosh maybe that's what we do now i'm gonna go to a bar and i'm gonna order a bud
[2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:55.280]  light and when they ask for my id i'm gonna say how dare you racist how dare you id me do you
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:38:05.920]  know how racist that is to id me for a bud light soros dumps five million plus into 2020 super pack
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:12.240]  largest check any mega donor has given so far that is a drop in the bucket for george soros
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:20.560]  he's just getting started soros spent seven million in district attorney races uh in the
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:28.960]  last cycle this guy has billions and billions and billions of stolen money and he funds all
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:38.480]  of his leftist anti-human agenda with it and it's all exposed lock her up chance break out at
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:43.360]  trump rally oh but it doesn't matter look donald trump is doing a great job but man i'll tell you
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:49.760]  they'll reverse all the stuff he did economically and everything and the pc stuff the media will
[2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:54.640]  try to trump that once he's out of office but man i just want the president to understand
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:39:02.160]  we're tuned in to the consciousness of america here at info wars more than any other news outlet
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:09.680]  because we are the consciousness of america if donald trump leaves the office whether it be in
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:17.280]  2020 or 2024 if donald trump leaves the office and hillary clinton at least is not in jail
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:23.600]  well the entire presidency will be a failure and again i understand all the economics assess
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:28.800]  the jobs numbers everything for culture for america for nationalism worldwide i'm not denying
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:34.960]  how incredible donald trump has been his president i'm simply saying if these high crimes that we
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:41.680]  know komi and clinton and obama and and their gang are guilty of if they go unpunished none of it
[2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:47.040]  matters because we still don't have a country and we still don't have a justice system but we
[2:39:47.040 --> 2:39:56.880]  wait and see as the democrats begin impeachment inquiries into trump just pathetic they all the
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:01.520]  whole any democrat that wants trump impeach should probably be investigated immediately
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:06.640]  manhattan da subpoenas trump organization over stormy daniel's hush money oh yeah you know and
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:13.280]  again trump look at what they're doing to you and he said it but do it he said oh what if we
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:18.480]  looked into obama what if we looked in the clinton foundation know what if do it do it
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:25.600]  these people would have you killed if they could and you're not even gonna have a simple
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:31.760]  investigation to expose all the crimes that they've done they would pull the trigger on your head
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:41.840]  tomorrow president trump and they might do it he needs to understand there are there is no quarter
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:47.120]  with the hillary clinton's of the world there is no quarter with these people they were good oh my
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:54.800]  gosh i see i don't even want to get into this because it's so next level it's almost impossible
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:41:00.960]  to break down but folks they were going to eliminate the human race do you understand that
[2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:07.600]  do you understand that do you understand the georgia guide stones do you understand jeff
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:13.040]  reeptine wanting to cede the human race do you understand the fema camps
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:30.240]  uh man new york city man beaten by gang of teens for wearing magahat youtube supporters had eggs
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:34.720]  and drinks thrown at them for wearing a magahat antifa publicly organizing terror attacks on
[2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:45.120]  ice facilities in texas oh but oh but what is the fbi doing congress says hey look fbi antifa is
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:51.600]  committing terrorism acts of terrorism on film damaging property threatening government facilities
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:59.440]  will you please label them a terrorist group the fbi says no thanks but if you follow qanon or you
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:04.880]  tweeted pizza gate or you're a conspiracy theorist you're now a domestic terrorist and in fact guess
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:08.400]  what in all the stories including i believe in this yahoo story it's all about alex jones
[2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:16.960]  jones said sandy hook was this jones said pizza game with this and it's not even accurate i'm reading
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:23.120]  this i'm not even alex jones and i'm reading this like you liars we didn't start pizza gate
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:32.000]  we didn't start qanon and all the conspiracy theories that info was reported on all came
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:37.520]  true the fluoride in the water lowers your IQ the atrazine in the water is causing frogs to turn
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:43.680]  gay jeffrey etstein was an fbi informant pedophile blackmail child sex trafficker you called it all
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:50.000]  a conspiracy theory it was all right obama spied on trump conspiracy theory no that was accurate
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:54.640]  but now you're a domestic terrorist if you're just an american patriot that knows the truth
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:43:00.240]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna
[2:43:00.240 --> 2:43:04.080]  kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:08.240]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:12.080]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:16.160]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:19.360]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy us supplements because they know how great they are
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:24.240]  and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones shells unapproved
[2:43:24.240 --> 2:43:30.720]  supplements he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:34.720]  supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then
[2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:39.040]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:42.960]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:47.360]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:54.000]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:44:00.160]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:05.520]  that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:09.840]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:14.160]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:19.760]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:24.000]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:28.880]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:33.440]  wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:38.160]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the
[2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:42.880]  person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:47.760]  the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:51.760]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming

[2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:41.040]  in god we trust you know i got new to get through but this quarter
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:45.040]  just happens to be sitting on the desk here i don't even know why
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:58.160]  why and i picked it up and it says in god we trust and you know alex is probably listening
[2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:02.880]  right now and i know sometimes he gets frustrated with me because uh he wishes i was just more
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:08.640]  hardcore at self promotion and i'm just so focused like he said i'm just so focused on news and
[2:48:08.640 --> 2:48:15.120]  aggregation and like futures like a sports freak but for politics that i just don't i do no self
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:21.600]  promotion and the reason why is because in god i trust you know i figured out a long time ago
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:30.320]  well not too long ago but figured out a long time ago that yeah you can have plans you can have
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:39.280]  all kinds of ornate plans but god already has plans and god's plans are the real plan and the
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:45.360]  quicker you figure that out the quicker you'll find your destiny but they'll probably take in god we

[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:59.200]  joneshow alex jones breaking down the epstein connection trilateral commission transhumanism
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:06.320]  eugenics program and his expertise from studying this and reporting on this for decades we had
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:13.360]  an exclusive from bob barnes he has just filed another lawsuit against those in the media that
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:21.200]  targeted the covington catholic boys i dropped the news on the women the woman that came up and
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:28.160]  grabbed my genitals at the women's march the verdict has been filed she's guilty and then of
[2:50:28.160 --> 2:50:33.200]  course we aired now what is the most banned info wars promo video on the internet we aired that as
[2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:38.400]  well so it's been a loaded broadcast and i'm going to do my best here in the last seven minutes
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:45.440]  before nick baggage takes over for the fourth hour to bring you the rest of these headlines i
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:52.960]  want to give a shout out i've i've explained this before but i'm a student of media i'm a student
[2:50:52.960 --> 2:51:01.760]  of politics and and quite frankly i spend about nine or so hours a day in the classroom and my
[2:51:01.760 --> 2:51:06.320]  teachers that i go to i've talked about this before uh i'm not saying i agree with everything
[2:51:06.320 --> 2:51:10.720]  or they're the go-to sources for me is rush limbaugh michael savage alex jones it's been that
[2:51:10.720 --> 2:51:16.080]  way for about four years of my life and so i want to give a shout out to michael savage who has been
[2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:22.000]  a guest on the alex jones show a friend of the alex jones show a kindred spirit in censorship
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:29.520]  michael savage asks boris johnson to lift 10-year ban from his travel ban to europe
[2:51:30.880 --> 2:51:35.760]  so michael savage is also blacklisted from mainstream news just like alex jones's so
[2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:41.280]  they're kindred spirits in that they're kindred spirits in their unrelenting fight for for truth
[2:51:41.280 --> 2:51:48.000]  and and for america so uh i'd actually love to get michael savage back on with alex jones to
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:52.480]  talk about this i think he should maybe even reach out to savages people guys to get him on with
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:57.120]  alex next week because this is a powerful thing and and quite frankly i because i follow it i'm
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:52:01.840]  telling i'm a student of the media savage and jones are the only places really giving tommy
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:07.920]  robinson a fair platform to to talk about his target uh the target on his back in england so
[2:52:09.760 --> 2:52:15.520]  i'd love to see the these audiences converge to make more things happen
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:21.520]  conservatives don't do that enough they're just so focused on the truth and awakening the public
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:28.080]  uh but let's go on about a quarter of large us newspapers laid off staff in 2018 what's the
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:36.000]  headline what's the story the old stream media is dying the fake mainstream news approach is old

[2:52:42.240 --> 2:52:47.840]  make it in the new media you have to know context and background and history to make it in the new
[2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:56.240]  media you have to understand trends to make it in the new media and the old guard media the old

[2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:45.280]  all you've done from the bottom of my heart info wars the most banned network in the world
[2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:52.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:52.320 --> 3:00:12.880]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggages you're listening to the alex jones
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:29.200]  show and we're here on a friday afternoon again broadcasting from austin and me and an anchorage
[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:34.880]  alaska i just i love the ability to connect in this way i mean it's pretty incredible what you
[3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:40.080]  can do with technologies and we're going to talk about technology today we're going to talk about
[3:00:40.080 --> 3:00:45.680]  some of the things that started my work in in the public years ago uh am i interested in
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:53.360]  effects on human consciousness in the minds we're going to get into that and before i do i want to
[3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:57.040]  kind of talk about you know i was listening to owin last hour and he was talking about you know
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:04.080]  sort of how the network uh began and and the reliance on listeners and i want to mention that
[3:01:04.080 --> 3:01:11.120]  because that is critical you know when i started now over 25 years ago my basic premise was the
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:16.240]  field and support me in terms of what i was doing then it probably wasn't worth doing and i had a
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:20.400]  juncture you know in the very beginning also you know where i could have gone to
[3:01:20.960 --> 3:01:25.120]  traditional grant sources to advocate for the issues that were important to me
[3:01:25.760 --> 3:01:32.080]  the problem is those sources always then demand something you know they you always end up compromising
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:37.440]  and i and i didn't want to do that so what i did um is similar to what alex did and and this is why
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:43.120]  people knew to support this network is we did it one person at a time and and i published a book
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:48.240]  and i figured well people value the information they would buy the book that would allow me to
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:52.720]  continue to research and write and do the things that were important to me and the same is true
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:58.880]  with this network input wars you basically support it that determines whether this broadcast
[3:01:58.880 --> 3:02:04.080]  continues and really that's the measure you know if the information is useful if it's good if it's
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:10.400]  meaningful um then it's valued and and people register their value by uh voting uh with their
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:15.360]  economics and i appreciated alex appreciates that this network appreciates and everybody involved
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:21.760]  in getting information to you so having said all of that i want to talk about the foundation of
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:29.360]  where i began which began which was the issue of mind effects and and looking at sort of the
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:36.560]  propaganda wars listening to how media is shaped today and basically it's it's not about just
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:43.600]  delivering information and gathering facts and collecting information then and then reporting
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:50.080]  on a story now it's about creating the news creating the story what is now called the narrative
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:03:00.320]  which is really kind of a nice word for propaganda and bs period because the narrative
[3:03:00.880 --> 3:03:06.320]  is the way in which culture is shaped and the way in which populations can be easily manipulated
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:13.520]  one of the things discovered early on in the science was that the mind of human beings was
[3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:20.800]  incredibly powerful if it could focus its attention and hold it for a period of time you could actually
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:28.720]  create more effectively the effects of what happens in the world around us and the basic idea of
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:33.600]  quantum physics the idea is behind quantum physics the idea that the observer creates
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:41.600]  the reality is something that science shows us but when you can get a person to hold the thought
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:48.480]  for a for a million seconds try it you can't do it right you can't do it because as soon as you
[3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:54.800]  try to hold a thought your mind drifts you can't focus but imagine if you could take a million
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:04:01.200]  people and hold a thought for one second or two seconds or five seconds even the compound effect
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:07.600]  is just as if one person had done it so it's cumulative reality creation which is why the
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:12.480]  media and the control of the media becomes so powerful because as you shape the narrative
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:19.200]  you change the focus you create the reality and then things change around us this is the foundation
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:25.120]  of mind effects consciousness manipulation we're going to cover this over the next hour
[3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:32.320]  and get into this topic the foundation of mind control and how the narrative is shaped by the
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:39.760]  media and we must choose to reshape the reality in front of us in the 21st century or be manipulated
[3:04:39.760 --> 3:04:44.640]  by the reality fostered on us this is dr. nick faggots you're listening to the info wars and
[3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:48.880]  we'll be right back after these brief messages
[3:04:54.720 --> 3:04:58.800]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies
[3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:03.200]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:07.600]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges
[3:05:07.600 --> 3:05:11.440]  the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members
[3:05:11.440 --> 3:05:15.600]  of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic
[3:05:15.600 --> 3:05:19.440]  consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:24.000]  big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:28.480]  ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression
[3:05:28.480 --> 3:05:33.840]  the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world to make
[3:05:33.840 --> 3:05:38.480]  real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent
[3:05:38.480 --> 3:05:42.960]  free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[3:05:42.960 --> 3:05:47.280]  to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling
[3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:51.280]  us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw
[3:05:51.280 --> 3:06:02.080]  isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[3:06:04.800 --> 3:06:10.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show with nick baggage
[3:06:10.560 --> 3:06:20.240]  and welcome back to info wars info wars dot com and i appreciate being here on this
[3:06:21.040 --> 3:06:27.840]  friday august uh second 2019 and you know a lot of things you know when you think about
[3:06:27.840 --> 3:06:33.440]  media push and just before the break i was talking about how the cumulative effect of
[3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:38.960]  consciousness actually begins to shape reality now when you think about the internet and modern
[3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:46.080]  technology and how it links literally billions of minds through the internet and millions at a time
[3:06:46.080 --> 3:06:54.320]  potentially through uh media feeds unfortunately the cnn's aren't getting very much read these days
[3:06:54.320 --> 3:07:01.360]  because when you can compile all of those uh conscious thoughts you then begin to shape
[3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:07.120]  reality and you think about how media works and how everyone is connected to the digital realities
[3:07:07.120 --> 3:07:13.120]  these days in terms of how they interface with the news interface with each other it's all fed in
[3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:19.680]  and then information is collected from all of these various devices that then gives a better
[3:07:19.680 --> 3:07:25.360]  profile and view of an individual that allows a higher level of manipulation this is the simplest
[3:07:25.360 --> 3:07:32.000]  form this is what was utilized in in brexit what was utilized in trump's campaign the the
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:39.200]  management manipulation of big data but what's not generally known is this is done every day
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:45.040]  in every way so to speak by the big commercial interest the google's the amazon's the facebook's
[3:07:45.040 --> 3:07:51.360]  the data collectors and then transferring through their alliance uh with government that data so
[3:07:51.360 --> 3:07:55.280]  the government can take and manipulate that information even further and when you think
[3:07:55.280 --> 3:08:01.840]  about media then restricting and constraining the voice of people including this voice and this
[3:08:01.840 --> 3:08:09.360]  network's voice this is a fundamental problem uh in a free society or theoretically a free society
[3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:16.240]  and and you know words um are part of the shuffle in terms of the mind effects mind control some
[3:08:16.240 --> 3:08:21.680]  simple things you know i mean when you think about what republicans did uh to sort of break up the
[3:08:21.680 --> 3:08:27.680]  democrats um in terms of how they view themselves democrats a democratic party it used to be called
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:33.600]  then it called a democrat party the democrat party because that's a abrupt ending it kind of chops
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:38.880]  it off it makes you have a negative connotation that was deliberate when you think about bribery
[3:08:38.880 --> 3:08:43.840]  you know you get visions in your head of deliberate things you know bag full of money
[3:08:45.440 --> 3:08:52.160]  but in in america we think about uh campaign reform to take care of bribery so we created
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:58.800]  committees and rules and regulations so that we could funnel the money in with a chain of events
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:05.200]  you know but what's the difference um we just gave it a new name feels good oh committee rules
[3:09:05.200 --> 3:09:10.960]  regulations great now everything's good right wrong you you're just substituting different
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:17.840]  words for the same effect because the effect is access influence and outcomes that's what bribery
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:23.040]  gets you that's what campaign contributions on a big scale get you that's what packs get you that's
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:30.160]  what lobbyists get you and what that ends up getting all of us is a crummy uh patchwork quilt
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:37.200]  of rags as public policy because it's built upon special interests and then built upon the manipulation
[3:09:37.200 --> 3:09:44.720]  of the population to go along with the the theme the program the programming because television
[3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:51.440]  and media isn't about watching the program it's about receiving it um this is what uh most listeners
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:59.520]  observers uh don't uh do is pay attention to the details and what's being fed in um foundation of
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:06.480]  basic mind control but i want to go back in time and history a bit and i want to also qualify
[3:10:06.480 --> 3:10:13.040]  for how the government overlay fits into this and and by way of a background you know my my dad was a
[3:10:13.040 --> 3:10:18.000]  state senator he was later a u.s congressman he disappeared on a plane with hail bogs and i'm
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:25.600]  going to touch on that segment um and then my younger brother mark he became a mayor and assemblyman
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:32.880]  and then later a u.s senator and then my brother tom he was and is currently a state senator um and
[3:10:32.880 --> 3:10:37.120]  around a bunch of campaigns done a lot of work and and i've done a lot of work internationally
[3:10:37.120 --> 3:10:43.040]  nationally locally but you get a sense of government and what government is really all about and and
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:50.800]  so much of it today is about focus groups polling and spin and manipulation to get an outcome and
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:56.800]  really doesn't have much to do with governance um and doesn't have much to do with creating a um
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:04.880]  a better vision you know for this country uh so much of it is bs and propaganda based on polling
[3:11:04.880 --> 3:11:10.720]  and spin uh rather than what people really honestly believe we saw it in the debates recently i mean
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:17.920]  didn't ask for a better group of uh a thousand sound bites right i mean and that is part of it
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:25.280]  but let's go back um in time uh in history and talk about what was happening um back
[3:11:26.160 --> 3:11:33.520]  going back even in the 1920s 30s 40s and hypnotherapy the the labs at uh harvard um under
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:38.480]  a guy named ester brooks who did a lot of research there you can look him up library congress you'll
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:44.160]  see some of this publications pretty interesting guy but he was involved in the cia experiments um
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:51.120]  and some of the work in the cia which which the work cia included things like uh experimenting
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:57.360]  with lsd and hallucinogenics um a lot of things that today we would consider pretty repugnant
[3:11:57.360 --> 3:12:03.840]  and yet they repeated sort of similar uh themes just a sort of export of the torture tour you know
[3:12:03.840 --> 3:12:08.480]  when they shuffled it around and outsourced a bunch of other countries but what people forget
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:13.280]  is the cia abuses were happening then and they kind of revisit they show up every you know a
[3:12:13.280 --> 3:12:18.320]  couple of decades when you're reminded about the abuses but the players now this is interesting
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:24.240]  the players sort of remain the same you know ester brooks um when you look at what he was doing
[3:12:24.240 --> 3:12:31.520]  um by the time the 60s hit you know there's a lot going on um mk alters in full swing these
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:38.480]  were the mind control experiments with the cia and 140 plus sub projects huge amount of research
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:43.520]  being spent on how to manipulate the human brain that the same was spent by china russia
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:50.240]  israel and many others to figure out and we manipulate human beings and most people think
[3:12:50.240 --> 3:12:56.800]  about things like the manchurian candidate this kind of thing but there was an abuse that many
[3:12:56.800 --> 3:13:03.840]  people have forgotten and it was frankholtz who was in the early 50s did did work in biological
[3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:10.880]  agents after world war two in interrogations all over europe and these were brutal interrogations
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:16.800]  which include hallucinogenics drugs all kinds of things now we never got the full story but i'm
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:23.360]  sure it dwarfed the waterboarding stories of uh of this century but the fact is it was going on
[3:13:23.360 --> 3:13:29.760]  then now olsen he wanted to resign and he told his family wanted to resign and unfortunately
[3:13:30.880 --> 3:13:38.400]  nine days before he died back in 1953 he was given lsd by the central intelligence agency
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:44.400]  and then nine days later pushed out of a 13 floor building in new york uh where he died
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:51.600]  um it took decades for his family to get any sense of relief and that happened in 19 in the early
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:58.720]  1970s and this is where the story gets a little twisted because the guys who settled the frank
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:06.160]  olsen cia dispute who came up with the settlement cashed or shut up the family because they were
[3:14:06.160 --> 3:14:11.600]  so worried about what a lawsuit would draw out of the cia that the church committee wasn't going
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:17.120]  to find or anybody else wasn't going to find because it was so hidden so deep but they would find it
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:26.400]  perhaps and that was dick cheney and his buddy mr rumsfeld uh when they were working uh in the
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:31.600]  fort administration let me tell you how the fort administration happened so many people forget this
[3:14:32.320 --> 3:14:38.720]  and this is the real story right because what happened richard nixon and agnew
[3:14:38.720 --> 3:14:46.400]  you were in deep trouble right watergated broken agnew was nailed for bribery you know bribery
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:52.560]  before we formed the committees you know when it was still in brown paper bags and then out of all
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:59.680]  of the watergate we formed the committees the committees to keep america safe again from the corrupt
[3:14:59.680 --> 3:15:09.680]  jerks who strangled us right i mean so this is the story so what happens um richard nixon
[3:15:09.680 --> 3:15:15.280]  uh well first of all you get richard nixon to resign right but it happened in a sequence of
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:25.440]  events agnew's thrown out ford is appointed ford uh is the vp nixon resigns ford moves up the
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:33.840]  part is nixon and guess what america never gets the truth the truth that americans deserve from
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:39.200]  then and the cloud that hangs over this country today this is dr nick vegas you're listening

[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:58.720]  everybody else down before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones
[3:18:58.720 --> 3:19:03.520]  and enforce dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product
[3:19:03.520 --> 3:19:08.640]  that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna
[3:19:08.640 --> 3:19:13.440]  force plus now i remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[3:19:13.440 --> 3:19:19.120]  telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what
[3:19:19.120 --> 3:19:25.760]  telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomere so
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:32.160]  i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement
[3:19:32.160 --> 3:19:37.840]  and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support
[3:19:37.840 --> 3:19:44.480]  and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get
[3:19:44.480 --> 3:19:49.520]  excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage
[3:19:49.520 --> 3:20:10.480]  of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:10.480 --> 3:20:22.000]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind with nick baggage
[3:20:24.960 --> 3:20:33.120]  and welcome back to the alex uh jones show and you know um here at info wars uh we we're always
[3:20:33.120 --> 3:20:40.640]  involved in a lot of things i always forget to give my my website it's earth pulse dot com e a r t h p u l s e
[3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:47.040]  earth pulse dot com but all the books and videos are available at the info wars store uh
[3:20:47.040 --> 3:20:52.160]  dot com and i prefer that you get them there that way we get the three you get good information
[3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:56.960]  you help me and you also help the network so i prefer that you do that so look at the info
[3:20:56.960 --> 3:21:01.920]  wars store but for articles and information about the subject we're covering today uh
[3:21:01.920 --> 3:21:08.160]  it's earth pulse dot com and the book most closely aligned with today's topic is controlling the
[3:21:08.160 --> 3:21:14.800]  human mind available at the info wars store but you know um when i think about uh where we were
[3:21:14.800 --> 3:21:21.520]  before the break sort of the the things that were happening in the during the watergate era um and and
[3:21:21.520 --> 3:21:28.400]  even before you know one of the reasons that olson was was murdered was murdered basically by the cia
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:34.720]  was because he was reporting uh and he was getting angry and he was getting ready to pull out of the
[3:21:34.720 --> 3:21:40.720]  of this of the cia's programs because they were doing these brutal interrogations even resulting
[3:21:40.720 --> 3:21:47.360]  in death of those being interrogated is is what the story how the story goes so you know the cia
[3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:53.280]  didn't want to have that disclosed and so it didn't come out um until uh almost 20 years later when
[3:21:53.280 --> 3:22:00.080]  the church committee and the u.s congress began to uh explore the abuse of cia and when uh the
[3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:09.360]  family of frank olson began to move it forward um but even as late uh as uh this uh 2012 the
[3:22:09.360 --> 3:22:16.000]  guardian in uh great britain was reporting on on this story because more information continues
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:22.160]  to come out as the decade passed the problem is the abuse has never ended we gave them new names
[3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:28.480]  new cover new stories but it always has continued and this is what part of the draining of the swamp
[3:22:28.480 --> 3:22:36.000]  that we hope um this administration attacks because the abuses of the cia and the fbi have gone on
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:43.600]  for decades the corruption began with the foundation of the fbi under hoover um who would be probably
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:50.160]  totally accepted today um uh in terms of what he what he was and what he did he was a cruel
[3:22:50.160 --> 3:22:57.520]  a brutal man that manipulated political processes for what he believed was the american way um any
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:04.080]  blackmailed congressman u.s senators um the same kind of thing that happens today i believe um
[3:23:05.280 --> 3:23:13.120]  through the elite organizations and networks um of abusers and abused because what happens so much
[3:23:13.120 --> 3:23:19.680]  in the uh political arena is this about knowing something about um your opponent or the person
[3:23:19.680 --> 3:23:24.640]  you're supporting and then manipulating them uh to behave in a certain way and i think this what
[3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:29.200]  we're seeing more and more of this is what the fc story is going to be about when you really get
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:36.640]  down to it i'm just going to be about political manipulation um and blackmail and i believe that's
[3:23:36.640 --> 3:23:45.600]  how these organizations function at the very highest level blackmail um and power uh corrupting
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:52.160]  the very essence of our government you know when you think about uh what what happened after the
[3:23:52.160 --> 3:23:58.400]  watergate was the rockefeller commission which is kind of a joke um but it it i have a copy of it
[3:23:58.400 --> 3:24:03.760]  it's a great report um it's a report showing the abuses many of the abuses central intelligence
[3:24:03.760 --> 3:24:10.480]  agency including mk ultra opening people's mail infiltrating domestic groups and on and on and
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:16.800]  off the same kind of things and tactics that are used uh today by both the cia and the fbi
[3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:20.960]  where they actually you know and there's a lot of good people in these organizations don't get me
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:26.880]  wrong there are incredible public servants in all of these organizations that are committed
[3:24:26.880 --> 3:24:31.680]  uh to the security of the nation uh and to doing the things that the country requires
[3:24:32.320 --> 3:24:38.560]  that are constitutionally committed but there are many that are not and unfortunately there
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:44.800]  are too many at the top that are not and it's time to clean it out and clean up the programs
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:50.640]  because these programs have abused too many americans for too many decades when you think
[3:24:50.640 --> 3:24:56.560]  about um the church committee and what came out of that and and i want to talk about going back
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:03.200]  frank holson where i was mentioned before the break so here's what happened during this time frame
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:08.160]  and how ford came to power and there's uh for those that are looking you know there's a copy of
[3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:12.320]  the report of to the president on the commission of cia activities within the united states which is
[3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:19.200]  cover of the document i previously mentioned june 1975 you know when you think about um
[3:25:20.480 --> 3:25:27.840]  all of this so here's the story and and i'm in dc as a young person as a teenager my dads in the
[3:25:27.840 --> 3:25:32.320]  congress people are always at the house you know we've got ubert humphrey dropping by he was in the
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:38.080]  senate by then it served his time as vp he was a good friend of my dad's my dad knew him from the
[3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:43.520]  first time uh ubert humphrey ran for the u.s senate in minnesota where my dad at that time
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:50.880]  resided as a young person in the 1950s he was a young um democrat involved in politics when the
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:57.120]  democratic party was a much different animal than it is today uh and and what he did is he worked on
[3:25:57.120 --> 3:26:01.600]  humphrey's campaign that he came friends and then humphrey later got my dad his first job in
[3:26:01.600 --> 3:26:08.960]  alaska as an inspector on federal programs which brought him here in the mid 1950s but when my dad
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:15.520]  got to the congress in the early 70s humphrey was a senior person powerful person in the u.s senate
[3:26:15.520 --> 3:26:20.640]  another friend of my dad's was blotnik congressman blotnik from minnesota my dad worked hard on his
[3:26:20.640 --> 3:26:26.960]  campaigns and by then he had seniority in the u.s house was able to help my father navigate one of
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:32.480]  the most complex legislative issues uh in the country at the time which was the biggest indigenous
[3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:38.560]  settlement in history the alaska native land claim settlement act but my dad was able to get right
[3:26:38.560 --> 3:26:44.960]  into the midst of the power structures in dc and as a consequence get good legislation passed but
[3:26:44.960 --> 3:26:50.480]  at the same time become privy to a lot of the information going on just before watergate broke
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:56.720]  when nixon was engaged in the greatest levels of corruption hoover was corrupting the entire fbi
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:02.560]  and bogs hail bogs the majority or the speaker of uh majority leader excuse me in the house
[3:27:02.560 --> 3:27:08.240]  was calling for the resignation of poover six months before him and my father flew out of on a
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:15.440]  flight from anguish to juno and disappeared um forever later to find out that the fbi knew their
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:21.920]  locations um based on intelligence uh that has been documented well over the years and i can get
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:28.320]  into it today but the fact is it would have been a very different situation bogs was the majority
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:34.160]  leader uh carl elbert was the speaker at the time and carl was not was a nice guy he used to hang
[3:27:34.160 --> 3:27:38.960]  around at the house but is a horrible alcoholic certainly couldn't be president united states
[3:27:38.960 --> 3:27:44.560]  and that's third in line right president vice president speaker the house uh what happened
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:50.160]  is bogs the powerful guy the guy that could have actually done something the uncorruptible guy um
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:57.440]  um was the man he was up next for speaker which would have put him in line what would have happened
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:05.200]  um had things happened a bit differently as you recall agnew went to jail ford came into office
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:12.080]  nixon resigned nixon was pardoned watergate went away um and then squeaky from from the old manson
[3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:19.840]  family tries to assassinate um ford and goes to jail um and don't forget that after ford became
[3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:26.080]  president rockefeller became vice president had squeaky from proceeded it would have been rockefeller
[3:28:26.080 --> 3:28:31.840]  as president united states in the early 1970s now what a change in history that would have been
[3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:36.480]  but equally it could have been hail bogs we're going to talk about that right after the break
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:42.480]  in the context of mind control you're listening to the info wars this is dr nick baggage uh and

[3:31:15.440 --> 3:31:20.480]  who want to do a detour around our constitution those who want to deconstruct our culture and

[3:32:03.440 --> 3:32:09.120]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with ai gods now we're
[3:32:09.120 --> 3:32:13.120]  fighting them hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension
[3:32:13.120 --> 3:32:17.440]  but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:22.720]  in our lives is our bodies if i wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from fours life
[3:32:22.720 --> 3:32:29.040]  dot com i couldn't do it that's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high
[3:32:29.040 --> 3:32:36.720]  quality meadow kebalman and double the strength of it in a new formula ultra 12 ultra 12 is undoubtedly

[3:32:57.120 --> 3:32:59.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:59.760 --> 3:33:07.760]  go
[3:33:10.240 --> 3:33:20.720]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[3:33:20.720 --> 3:33:32.720]  and welcome back and i appreciate you all list today on august 2nd 2019 on this friday afternoon
[3:33:32.720 --> 3:33:39.040]  and i'm broadcasting from anchorage alaska today and hooked in through the team in austin and i
[3:33:39.040 --> 3:33:44.320]  really appreciate connor and darry and all the guys down there doing the work that makes this
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:50.320]  uh work for all of us you know i i so much appreciate the network and and the ability to get
[3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:56.400]  these these issues out and have time to really explore them and break them down and and from
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:34:02.320]  the context of coming out of a political family and looking at how it's changed and again kind of
[3:34:02.320 --> 3:34:08.160]  back to this theme i've covered in past shows multi-generational knowledge you know this is
[3:34:08.160 --> 3:34:13.280]  where it matters when we can convey the information that's funded foundational and fundamental
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:20.960]  um in a way that that helps us grasp a value system within the context of current news and
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:26.480]  you know the the rest of the team covers so much of the of the current news it seems like redundant
[3:34:26.480 --> 3:34:34.240]  for me to get into some of it but these issues kind of underlie so much of what we see um happening
[3:34:34.240 --> 3:34:38.560]  in the news because the elites have functioned the same way and they always have when i go back
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:49.040]  again to the 1970s we are at the same crossroads today as we were then without um and then we
[3:34:49.040 --> 3:34:55.200]  didn't we had media you know i remember sitting in front of uh my grandfathers who my grandfather
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:35:01.200]  was an immigrant uh from uh croacia came over here in 1906 and i'm sitting there with one of my
[3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:05.840]  buddies in his living room and watching the watergate trials and was when urlichman was testifying
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:10.800]  and i knew urlichman's son i went to school with him in dc he was a nice kid but urlichman at that
[3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:16.880]  point it was this um representative from hawaii i think was in a way who said he's lying you
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:22.240]  know and it got picked up by the mic and my grandfather was so incensed you know what was
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:27.520]  going on he couldn't believe it you know and and then it all got shut down when nixon got pardoned
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:35.920]  you see because the real story was the elites had an operation and a plan and it was shut down um
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:39.760]  information that was about to break loose and break free and it started with the kennedy
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:45.120]  administration he was going to break it loose and break the information free it didn't happen
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:49.360]  augs knew this he was on the warring commission wanted to broken back open because he knew our
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:54.080]  government was involved and it was corrupt at least involved to the extent of either hiding it
[3:35:54.080 --> 3:36:00.880]  which is what the fbi did to the very flight he was on um hid the information uh and they never
[3:36:00.880 --> 3:36:06.240]  recovered the plane that's the fact of the matter and that's what the history shows the reality is
[3:36:06.240 --> 3:36:10.800]  our government did this routinely richard nixon was one of the most corrupt people that ever lived
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:18.400]  when you think about how government operates this is the problem we never get the truth and then
[3:36:18.400 --> 3:36:24.640]  with four administration came cheney and rumsfeld trying to shut down the church uh committees
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:29.200]  information with frank olson's testimony believe me it would have his family's testimony would
[3:36:29.200 --> 3:36:36.640]  have a very different outcome uh than the nonsense uh that we got and it was bad enough um from what
[3:36:36.640 --> 3:36:41.840]  we we've seen from those uh those committee reports but the point of the matter is it's
[3:36:41.840 --> 3:36:50.640]  happening again today cia abuses abuses of the fbi false reports and now we have secret courts
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:56.720]  visa courts that can hide all of this so now they can lie cheat steal and manipulate no one gets to
[3:36:56.720 --> 3:37:04.160]  see the truth this is fundamentally violates the very foundation of the nation and these courts
[3:37:04.160 --> 3:37:08.320]  where they've been violated in this way where people's rights have been violated including the
[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:13.520]  current fitting president of the united states when he was candidate we should be gutting these
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:20.880]  agencies we should be in there with the government accounting office slicing them up hacking them up
[3:37:20.880 --> 3:37:27.040]  and finding out where the corruption is and getting it out of there drain the swamp that's what we
[3:37:27.040 --> 3:37:34.880]  need the manipulation mind control today is on steroids let me talk about um a little bit about
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:41.040]  sort of how that works and and and what it how easy it is and and again you can get the background
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:46.000]  in the book controlling the human mind or the video controlling the human mind both available
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:52.240]  at the info war store but they give you the foundation over 300 sources i think were cited in
[3:37:52.240 --> 3:37:58.960]  that book um of where all this information comes from but how easy is this to manipulate you know
[3:37:58.960 --> 3:38:06.640]  there was a us army war college uh for a quarterly back um and i think was 98 or 99 and you'll see
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:11.520]  the reference but what they said was essentially the article you look up the articles called the
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:22.320]  mind has no firewalls and it was a reiteration from the uh of a publication the us army uh quarterly
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:28.880]  and and and and it was a publication of orient here which is a russian journal and and what it was
[3:38:28.880 --> 3:38:34.240]  talking about was the ability to manipulate human behavior utilizing any electromagnetic
[3:38:34.240 --> 3:38:41.760]  carry now this includes radio television the internet um uh wi-fi i mean anything that you
[3:38:41.760 --> 3:38:48.480]  can pulse modulate a signal in a specific way you can change the attitude and uh in basic emotional
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:54.320]  state of populations you can do this a lot of different ways um but what the research shows
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:39:00.800]  is that this has become highly um sophisticated and and increasingly so as time moves on so what
[3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:07.920]  you're able to do is gain what i call resolution the more computing power the more capability
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:13.920]  of understanding the electromagnetic fields associated with with biological systems like
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:19.920]  human beings then you get to figure out how to manipulate those electromagnetic signals
[3:39:20.720 --> 3:39:26.480]  oh and and what you can do then is you can sort of you can look at the brain and you can map what's
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:32.160]  going on in the brain at a very high resolution because you got the computing power now and the
[3:39:32.160 --> 3:39:39.120]  ability to monitor at very fine resolution and then the idea is you by by taking those signals
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:43.680]  and then trying to interpret what those signals are saying in other words the images and visions
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:51.520]  and then being able to re-establish a program to send signals back in and there was a um publication
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:40:00.560]  it was uh new uh uh technology arises a u.s. air force document back in um in around 2000 again
[3:40:00.560 --> 3:40:05.840]  cited in controlling human mind and in this particular uh document it was talking about
[3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:12.960]  being able to create complete memory sets where you could uh substitute all of the basic sensors
[3:40:12.960 --> 3:40:21.200]  touch a smell sight sound and be able to substitute and create illusions so real you couldn't sort
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:27.920]  out what was a real memory from the fake man you want to talk about fake news this is a direct
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:35.360]  program this is where the technology is headed and where the research is going if you look at a
[3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:41.760]  pbs special called the world wide mind their belief is the next leaf they say a hundred years out
[3:40:41.760 --> 3:40:46.480]  that's a ridiculous can be much sooner than that that you'll be able to link the minds of
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:51.840]  individuals already they're looking at mechanical electromechanical devices to do this and there's
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:40:58.240]  already been many developed but not using any implanted technology nothing where you can just
[3:40:58.240 --> 3:41:06.240]  manipulate um even at a distance uh five uh five g why that's important is being able to focus
[3:41:06.240 --> 3:41:12.400]  the signal to a relatively small area specific device so you can manipulate the person within
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:18.240]  that field within that device's range the the electronic surveillance system that has been put
[3:41:18.240 --> 3:41:24.240]  in place is part of that manipulation everyone that carries an electronic device is part of that
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:30.160]  system that the only way you get out of it is what osama bin laden did when he was eluding um
[3:41:30.160 --> 3:41:37.040]  um everyone is you drop the electronic footprint you let go of all the modern technology everything
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:43.760]  you don't keep any of it because all of it is a tracking tool a surveillance tool and now we've
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:49.360]  all invited the government and commercial interest into our homes into our lives on a hundred percent
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:55.760]  basis think about that ladies and gentlemen if you want to talk about manipulation of mind
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:42:03.680]  control at its foundation within our homes every one of us has our digital doorway kicked in
[3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:10.400]  every moment that we breathe let me say that again this is our digital doorway this is our
[3:42:10.400 --> 3:42:17.680]  constitutional privacy that's being violated every day in every way with every breath we take
[3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:25.600]  as our systems monitor every single thing we do is this the 21st century that we envision
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:31.040]  for our children our grandchildren what we envision for future generations i don't think so it's time
[3:42:31.040 --> 3:42:37.920]  to remember what multi-generational history yield which is better government not manipulation
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:42.480]  we're in it for the long haul this is the info wars and you're listening to dr nick faggots
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:52.080]  and we'll be right back after these very important messages

[3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:57.200]  supplement routine i look yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180
[3:43:57.200 --> 3:44:01.600]  dollars so far this year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:04.400]  because i mean i don't want to give that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people
[3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:08.320]  who are going to donate it to causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:12.880]  getting quality product the products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:17.520]  really done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i made my kid they use
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:22.400]  the toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it
[3:44:22.400 --> 3:44:26.480]  and it gets rid of his sore throat uh he will start let me break this down for you i want high quality
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:31.200]  stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:35.360]  when it's 50 off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:39.680]  like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:44.240]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're
[3:44:44.240 --> 3:44:48.800]  already getting 10 off because you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something
[3:44:48.800 --> 3:44:52.320]  like that uh we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:59.760]  before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and info wars dot com but
[3:44:59.760 --> 3:45:04.480]  also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info wars
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:10.480]  store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when alex
[3:45:10.480 --> 3:45:15.920]  first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:21.440]  with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:27.360]  improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:33.520]  plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other
[3:45:33.520 --> 3:45:39.360]  competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[3:45:39.360 --> 3:45:46.000]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:52.320]  on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at
[3:45:52.320 --> 3:45:58.400]  info wars store dot com george arwell said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:03.520]  a revolutionary act and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the american flag because we
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:08.080]  still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it but now
[3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:12.720]  they're trying to take it out of schools they're taking it down off of government buildings weird
[3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:17.840]  white leftist that when a virtue signaler pulling down american flags and running up mexican flags
[3:46:17.840 --> 3:46:22.640]  this is the bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act in
[3:46:22.640 --> 3:46:27.840]  the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american flag particularly
[3:46:27.840 --> 3:46:33.520]  the betsy ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on the back right there ladies and
[3:46:33.520 --> 3:46:39.840]  gentlemen america's back in full wars dot com so whatever you do take action today and exercise
[3:46:39.840 --> 3:46:44.640]  your free speech in these bullies face all over not just the u.s but worldwide because more than
[3:46:44.640 --> 3:47:00.560]  ever the american flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:21.680]  and welcome back to info wars and this is uh nick baggage on this friday afternoon and we're in
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:28.720]  the last segment today and we're talking about controlling the human mind and the whole concept
[3:47:28.720 --> 3:47:34.400]  behind the sort of what happens and how does this go and sort of the politics behind it as well and
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:40.560]  and again we're at that crossroads um this point in history and where we were during the water
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:45.920]  date era and what what i believe would have happened had bogs plain not disappeared it would
[3:47:45.920 --> 3:47:51.520]  have been a very different outcome um and and we almost had rock a fellow running the country i mean
[3:47:51.520 --> 3:47:57.360]  think of you want to talk about elites i didn't think about this and ford was bad enough quite
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:03.360]  frankly and and the pardoning of nixon which really hollowed out what should have been the
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:10.560]  bring the bringing down of a corrupt institution central intelligence agency at the time in the fbi
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:16.720]  and they neither were properly reformed although we all got the illusion of it by the rock and
[3:48:16.720 --> 3:48:23.040]  feller report but you know thinking back on the time now what would have happened had bogs been
[3:48:23.040 --> 3:48:28.240]  and uh had remained the majority leader what i believe would have happened is carl elbert would
[3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:35.680]  have stepped down bogs would have moved up as the speaker as the speaker had been third in line to be
[3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:40.240]  president agnew would have been thrown out nixon would have been thrown out and that would have been
[3:48:40.240 --> 3:48:47.840]  put bogs in charge of the executive branch and then you would have seen the opening of the book
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:54.720]  in terms of the corruption that has gone on in this country for way too long we're at the same
[3:48:54.720 --> 3:49:00.240]  threshold again we have someone in office that actually might do it i know a lot of people are
[3:49:00.240 --> 3:49:09.920]  screaming about donald truffin so many ways i still support him yeah he's rough in terms of his
[3:49:09.920 --> 3:49:17.200]  approach but sometimes you know you'd need a guy like him to be the bully that this country hasn't
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:23.920]  had in a very long time sometimes you need a guy with a baseball bat to step into the arena of foreign
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:31.200]  affairs and address it differently uh than the niceties of yielding to the global elites every
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:35.840]  time we turn around which is what the democrats and republicans at the national level have been
[3:49:35.840 --> 3:49:41.200]  doing for much too long catering to special interests catering to those interests that work
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:49.360]  against us um we got a total remake you know donald trump uh wasn't uh someone who came out of the
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:56.160]  republican party he's someone who went into the republican party changed it fundamentally altered
[3:49:56.160 --> 3:50:01.440]  it um and became president of the united states and wiped out all of the people that the establishment
[3:50:01.440 --> 3:50:09.440]  could produce what was it 16 17 people ran against him you know come on the fact is yeah
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:15.520]  a little rough around the edges for sure uh but he's getting the job done you know and in this area
[3:50:15.520 --> 3:50:21.600]  i hope um he cracks the egg because manipulation is what's going to determine whether he's the
[3:50:21.600 --> 3:50:27.040]  next president of the united states or not because believe me what's going on with big media today
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:33.520]  dwarfs the things we've been talking about in terms of manipulation big media today is the
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:41.200]  facebook is um the googles these are the folks that right now are the gatekeepers for what knowledge
[3:50:41.200 --> 3:50:50.080]  you shared um worldwide fundamentally wrong fundamentally wrong the youtube's the facebook's
[3:50:50.080 --> 3:50:56.320]  these are public utilities need to be regulated accordingly speech needs to be protected personal
[3:50:56.320 --> 3:51:02.320]  privacy of individuals need to be protected and the sanctity of the mind and awareness consciousness
[3:51:02.320 --> 3:51:07.680]  is the foundation of all of it think about it freedom of speech freedom of press freedom of
[3:51:07.680 --> 3:51:12.320]  assembly freedom of religion require fundamentally freedom of thought freedom of the mind function
[3:51:12.320 --> 3:51:18.960]  freely of interference especially of technologies that weren't even envisioned 250 years ago when
[3:51:18.960 --> 3:51:25.440]  that constitution was being formed and here we are in the 21st century again our digital
[3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:34.640]  doorways kicked in our minds raped by the propaganda wars and and where is the opportunity
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:40.720]  to have a republic a democratic republic that is the representative of of our voices
[3:51:41.840 --> 3:51:45.760]  controlling our mind controlling our speech controlling our thinking is fundamental to
[3:51:45.760 --> 3:51:49.760]  that you know when you think about the ability to manipulate and during the break connor and I
[3:51:49.760 --> 3:51:57.200]  were talking about that pbs segment that appears to be scrubbed off of the internet so the worldwide
[3:51:57.200 --> 3:52:06.400]  mind pbs special I know I I marketed quite a bit of uh of those vhs is when they were out
[3:52:07.760 --> 3:52:12.160]  but somebody's got it out there take a look around find it on the shelf and re upload it
[3:52:12.160 --> 3:52:17.600]  because I'll look in my archive as well I think it's an important one that people need to realize
[3:52:17.600 --> 3:52:23.760]  that before it was big news people were willing to shut it down but I'm telling you the worldwide
[3:52:23.760 --> 3:52:32.880]  mind is the greater threat because think about this the digital money okay the digital money in terms
[3:52:32.880 --> 3:52:41.040]  of bitcoin and what that's about one day you're going to see this concept applied to a worldwide
[3:52:41.040 --> 3:52:47.680]  currency because every transaction then can be tracked and your engagement in that is going to
[3:52:47.680 --> 3:52:55.680]  be modeled after the facial recognition and social scoring systems being trialed in india and china
[3:52:55.680 --> 3:53:03.600]  today and the monetary system the digital monetary system being being trialed in india today and when
[3:53:03.600 --> 3:53:09.680]  you combine these things with what the google's and the youtube's are doing and consumer manipulation
[3:53:09.680 --> 3:53:14.640]  under the guise of consumer manipulation with the support of the government and the structure of
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:20.880]  government you have a fascist system of corporations aligned with government from the manipulation
[3:53:20.880 --> 3:53:30.000]  of populations from china to this she see the shining sea from china to the usa to europe
[3:53:30.000 --> 3:53:34.320]  we are all being manipulated from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere from the
[3:53:34.320 --> 3:53:42.960]  east to the west we are all being manipulated it's time to pay attention it's time to dig deeper
[3:53:42.960 --> 3:53:48.800]  it's time to rise up into the essence of who we are as created human beings
[3:53:50.480 --> 3:53:57.040]  take that which we are and express it in the world in a different way this is what's needed
[3:53:57.040 --> 3:54:04.480]  right now it's a recognition of the divinity of human beings created in the image and likeness of god
[3:54:04.480 --> 3:54:12.160]  to be divine to be responsible to live forever this is the carrier we're stewards of this planet
[3:54:12.160 --> 3:54:19.280]  and we have to take care of it in a rational way but more importantly we need to support and take
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:26.160]  care of one another in a different way in a way that allows us to explore the individual power
[3:54:26.160 --> 3:54:33.920]  and potential of what we do not as some squishy collective but as enlightened individuals who
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:41.520]  are able to create a better way a better world and it's by looking into the eyes of one another
[3:54:41.520 --> 3:54:47.040]  and seeing the divinity in each other and constructing a conversation not destroying
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:53.520]  each other as avidia is trying to create through identity politics the only identity that we need
[3:54:53.520 --> 3:55:00.400]  is we are part of the human race we are engaged in a collective consciousness for sure expressed
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:06.240]  through individual souls manifesting in this planet in a way that we can either change it
[3:55:06.240 --> 3:55:12.560]  or lay down and accept it and I don't think that's what we were created to do each of us have incredible
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:18.800]  potential and power the counterbalance to this is to rise up into what we were created to be
[3:55:18.800 --> 3:55:25.200]  and begin to express it in the world more fully that's controlling the human mind that's controlling
[3:55:25.200 --> 3:55:31.280]  our outcomes by taking our power back the uncountable first to ourselves recognizing
[3:55:31.280 --> 3:55:37.680]  our places to improve and change and then jumping into it and not being so self-condemning
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:44.880]  and self-restricting and we all make mistakes we all are flawed for sure but to condemn the
[3:55:44.880 --> 3:55:53.120]  highest creation in the universe the human soul now this is blasphemy against creation itself
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:56:00.000]  recognize our flaws change who we are and then we alter our world but we do it first by doing the
[3:56:00.000 --> 3:56:06.480]  hard work internally so we can express externally what we were created to be that's what we need to
[3:56:06.480 --> 3:56:13.280]  do to change the world today is step into what we believe is right and true and begin to act on it
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:18.720]  that's called the act of faith that's called awareness acting in the world do what you can
[3:56:18.720 --> 3:56:23.920]  within your sphere of influence whether it's talking to your neighbor and if it gets elevated
[3:56:23.920 --> 3:56:31.600]  calm it down look them in the eye and express to them what you would express to speaking to someone
[3:56:31.600 --> 3:56:38.480]  created in the image and likeness of god then the conversation changes do what you can each day
[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:43.600]  write a letter to your congressman a hand written letter not an email not a phone call and written
[3:56:43.600 --> 3:56:50.080]  letter second most effective thing is phone call directly to their offices look up their phone numbers
[3:56:50.080 --> 3:56:56.240]  in their local phone directories you'll find them for those who still use them and now look them up
[3:56:56.240 --> 3:57:00.560]  call them up tell them what you think let them know that you want an accountable government
[3:57:00.560 --> 3:57:08.720]  that you want the truth the things that set us free the truth about our government even as ugly
[3:57:08.720 --> 3:57:14.160]  as it might be because the only way it'll change is when we first recognize the need to change and
[3:57:14.160 --> 3:57:22.560]  that's through um revelation through recognition through the vision of seeing the truth let's
[3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:27.600]  look for that truth on the info wars let's find our truth and let's express it in the world today
[3:57:27.600 --> 3:57:33.280]  let's make a difference uh in what we do let's change the way we see the world and let's have

[3:58:46.480 --> 3:58:50.960]  hey i'll yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[3:58:50.960 --> 3:58:55.520]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[3:58:55.520 --> 3:59:00.480]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know
[3:59:00.480 --> 3:59:05.440]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[3:59:05.440 --> 3:59:09.520]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think
[3:59:09.520 --> 3:59:13.680]  he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely
[3:59:13.680 --> 3:59:17.360]  and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
