[00:55.500 --> 01:04.880]  car bomb attack dining at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 I know we covered
[01:04.880 --> 01:07.560]  this for an hour yesterday but it's such a big deal so Tarpley is going to be
[01:07.560 --> 01:11.560]  popping in and we're also going to talk to Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer
[01:11.560 --> 01:16.520]  of Abel danger about his suppressed book and well his take on what's
[01:16.520 --> 01:22.480]  happening with the different intelligence agencies protecting Al Ciaida so
[01:22.480 --> 01:27.240]  he'll be joining us for a full hour the job our producers for getting that done
[01:27.240 --> 01:33.800]  coming up at high noon and T-minus 58 minutes from now and of course we have
[01:33.800 --> 01:38.140]  our weekly visit with Bob Chapman on the economy so important to have him on with
[01:38.140 --> 01:42.400]  us once a week as we chronicle and track what's happening all over the planet
[01:42.400 --> 01:47.560]  including the mortgage gate situation that is just expanding but we'll be
[01:47.560 --> 01:53.160]  talking about Fox's supposed exclusive al-qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon
[01:53.160 --> 02:00.080]  just months after 9-11 and more al-a-laki and it goes on from that point
[02:00.080 --> 02:07.040]  with Tarpley and Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer coming up today we
[02:07.040 --> 02:11.600]  also have the Lindsay Williams interview that is just taking the internet by
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.760]  storm right now just huge amounts of traffic to info wars dot com and prison
[02:17.760 --> 02:22.720]  potter com with that interview yesterday and a lot of different news outfits
[02:22.720 --> 02:32.400]  picking up on it I know Lindsay Williams is for real in that his source is for
[02:32.400 --> 02:39.000]  real but I also just want to add that a lot of you know old men especially who
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.600]  are really old and are getting ready to die they're very matter-of-fact they're
[02:43.600 --> 02:49.000]  very especially elitist are very authoritative in the things they say
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.920]  and just because this elitist says all of this is going to happen it doesn't
[02:52.920 --> 02:55.920]  mean it's a hundred percent going to happen or that he has all the
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.240]  information about what's going on in globalist circles kind of like his
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.120]  source one area that his source has been wrong about was how you know it was
[03:05.120 --> 03:08.680]  going to be totaled you know mega disaster in the Gulf and there has been a
[03:08.680 --> 03:11.920]  disaster they've covered most of it up in the core exit and the fact that most
[03:11.920 --> 03:15.840]  the oil hasn't been cleaned up I mean that's ongoing and now really the dead
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.520]  fish and the illnesses and the rest of it's out of the news but I mean but but
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.520]  that's an example right there of his source you know saying this oil pressure
[03:24.520 --> 03:28.840]  so incredible and so high that they're basically never going to be able to fix
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.640]  it so that's some good news in that you know his source is not omnipresent
[03:32.640 --> 03:37.080]  doesn't have all the answers he talked about this Hispanic prominent activist
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.280]  that he's met with and talked to who's been meeting with Janet Napolitano
[03:41.280 --> 03:46.760]  offering her jobs and Napolitano telling her that you need to get six months of
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.080]  food and water we separately know who that source is confirmed that that indeed
[03:52.080 --> 03:58.320]  did go on and we know the name and and that Williams has talked to her and
[03:58.320 --> 04:01.600]  that Napolitano did tell her that but obviously the lady scared doesn't want
[04:01.600 --> 04:08.880]  her activist work you know harmed with what she's doing but the government
[04:08.880 --> 04:14.160]  itself has been building up emergency supplies for decades so that's really
[04:14.160 --> 04:17.480]  nothing new and we know they could stage a cyber security attack which are
[04:17.480 --> 04:22.480]  clearly gearing up to do and the Stuxnet worm appears to be just that the trigger
[04:22.480 --> 04:26.280]  to pass in the lame duck session of Congress the cyber security takeover
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.480]  which is the Pentagon takeover of the internet so we'll talk some about that
[04:30.480 --> 04:36.160]  today also establishment dispatches Clinton the campaign against Rand Paul
[04:36.160 --> 04:41.080]  if you ever needed any sign that Rand Paul is the guy for the job it's that
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.960]  Bill Clinton the discredited criminal is being dispatched against him in
[04:45.960 --> 04:50.720]  Kentucky to now play the race guard we're going to be discussing that as
[04:50.720 --> 05:02.600]  well we'll be right back stay with us you've heard Alex explain how the
[05:02.600 --> 05:06.040]  Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.160]  produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function
[05:10.160 --> 05:13.400]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[05:13.400 --> 05:18.520]  solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the
[05:18.520 --> 05:22.680]  developer of the Silver Lungs generator not only does the Silver Lungs system
[05:22.680 --> 05:26.880]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped
[05:26.880 --> 05:30.720]  with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[05:30.720 --> 05:37.600]  solutions directly to key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs

[06:00.600 --> 06:05.560]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[06:05.560 --> 06:11.200]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[06:11.200 --> 06:14.680]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in many
[06:14.680 --> 06:19.120]  same influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[06:19.120 --> 06:24.400]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[06:24.400 --> 06:28.920]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[06:28.920 --> 06:33.600]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[06:33.600 --> 06:37.680]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[06:37.680 --> 06:41.360]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the checkout to
[06:41.360 --> 06:46.400]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[06:46.400 --> 06:52.480]  a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[07:03.040 --> 07:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.720]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.720 --> 07:16.000]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.360]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.360 --> 07:24.440]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.440 --> 07:29.000]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.120]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.120 --> 07:37.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.080 --> 07:40.920]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.920 --> 07:43.640]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.640 --> 07:49.640]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[07:49.640 --> 07:54.160]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go

[08:01.160 --> 08:08.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[08:12.960 --> 08:19.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[08:19.960 --> 08:26.960]  none of us want 9-11 to be an inside job it just is and what is is and anyone can
[08:37.960 --> 08:42.240]  just look at the news every day and read all the government documents that are
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.320]  public and the former head of Homeland Security Governor Ridge last year
[08:46.320 --> 08:50.440]  admitting that the White House issued terror alerts for political gain and
[08:50.440 --> 08:54.400]  understand that they're using the war on terror to take our liberties and
[08:54.400 --> 08:59.720]  freedoms and set up secret police networks well at the same time Homeland
[08:59.720 --> 09:04.440]  Security in the last year has blocked almost all deportations of illegal
[09:04.440 --> 09:10.440]  aliens this has been going on for a long time under Clinton Bush and now
[09:10.440 --> 09:16.080]  Obama but but but now it's it's getting more outrageous I have a report here
[09:16.080 --> 09:20.680]  Homeland Security Department blamed for border fence project delays budget
[09:20.680 --> 09:24.600]  problems that's out of Fox News and came out a few years ago that illegal aliens
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.960]  were building the shoddy fence that was for show they'll put a few thousand
[09:28.960 --> 09:34.640]  troops strung out across the border who aren't allowed to you know aid the
[09:34.640 --> 09:40.400]  police or anybody when they're under attack it's all for show and many people
[09:40.400 --> 09:45.520]  pointed out we have countless times that if the 9-11 attacks were real you
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.840]  would have seen the borders militarized and locked down overnight on September
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.600]  12th believe me the globalists know how to do it they can secure borders and
[09:53.600 --> 09:58.000]  you know dozens of third world countries they control our military our
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.480]  government is run by offshore corporations and we're used as the
[10:01.480 --> 10:07.560]  muscle to build and enforce their world government and when you read the
[10:07.560 --> 10:10.480]  Maik reports and Homeland Security reports and all the new reports that
[10:10.480 --> 10:14.720]  have been leaked you find out they're not spending any other time dealing with
[10:14.720 --> 10:19.400]  quote Muslim extremists and to the contrary they are protecting them they
[10:19.400 --> 10:24.160]  are funding them they are financing them I mean you know exclusive Al-Qaeda leader
[10:24.160 --> 10:28.880]  dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11 Anwar al-Alaqi the guy that runs
[10:28.880 --> 10:35.880]  all the attacks Lord Hood shooting underwear bombing time square attack 911
[10:35.880 --> 10:40.360]  I mean they say he's the guy and it comes out he's always in control of the
[10:40.360 --> 10:44.760]  lunatics they find to carry out these attacks and because they are such low
[10:44.760 --> 10:49.240]  grade morons most of the attacks you end up to be complete duds the Fort Hood
[10:49.240 --> 10:53.480]  situation was not and it's come out mainstream news that for two years they
[10:53.480 --> 11:00.880]  knew about Hassan and he was talking to Al-Alaqi and the CIA and the Pentagon knew
[11:00.880 --> 11:04.880]  this and he was saying what should I do Al-Alaqi and the full text of these
[11:04.880 --> 11:08.560]  emails has not been released because the CIA declared national security and
[11:08.560 --> 11:13.400]  denied it to Congress how is the CIA denying that to Congress how does the
[11:13.400 --> 11:16.440]  private Federal Reserve get up there and all these banking committee hearings
[11:16.440 --> 11:20.000]  for two years straight every month and they say where's this trillion where's
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.120]  this 500 billion where's this 800 billion and they say we're not gonna tell
[11:23.120 --> 11:28.120]  you I mean I mean there's the corruption right out in the open okay and I see
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.480]  police and I and I and I've been to the events the drills we've we've we've we've
[11:33.480 --> 11:37.800]  seen her on the news countless times the police all serious learning how to run
[11:37.800 --> 11:41.960]  checkpoints learning how to search homes learning how to spy on citizens and
[11:41.960 --> 11:46.000]  oh my gosh Al-Qaeda is such a threat and I've been in the airport before and
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.720]  here in Austin and seen a TSA worker at the lunch counter sitting there reading
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.720]  a book they look like something out of 1984 saying you know how someone becomes
[11:54.720 --> 12:00.560]  a terrorist and and ooh everybody's gonna I mean it's made up ladies and
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.440]  gentlemen it is manufactured so the globalist have an excuse to take over
[12:05.440 --> 12:09.640]  our society and laugh all the way to the bank and how do they laugh all the way
[12:09.640 --> 12:15.600]  to the bank how do they get that done well all of the red light cameras the
[12:15.600 --> 12:19.760]  face-scanning cameras the license plate reading cameras all of these systems of
[12:19.760 --> 12:26.800]  control the data mining the private NSA contractors through total information
[12:26.800 --> 12:32.360]  awareness network the hundreds of billions a year that is publicly spent
[12:32.360 --> 12:38.320]  on this of your tax money is all run by a handful less than ten defense
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.280]  contractors I mean they're not just getting trillions overall every year to
[12:43.280 --> 12:48.720]  take over 160 plus nations that US military and contractors are in they're
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.920]  paid to take over this country it's very simple people like well why would they
[12:52.920 --> 12:57.800]  do this well there's profit alone but there's also the control that the big
[12:57.800 --> 13:03.120]  banks that sit at the top of the pyramid of this fraudulent kleptocracy have
[13:03.120 --> 13:08.080]  committed so many crimes they have done so many things that are openly illegal
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.840]  with their looting that they need a police state in control they need a
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.120]  system that is outside the Constitution in the name of national security so they
[13:18.120 --> 13:21.800]  can get away with it since 1947 with the National Security Act and the
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.160]  establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency absolutely created out of
[13:26.160 --> 13:33.400]  Yale and Harvard and skull and bones that's mainline news skull and bones was
[13:33.400 --> 13:40.720]  founded by a trust that controlled the opium importation I mean this is main
[13:40.720 --> 13:46.480]  line ABC news and so the opium trust created the CIA of course they ship the
[13:46.480 --> 13:50.640]  drugs in of course they're in Afghanistan for the 500 billion a year in opium of
[13:50.640 --> 13:54.400]  course they have Marines on TV admitting they help grow it now they just put the
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.560]  evil in your face and say we're growing opium to stop men and turbans from killing
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.240]  you we're naked body scanning you and radiating you and saving it to keep you
[14:03.240 --> 14:07.240]  safe from men and turbans when they're financing the men and turbans and you've
[14:07.240 --> 14:11.800]  got the CIA run by Wall Street doing whatever it wants that it's just it's
[14:11.800 --> 14:17.240]  gangsters and you've got the light side of the CIA and the FBI you know you've
[14:17.240 --> 14:20.720]  got the people that are the paper pushers and the people that investigate bank
[14:20.720 --> 14:25.480]  robberies at the FBI and the people at the CIA that create dossiers on different
[14:25.480 --> 14:28.640]  world leaders and infiltrate for information and a lot of them are good
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.080]  people who really think they're fighting you know corruption worldwide and
[14:32.080 --> 14:36.680]  spreading truth justice in the American way but you're not stop living in
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.360]  denial the average police officer is a good hard-working person who wants to
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.840]  help people okay when I was in college I looked at a career in law enforcement
[14:47.840 --> 14:54.440]  briefly because I wanted to help people okay and I like adrenaline and I like the
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.560]  idea going up against bad guys and my dad said I have a friend who's a federal
[14:58.560 --> 15:01.960]  marshal why don't you have lunch with him and I went over to his office and
[15:01.960 --> 15:06.440]  had lunch with him and he said are you a criminal and I said absolutely not I'm
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.560]  you know like mr. Boy Scout and he said yeah well that's why if I would have done
[15:11.560 --> 15:16.160]  this over again I and this is a senior federal marshal he said I wouldn't have
[15:16.160 --> 15:23.200]  done this and he said if you are not basically a criminal then this is not
[15:23.200 --> 15:25.800]  the job for you
[15:30.680 --> 15:36.240]  so that was a big wake-up call at 20 years old and I was looking at lots of
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.560]  different stuff you know I was going and talking to people about you know but
[15:39.560 --> 15:42.880]  being a game warden or you know cuz I could be outside and do stuff but then
[15:42.880 --> 15:46.360]  they're like that's not really what we do we spy on people people don't like us
[15:46.360 --> 15:50.440]  so so I mean if you're talking to a senior federal marshal it was about to
[15:50.440 --> 15:55.200]  retire and he tells you that if you're not a criminal you don't want to be
[15:55.200 --> 15:58.840]  involved in this why would he say that what do you think a senior federal
[15:58.840 --> 16:01.440]  marshal knows
[16:01.440 --> 16:11.440]  what do you think a senior federal marshal knows that he would tell a 20 year
[16:11.440 --> 16:17.560]  old somebody who looks like mr. Apple pie I mean when I was 20 years old folks
[16:17.560 --> 16:21.520]  around six miles almost every day looked waits for two hours a day three times a
[16:21.520 --> 16:27.520]  week and I was in 2% body fat perfect shape well spoken nice and he's got you
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.600]  know leave it to beaver sitting in front of him and he says you don't want to do
[16:31.600 --> 16:45.240]  this because he said it isn't what it used to be and I didn't understand
[16:45.240 --> 16:48.120]  exactly what he was talking about at the time but that certainly scared me away
[16:48.120 --> 16:55.440]  from it and when you realize how dirty this government is when you realize how
[16:55.440 --> 17:00.880]  bad it is when you realize it's only getting worse it's it's it's it's a
[17:00.880 --> 17:08.000]  painful thing but but living in denial doesn't make those problems go away
[17:11.440 --> 17:18.040]  living in denial only allows it to all get worse and so I see the different
[17:18.040 --> 17:22.240]  types of police officers the hard-working former military types who are just out
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.600]  there following things by the book and they stay low-level and they're out
[17:25.600 --> 17:31.840]  there writing tickets when they're 55 but the people that know how to play the
[17:31.840 --> 17:42.880]  criminal game the people who know just how evil the system is and will go along
[17:42.880 --> 17:48.320]  with it whether they join with it or just passively look the other way they're
[17:48.320 --> 17:53.360]  gonna go to the top you know I've been out in Los Angeles a lot and I have been
[17:53.360 --> 17:58.040]  around former police detectives and current police detectives I have had
[17:58.040 --> 18:02.960]  dinner with police detectives I have had dinner with people involved with the
[18:02.960 --> 18:08.360]  Vikings and that's not a football team in Minnesota that's the police mafia of
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.840]  Los Angeles and they're all just of course the government did 9-11 we knew
[18:12.840 --> 18:23.480]  that day one of course I've got a well we call him a great uncle but he's one
[18:23.480 --> 18:27.440]  of my dad's cousins lives down by our farm you know noting since the day I was
[18:27.440 --> 18:35.080]  born and he was an army officer and he was recruited by the CIA as an army
[18:35.080 --> 18:41.120]  officer and in his training he was supposed to do unbelievably criminal
[18:41.120 --> 18:46.160]  things in Chicago and other cities and he got out of it I mean everyone I know
[18:46.160 --> 18:56.440]  in my family you name it who has who has brushed up against this it's the same
[18:56.440 --> 19:03.040]  report okay and they don't care hey great you know my family member army
[19:03.040 --> 19:14.040]  officer he wouldn't do evil things so they said good we don't want you we're
[19:14.040 --> 19:18.000]  gonna recruit somebody else think about how the system has had decades to go
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.160]  through with a sieve like panning for gold but the gold they're looking for
[19:22.160 --> 19:30.560]  or tyrants and they've been panning through it and most of the people are
[19:30.560 --> 19:34.680]  moral they won't do things that are evil they don't care they find the ones that
[19:34.680 --> 19:38.440]  will it's just like the confirmed reports of TSA agents are being called in and
[19:38.440 --> 19:43.040]  saying will you run naked body scanners do you have health concerns yeah I don't
[19:43.040 --> 19:45.280]  really want to run them and I've heard you can get cancer was in the New York

[24:13.280 --> 24:20.040]  the point I was trying to make last segment is the corrupt corporations that
[24:20.040 --> 24:25.600]  have been running this country into the ground the robber barons that really
[24:25.600 --> 24:32.240]  took over to 1913 they have been slowly building a giant underground army of
[24:32.240 --> 24:37.480]  criminals and compromise individuals I mean by the mid 1930s they came to the
[24:37.480 --> 24:45.520]  most highly decorated Marine Corps officer or enlisted in history two-time
[24:45.520 --> 24:49.320]  Congressional Medal of Honor winner Smedley Butler who'd overthrown countless
[24:49.320 --> 24:53.880]  countries for them they came to him and they said we want you to help run a coup
[24:53.880 --> 25:00.360]  with 500,000 men we've got in police the military you know we've got the units
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.800]  ready we're gonna take over the US and join with Hitler and this came out in
[25:04.800 --> 25:09.080]  the McCormick-Dickstein committee hearings now he played along with them
[25:09.080 --> 25:12.960]  long enough to blow the whistle and that's what finally woke him up Smedley
[25:12.960 --> 25:21.840]  Butler what Major General Smedley Butler and they said after you stage the coup
[25:21.840 --> 25:24.520]  we're gonna make you comment down in the Marine Corps probably president down
[25:24.520 --> 25:30.000]  the road after that how does a dictator sound Smedley Butler was taken all the
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.200]  way up on the mountain by the globalist and he named them the Rockefellers you
[25:37.200 --> 25:42.640]  name it he did radio broadcast on it he did newsreels on it they took him up to
[25:42.640 --> 25:50.520]  the mountain and they said how would you like to be president all you got to do
[25:50.520 --> 25:57.040]  is take over the US well they've done it they found the generals they found the
[25:57.040 --> 26:01.040]  Homeland Security people they built the system the Rand Corporation and CFR
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.520]  designed it and we are in a corporate dictatorship right now and they want to
[26:06.520 --> 26:09.600]  start shutting down the internet and free speech they want to try to intimidate
[26:09.600 --> 26:12.960]  the American people they're counting on police and military and others to be
[26:12.960 --> 26:19.440]  ignorant and when the system stages terror attacks and it creates a financial
[26:19.440 --> 26:24.360]  atmosphere that causes riots as you're seeing accelerate in Europe they have
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.080]  trained you to see the people as your enemy in the name of protecting them
[26:28.080 --> 26:34.080]  and to basically march out against us and it's not just the government the
[26:34.080 --> 26:37.680]  corporations that are decadent the general public is very decadent is into
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.120]  evil is into corruption I mean we all share the blame if you want to know why
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.000]  this has happened look in the mirror evil's always been there it's always
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.960]  trying to get control but when you give in to it your country goes down a rat
[26:48.960 --> 26:55.360]  hole your country gets flushed down the toilet and if they can cheat people on
[26:55.360 --> 26:59.320]  mortgages and take veterans death benefits and all the rest of things
[26:59.320 --> 27:06.000]  they're doing can you imagine what's coming down the road none of us have
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.880]  seen anything yet and at the end of the day you know I don't feel up to the task
[27:13.880 --> 27:18.120]  of fighting these people but I don't have a choice I mean it's either submit to
[27:18.120 --> 27:21.600]  them or stand up against them you think it's fun to stand up against these
[27:21.600 --> 27:24.640]  people you think it's fun to have all their major think tanks attacking us
[27:24.640 --> 27:30.560]  24-7 and all their paid provocateurs on the web you think it's fun for Rand Paul
[27:30.560 --> 27:33.240]  to have the Republicans and the Democrats coming out against him and Bill
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.000]  Clinton dispatched there to now claim that some group he might have been
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.480]  associated with wrote a newsletter making jokes about black people just
[27:40.480 --> 27:43.560]  totally made up or that he's kidnapping women you think that's fun to have
[27:43.560 --> 27:53.800]  people lying about you but it doesn't matter if it's fun it's our duty to do
[27:53.800 --> 27:58.920]  this and I just want to say to everybody who's a bureaucrat or a banker or a cop
[27:58.920 --> 28:04.120]  or anybody I mean you better really have a gut check and look in the mirror or
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.520]  turn the lights off this you know this afternoon sit there quietly in your
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.080]  living room and meditate for a few hours and by meditate I don't mean like
[28:11.080 --> 28:16.840]  some Buddhist I mean think cogitate really ask yourself get conscious and
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.640]  think is this a free country are we going in the right direction and of course a
[28:20.640 --> 28:23.000]  lot of you will say oh no we're not going the right direction it's Obama
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.680]  Obama Obama is meant to take the blame for this leg of the agenda and then
[28:28.680 --> 28:32.320]  Republican that comes after him will take the blame for the next leg the
[28:32.320 --> 28:37.400]  next step I mean it's so of course Obama's horrible I hate him I hate
[28:37.400 --> 28:44.440]  George Bush but they are still just high-level minions it's the system it's
[28:44.440 --> 28:49.200]  it's Goldman Sachs it's JP Morgan Chase it's Bank of America it's the it's the

[29:07.040 --> 29:14.480]  spectrum of information I have made it my life's duty to study this system to
[29:14.480 --> 29:19.080]  research it and understand it through a historical lens and to read the public
[29:19.080 --> 29:22.880]  white papers by these people of the plan they have for this planet let me tell
[29:22.880 --> 29:30.440]  you their plan is one-child policies forced abortions their plan is neo
[29:30.440 --> 29:34.840]  feudalism they call it austerity and you watch our films like Obama the
[29:34.840 --> 29:38.720]  deception fall the Republic you know from a year and a half ago eight months
[29:38.720 --> 29:41.880]  ago it's like prophecy it's everything that's now unfolding but it's not

[34:05.920 --> 34:09.200]  article about it last night West Virginia Senate candidate questions for
[34:09.200 --> 34:16.680]  knowledge of WTC collapse in live TB debate Jeff Becker running for the
[34:16.680 --> 34:22.000]  Senate in West Virginia in the Constitution Party and this was on C-span but
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.440]  the issue here is the courage of this individual and the fact that if you run
[34:27.440 --> 34:32.680]  for office Governor State Senate US Senate whatever you get into to the
[34:32.680 --> 34:37.520]  debates the town halls the local TV the national TV and if you watch C-span
[34:37.520 --> 34:42.960]  these days every time I do and I get sent the clips constantly from YouTube
[34:42.960 --> 34:47.200]  people upload it they'll take 15 calls in a row saying 9-11's an inside job
[34:47.200 --> 34:50.680]  every time they've got the former head of Homeland Security or Israeli
[34:50.680 --> 34:54.520]  intelligence I mean anybody goes on these shows they get bombarded that's
[34:54.520 --> 34:59.520]  freaking the system out and they just independent line 9-11's an inside job
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.880]  Republican line 9-11's an inside job Democrat line 9-11's an inside job and
[35:04.880 --> 35:08.080]  they're there they're they're articulate they're informed the system's got a
[35:08.080 --> 35:12.120]  problem so they come out and announce 9-11 truth is dead we've discredited it
[35:12.120 --> 35:16.280]  like it's like like everybody knows the moon is made of cheese the and weak
[35:16.280 --> 35:20.040]  minded people you know these aren't the droids you're looking for move along
[35:20.040 --> 35:24.280]  these aren't the droids we're looking for move along move along they it's like
[35:24.280 --> 35:29.120]  a Jedi mind trick but only works on the weak minded and so I just wanted to
[35:29.120 --> 35:31.480]  play this clip before we got a tarp because we're dealing with 9-11 and
[35:31.480 --> 35:36.400]  stage terror with him here briefly here's a few minutes from C-span where
[35:36.400 --> 35:39.760]  they bring up what do we do about defense fighting the Muslims and he goes
[35:39.760 --> 35:47.080]  well this whole thing's fake and he goes over it here it is I think we need to
[35:47.080 --> 35:52.000]  first take a look at what happened on September 11th there were actually three
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.640]  buildings that collapsed that collapsed on September 11th World Trade Center 7
[35:57.640 --> 36:02.040]  was two blocks away from the Twin Towers I think this is important to
[36:02.040 --> 36:06.560]  consider because it was not rained on by any debris it was just a 40-story
[36:06.560 --> 36:14.840]  building and at 5 p.m. on 9-11 Jane Stanley the reporter for the BBC was
[36:14.840 --> 36:18.400]  standing right in front and we're standing at ground zero and reported that
[36:18.400 --> 36:24.400]  building 7 collapsed when in fact you could still see it over her shoulder and
[36:24.400 --> 36:30.200]  then 20 minutes later it did collapse this is for knowledge and it needs to be
[36:30.200 --> 36:35.360]  investigated additionally Larry Silverstein the owner of World Trade
[36:35.360 --> 36:40.960]  Center 7 complex before 9-11 had taken out a multi-billion dollar insurance
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.800]  policy to protect his property against a terrorist attack and then in 2002 on a
[36:46.800 --> 36:53.360]  PBS station interview he said that he gave the order to pull it pull it is a
[36:53.360 --> 36:59.840]  controlled demolition term but more evidence of for knowledge these are
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.360]  facts you can watch the interview you can look you can get the BBC footage how
[37:04.360 --> 37:09.400]  did the British know 20 minutes ahead of time this is going to happen this needs
[37:09.400 --> 37:14.120]  to be investigated there is a preponderance of anomalies surrounding
[37:14.120 --> 37:20.440]  the events on 9-11 architects and engineers over a thousand degree
[37:20.440 --> 37:24.560]  and licensed architects and engineers have looked at the information and
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.040]  there's just there's too much there's so much information that that needs to be
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.680]  it doesn't make sense the official story the only way for the official story
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.800]  makes sense is if the laws of physics had changed on that day and I'm an
[37:36.800 --> 37:42.000]  engineer and I can tell you that they did not change okay then it cuts to all
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.400]  the videos from mainstream news of exactly what he talked about that's an
[37:46.400 --> 37:50.320]  important article because more people can then imitate what he's doing and they
[37:50.320 --> 37:54.200]  can't stop us even they try to shut the web down people run for office you're
[37:54.200 --> 37:56.560]  gonna be on television you're gonna be able to talk about it being an inside
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.200]  job and remember 9-11's been used to launch all these wars to take your
[38:00.200 --> 38:03.920]  liberties to set up this control grid now recapping this we're gonna talk about
[38:03.920 --> 38:07.280]  with Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer coming up I got a sneak and
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.720]  suspicion that Fox was leaked this information I wonder where it came from
[38:11.720 --> 38:17.160]  exclusive al Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11
[38:17.160 --> 38:23.640]  Anwar al-Alaqi trouble with his name Anwar al-Alaqi maybe the first American
[38:23.640 --> 38:27.560]  of the CIA's kill or capture list but he was also a lunch guest of a military
[38:27.560 --> 38:32.320]  brass at the Pentagon including the Secretary of the Army now he would
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.880]  already been in the media they said that he was behind 9-11 but there he is at
[38:36.880 --> 38:43.800]  the Pentagon and this is the guy they say is behind the Fort Hood shooter this
[38:43.800 --> 38:48.760]  is the guy behind the dud bomb in Times Square this is the guy behind the
[38:48.760 --> 38:52.640]  underwear bomber and in every case the underwear bomber the government got him
[38:52.640 --> 38:56.640]  on the plane on record without a visa or passport our government the State
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.160]  Department admits that I mean this is crazy and it's like George Bush senior
[39:01.160 --> 39:05.000]  meeting on the morning of 9-11 in a car law group function London Guardian AP
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.320]  with the head of the bin Laden family at his table it's it's now they say Bandar
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.720]  Bush is running the the al Qaeda attacks and Bandar Bush the guy on you know C
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.440]  span of the ambassador from Saudi Arabia the guy on Larry King live two days
[39:20.440 --> 39:25.640]  after 9-11 I mean it's insane it's just they're right out in the open that
[39:25.640 --> 39:29.680]  they're doing this and they stage pure terror attacks like 9-11 then they have
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.040]  other events where they have handlers that go out and find mental deficience
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.400]  they always have low IQs they're on welfare they look drugged like the
[39:36.400 --> 39:40.480]  underwear bomber we've only got him for this segment part of the next because
[39:40.480 --> 39:44.160]  he's got a tape for with Genesis his own Saturday show that's taped every week
[39:44.160 --> 39:49.480]  World Crisis Radio Webster Griffin Tarpley doctor of history he's also an
[39:49.480 --> 39:58.080]  economist and author no no stranger to this radio show Webster we have a good
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.680]  to have you here we have the headline al Qaeda mastermind invited the Pentagon
[40:02.680 --> 40:06.600]  after 9-11 and we have our other headline al Qaeda is a front group for the
[40:06.600 --> 40:10.400]  US military industrial complex I mean this is so out in the open Webster tell
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.800]  us about a locky well if you look at my website to help me that net I've been I
[40:15.800 --> 40:21.320]  have a my nickname for this guy is our lucky the CIA lucky I think that it
[40:21.320 --> 40:27.480]  makes it easy to remember so he's on well lucky and he's a provocateur working
[40:27.480 --> 40:33.480]  for US intelligence and he's part of this gaggle of murderous thugs but of
[40:33.480 --> 40:40.080]  course also provocateurs in other words people who are used for political
[40:40.080 --> 40:45.680]  purposes and typically what what our lucky his his past if I can just
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.040]  reconstruct it off the top of my head he was he was in a mosque in northern
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.680]  Virginia where I think a couple of the 9-11 alleged hijackers the Patsy's for
[40:55.680 --> 41:00.240]  that were attending and then he was over here in Maryland and there he got
[41:00.240 --> 41:06.440]  connected to I guess that must have been major Hasan and later on then he's
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.280]  connected to the underwear bomber now connected connected simply means that if
[41:11.280 --> 41:16.880]  you have a Patsy that has reached the point of ripeness and maturity to do
[41:16.880 --> 41:22.320]  something and you want to deploy the Patsy as a kamikaze in some way you
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.440]  want to be able to say if you're the US intelligence community that this was
[41:26.440 --> 41:32.160]  al-Qaeda doing it so the way you do this is to have them exchange emails with
[41:32.160 --> 41:38.360]  our lucky the CIA lucky and then you can say aha again we told you so it's al
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.600]  qaeda they do exist and they do act now as far as I know our lucky is in Yemen
[41:43.600 --> 41:48.040]  and he's in Yemen because it was a commitment you could see it about a
[41:48.040 --> 41:54.400]  year to two years ago the US wanted to build up branch offices of al qaeda and
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.320]  they needed to make this credible right there's al qaeda in the Maghreb because
[41:59.320 --> 42:04.680]  they want to attack Algeria and Tunisia and maybe Morocco and and places like
[42:04.680 --> 42:10.000]  this but they also wanted to have al qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.640]  and the reason to have it in Yemen is that Yemen of course is strategic because
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.920]  it happens to control the exit from the Red Sea in other words all most of the
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.240]  traffic that comes out of the Suez Canal has got to go down the Red Sea and
[42:23.240 --> 42:28.440]  then out out into the Indian Ocean by by Yemen but the other advantage of Yemen
[42:28.440 --> 42:33.120]  is it gives you a chance to run destabilization operations into Saudi
[42:33.120 --> 42:36.720]  Arabia which is something you you have to do from the point of view of these
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.160]  people at certain times so if you have al laki in Yemen you can argue aha there's
[42:42.160 --> 42:46.920]  al qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the other thing is in order to make sure
[42:46.920 --> 42:50.960]  that they had some members this is the case where they let some people out of
[42:50.960 --> 42:54.920]  Guantanamo that the people who had been rotting away in Guantanamo and they
[42:54.920 --> 42:58.640]  said all right fine we're gonna let you out you go to Yemen and then you know
[42:58.640 --> 43:01.480]  with a wink at a nod they said of course you've got to swear not to become a
[43:01.480 --> 43:04.760]  terrorist again and of course they said yes we'll do that and then of course
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.720]  when once they get over there they disappear and they join al qaeda in the
[43:08.720 --> 43:12.440]  Arabian Peninsula all of this is completely planned in other words this
[43:12.440 --> 43:18.400]  is a bloody theater it's a it's a farce it's a dog and pony show it's designed
[43:18.400 --> 43:24.680]  to dupe people and the idea that al laki is there I mean it reminds you of these
[43:24.680 --> 43:31.040]  things like you know bin Laden treated in a US military hospital in in somewhere
[43:31.040 --> 43:36.360]  in the Gulf right around the time of of 9-11 it simply shows the intimate
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.960]  links between the intelligence and the military intelligence people and this
[43:40.960 --> 43:47.880]  stable of of taxis and provocateurs double agents who these are the witting
[43:47.880 --> 43:51.080]  ones right al laki I'm sure knows what he's doing but then the people that he's
[43:51.080 --> 43:56.800]  working with our psychotics fanatics mental deficients drug addicts and so
[43:56.800 --> 44:03.000]  forth sort of human pawns that they're quite expendable and can be used and the
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.120]  idea that you know they would kill big big big bro ha ha of course is that
[44:07.120 --> 44:12.560]  obama says that he's got the ability to kill al laki the CIA laki whenever he
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.720]  wants well this is also not unheard of right if if if al laki overlives his
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.720]  usefulness then he can be liquidated in some spectacular way and webster to
[44:22.720 --> 44:29.320]  tell me to quantify this it it's very elementary and for you know adults out
[44:29.320 --> 44:34.160]  there that that that don't understand what problem reaction solution is you've
[44:34.160 --> 44:39.960]  got a two trillion dollar plus overall defense budget every year enriching all
[44:39.960 --> 44:44.240]  these groups and if they want to invade oil rich opium rich areas or key
[44:44.240 --> 44:48.600]  strategic zones they're gonna need to have an enemy and so they stage a terror
[44:48.600 --> 44:53.760]  attack and then in the next nine years they go and run these muslim brotherhood
[44:53.760 --> 44:59.800]  type brigades that are handled you know by these criminal types to stage events
[44:59.800 --> 45:04.320]  to stir up mentally ill people to carry out events always as a pretext to
[45:04.320 --> 45:09.680]  invade the next sector or to project force into the next sector and so we
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.320]  see a laki handling everybody they need to put in the naked body scanners they'd
[45:13.320 --> 45:18.920]  already ordered that were being delivered in December and January boom they
[45:18.920 --> 45:23.040]  get a mental patient literally who was couldn't even talk and was drooling
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.520]  according to witnesses he can't get on the plane sharp dressed man has such
[45:26.520 --> 45:30.160]  authority he orders them on the plane with no you know no idea of any type
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.000]  that's the underwear bomber I mean it's the same story over and over again it's
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.000]  been admitted that the emails to a laki from Hassan at Fort Hood and they won't
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.360]  give the full emails to Congress and then they knew for two years he was
[45:42.360 --> 45:46.400]  planning he was asking a laki what do I do your lordship I'm preparing to attack
[45:46.400 --> 45:52.520]  I mean this is just unbelievable and who knows if the if Hassan even did
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.320]  anything because they're racing cell phone tapes videos and other things that
[45:56.320 --> 46:02.040]  witnesses shot but I mean it's just so transparent comment on that and then
[46:02.040 --> 46:06.360]  briefly why do you think this document got leaked and it's confirmed it's
[46:06.360 --> 46:13.280]  authenticity has been confirmed to Fox News because I mean I think I know the
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.600]  answer the spin here is oh good people in the Pentagon were concerned this was
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.640]  just an accident but I give you your take on that Webster well certainly with
[46:22.640 --> 46:26.080]  Hassan you remember that the original reports and I think I wrote this up at
[46:26.080 --> 46:29.360]  the time the original reports on Hassan with it they were there were other
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.000]  shooters they were one two other shooters so and there was a security drill
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.120]  going on for so it's always the same the other thing of course they you it's
[46:39.120 --> 46:42.440]  good that you mentioned the the Muslim Brotherhood because that the neocons like
[46:42.440 --> 46:46.800]  to throw this around the Muslim Brotherhood was created by British
[46:46.800 --> 46:51.880]  intelligence in Egypt in the 1920s because they wanted to counteract
[46:51.880 --> 46:57.760]  Egyptian modernizing nationalism people who wanted to have a modern nation state
[46:57.760 --> 47:01.800]  and the British wanted to have a counter gang that they could well that's like
[47:01.800 --> 47:05.800]  Iraq they mean they kicked Saddam out they that was an older policy of
[47:05.800 --> 47:11.080]  modernization and the women now are wearing the barcas yes and it's a
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.440]  continuity at the Muslim Brotherhood really came into its own under
[47:14.440 --> 47:19.240]  President Nasser of Egypt who was the the classical figure of progressive
[47:19.240 --> 47:24.960]  modernizing Arab nationalism with a with a good chance to build a powerful
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.520]  country and of course they the Muslim Brotherhood was mobilized to try to
[47:29.520 --> 47:33.560]  sabotage that Nasser put up put a lot of them in jail he treated them very
[47:33.560 --> 47:37.920]  brutally needless to say so a lot of these groups are the second and third
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.960]  generation of the original Muslim Brotherhood but again this is not an
[47:42.960 --> 47:47.200]  authentic spontaneous creation of the culture and history of the Middle East
[47:47.200 --> 47:53.080]  it's an implant by British intelligence now with it with the US playing a big
[47:53.080 --> 48:00.360]  will take a swat on 777 you know BBC headline in fact pull it up a swat
[48:00.360 --> 48:06.880]  mastermind of 777 MI6 and they protected him even after I mean it's
[48:06.880 --> 48:10.840]  incredible yeah the the other one is I think that we haven't paid enough
[48:10.840 --> 48:16.760]  attention to the fact that at the the deputy secretary of state of the United
[48:16.760 --> 48:22.000]  States Kennedy at the beginning of this year right after the underwear bomber
[48:22.000 --> 48:29.560]  on Christmas Day this secretary of undersecretary of state for consular
[48:29.560 --> 48:33.560]  affairs meaning visa so he was on the hot seat why did you give him a visa why
[48:33.560 --> 48:39.480]  did you let Abdul Motalop the the underwear bomber why did you let him
[48:39.480 --> 48:42.680]  have a have an entry visa to the United States without which he never could have
[48:42.680 --> 48:46.800]  gotten on the plane and he said well we we wanted to take it away from him but
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.400]  we did an interagency review and there was an agency that came forward which he
[48:51.400 --> 48:56.760]  didn't name saying no you've got to let him keep his visa because we're we've
[48:56.760 --> 49:00.680]  got eyes on him we're following him he's a little fish he'll lead us to the big
[49:00.680 --> 49:05.040]  fish and of course the reality was that's the perfect cover to let him do
[49:05.040 --> 49:10.040]  whatever he did or didn't do which we I guess we still don't know but the the
[49:10.040 --> 49:15.800]  idea is it's a it's a it's a collusion and deception in which these expendable
[49:15.800 --> 49:21.860]  patsies but but again then you've got the the patsy supervisors the patsy
[49:21.860 --> 49:26.520]  minders you could probably think of of our lucky the CIA lacky as a patsy
[49:26.520 --> 49:30.920]  supervisor and patsy patsy minder and every now and then for whatever reason
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.040]  these things are exposed sometimes it's bureaucratic rivalries sometimes it's
[49:36.040 --> 49:42.640]  it's simply you know coincidence right there are coincidences in the world and
[49:42.640 --> 49:46.480]  sometimes for various reasons these things come out from people that with
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.080]  that with other motives but the the bottom line of course is that these
[49:50.080 --> 49:56.400]  events are staged they're part of the management of world affairs by ultimately
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.160]  the banking elite in other words all this the stuff leads back through various
[50:01.160 --> 50:06.640]  mediations back to Wall Street because if you look again at Yemen it's not just
[50:06.640 --> 50:10.440]  that you can you can have dictatorship at home but you can also attack
[50:10.440 --> 50:14.440]  countries in other words if if I have our lucky the CIA lacky and I've built up
[50:14.440 --> 50:19.960]  in an aura around him right a cover story a legend that he's really an
[50:19.960 --> 50:24.000]  authentic terrorist firebrand and he blows up buildings and things like this
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.200]  if I send him into a country and he surfaces in the country say Yemen I'm
[50:29.200 --> 50:32.360]  now free to bomb Yemen and that's what they've been doing right there but US
[50:32.360 --> 50:36.120]  has bombed Yemen a number of times allegedly with the idea that they were
[50:36.120 --> 50:40.080]  going after our lucky the CIA lacky all right stay there let's briefly come back
[50:40.080 --> 50:44.840]  and sum up where you see this going and how dumb do they think we are it's now
[50:44.840 --> 50:48.120]  hidden in plain view oh when he's not having dinner with the Secretary of the
[50:48.120 --> 50:53.240]  Army he's uh you know running underwear bombs I mean it's just so

[53:01.800 --> 53:06.240]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[53:06.240 --> 53:10.240]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[53:10.240 --> 53:14.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[53:14.200 --> 53:18.200]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[53:18.200 --> 53:22.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[53:22.760 --> 53:26.760]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[53:26.760 --> 53:30.560]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[53:30.560 --> 53:34.200]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[53:34.200 --> 53:38.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[54:05.280 --> 54:10.800]  lieutenant colonel Anthony Schaefer's coming up the next segment
[54:10.800 --> 54:17.720]  you can go here just a few minutes but other key points again why do you think
[54:17.720 --> 54:21.480]  this got leaked you think it was somebody a really a good guy inside or what
[54:21.480 --> 54:24.680]  would be the reason for them to leak this info that the who they say the
[54:24.680 --> 54:27.720]  number one guy in al Qaeda in the world he's hanging out with the secretary of
[54:27.720 --> 54:33.640]  the army I don't really know it's difficult to speculate sometimes you
[54:33.640 --> 54:37.800]  have to wait for a few weeks to go by to figure out what the context was it
[54:37.800 --> 54:42.120]  could be that there's a faction fight inside the Pentagon it could be that
[54:42.120 --> 54:46.640]  the faction fight involves what the next step will be right there may be one
[54:46.640 --> 54:51.360]  group that's more adventurous that wants to work to have a false flag maybe
[54:51.360 --> 54:55.560]  visa be Iran and then maybe another group that says that's not a good idea and
[54:55.560 --> 55:02.400]  they they proceed in this way or it could just be good guys inside that know
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.440]  that Al Qaeda is synthetic and that they're tired of it well good guys I
[55:07.440 --> 55:11.000]  wouldn't say good but the lesser evils let's say there may be lesser evils
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.160]  inside who realized that some kind of a war with Iran say if that's what it is
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.000]  would be it you know a catastrophic adventure worse than Iraq most likely
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.840]  leading to a world war within within a number of years so they were there were
[55:24.840 --> 55:30.560]  those considerations too you mean like Fox Fallon three years ago refusing to
[55:30.560 --> 55:35.560]  they had a scent con to launch the attack on Iran yes somebody who says this is
[55:35.560 --> 55:39.720]  you know not not for a choir boy motives but simply because even from an
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.360]  imperialist point of view then I'd say if you if you attack Iran then your
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.760]  Anglo-American imperialism will collapse faster than it would then it would
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.400]  otherwise if you didn't write or you might want to wait for wait for some
[55:52.400 --> 55:56.120]  other option to emerge right I don't think it makes much sense to speculate
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.320]  right if you have an inside source report that's good but right now I
[56:00.320 --> 56:05.440]  don't have one about this so rather I would suggest we look at you know
[56:05.440 --> 56:09.480]  what people can do and then since I have you on the phone here in the last
[56:09.480 --> 56:14.120]  minutes let me just recommend we there is this birth certificate March on the
[56:14.120 --> 56:18.400]  US Capitol tomorrow right that's Saturday and it starts at noon on the
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.640]  west front of the Capitol right this is Phil Berg's March he's the lawyer from
[56:22.640 --> 56:26.640]  Philadelphia we had him on you've had him on he he went to the Supreme Court in
[56:26.640 --> 56:32.160]  August of 2008 to try to get Obama to reveal his birth certificate his his
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.600]  place of birth and all these elementary constitutional things and there's a
[56:36.600 --> 56:40.320]  broad umbrella right they're all kinds of reasons not to like Obama right if
[56:40.320 --> 56:45.280]  you're anti-war if you're anti-federal reserve if you're anti Wall Street if
[56:45.280 --> 56:50.880]  you're anti-dictatorship and so forth right the key to all that is is Obama
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.640]  and I personally look at it this way if he can't produce his birth certificate
[56:55.640 --> 56:59.400]  which he can't do because otherwise he would have done it not only has he not
[56:59.400 --> 57:04.040]  done it but he's fought against people who have tried to to go into the records
[57:04.040 --> 57:07.520]  and pull out what whatever there is there who knows what it is we still don't
[57:07.520 --> 57:12.920]  know if he could do this he would have done it because it is it hurts him but
[57:12.920 --> 57:17.400]  in reality he hasn't done it so I take it this means that he's blackmailable and
[57:17.400 --> 57:21.000]  this for me is the key if he can't produce the birth certificate it means
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.080]  that anybody who knows this fact meaning a whole series of intelligence
[57:25.080 --> 57:31.760]  agencies foreign domestic Wall Street Saudi Arabia you name it mind any any
[57:31.760 --> 57:36.040]  country you want to name on the list it means that he can't be president of the
[57:36.040 --> 57:40.000]  United States he's the puppet of whoever is blackmailing him with this
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.040]  information I don't know that that's the case but that's the obvious prima facie
[57:44.040 --> 57:49.160]  danger and that's intolerable so he can't produce the birth certificate he
[57:49.160 --> 57:53.880]  really has to leave office as president because he can't be president if he
[57:53.880 --> 57:57.360]  can't prove that he's qualified Webster thank you for joining us we'll talk to
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.080]  you again soon okay tomorrow at noon at the Capitol hope to see people there

[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.440]  Colonel Anthony Schaefer operation Darkheart.com Lieutenant Colonel
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.760]  Schaefer is a highly experienced intelligence officer and recipient of
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.920]  the Bronze Star 25 years of field experience Tony has commanded and
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.440]  directed several key operations intelligence organizations these
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.560]  include special mission task force Stratus Ivy that conducted direct
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:03.960]  support of DOD compartmentalized activities OSD SOCOM the Army it it
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:10.560]  goes on about go through his entire bio here operation Darkheart story the New
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.040]  York Times bestseller they suppressed a lot of it they bought up some of the
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.480]  first books and then blacked out a lot of it but so they've really been trying
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:25.320]  to keep him from telling the population of this country in the world what he
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.840]  told Congress and what was suppressed during the 9-11 Commission as well and
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.480]  he joins us to talk about all of this today Colonel good to have you here
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.320]  with us well thank you for having me again Alex good to be all with you there
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.640]  is so much to talk about today and we're going to break in a moment this is a
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.080]  short segment but out of the gates just recap what happened with your book and
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.520]  and what your book does deal with that certain elements the Pentagon don't want
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.200]  people to see well I think it's ironic Alex when you think about it we talked
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.640]  about this on on your show as my fact we had a big detailed discussion about the
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.960]  fact that the Army had just completed reviewing and been clearing it the first
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.400]  time you and I talked so it's interesting that according to the defense
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.600]  intelligence agency they have a clue they had no clue that the book was coming
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.680]  until like mid summer I mean it's just it's beyond the pale of belief and plus
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.040]  in addition to mentioning it on your show I mentioned it on national TV the
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:29.360]  Riley show Larry King and in the end they they decided DOD with defense
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.520]  intelligence agency leading the charge literally decided to intercede on the
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.280]  publication of my book the day before the book was going to be distributed
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.800]  nationally so you got to wonder why on earth would you look to the very last
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.720]  minute as very clear just to summarize before we get into the details they
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.440]  meant to disrupt the release of the book for any number of reasons and obviously
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.720]  that's by the fact that by the army there are apparently a number of things in
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.080]  the book that DOD and again the defense intelligence agency is different than
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.480]  the army if your listeners do understand this they are distinctively
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.120]  different organizations within the Department of Defense and often they
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.160]  have different objectives and views and for whatever reason the DIA has and I
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.640]  think you and I know why DIA has has some pretty bad feelings about me and my
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.760]  disclosure back in 2003 initially the Philadelphia Cal at Deb Bagram regarding
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.480]  able danger and then of course my testimony which got me fired in 2005 and
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.960]  2006 so it's really those issues I believe at the core of why they did this
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.520]  like you know literally the lead 11th hour and you know interdiction of the
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.360]  book trying to cause maximum disruption and havoc essentially send a message to
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.600]  others to say you know you probably don't want to you know break ranks
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.440]  because you're just gonna make your life miserable any chance we get and of
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.200]  course we've heard about these new DOD rules that officers can't talk to any
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.400]  media about any subject without authorization have they been trying to
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:58.000]  use that on you well you know it's interesting I did seek and I did obtain
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.920]  guidance before the current publicity to where I'm doing right now and so the
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.040]  essentially the guidance I've been given is that I can talk about the book
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.200]  which has been cleared I but I'm I have to be careful that I can't talk about
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.960]  certain elements of the army the certain you know I'm an army reservist so
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.560]  there's certain things I can't talk about within the context of that and
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.040]  obviously that I've been reminded my security oath which you know I'm not
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.960]  sure if you're aware of it my security clearance was restored as part of the
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.280]  review of the book so obviously they they try to use that to prohibit me from
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.800]  talking about the information they took out of the book and that's and by the way
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.560]  Alex that's going to be a subject of a First Amendment suit against DOD here
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.200]  in a very near future well let's talk about that suit what you can talk about
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.080]  that's in the book and if you can give us any hints in the parameters of the law
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.160]  about what was excised from the book and we'll also get into some other key
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.960]  issues with Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shafer with his number one best-seller

[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.920]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.080]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.120]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.000]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.240]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.400]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.720]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.440]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.640]  Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.480]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.440]  of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.600]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.560]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.520]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.560]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:49.640]  right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of

[01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:03.680]  in super high quality at prison planet dot TV from his central Texas command
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:09.120]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:16.000]  Jones and the GCN radio network there can be no doubt mega corporations have
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.520]  basically taken over this country almost every other nation they are
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.960]  destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution we are broadcasting in
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.920]  occupied territory we want our Republic our bill of rights our Constitution back
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:33.800]  operation dark heart dot com is the website the book is the operation
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:39.160]  dark heart story now a New York Times bestseller of the Pentagon grabbed the
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.880]  book destroyed the original copies made a deal with the publisher to block out
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:50.000]  large parts of it and Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shavers one of the chief
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.600]  officers over a stratus ivy or the head of that and also involved deeply in able
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:05.040]  danger and what is in the book is what he told Congress and and so much came
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.480]  out as the book and near its publication backing up everything he talked
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.120]  about that I think that's one of the biggest reasons they've tried to
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.640]  suppress your book am I wrong in saying that Colonel no I think you're right I
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.560]  think there's there's three things in popular media right now that you can
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.720]  refer to and very easily pick it up as a matter of fact my fellow author of my
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.640]  publisher is general Hugh Sheldon his book is just out and he actually talks
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.680]  about the existence and success of able danger and and and and and on page 280
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.360]  283 so right there's a clue the the next big clue that people have talked about
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.560]  and a little bit is a book called horse soldiers where general Jeffrey Lambert
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.520]  talks about the fact that not only did we discover Muhammad at all as part of
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.640]  able danger that he was briefed on he admits this we he was the guy who
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.880]  who prohibited me from moving the FBI the information to the FBI relating to
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.320]  the 9-11 terrorist and then most most damning I think was a Fox News thing
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.880]  which was done recently I think within the last two weeks relating to the fact
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:09.360]  that they got a hold of the DOD and Inspector General report God bless them
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.160]  for getting a copy that there was unredacted which means they could go
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.680]  out and talk to the actual individuals the DODIG had tried to hide the
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.760]  individuals by basically coding everybody which made it you know kind of a
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.880]  gobbledook and you really couldn't make heads nor tails of who said what and I
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.560]  think they did it for a reason they used the privacy act as excuse but I think
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.120]  clearly their intention was something different well anyway they got a copy of
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.520]  the unredacted report with the names and of course the first thing any good
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.800]  investigative organizations going to do is go back and check and that's what they
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.480]  did they went back and re-interviewed folks and showed these folks their
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.120]  testimony I'm sorry the the interview results basically the summary of what
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.800]  was attributed to them and I think everybody they talked to said that's
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.240]  that's not what I said that's not remotely what I said and oh by the way
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.440]  they left out key and you know key information to include the fact that in
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.680]  one instance one of the witnesses talked about the fact that she had she was
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.560]  the one who discovered the Muhammad Ataf photo so it's kind of like you know
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.240]  those are kind of big facts and why would you leave those out if not for the
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.680]  fact that you had a narrative you wanted to to say that what you know that any
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.840]  facts the counter to that narrative would be deleted so yeah I think your
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.760]  your listeners can can go check for themselves a lot of this is coming out
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.600]  now and I think one of the grand ironies and all this Alex is DoD right
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.560]  before that story on the DoD IG report came out the DoD and spokesman said
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.800]  they stand by the report so you got to ask yourself what's going on if they
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.320]  still stand by a report which has clearly been proven to be less than than
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:39.480]  accurate and and why would they be standing by an inaccurate port if not
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.480]  for some reason well Colonel in a nutshell for new listeners and they've
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.880]  heard about able danger they've heard about colonel Schaefer but they heard
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:52.040]  about your book being suppressed but they're you know what's the bottom line
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.320]  of the story and and and correct me if I'm wrong it's that elements of the army
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.880]  headed up by you and others knew the attacks were coming knew who the people
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.760]  were wanted to take them out and you were blocked from doing that and some of
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.480]  that came out at the time you know armies angry colonels are angry you know
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.640]  they have been lauding and atta in their sides they were told to stand down and
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.160]  then the media spun it well it was a turf battle the CIA and private
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.960]  contractors you know weren't sharing information or they wanted to be able to
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.720]  you know be the ones that gave the green light kind of like its branches of the
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.880]  regular armed services fighting with each other but I mean in a nutshell boil
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.400]  down what able danger was doing as much as you can say and what the book gets
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:41.520]  into on that subject well yeah I mean able danger was essentially a pre-911
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:48.360]  designed in the 99 time frame to be an offensive and this is very critical for
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.720]  your listeners to understand this was an offensive capability so often in
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.200]  Department of Defense we defend things this was something meant to be something
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.240]  we could go out and take take proactive action and that's the key here to go
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.800]  after global terrorism and the primary focus was al-qaeda that's that's very
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.880]  clear with what the objective was within the context of that then we started
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.800]  doing and I'll be I can't get into the specific operational objectives but I
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.640]  can say that the data mining thing is but one aspect of it and this is that the
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.240]  data mining thing while crucial and has become the public face of it there is a
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.360]  lot more to it than that that still cannot cannot be talked to talked about
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.040]  for any number of reasons but they do relate to the fact that the idea was to
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.600]  go after these guys offensively and within the the ramp up any good
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:35.120]  operation you have a period of time you're trying to do planning you're
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.880]  trying to put things together the ramp up portion included the data mining
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.720]  effort which was to map al-qaeda and and alex there was some turf battles and
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.040]  this is one of those things that recently Michael shoyer and I were on on a
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.080]  show together and I think he and I publicly disagree about specific
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.680]  operational issues because I think there was competition but the one thing I
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.400]  think he but you know I both agreed on is that the aftermath of whatever you
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.640]  want to call happened there was no and there's no intention of taking
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.600]  information from him or me to try to put the pieces back together with that said
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:13.920]  let me continue on the able danger issue able danger then was was created we we
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.520]  put a blue ribbon team together general Peter schoonaker commander special
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:23.280]  operations command was the the really the protector of it and the idea was to be
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.600]  prepared on call to go after al-qaeda and not to interfere with what alex station
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.720]  and has been the great new discussion public discussion about alex station
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:37.040]  alex base and what they did to target men lot and for covert action we were
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.320]  not going after been a lot and we were going after the infrastructure looking
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.240]  at that elements of that infrastructure for purposes of understanding it
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.160]  primarily and then at some appropriate time using a variety of techniques and
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.320]  ten procedures to do something to degrade it to make it less effective than
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.000]  it might be and that's where the mystery deepens by the fact that we had
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.880]  continued to work until essentially january of 2001 at which time everything
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.840]  stops there was a briefing to general Hugh Shelton that this was made public
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.160]  and then that's where this the trail kind of ends so you were blocked bottom line
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.960]  from frustrating al-qaeda that's absolutely that's that's a great summer
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:21.480]  yes that's that's that's essentially the the bottom line of what happened yes
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.960]  okay let's let's get to the I mean the heart of this I'm sure you know about
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:33.000]  civil Edmunds FBI translator she's broken her gag order in court headline
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:41.400]  CIA in control of al-qaeda up until day of 9-11 she's listening to people inside
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.680]  our government talking to al-qaeda leadership and you know you see that you
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.280]  think this woman has no reason to lie then we have this Fox News headline
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:56.480]  yesterday exclusive al-qaeda leader dined at Pentagon just months after 9-11
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:03.080]  and war al-alaki he's the guys reportedly behind the Fort Hood nut he's the guy
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:09.720]  behind the underwear dud he's the guy behind the Times Square we're told he's
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:17.000]  always in contact and then the CIA for two years knows that he's talking to to
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:26.240]  this army officer the psychiatrist right and and I mean this is amazing what
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.560]  do you say to that well this is what is where you and I may disagree I don't know
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:37.400]  I am I'm trying to keep my faith in the government as best I can and I for my
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.840]  own personal experience I've seen huge incompetence and I know that a lot of
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.960]  folks think there may be something more to that I honestly don't know I'll say
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.720]  this the only way we're going to get to the bottom of anything relating to
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:54.720]  on while alaki the relationship between he and the Department of Defense and
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.920]  frankly the FBI the FBI at one point in time if you check the record of Fox
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.400]  News is reporting on this they actually canceled an arrest warrant for him he he
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.040]  was here illegally by the fact that he was there was a warrant out for his arrest
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.760]  because he fraudulently came to the United States as a foreign student and
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.440]  had his college paid for well it's the same thing with a SWAT the supposed
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:21.920]  mastermind of 77 BBC headline a SWAT MI6 protected after the tax I mean here
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:27.000]  you've got somebody having dinner at in a big meeting with the Secretary of the
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.600]  Army who's a supposed college student who the news is already saying is
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:35.760]  involved in 9-11 but if I try to go get into the Pentagon you know I'm not
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.560]  going to be able to meet with a sergeant I mean I mean this is amazing and I
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:45.360]  then your point is well taken my on my Facebook page I posted the very thing
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.360]  you're talking about regarding a dining in people went wild over I mean it's
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.080]  very clearly something people are concerned and should be concerned about
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.680]  and this goes back to the original point of why you and I are talking here
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:59.640]  today I think there's a narrative out there no matter no matter what is behind
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.040]  it there is a narrative which people are dissuaded from from pursuing and that is
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.920]  the narrative of truth trying to find out what exactly happened there's there's
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.120]  this alternate history that's been put forward by the 9-11 Commission which
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.240]  clearly states and their bottom line is 9-11 was was not preventable and we just
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.400]  have to accept that fact well I argue that fact to the point of being blue in
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.280]  the face I think that is that is just started with the preset statement that
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.080]  this was not preventable and we're and we're not going to look at how this
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.760]  happened we're gonna look at what we should do and the answer is a police
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.000]  state well and then to back you up on that a little bit here too just look at
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.680]  what happened over the last few days Alex with them with Leon Panetta over at
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:48.080]  CIA and tragically there was seven CIA officers and two guards lost last year
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.800]  at Camp Chapman and the answer there and I'm just mathled by this as Leon
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.400]  Panetta's comments as Director of CIA well mistakes were made but we're not
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:01.640]  going to fire anybody so you know you got to ask yourself why would people like
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.760]  me get fired over you know trivial allegations which didn't stand up to
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.960]  any legal process you know that I'd actually lose my clearance and my job
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.600]  over while others who you know literally allow tragedies to happen where
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:20.120]  loss of life are the prime outcome and nothing ever happens bad I'm fascinated
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:24.000]  by the disparity of the standards within our own government well remember the
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.280]  record up until that time in 2001 the record FBI bonuses were given to the
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.080]  specific leadership that blocked all of the good FBI people who were on the
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.360]  hijackers nationwide right and I think that's a what point well taken and I
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.800]  like your listeners understand that there are still good people in the
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:46.640]  government is just that they are often ridiculed set aside limited their put
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.840]  in places of limited scope because of the fact that people like me like stern
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.960]  trouble up and the trouble to them is just getting your job done well Colonel
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:58.080]  Schaefer I mean look I've got a lot of family who's been in the Army and and
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:03.920]  almost anyone I've talked to who's been in the Army and my family the CIA tried
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:07.680]  to recruit them and one of them was recruited and got out of it because he
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.240]  just says it was completely criminal stuff inside the US drugs you name it in
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.960]  Chicago and you know the CIA is constantly getting caught with airplanes
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.840]  crashing full of cocaine I mean my whole issue is we know the government's got a
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.840]  lot of good people in it on the light side but you've got the dark side that
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:27.200]  basically operates as a mafia and you know I mean there needs to be an
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.840]  investigation of why one of the top al-Qaeda masterminds the government
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.640]  tells us and more alalaki is hanging out with the top brass two months after 9
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.880]  11 I mean that's a big deal and I think there needs to be an entire relook at
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.880]  least in the defense side of the very issue I mean I I support a lot of folks
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.120]  that you and I both have friends on Facebook they all they have all called
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.960]  for a new investigation I support that but if nothing else if nothing else we've
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.760]  got a call into account for these actions you just mentioned I mean why on
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.160]  earth would you have done this there's other things regarding alalaki which are
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.600]  still very peculiar I'll say that without getting into some too dramatic as
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.800]  well as the 9-11 issues regarding able danger I mean it's one of those
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.040]  situations where you know it's very clear that I hit a sore spot again by
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.480]  merely putting in and your listeners I hope they will go out and pick the book
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:19.920]  up at some point dark hard by the fact that I go through and painful detail to
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.360]  give the reader a good understanding of what happened in that room when I
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.520]  mentioned able danger doctor Philip Zellekow and Alex I hope you understand
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:34.760]  I went in there with as many facts that could be verified as possible so that
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:39.320]  he could leave that room and go back to the United States and pursue getting the
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.920]  document getting the information necessary and of course one of the big
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.120]  mysteries and this was something I will talk about because I had to threaten the
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.920]  the DOD editors when we went through my book again in in in early September that
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.480]  they actually tried to pull a paragraph out where I talk about the fact the
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.960]  fence intelligence agency allowed my 9-11 able danger documents to go missing
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.320]  and I had to threaten them I said look I'm not saying this is it you know you
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.640]  can pull a lot of crap out but this is the deal the moment you start pulling
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:11.560]  information out which relates directly to my congressional testimony you may do
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.880]  that but you will lose by the fact that will just stick a copy of my testimony
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.560]  in the back of the book and people will still see it so you've got to wonder why
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.840]  you know we're talking about information which in some cases is over 10 years old
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:28.480]  the disclosure was made in 2003 why would they be interested in and redacting
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.120]  information relating to that meeting if they're if they're not concerned about
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.040]  it so those that don't know and it's all in the book dark heart but I mean I
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.200]  mean tell us I mean what did what did Zellicow I mean what did you say to him
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.680]  about able danger that freaked him out well it was we were all in this room
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.320]  this is October 2003 in a combat zone and and Zellicow Dr. Zellicow and two
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.240]  other I'm sorry three other business staff were actually at Bob from doing
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:57.400]  kind of a whirlwind tour of the combat zone trying to find people who had pre
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:01.840]  9-11 intelligence that had not been previously provided to them essentially
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.640]  I think it was a very wise move to go out and just kind of you know hit the
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.840]  you know go out into the bush and see what what you find from knock knock
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:12.280]  rocks over with that said I don't think they really wanted to find out what was
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.080]  under those rocks based on what happened during this meeting I had a full
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.440]  hour to brief him at the end of the bottom about a 40 minute briefing where I
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.680]  did a point paper and laid out to him the full scope of a clandestine human
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:29.000]  often a human intelligence operation relating to able danger as well as the
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.440]  able danger project itself and at the end of that hour there was just stunned
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.080]  silence and I talked about the fact that we discovered the 9-11 hijackers at
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:43.440]  least at least for them that basically the who were in two of the three cells
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:48.000]  which conduct conducted a successful 9-11 attacks and and most notably at
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.360]  the end of the meeting after everybody was getting ready to leave Zellakow
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.320]  comes up to me presents his card to me and says what you said today is
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.440]  critically important I need you to come see me when you return to the United
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:03.240]  States after your tour here in Afghanistan so that was the result
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.840]  Zellakow being just I you know I can honestly say I think there was a a
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.480]  moment of being stunned by his entire staff and everybody in the room by the
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.520]  fact that talked about our finding Mohammed Atta and the other hijackers in
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:20.560]  our data in our data mining effort to target al-Qaeda and there was no doubt of
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.600]  his concern because he personally later admitted before I performed my hearings
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.480]  in 2006 that yes they were they did go back and check on able danger but
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.520]  according to them the Pentagon only gave them two briefcase of you know
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.080]  container-sized things and there was nothing in them and and this is the
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.560]  peculiar thing Alex you know that they've already been told they've already
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.600]  figured out now the Pentagon's lied to them about a number of things relating to
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.680]  the attack the norad issues and some other things but for some reason Zellakow
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.640]  still backs the Pentagon on this one issue saying oh no we're sure that the
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.200]  Pentagon is telling us the truth so anyone who's been around Washington any
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.840]  any like the time understands the moment someone does something like that where
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.440]  you know they've been lied to multiple times but this one thing that they're
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.080]  telling the truth on you know they feel they're telling the truth on that means
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.640]  there's something there and I think your listeners are very intelligent and can
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.440]  figure out for themselves that there's some reason they don't want this to be
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.200]  talked about and they're continuing this effort to suppress me and and what I
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:19.280]  talk about as best they can and I think in this case with my book it backfired
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.520]  on well absolutely and Colonel I mean a lot of people don't know this but it's
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.200]  been in the news but it hasn't gotten the attention it should six of the ten
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.560]  commissioners of the 9-1 commissioner on record saying the Pentagon has been
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.880]  involved one of them use the term in a criminal cover-up and that we were
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.440]  lied to by the Pentagon and the White House and then along comes a colonel
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.800]  who is not corrupt and backs up that information and they're trying to
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.600]  suppress your book when a lot of what's in your book I've now had a chance to
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.280]  read most of it has already come out in pieces and been confirmed in other
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.360]  declassifications other books that have been written it's just that you put it
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.240]  all together and have a conclusion that they don't like I think it's absolutely
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.920]  correct I think when you put the whole of the totality together you start seeing
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.120]  a picture emerge and and this is one of the things you know the army God bless
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.240]  them were very good about making me making me forcing me during the initial
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.560]  review and let me be very clear here there are there is a lot of information
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.880]  that was truly classified regarding things I did in Afghanistan that we
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.160]  cannot talk about because it is it is truly classified what that said the
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.880]  army made me source everything I actually hired a researcher who went
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.560]  through and found open sources of pretty much everything in the book and my
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.280]  objective here Alex was not to reveal secrets but to was was to create a
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:47.080]  narrative a true narrative that showed factually what happened what went wrong
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.320]  and not only regarding the able danger thing but the larger war in Afghanistan
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:56.080]  why things have gone so badly wrong there and my the last chapter which you'll
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.680]  see in the book there is the path to victory where I actually sat down and
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.640]  and and worked on coming up with reasonable courses of action for the
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.320]  future to include I went to Ireland did did some original research talking to
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.720]  folks in Northern Ireland regarding the Irish peace process and that's probably
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:14.120]  what they really don't like is that you're now trying in their view to
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:19.600]  quote metal in policy when when all that's really happening is they're
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.080]  meddling and things are you know getting worse and worse over there well and I
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.080]  think that's the problem you know when you and there's been some future
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.480]  mistakes here Alex let me just say a couple things for your listeners which
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.080]  are obvious but I think people that the president in particular is not not done a
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.520]  good job picking up on we announced the surge and then we announced the five
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:41.400]  provinces we were putting people into and I've always talked about this is a
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.280]  Ken to would you would you have told the British to tell the Germans hey by the
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:47.840]  way we're only gonna hit four beaches on D-Day these are the beaches so just be
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.640]  prepared for us to hit on June 6 we didn't do that and then the other thing
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.880]  when you start looking at the actual effects of what we're doing this New
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.600]  York Times article from two days ago talked about us being able to basically
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.600]  just just slicing up the Taliban doing a great job of taking Kandahar back of
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.600]  course it took us six months to do that and Amid Wali Karzai the president of
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:12.440]  the current the current governor of Kandahar and the Kandahar province talks
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.920]  about by the way the brother of president Karzai president of
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.520]  Afghanistan comments that well yeah I'll do the Taliban have left but we know
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.560]  don't know where they went well of course not it's like trying to nail you
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:29.200]  know jelly to the wall by the way his brother is the biggest opium dealer and
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.560]  then that's I think been very well reported on by a number of credible
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:36.840]  sources but the fact that you know that that the reason it's drug problems is
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.440]  as prominent as it is not only because of the Taliban but because of elements
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.760]  other than the Taliban possibly you know official elements being engaged in that
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.560]  very issue and that's why you see that's one of the reasons you see the
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.440]  slippage in Marja Marja was supposed to be the textbook example of how we're
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.320]  going to secure the rest of the country and you and I both know Alex that's
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.240]  essentially stood back into chaos now so when you look at that the actions of
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.840]  how we've done things why we're doing them you you've really got to ask
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:06.880]  yourself and I and this is why I was one of the reasons I wrote the book is for
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.320]  the American people to ask some really hard questions what do we hope to
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.760]  accomplish when everybody to include president Obama's talked about the fact
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:18.920]  that the real issues are not in Afghanistan they are in Pakistan and
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.440]  until we take those issues seriously we will continue to essentially make no
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:30.400]  progress let's talk about your plan you're I mean you've been there you've
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:36.920]  been through it you've tried to study the region your idea for you know ending

[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.360]  summing up your experience there and now watching what's happening in Afghanistan
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.800]  and Pakistan where do you see the war going versus where you think it should
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:40.200]  go I think the one critical issue Alex we've continued to not fully understand
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.240]  and and deal with is the fact that the real insecurity of that region has to
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:48.960]  do with the Cold War between India and Pakistan the Pakistanis are far more
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:52.680]  worried about the Indians in a nuclear program and rightfully so because anyone
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.160]  you anytime you have people on your board of nuclear weapons you you have
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:01.840]  reason to be concerned with that said you Afghanistan's become essentially a
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:07.440]  smaller microcosm of proxy warfare much like we did during the Cold War with the
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:10.720]  Soviets when we were facing off with them everybody else fell into one of two
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:16.200]  camps that them or us and I think what you've seen here lately is the Indians
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.080]  and and for any number of reasons attempting to gain some access to the
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.520]  packet to the Afghan region they built a power plant they've done other things
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.920]  commercially and the at the frankly the Afghans have partnered with them on some
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.640]  things which have made the Pakistanis very uncomfortable and so you've got
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.160]  things like the iconic network one of the the prime elements of the Taliban and
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:43.760]  for the your listeners understand the Taliban is not a monolithic self-managed
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.440]  organization it is a tapestry of some organizations often of which have their
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:53.120]  own objectives relating to their own area of the of the of the country we're
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.720]  talking about tribes which have been there for thousands of years who will
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:00.640]  probably always be there in some form so it is this is not a cohesive state so
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:06.240]  the Taliban have been successfully in some cases co-opted by the the Afghan
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.400]  the I'm sorry the Pakistani intelligence service which I talk about in my book the
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:14.760]  economy network in particular has become a proxy for the the Pakistanis to go
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.360]  after the Indian interest in Afghanistan to include launching attacks so the
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:23.480]  reason I bring this up as a specific is to illustrate the larger issue the fact
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:29.640]  that we've got to focus not only on the Afghan government because frankly I don't
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.320]  see why we are focused on the Afghan government we have a number of other
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.000]  allies in the region who are not democracies and I cite for you the
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.640]  Jordanians and the Saudis who seem to be doing fairly well as a government but
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.640]  are not in any shape or form a democracy so why are we pushing so hard for a
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.320]  Jeffersonian style democracy if we're you know you're talking about people who
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.840]  think in terms of the 10th century so I think we're trying to push a noodle up
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:36:00.440]  the hill with no even perception of a good outcome for us I think we need to
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.720]  be focused on Pakistan and Pakistan's nuclear weapons and in addition to the
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.320]  Cold War Alex with what we need to be worried about is the fact that the both
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:14.360]  the Taliban elements in Pakistan and al-Qaeda have stated clearly with without
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:20.540]  any sort of clarification other than that they're intended to obtain and use
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:26.320]  nuclear weapons from the Pakistani arsenal against us and if you look back
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.040]  on the 9-11 attacks there were actually warnings available to us saying that they
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:34.240]  intended to do attacks on us which have been widely talked about so there's no
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.840]  reason to say that they won't do that now well Colonel Colonel yeah I mean
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:43.240]  here's my issue clearly Pakistani intelligence has has ran you know the
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:47.240]  major elements are organized that did the the different tribes right with the
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:53.000]  U.S. in that nine-year war or 10-year war with the Soviets and then General
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.720]  Hamid Ghul our media says is this great hero back then now our media implies
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.600]  you know that that that he's somehow this big leader but he's come on this
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:07.440]  show to say look your drone attacks all of this it's just stirring people up this
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:15.440]  is a destabilization operation so so my issue is I hear that there's all these
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.780]  Pakistani intelligence connections to the different Taliban groups which of
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:23.600]  course are in their country what do you expect and but I see more connections
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.240]  with our Pentagon you know like a locky you know have a dinner with us with the
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:32.360]  head of the army then I do the Pakistani intelligence so so so me are you
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:35.960]  saying Pakistani intelligence is running attacks against our troops or what
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.000]  elements and what do you think of General Hamid Ghul why well let me I'll
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.800]  say let me answer that in two pieces first regarding the the destabilization
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:49.200]  I could not agree with the Amid Ghul more that I think we have destabilized
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:54.360]  Pakistan by our actions I agree with them 110% the the basic fact is this we
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.240]  don't understand the culture while I talk about that in my book I recommend it
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.000]  to your listeners to pick up and yeah clearly we don't understand the culture
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.960]  and by our our fumbling around in that region we have helped destabilize the
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.680]  Pakistanis we put them in a position where they have to to basically split
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.200]  themselves regarding their own self-interest which has resulted in the
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.280]  chaos you now see with that said yeah I do believe there's elements of the ISI
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.640]  who have encouraged the Taliban to maintain its AA and insurgency in
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.280]  Afghanistan which resulted in the death of US troops I'm not saying that the I
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.680]  mean Ghul himself has been involved but I think that there are elements are and
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.200]  I've had friends of mine in the media who have been there embedded with the
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.760]  Taliban and gone across the border into Afghanistan the Taliban is Afghanistan
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:37.600]  so what you're basically saying is just like India is trying to influence
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.280]  Pakistan is trying to influence the United States is trying to influence
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:45.360]  right yes and with that said then I think the best thing we can do is pull
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.680]  ourselves out and I do agree about the drone strikes as well I've gone as
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.960]  matter of fact it's been ironic I've gone on several networks to include one
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:55.360]  where a you know I'm fundamentally a conservative thinker and I had a
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.240]  liberal telling me that they thought the drone attacks was the best thing since
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.160]  sliced bread which I just found fascinating coming out of a liberal but
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:07.200]  was that said no I think the the drone strikes are hugely destabilizing and
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.360]  and I've off I've used this I think before and we you and I may have talked
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:15.200]  about this how long how often how long would it last for us to be you know
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:21.000]  lovin missiles into the southwest border where you know we got a guard a drug
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.560]  cartel and say you know Nugolas coming across the border and yeah we fire off
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:30.000]  one of these these drones you know fire off a missile and kill you know five
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.880]  drug guys and we take out three families from my not North Dakota how long
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.520]  would that last here it wouldn't last very long so why do we have a different
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:41.800]  standard of attack in in in Pakistan where fundamentally if you don't have a
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.680]  clear shot and you take out what they call collateral damage you've then
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.280]  created additional generations of terrorists because obviously this
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:52.480]  region the world understands the idea very well of vengeance that's one of the
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.800]  driving forces exactly you talked about 10th century imagine I mean it's not
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:03.160]  just if we had drones attacking northern Mexico but bones attacking areas you'll
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.720]  in Texas you IE Pakistan and just that fundamental primitive level of it's like
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:14.560]  Skynet has death birds in the air raining hellfire missiles you know down
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.680]  on us I mean that is going to create people that are going to fight back
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.040]  because of vengeance because of a debt to score a blood debt an eye for an eye
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.240]  and then it they're called terrorists but I mean bottom line if somebody kills
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.960]  your family what would you do maybe that's the policy order out of chaos they
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:35.920]  want to go in and get Pakistan's nukes they want to destabilize Pakistan they
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.160]  want to have a radical Muslim uprising as a pretext to go into Pakistan and
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.880]  that's what general Hameed ghoul and others have said on this show they
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.400]  believe is the real end game I you know that's one of those things where you and
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.320]  I may disagree about the fact is the fact and what you're what you're
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.040]  stating essentially are the facts is there they're now kind of self identifying
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.080]  yeah the fact is that we are we have and I believe we can we you know one of the
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:04.640]  things my think tank is done is we actually by just taking a step back and
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:09.480]  looking at the facts do believe that by the u.s. inability and again you may
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.080]  tribute it to a to a deeper objective I attribute it to basically incompetence
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.400]  not understanding what the hell we're doing the fact that we by the by our
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.680]  very actions have helped destabilize Pakistan and it resulted in the
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:26.560]  government being probably the least able it's ever been and since it was an
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.800]  inception in nineteen I believe nineteen forty seven and it's not going to get
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:34.160]  any better by the fact that we continue to do the very bad acts to help to
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.640]  stabilize and you've got this nationalistic long you know hundreds
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:43.360]  year-old plus I mean Pakistan and India had what two wars last century alone
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:48.760]  big ones with each other and they've got disputed areas in Kashmir I mean if I
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.000]  was India I'd be wanting to bury the hatchet and work with Pakistan but
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.640]  either side doesn't want that and and and this could get so so what is your
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:00.800]  plan from the deep research you've done and and being over there you in the
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:05.640]  culture deep what is your plan to extricate ourselves from the region
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.120]  well first thing I would do for the president I would declare victory and
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.640]  leave Afghanistan tomorrow and I would just say we've done our job we've no
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:16.640]  longer we've not had a terrorist attack mounted from Afghanistan since we
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.240]  invaded it's time to leave and with that and I would not completely like leave
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.440]  the country I think that we would probably leave about 20,000 troops mostly
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:30.440]  special operations guys there to focus on just elements that we need to focus on
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.480]  to make sure that no other terrorist training camps are created things like
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.400]  that basically trying to fundamentally make sure that things don't happen as
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:42.400]  they did in the late 80s early 90s where you know we basically left the
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.440]  country for anyone to go in there and do what they wanted and then work with the
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:48.840]  Pakistanis and the Indians to negotiate a peace process one of the things I
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:53.080]  found very helpful and again you may disagree with me on this but General
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:57.280]  Petraeus said two weeks ago that we need to establish a northern Ireland peace
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:01.720]  process for the region and you've been saying that six months ago so maybe
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.080]  they're listening to you why it's interesting I hope maybe Joe Petraeus
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.640]  actually got one of the copies of the unredacted books before they shredded
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:11.080]  it the Pentagon but yes he actually said that and I think it's notable and
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:16.680]  here's why the northern Ireland peace process one which was very bloody and
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:19.240]  this is what this is one of the notable things I'm not sure if your listeners
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:26.080]  fully understand that was not a pleasant process it took both sides at one
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.280]  point in time essentially self-eliminating that the most extreme
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.480]  elements of their of their of their of their ranks and it was one of those
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:38.440]  things where it was breaking a pathology what we have now as a pathology we
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:42.160]  have generation after generation kind of doing the same thing and we need to
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:46.480]  find a way to give them alternative things to do and you know these folks
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:50.200]  are going to be tribal they've been tribal for thousands of years there's no
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.440]  reason to believe that they're going to behave differently and come to the 21st
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.360]  century understanding of society and it's a lot cheaper to to to not have
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:02.680]  trillion-dollar wars but to actually build some schools and roads and and I
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:06.720]  mean just just give cash payments to every person in Afghanistan I've seen
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.760]  the breakdown it'd be a lot cheaper to do that than to continue this right
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.560]  exactly and then and then look I gotta say abandon the cars like government if
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:20.080]  it survives on its own wonderful if not then so be it we have because because
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:23.680]  we're claiming we're giving them democracy but it's the opposite everybody
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.840]  knows he's been stealing these elections right and then that makes us
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:31.280]  look hugely stupid Alex in the eyes of the world you know where is our
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.240]  standards here for actually knowingly supporting a dictator they want to be
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.320]  able to self-determine that's what you're saying that's what I'm saying and I
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.520]  think that's the best course of action for us to not determine for them what's
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.120]  best for them I think that's arrogant and socially you know gonna get us in
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:48.160]  trouble by the fact we are then trying to nation-build not not do what's
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:51.120]  necessary to support our own well really isn't it just the liberal control
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:54.360]  freaks just just love to control countries well it's interesting because
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.720]  one of the things that I don't get me wrong I when I was there on the ground
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.440]  and there's I talk about this in my book about the fact that when I was down in
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:03.560]  Kabul what we would do little the little kids would come up and want to be our
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.920]  quote-unquote bodyguards know and this was them kind of taking us around the
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:10.640]  shops and they would get kicked backs from us and the shop owners and I
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.080]  always made a point to pick a female bodyguard which drove the elders crazy
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.840]  because you know well that's really a little boys work not a woman's work
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.560]  with that said the liberals have have made a cause of this where they're
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.320]  saying well you know if we leave the Afghan women will be will be you know
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:30.160]  they're victimized you know as much as that is tragic and I feel personally
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.240]  bad about it it is not our job to determine every single societies what's
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.640]  good and what's bad for them I mean I know that sounds harsh but you know the
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:42.320]  idea of securing a country just simply because we have a social requirement to
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:46.380]  do so you know we're we're not we just don't have you know that's a cover
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:51.060]  because the same quote liberals love robot drone attacks that blow up whole
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:55.680]  weddings right and that's it right and so we have imprecise use of force which
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.640]  I think has caused more harm than than good so yeah the bottom line Alex is we
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.680]  need to step away from what we're doing and step away from the cars like
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:06.240]  government allow the tribes to exist and come to come together or not come
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.920]  together as they want and this is a problem we've we face now to the time
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.400]  one of the reasons the Taliban has been so effective and this is again self
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:18.040]  evident but not something that readily is discernible from just looking at the
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:24.200]  news when when we came in there and oh oh two oh three and then begin work the
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:29.720]  Taliban were hated because of their rigid former Sharia law well break break we
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.080]  got all this time goes by and and the very thing that's drawing them to the
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.280]  people of Afghanistan is this very very rigid former Sharia law because the
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:42.520]  central government cannot give them justice one of the things the central
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.360]  government has completely failed to do is be fair and as you pointed out
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.440]  essentially it's become a dictatorship it has no relevance to the Afghan people
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:54.000]  so when faced with two alternatives often they will choose the least the less
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.760]  less bad in the last bad less bad one of the two and in this case they rather
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:01.920]  than some cases they get they will go to the Taliban to resolve disputes because
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:05.440]  the government is as even when they bribe the government they can't they can't
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.640]  get it less it makes the Taliban look like heroes when they're going up against
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:14.240]  the you know the the the powerful us eagle right exactly so you've got to
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:17.880]  consider the fact that you know when you look at the that what's going on what
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.480]  the real facts are and what we're accomplishing you've got it you know I
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:26.000]  still question the policy and then you know in the end we're talking about
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.520]  withdrawing under a conditions-based relief where you know this war we
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:34.520]  were supposed to draw down but I I have yet to be able to find anyone who could
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:38.200]  tell me or finding any any specific instances on the internet and what
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.720]  those conditions are going to be next July so if they don't go with your idea
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.360]  or other people's you know to end this nightmare briefly kernels run out of
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.840]  time and I could talk to you for 10 hours you're so gracious to be with us I
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:53.920]  mean how do you see this ending or what direction do you see it going in if they
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.160]  don't inject sanity into the process well I think we're talking about the end
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:02.520]  of the very similar to the Soviets when when we we know when we leave begin
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.600]  leaving next summer the Taliban as far as I can tell it's not stop this
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.880]  momentum and don't forget everybody's there that we're going to send there
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.320]  now so it'll probably end with you know instead of us driving across the freedom
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:17.520]  bridge will be us you know convoying out to cut to Karachi and letting things go
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.240]  back to the chaos they were before because I just know why we're going to
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.840]  be able to stabilize maintain the cars like government unless we're there
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.120]  holding their hand and I just don't see that happening next two years I want to
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:30.000]  shift gears and get back into the book after the break in our final segment
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.760]  books Darkheart operation Darkheart will give me the website folks but it's in
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:37.480]  bookstores everywhere it's a best-seller briefly have you seen the Fox
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.320]  News piece and AP pieces where they go and talk to Marine Corps kernels on
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:48.440]  video and that our military gives them fertilizer and helps them grow the opium
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.960]  and I understand the argument well if we don't do this you know then they'll
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:57.920]  hate us even more but I mean it productions off the charts and our
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:01.960]  military controls most those borders and the conduits to ship out and you know
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:04.920]  how many times in Vietnam and right through the military has been caught
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.120]  and contractors have been caught and that's coming out in federal depositions
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:13.160]  dealing with the XE formerly blackwater that you know the people running this
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:16.640]  system they don't care because it's a black hole to pump money into they get
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.400]  to launder the drug money I mean have you seen the news clips where Geraldo's
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.560]  up there and the Marine Corps Colonel is admitting they're help helping grow the
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.760]  opium I'm aware of those and the thing is when I was there in 03 I can I can
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:34.240]  cite for you specific experience I've had on this we knew in 03 that the drug
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:39.320]  groups were essentially starting to research and put things together and we
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.960]  purposely at that time Alex turned a blind eye to it and the thinking was the
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.800]  policy thinking was if we don't allow them to do this they'll have no income
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:50.760]  and the the ultimate result has been obviously for other elements of the
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.320]  Afghan government and the Taliban to benefit from this illicit drug trade so
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:00.640]  you know there's really no new policy or no real effort to to stem the tide of
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.760]  the drugs for any number of reasons and I think it's one of those situations that
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:09.120]  that no one in the government is going to admit to the fact that that the you
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.320]  know if you look at what's going on the facts don't meet with the policy the
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.080]  policy is obviously we're trying to stop it but in the reality is you know I
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.120]  think we've done far more to give it lip service and actually take any action
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:24.160]  one way or another to actually try to stop it well like giving them
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:29.000]  fertilizer and helping guard it I mean that's not just taking no action I mean
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.840]  the productions off the charts and that's and again you got to ask yourself
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.840]  what are we trying to do there for allowing us to happen yeah well I mean
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:43.200]  it's hidden in plain view of it's 500 billion dollars opium 92% of world
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:48.840]  production it was down to like 10% you know with the hardcore nutty Taliban over
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:52.360]  there before mmm but we had to go into Afghanistan because the terrorists were
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:56.880]  over there now the open productions off the charts you don't think the CIA or
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.480]  the contractors would be doing something with that drug money soon we'll be
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.000]  shutting our doors and windows shutting out fresh air for months did you know

[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:44.480]  situation and looking at all the other things that are happening around the
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:51.680]  world I mean just recapping where do you see this ending well the problem is I
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:55.360]  think we've been so distracted with the Iraq and Middle East issues relating to
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.560]  the Iraq and that sort of thing I don't think we're actually posture to look at
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:03.280]  the future very well there there's some global competitors we have to start
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:08.560]  thinking about and the Chinese I think in particular are someone who you know
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.280]  are going to be our friends as long as we continue to make our payments we've
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:16.120]  got some huge debt with them which you know if we can't make the payments I
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.200]  think they may be become very mafia like and I think one of the things we
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:23.000]  neglected to watch carefully and this is something I actually studied back in
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.320]  the 90s the Chinese as a country as the government of China have the desire to
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:34.360]  become essentially the superpower of the Pacific Rim and we have two allies in
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:38.320]  particular besides the Japanese in particular and the South Koreans there's
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:42.480]  two other allies in that area the the Austrians and New Zealand defense and
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.840]  the New Zealand folks the Kiwi who are concerned about what's going to happen
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.360]  should the Chinese become much more dominant in that region and I think
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.720]  that's one of the things we have to be well they've already as you know taken
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.040]  over most of the mining for rare earth minerals that are key to missiles cell
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:01.840]  phones and China has announced they are cutting back on rare earth minerals to
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.200]  the United States and so that means we won't be able to make stuff here because
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.640]  they've been smart they've gone out in Africa and Australia and Latin America
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.040]  and South Texas and the Rockies wherever you can find these and they've
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:18.680]  literally created a 94% global monopoly over this they own most are dead I mean
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:23.200]  this Washington has completely destroyed this country's security and I think
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:27.240]  we've because of our own negligence have not been studying this as much as we
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:30.840]  should and trying to understand how to do how to play this as a chess game not
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.120]  as a checkers game so I think that's where we have some real problems coming
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:38.160]  up over the next 10 to 15 years and I think our kids God bless them will have
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:40.920]  to be dealing with this much more directly than we did and I think it's
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:44.280]  sad that we're gonna leave this legacy for them to deal with well the elites of
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.160]  this country made deals with the communist Chinese to accelerate and
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:52.320]  consolidate wealth and now we're gonna pay big time what's your take on just
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:56.800]  the state of the banking situation and the mortgage corruption and just I mean
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:01.560]  it's like Washington is just is just filled with with scum right and I think
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:04.480]  that's a problem we have we have people that don't have a lot of vision or
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.600]  integrity and I think that that translates badly for the larger country
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.040]  I think you're about to see some of that over the next few weeks in the
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:14.400]  elections coming up I think there's gonna be a backlash to a lot of the the
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.880]  status quo and and Alex this one of the things that I just did is a microcosm
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:23.080]  I think everybody has to have a certain level of integrity and and and self
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.760]  correction inside of them anytime I ran an operation I had a very simple test
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:30.800]  I would I had the Ed Bradley test and the Joe Sixpack test I'm not saying that as
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.320]  a pejorative I just wanted to explain it real quick if I whatever operation I was
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:38.720]  running I would always think in my head if Ed Bradley showed up at my doorstep
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.560]  would I be able to answer his questions correctly and honestly and still look
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:46.160]  good on 60 minutes that was one of my I believe I was one of my my my my things
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:50.920]  and secondly would Joe Sixpack with some individual male or female doesn't
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:56.680]  matter in you know the Midwest approve of my use of his or her taxpayer
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:01.840]  dollars and I think these are very very simple but I think you know good rules
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:06.840]  to go by so if I couldn't honestly you know say that my actions were related in
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:11.200]  some way to answering an affirmative one of those two questions then I figured
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:16.320]  I shouldn't be doing it well that's a simple but succinct way of doing it it
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.680]  makes a lot of sense we're gonna have five more minutes with you on the other
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:22.760]  side I want to get a little bit more into the book and and and some of the
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:28.160]  other things you can now talk about so just a few you know key points on that
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:32.120]  some bullet points and then I want to briefly ask you about cyber security and
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:36.960]  the Stuxnet worm on the other side we'll be back in 70 seconds with the third
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:41.560]  hour then Bob Chapman will be coming on info wars.com
[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:54.960]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:58.920]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:02.320]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:07.160]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:11.960]  name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:15.000]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.440]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:24.680]  needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:30.960]  includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:35.120]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:41.400]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:46.080]  system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:51.920]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[01:59:51.920 --> 02:00:06.400]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:13.720]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:23.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:33.840]  so Israel has all but admitted that they launched a Stuxnet worm now homeland
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.880]  security says we've got to have the Pentagon basically take the web over and
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:42.680]  be able to shut it down to protect it because of Stuxnet what's your take on
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.840]  this move to try to censor the web at the White House technologies are that's
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:53.800]  Holdren the White House regulations are cast Sunstein and others have called for
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:56.720]  are you concerned about all these different police state developments here
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:01.600]  oh absolutely I think the internet has functioned well by the fact that has been
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.320]  left as minimally touched by the government as possible I mean I think
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:09.560]  some initial things and this came out as your your your list is probably no
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:14.040]  lot of the the DARPA project relating to sharing information years ago and then
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:19.600]  you know kind of took on life of its own it is an organic organism and like
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.200]  anything that is organic it should be allowed to grow and and and transmute
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.960]  itself as necessary any government control or what they're proposing here
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:31.920]  this this the idea of like you said we need to be able to shut it down to
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:35.440]  protect it I think is but one more control thing that the government should
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:40.440]  not have any anyone who studies the net any in a given time and you can shut
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:43.920]  down parts of it is necessary the idea of taking over the whole thing is just
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:48.960]  it's a bit frightening so there's no reason ever to think about taking over
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:51.440]  the whole thing because there are so many background services there's
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:56.640]  communications going on constantly and and the the the telecommunications
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:00.080]  infrastructure of this country now depends on the internet there's nothing
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:04.320]  that happens today it is not somehow internet related so the moment the
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.720]  government determines that they want to shut down everything they would they
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:11.920]  would create literally Alex huge chaos in this country by essentially just
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:15.480]  turning off the spick and by creating the mechanism to be able to do it do it
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:19.880]  that adds that the problem with somebody taking it over and doing it and it
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:23.720]  creates technicians and experts that know how to do it who could sell that
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:28.040]  knowledge right exactly so I think we're much better off leaving it and diffuse
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:31.800]  leaving it as an organic kind of growing entity that that a lot of people
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:35.960]  have access to but no one organization owns this is what reminds me a walk back
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:38.680]  when the French wanted to actually make sure that the whole that their whole
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.160]  internet was only done in the French language which to me was loony the whole
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.440]  idea here is free exchange of information ideas and and and and commerce so
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:50.360]  again I don't think the government in any form should be the one trying to
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:53.800]  determine how you know to control it I think there are elements with certain
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.160]  within the internet the government has the right to control their own backbone
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:00.040]  there's there's super net nipper net there's all these things which run you
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:06.040]  know as as as sub sub yeah and they lie and say that you know that stuff's open
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:09.960]  to these worms when these worms have to be injected in internally well we're
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:14.720]  almost out of time but clearly the system is corrupt by and large it's scared of
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.680]  the people waking up and that's why they're wanting to do this operation
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.160]  darkheart.com promise me that the next few months you'll come back on to get
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:25.360]  more into more into darkheart because currently I could talk to you all day
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:29.160]  just such a such a great mind but in the last minute and a half anything else
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:33.360]  people should know about operation darkheart. Well the summary of the book
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:36.720]  I again encourage you to pick it up is it really does talk about the tipping
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:40.720]  point in Afghanistan I think we had a pretty good idea of what we needed to
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:45.200]  do to basically just let things happen and then things change dramatically you
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:49.760]  know three and I actually in the book there's a confrontation between General
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.840]  Barnaud the then commanding commander of forces and of course I was a major at
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:55.880]  the time so you know that obviously I was gonna lose that battle but I try to
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:58.640]  point out to him the insurgency is coming and we need to take action to
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:04.000]  prevent it or or limit it and his answer was well you know I don't I really
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.200]  don't care this is what he basically said we're gonna do things my way and
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:12.560]  that resulted in the course which we are currently on relating to nation building
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.800]  rather than trying to allow the Afghan people to determine their own future and
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.560]  that's and that's where we argue I argue the tipping point came it reads like a
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:22.720]  novel so I think your listeners will enjoy it as well as be educated by it
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:28.520]  so operation dark heart dot com we have links to it up at info wars dot com and
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:34.040]  prison planet dot com Colonel good luck Godspeed and I appreciate you having the

[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:45.680]  issues we're not gonna just cover the economy we're gonna get a bunch of other
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:49.320]  news I haven't even covered yet and then I'm gonna be getting on an airplane

[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:08.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.360]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.400]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.280]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:24.320]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:28.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:33.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:36.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:09.480]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:13.720]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for

[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:09.880]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we're
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:15.200]  going to Bob Chapman in a moment but I wanted to talk about this radio broadcast
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:21.320]  briefly and the news websites the films we make everything we do I think it's
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:25.160]  important for people to realize that it is a godsend that the internet and
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:31.760]  alternative media is still alive free and growing and I don't want people to
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:35.840]  including myself to take it for granted that any time they could launch a
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:39.440]  giant cyber attack and use it to shut down the web for a while and then come
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:43.320]  in with draconian rules in the aftermath to curtail free speech this is all
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:47.800]  being proposed by the White House this is being proposed by the Pentagon just
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.320]  heard Colonel Anthony Schaefer agree with me I mean this is happening if
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:54.400]  you're not aware of it you know we cover it at info wars.com and prison
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:59.520]  planet.com we are constantly attacked by sophisticated denial of service attacks
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:05.520]  we are constantly under attack we don't talk about it nine times out of ten
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:11.240]  last night somebody went into the Genesis GCN live.com servers you know
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:16.760]  corrupted things wrote over things you know that's a problem we went through
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:19.920]  over the years and we've gotten better and better at being able to stop it so
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:23.560]  they just do zombie attacks zombie computer attacks where they go take over a
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:28.320]  bunch of machines university machines in Tokyo whatever an attack is the system
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:32.840]  is demonizing us at every level why because we're effective and we're a
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:38.200]  platform for people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Max Kaiser and Gerald
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:44.400]  Salente and Bob Chapman and Anthony Schaefer and Ron Paul and Jesse Ventura
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.600]  and EPA whistleblowers I mean just think of the guest we have here in in our
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:53.480]  attempt to demonstrate and document with true credibility what's happening I
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.600]  mean the government knows sodium fluoride attacks children's organs and
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:02.840]  lowers IQs the government knows DU's deadly for troops the government knows
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:06.720]  that they've allowed mortgage companies to engage in fraud for over a decade
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:11.000]  all of this is out in the open but you got a bunch of people in fancy suits on
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.480]  CNN Fox up there talking about their credibility all day they have no
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:20.520]  credibility overall NPR fires Juan Williams for doing a classic cliche
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:24.920]  statement that everyone says oh I get scared when I see a guy in full Muslim
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.840]  dress but I shouldn't because when a white guy you know carries out a terror
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:34.960]  attack we don't blame all white people or and they're firing and then there's
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:38.840]  all these discussions about you know credibility and how credible NPR as
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.800]  NPR is a joke NPR was founded by the Rockefeller Foundation it then begs for
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:49.040]  money every month year-round they're in their big pledge drive right now and they
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:54.120]  raised tens of millions of dollars to sit there and feed you pro-war
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.160]  disinformation that they call liberal and Juan Williams point pointed out he's
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.560]  the only black person on air at NPR nationally that's the diversity of NPR
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:08.480]  okay now well whatever you think of what Juan Williams says I don't agree with
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:13.200]  much of what he says the point is that it just illustrated to me that oh this is
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:17.440]  now hurting NPR's fundraising because this happened this week in the bad
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:22.240]  publicity and somehow the media the dominant media which isn't so dominant
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:25.920]  anymore they've tried to convince patriot groups libertarians conservatives
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:31.480]  people that are anti-globalist that it's bad for us to ask for money that it's
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:36.800]  bad for us to build an operation that it's bad for us to sell a book think
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:40.720]  about that mind game and how crazy that is you've got tens of billions of
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:44.080]  federal money in behavior placements what the government calls it I call it
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:49.960]  propaganda placement with storylines and TV shows fictions you know dramas sitcoms
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:57.120]  cop shows CSI all of this that's programmed see the the mainstream media is
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:03.200]  a government outfit by and large NPR is totally a foundation outfit slash
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:09.800]  government and so if we could do so much more if people remember to support our
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.280]  sponsors to buy the books the videos the t-shirts it all gets the word out but
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:17.880]  plus it supports the overall operation if folks will give to the money bomb you
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:21.200]  know we've raised $420,000 sounds like a lot it's not when you're trying to
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:24.760]  finish a studio even with the cheapest gear out there that works and trying to
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:28.080]  get the people in place we could do so much more we weren't spending all our
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:32.320]  time trying to raise money people like well you have sponsors on and you you
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:35.080]  know you do this and you're pitching your videos yeah yeah like you know once
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:41.440]  a show what how we supposed to do this this is a real media operation it takes
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.720]  a lot of money and I don't have the Rockefeller's funding is I want to hit
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:49.840]  that $500,000 number and I hope a lot of people out there especially middle-class
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:52.840]  folks you know the government comes and raises your taxes and takes your money
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:56.760]  and then uses it for propaganda against you this is a vote with your dollars to
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:59.880]  say hey we're gonna support the alternative media and believe me this
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:04.160]  shows having a global effect the films the broadcast the news websites so you

[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:19.320]  without you I mean you know five years ago Genesis came this close to
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:25.040]  disappearing it was so in the red I mean that's the type of situations that go
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:28.560]  on that we could tell you about years later we couldn't do any of this without
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:31.520]  you we couldn't have 400 plus affiliates that's all the shows on Genesis
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:35.160]  without you we're having a huge effect I was I talked to guests all the time now
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:37.800]  they say they drive across the country they hear me on the radio all the time
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.480]  we're on a lot of stations now we're really breaking through but we're
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:45.120]  breaking through right at the point we're going into depression right at the
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.640]  point that everybody goes wow these people know what they're talking about
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.840]  right at the point that that happens the economy is falling apart so it's a
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:56.360]  catch-22 and I understand that but it's only going to get worse if we don't
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:59.560]  reverse this system I want to get into the economy a bunch of other news with
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:03.840]  Bob Chapman who I appreciate holding the international forecaster.com but
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:09.440]  but but Bob what's your take on what I just said or you always have a great
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:13.480]  way of crystallizing it boiling it down concisely but I mean what's your view on
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:20.200]  what I just said well first of all listening to the colonel and yourself
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:27.240]  earlier it just goes to show that the things that we thought were going on are
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:35.240]  going on and we're in danger of losing the internet at any given time with
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:40.160]  that said we have to get more powerful and yes we know there's a depression
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:46.400]  going on and it's got to get worse but we need you we need people throughout the
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:53.280]  entire world to be able to understand what's going on and Alex you know that
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:57.720]  but nobody knows it better than I because we have subscribers from
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:04.120]  everywhere and they say we've got the same problems we get the same kind of
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:08.320]  people behind the scenes running our country and there's lots of countries
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:13.280]  that people tell me that they're having those problems so we've got to do what
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:25.320]  we've got to do and Alex and Genesis as well needs funds and the generation of
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:33.600]  profits from Genesis goes into all these programs operating 24-7 reaching all
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:38.880]  over the world and so doing business not only with Alex and the things he's got
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:46.080]  he has for you but also Genesis itself well I mean Bob Bob and in the coins and
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:51.600]  in the Boolean go ahead no I mean Bob think about the in the spectrum of
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:58.080]  resistance Genesis Ron Paul the group of guests we have on the experts represents
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:03.200]  the most powerful constellation of resistance against the globalist we're
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:08.000]  it folks and think of the effects we've already had listeners just spreading the
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.960]  word about the radio show the films the websites just spreading the word about
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:17.160]  the information we're covering the the the the spectrum of powerful minds we
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:22.560]  bring together just that is already having a giant effect realize the
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:29.280]  immediacy and and and the seriousness of the time frame we're in on getting the
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:33.440]  word out that's the most important thing people spreading the word that's why
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:36.400]  we're having a bigger and bigger effect that's why we're under attack and as
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:41.640]  Bob said we need to be flush with cash not hurting for cash we need to be
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:46.360]  powerful we're doing something dangerous okay we're going head up against the
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:50.400]  criminals calling them out and not mincing words I mean that's a powerful
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:57.000]  thing isn't it Bob it certainly is and it's probably the basis to my history on
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:03.360]  the radio and I just felt to me when I was a little boy I said to myself gee if
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:07.600]  you tell a lie you have to tell about 20 of them to cover it so it's not worth
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:11.600]  it see tell people the truth all the time and that's what this is really all
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:15.440]  about well going back 40 plus years ago when you started fighting the globalist
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.320]  you're one of the only living above maybe a half dozen people icons out there I
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:23.600]  mean could a could you ever have imagined that the tyranny would actually go this
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:27.480]  far and and be could you ever imagine from the meager beginnings how many
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:34.680]  people we now reach well first of all we were running around with pamphlets the
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:39.280]  only one who made anything in the communications business beyond that was
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:43.600]  Anthony held it with his records and then his tapes and so we had a rough
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:51.120]  road fast as pamphlet in the west I used to say and and of course Gary and and
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:58.200]  Alan and and and gee it would Griffin or all writing books and I was too busy to
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:04.280]  do that but today it's totally different and it's it's totally different in as
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:08.520]  much as we're reaching just millions and millions of people every day we got to
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:12.680]  keep on doing it it's just like other newsletter writers say to me well how do
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:19.400]  you have time and why do you bother to answer people's questions personally and
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:26.360]  my answer is look this is why I'm here but also I do at 75 years old and so I
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:30.920]  help people and that's part of what I do and this is what's Alex is doing and
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:35.800]  this is what a Genesis is Genesis is doing for all of us so you got to be
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:41.960]  there for us well I mean my only point is we all need to have a gut check and
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:47.120]  realize where we all stand in this world and I don't like the fact that I'm one
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.680]  of the most preeminent people in the world fighting the globalist I mean
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:52.600]  it's not fun but it's something that's got to be done I just want people to
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:57.760]  really consciously realize why we're under so much sustained attack we'll

[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:24.040]  Bob Chapman's our guest the rest of the hour Bob I want to get into the economy
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:28.120]  but I say this every day now because it's just constantly hitting me it's one
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:32.520]  thing to intellectually coldly know the new older's plans to see them carrying
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:36.520]  it out it's another thing to be this deep into it and to see Time magazine saying
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:39.960]  will the Federal Reserve cause civil war to see the Pentagon admitting they're
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:43.960]  preparing to make war against the American people to see them federalizing
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:47.960]  with the fusion centers to see the CIA operating openly and foreign
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:52.800]  intelligence agencies spying on members of legislatures in Pennsylvania to
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:58.800]  really see it all manifesting now and to know we really were right in fact we
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.240]  were more than right it was worse than what we had thought it's just it really
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:09.880]  it makes me have gut checks just constantly about the amazing I I hoped
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:13.040]  always in the back of my mind even though I had all the documents that knew I
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:16.080]  was right that I was wrong I mean you know that feeling I mean don't you ever
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:19.200]  just just want to be wrong don't you ever want the government to turn out to
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:22.720]  have some good in it don't you ever wish it wasn't as bad but it always turns
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:26.480]  out to be worse do you see what I'm saying Bob absolutely and it and you
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:31.760]  always think about well it is bad but maybe we can turn the corner and that's
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:38.920]  where we're headed right now and we know what we said was correct just as you just
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.120]  said and so we have to go on this the assumption of all of the ideas for the
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:48.520]  future that we base upon the knowledge that we have in the history that we've
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:53.480]  seen that we're on the right track and all the listeners have to realize that
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:57.680]  and they have to spread the word about the program and we have to keep on
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:02.440]  digging deeper and deeper and deeper into all of these episodes that come out
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:07.280]  they pop up everywhere and in one of the good things about these episodes
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:13.880]  happening is that it just shows you over and over again how corrupt the system
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:20.360]  really is it's not because we say it is it's because it really is I mean just
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:25.600]  look at what happened in the last couple of weeks in regard to mortgage
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:30.680]  gate or foreclosure gate it it's absolutely dreadful but we have
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:36.760]  discussed this over the last three years on this program we didn't get into the
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:41.200]  intimate details of the foreclosure process but we said there was something
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:47.440]  wrong and particularly in the sale of the syndicated bonds that contained those
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:55.080]  mortgages which were a nightmare and you know I cannot understand why especially
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:01.960]  in Europe that took down 60% of that paper or those bonds as they called that
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:07.160]  they never made a complaint didn't that seem strange to you Alex yeah they're
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:10.920]  sold the same mortgages over and over again it's pure fraud it's certified as
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:16.960]  triple A rated and there's no complaining unbelievable and they're
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.720]  really at the beginning they were triple B paper which is like a four instead of
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:28.520]  a ten and now we have just had that they admit to the federal reserve 1.7
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:35.080]  trillion in what is called toxic waste which is those mortgages MBS CD it CDOs
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:42.480]  and ABS and what they've done is purchase these things and they won't
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.800]  tell us how much they paid for them from the banks to clear them off their
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:52.880]  books and my guess is 80 cents on the dollar and now they want to sell them
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:59.720]  back to them but 20 cents on the dollar and the loss in between goes to all of
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:05.720]  us we get to pay for it to bail off the banks again and it's things like this
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:12.600]  that within that structure of the we'll call it the real estate bubble fiasco
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:19.720]  there's so many facets to this thing and you know we saw about two months ago
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:29.560]  Goldman Sachs which stole about five billion dollars really wanted to be able
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:37.000]  to be found wanting but neither admitting or denying and they paid five
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:43.840]  hundred million dollar penalty now that absolves them of everything but they
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:50.520]  get to keep the other 4.5 billion this is the way this system works I I saw
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:58.600]  this milk and character on television this morning here's a man who stole
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:05.320]  three billion dollars and he gave one billion to the government and he got to
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:10.240]  go to jail for about a year a year and a half and he's got two billion dollars
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:14.560]  and now he's a celebrity because he got a lot of money and he's got a
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:23.360]  foundation this absolution for being a crook I mean doesn't anybody out there

[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:29.040]  get more into the economy in a bunch of other news about
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:35.180]  chairman I'm researching a story that I saw being discussed a few days ago in
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:41.000]  Australia the headline is trades hole president Kevin Bracken stands by as
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:47.200]  911 conspiracy very prominent and powerful head of the organization it's
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:52.680]  causing debates in the parliament dealing with this and he said look I'm not
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:56.600]  backing off my statement that it's an inside job I'm not a coward like the
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:59.920]  rest of you more and more people worldwide are coming out and saying
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:05.200]  inside job and they don't care what people say to them and it and and the
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:14.920]  poll in the newspaper showed that 67% believe it's an inside job I mean that
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:21.120]  has got to anger the the system over there some print some more articles on
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:26.520]  this and we're gonna be talking about it more but but Bob continuing with the
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:30.000]  economy and and and what quantitative easing means this announcement by the
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.560]  Fed that inflation is our friend to quote pay down our debt yeah like why my
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:41.360]  Republican Mexico well I think it's probably a propelling itself more
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:48.280]  toward a Weimar tow type of situation if you remember in this program three
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:54.280]  months ago I said that they were going to go to a QE to and I was ahead of the
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:35:02.040]  pack again and I was right and what I didn't know at the time was about three
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:08.560]  weeks prior to my saying that that the Fed had already gone into the bond
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:16.320]  markets again and into the what they call a repo market and they were buying
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:22.680]  and selling bonds in that process they're injecting money into the economy
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:30.240]  and this has grown since then over the past three months so I'm telling you
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:37.520]  this because QE to began three months ago they just didn't take the time to
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:44.280]  tell you about it and now you have this official announcement yes this terrible
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:51.560]  deflation is around again same story we had three three years ago and we got a
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:58.560]  jack this thing up and that's part of their excuse for doing so and we're
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:04.880]  going to have some pretty bad inflation and I'll tell you why here too for other
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:11.480]  governments have allowed the investment of dollars into their country and they
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:15.560]  haven't said too much about it one of the reasons why is they were all rigging
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:20.520]  their currencies and they've been doing it since the Second World War and in the
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:25.240]  process of doing there what they do we'll take Brazil as an example they'll
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:29.720]  print their currency and then they take the currency just like the Chinese do
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:35.680]  and they go and they buy dollars and that drives the value of their currency
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:43.520]  down at the same time they take the money and they buy US treasuries well the US
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:48.920]  never said much about it because what that does is it keeps inflation down in
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:53.320]  the United States because the goods coming into the country are cheaper and
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:37:01.000]  it also funds the debt so they didn't want to hear about it now they got a
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:06.760]  problem with the same characters in these different countries are not
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:12.680]  aggressively funding the debt anymore and they have starting to put up barriers
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:18.200]  against money coming into their countries in the form of dollars and that
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:25.040]  means if countries are not going to invite dollar-based investors into their
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:32.720]  country to buy bonds or or buildings or companies or whatever then that
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:39.000]  inflation that had previously been laid off on all those countries out there is
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.760]  going to back up into the United States so we're going to have more inflation
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:49.160]  than we had before and that's one of the arguments at this G20 meeting and on
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:55.520]  top of that at the G20 meeting I'm sure they're telling Mr. Geithner you people
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:38:00.240]  got to be crazy you keep on pumping more and more money in and it doesn't solve
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:07.640]  the problem and you expect us to be able to not compete with each other and to
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:14.200]  stop depreciating our currencies to accommodate you when we've accommodated
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:18.440]  you for years no we're not going to do that anymore so I don't see much coming
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:22.240]  out of that meeting because coming back to the Fed and what they're doing in
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:26.800]  the economy with QE2 and the announcement coming up after the election of
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:32.720]  course to be accompanied by foreclosure date which they've been hiding in the
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:41.120]  media this is supposed to be a be a revelation anybody who is involved in
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:45.760]  money and finance and economics knows what's going on and they've seen it
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.880]  already and so this is really just for public consumption officially to let
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:55.200]  the world know that we're going to save America the Federal Reserve is by
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:39:01.760]  pumping out more money out of thin air yeah I'm monetizing the debt and this is
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:06.160]  basic economics I mean we know what this is going to do it's going to devalue
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:09.680]  people's savings it's going to make the cost go up at the same time they're
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:13.040]  freezing for the next two years the social security costs of living increase
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:19.120]  the COLA the reports spill out every day of every locale in the nation jacking up
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:23.000]  taxes and people just don't have the money and driving to work every day
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:28.600]  now it's got to be every mile I see cops pulling people over giving them
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:31.840]  tickets and they say well we're just enforcing the law no they're out there
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:40.240]  revenue generating you can't squeeze blood out of a stone and over 10% of
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:43.560]  Texas has a rest warrants out for us and then I was listening to local radio
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:47.200]  admit because they've had some police chiefs complaining that they're not
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:51.520]  allowed to arrest illegal aliens for drunk driving or not having IDs and
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:56.120]  businesses are basically being allowed to have their drivers be illegal aliens
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:00.320]  without driver's license and cops are told let them go I mean the bankers are
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:04.880]  above the law the police more and more above the law the illegal aliens because
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:08.240]  they're ally but this whole globalist system to drive down the wages they're
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:12.560]  above the law then it and none of it washes anymore and separately though I
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:17.640]  played a Senate candidate on c-span from West Virginia an engineer coming out
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:21.720]  and laying out how they blow up the World Trade Center towers and I've got a
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:28.160]  Harold Sun poll 67% believe inside job trades hall president Kevin Bracken
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:33.000]  stands by as 901 conspiracy and I love what he said he was on ABC News that's
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:39.280]  Australian Broadcasting Company not not not US trades hall president he is the
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:45.960]  Victorian Secretary of Maritime Union of Australia very powerful position in
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:53.440]  the Labor Party and he says that most of his members agree with him and he
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:56.760]  talks about polls showing 50% in Australia believe inside job well they're a
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:00.840]  lot higher than that I mean I've got an Angus and Reed of 84% New York Times
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:06.600]  19 2006 excuse me but it says mr. Bracken sparked outrage yesterday when he
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:11.160]  told John Faines ABC talk back program that attacks were not the result of
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:14.560]  terrorist activity he said the story was a conspiracy that didn't stand up to
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:19.920]  scientific scrutiny and he's an engineer the this morning mr. Bracken
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:24.480]  phoned into Faines program again for a right of reply he said he wasn't
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:28.000]  phoning as the president of the trades hall counsel or the Secretary of
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:32.440]  Melbourne's Union of Australia mr. Bracken stood by his comments and said he
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:36.400]  had the support of 50% of the community he also attacked the talk show host that
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:39.320]  was attacking him claiming he was ridiculed on yesterday's program
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:44.080]  unfortunately cowards like yourself this is a quote have set the political
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:49.920]  agenda in this country for too long said Kevin Bracken I won't be coward down to
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:54.640]  bullies like yourself and he went on and we'll scroll down and show you a
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:42:00.320]  photo of this hero and but but there's more and more people professionals
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:06.520]  military people civil Edmonds you know working with the FBI and NSA who who
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:10.040]  who and I mean you heard Anthony Shaver of your listing last hour folks I talked
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:17.000]  about the government staging events I talked about I talked about how a lockie
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.640]  you know the supposed head Al Qaeda commander meeting with the Secretary of
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:25.360]  the Army two months after 9-11 in the Pentagon and you know what could Shaver
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:29.000]  say he said no it is what it is people just look at it make your decision I
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:33.320]  mean folks we've got criminals running the country that blew up those buildings
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:37.320]  I mean do you understand the magnitude of this and if it's uncomfortable to come
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:42.320]  out and say it sorry that's just the way it is facts or facts or facts and I saw
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:45.240]  the media hyping we were gonna be hit by terrorists and when we get hit by
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:48.720]  terrorists give all your rights up I saw that in the months leading up to 9-11
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.480]  and I could see what they were doing to the point of being able to say they're
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:54.520]  gonna blow up the World Trade Center and blaming on their CIA I said bin Laden
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:43:01.720]  just like a lockie CIA I mean I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen the guy who the
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:05.600]  media and the Pentagon tell us is the number one Al Qaeda operative in the

[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:49.480]  open okay none of us are safe okay if you coward of this they win okay ask your
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:53.720]  gut not even looking at the evidence are you afraid of men with turbines or are
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:56.800]  you afraid of a government that puts in naked body scanners and now going in
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:00.440]  courthouses everywhere and and in lives to you and says they're not saving the
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:04.800]  images and it turns out they are I mean this is a pack of murdering criminals
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:10.800]  your life means nothing to them and the niety that is going on in this country
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:14.840]  in the world is allowing this evil to grow to proportions never before seen
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:19.640]  it's over the thumb-sucking denial is over you think I like risking my life
[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:22.680]  you think I like death threats you think I like people physically attacking me
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:26.160]  they go like hack attacks you think I like every major globalist think tank
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:30.920]  calling me enemy number one you think this is fun you think I like it I wish
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:34.840]  men with turbines did what they did and not our own government that's a lot less
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:40.560]  scary I wish none of it ever happened okay but but living in denial isn't
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:44.560]  gonna change it I'm sorry I'm ranting Bob I'm just sick of the cowardice and I
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:49.440]  love this guy saying I'm not a coward you're a coward and it's time for cowards
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:56.960]  to not set the agenda Bob Chapman I hear you in your absolutely correct absolutely
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:01.920]  correct and we're not gonna take it anymore and you're seeing it in the
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:07.400]  streets all over Europe particularly now for the last two weeks in Paris and the
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:16.640]  Senate has passed the change in the the laws concerning a retirement and that's
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:21.720]  gonna lead to some real problems in France and I think this thing could
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:26.640]  really blow up in their faces and you know the bottom line here is what
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:30.920]  they're right I speak French and what they're ranting in the in the streets
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:37.640]  is the bankers get away with everything and they want us to pay for it by the
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:42.200]  way something just hit me here again and this will cost thousands of dollars
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.560]  somebody with a sophisticated attack hack the machines at Genesis last night
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:50.520]  we had our stuff go down to we're still analyzing it last night they hacked it
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:55.360]  they had destroyed everything I don't even know GCN live comms back up right
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:02.200]  now and the Israelis tacitly admit they launched the Stuxnet worm now our media
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:05.000]  as I said they would is saying we've got to give up our rights on the internet
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.400]  but depending on take the web over or this the this worm will get us when in
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:14.160]  plain view the Western governments is guaranteed the US governments involved
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:18.240]  the experts have looked at it not just Israel they're all involved in it and
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:22.240]  now Obama tells Pentagon to attack cyber threats on American soil who's the
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:26.200]  commander in chief Obama now our stuff went down last night we're still
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:31.360]  analyzing it but it looks suspicious they attack the streams Genesis clear
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:35.960]  attack they break in they get through the codes they savage the machine so that
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:38.920]  it would take longer to get it back up with backups and here's the Wall Street
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:44.720]  Journal cyber attack strikes freedom works a mysterious cyber attack apparently
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:48.000]  struck the computer servers of the pro-tea party group freedom works you know
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:52.640]  what they admit what a year ago Kurt Nemiro stories about the Pentagon
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:55.960]  testing to counter cyber attacks by launching attacks cast Sunstein is
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:00.960]  called for them cyber attacking patriots and now we learn that Genesis got hit
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:05.760]  freedom works got hit one of the big tea party groups and it looks like we got
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:10.360]  hit Bob look at this Wall Street Journal they just brought this into me you
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:15.200]  know what I think the White House hit hit Genesis computers last night well I
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:18.960]  don't think there's any doubt that they would and they got to shut us up and
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:25.720]  they're trying to put us out of business not gonna work it's gonna be again very
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:30.880]  disjointing and it's gonna cost money well they're getting desperate you're
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:35.040]  gonna have to out they're gonna have to help them pay for it otherwise you're
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:40.440]  not gonna get the real news well you know what scares me my gut tells me this
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:46.120]  this is a my gut told me a George Soros affiliated deal but didn't you but
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:52.880]  now you've got freedom works and Glenn Beck getting hit and and the group is
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:58.080]  raising masses of money right now for patriot candidates the group estimates
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:02.680]  it lost eight hundred thousand dollars in potential donations as it struggled to
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:10.360]  bring its site back online and it was a sophisticated attack and fundraising
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:14.440]  money bomb was set see we were attacked during the money bomb and the hackers
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:20.520]  went to public hack sites and YouTube and posted the code to attack us Bob I
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:25.120]  mean so you notice they're attacking during money bombs they are scared and
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:30.240]  they want to cut our money off here it is Wall Street Journal right here Bob well
[02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:35.000]  let's have another money bomb if we miss money and then the other groups miss
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.160]  money tell them to do it over again and keep on doing it until we get enough to
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:43.040]  do what we have to do well they're desperate they've got persistence to
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:47.480]  you know exactly they've now dispatch it's here in my stack Bill Clinton it's a
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:50.760]  prison-planet article here it is establishment dispatches Clinton to
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:54.000]  campaign against Rand Paul they said he wasn't a doctor they said he kidnapped
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.760]  a woman better do drugs all than it did not be true they said he was against a
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:00.640]  civil rights act not true now they're claiming that a newsletter not even
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:04.400]  affiliated with him made a mild joke about black people and Bill Clinton is
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.160]  running around saying he's a racist oh really is he the type of racist that
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:11.560]  shot black people up with syphilis see the liberals never care about the real
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:15.720]  stuff they do because they're the real racist cloaked in this anti-racist
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:19.640]  package and then now they are so desperate they are pulling out all the
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:25.520]  stops against Rand they're scared folks your comments Bob Chapman well I just
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:31.560]  came across a piece and it came out today and you probably saw it well
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:40.440]  Bill Clinton was president he lost the code for arming nuclear weapons they
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:45.400]  couldn't find it I bet he did I mean I you know he's probably left it in
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:51.920]  somebody's bedroom but the point is he lost it I mean that's incredible I mean
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:55.480]  we're supposed to our enemies decided ah we're going to have an attack in in
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:00.600]  Bill's looking under the covers to see what whether the instructions are well
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:07.200]  it's a kind of this is the kind of people they are dreadful and sure you
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:11.840]  get you're going to get more of that attack dog kind of stuff and it goes on
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:18.040]  in both sides we'll win anyway in this election we're going to kick a lot of
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:22.120]  people out of office we being the American people and we're going to get
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.880]  back on the trail of saving our country with the help of talk radio and the
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:32.200]  internet well I just added that your support of course I just added that as
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:36.320]  we come back with the final segment hit some other news Cass Sunstein admits they
[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:40.660]  pose as conspiracy theorist on the web to get us in fighting and let's say
[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:44.160]  Alex Jones is the worst guy in the world which I'm not why is so much time
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:48.080]  spent by all these sites and talk show house attacking yours truly a lot of
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:51.760]  them are on the globalist payroll even though I was a bad guy why would all the
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:55.240]  time be spent literally about half the time attacking me because we're real

[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:32.600]  tonight they they came in they attacked the servers they went and butchered it I
[02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:36.160]  came in had all my news didn't even notice the Wall Street Journal or this
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:40.800]  was already big news today that the main Tea Party website got blown away during
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:44.960]  their money bomb and they have a criminal investigation going on I got to
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:48.840]  get Watson on this to write an article that anti-globalist groups you can see
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:52.520]  what you want about the Tea Party Express but they they were hit and it
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:55.440]  looks like we probably got hit last night but we've just tried but trying to
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:55:00.960]  fix it not analyze how how it was done but there's no doubt they went got into
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:07.800]  our the Genesis GCN live comm servers and wrecked it the Freedom Works website
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:11.880]  is still down according to this article I don't know if it's been updated as they
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:14.720]  try to migrate to a new server same thing they went in and wrecked the server
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:18.960]  they didn't just do it in all of service they got in and wrecked the server so
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:21.960]  this is big news I mean this is what we're talking about here today I mean
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:25.600]  we're under attack and you know it's manly to not talk about it but it's not
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:30.360]  even that I'm always so busy I don't get into all the attacks we go through but
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:35.560]  Bob I mean this shows that the system is scared right now they sure are and it
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:43.400]  shows how effective we are and you know people you've got to understand the work
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:52.640]  that goes into what we do Alex works 16 15 hours a day just like I do yesterday
[02:55:52.640 --> 02:56:00.440]  I did nine programs an hour each I mean even that's a record but we got to keep
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:05.240]  on doing it because we've got to get people to understand what we're up
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:11.240]  against and who's doing what to us and why they're doing it Alex is absolutely
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:14.760]  correct we can't let this get us down we got to have another money bomb that's
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:18.640]  all well ours went off okay though we were attacked during it we've been
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:22.920]  attacked so much we were able to withstand it but we do need to reach our
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:28.560]  goal at info wars money bomb calm but look there's no doubt Obama is saying to
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:33.680]  the Pentagon attack cyber threats domestically in the US we know that's
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:36.680]  the cover for attacks I think I'm gonna call Watson and say did Obama
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:40.920]  administration or did Democrats you know launch cyber attacks against you know
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:46.400]  opposition fundraising and because this is the key time these races are so
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:49.640]  close and not all these Republican or Democratic candidates that are anti
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:54.000]  establishment are good but a lot of them like Rand Paul and others are and the
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:58.200]  system is scared because they're losing the house maybe the Senate and there's
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:02.360]  gonna be all these new voices there of Liberty and this is our wedge going into
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:07.200]  the next election in 2012 2011 to really take the country back just like the
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:10.560]  states rights movement that's why they staged Oklahoma City was to blame the
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:13.320]  states rights movement that was burgeoning then it's not gonna work this
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:18.160]  time though fool me once shame on me or shame on you fool me twice shame on
