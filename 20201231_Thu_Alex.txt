[00:00.000 --> 00:06.640]  First, congratulations.
[00:06.640 --> 00:08.640]  Such an obvious success story.
[00:08.640 --> 00:09.740]  People are leaving California.
[00:09.740 --> 00:11.240]  They can go to 49 other places.
[00:11.240 --> 00:13.000]  They're coming to your state.
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.080]  That is an endorsement of the way you're running it, obviously.
[00:16.080 --> 00:18.240]  So sincere congratulations.
[00:18.240 --> 00:19.240]  But I do have a question.
[00:19.240 --> 00:25.120]  We've seen this across the country where people flee a collapsing, crummy state and then wreck
[00:25.120 --> 00:26.940]  the state they go to.
[00:26.940 --> 00:31.320]  Are you worried, totally sincere question, that all these Californians will bring their
[00:31.320 --> 00:35.600]  values and degrade the state of Texas?
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.880]  Tucker, this is the number one question I get from fellow Texans all the time when they
[00:40.880 --> 00:46.700]  see all of these headquarters relocate from California to Texas and I have great news
[00:46.700 --> 00:53.240]  for them and that is these relocations are not going to change the politics in Texas
[00:53.240 --> 00:56.080]  and we have mathematical proof for it.
[00:56.080 --> 01:00.320]  Two years ago I was on the ballot at the same time that Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke were
[01:00.320 --> 01:01.320]  on the ballot.
[01:01.320 --> 01:06.400]  We did an exit poll asking people after they left the polls, did you vote for Ted Cruz or
[01:06.400 --> 01:08.240]  did you vote for Beto O'Rourke?
[01:08.240 --> 01:12.440]  And then we asked him, have you moved from California or are you native born Texan?
[01:12.440 --> 01:18.000]  The results of that poll showed that 58% of the people who moved from California voted
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.280]  for Ted Cruz.
[01:19.280 --> 01:25.200]  Interestingly, that almost identically matches a separate poll that was taken, also an exit
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.960]  poll from that same election that showed that 57% of the people who moved from California
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.000]  voted for Ted Cruz and both of those polls match a study that was done a couple of years
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.200]  before that that asked Californians that came to Texas, are you conservative or are you
[01:40.200 --> 01:41.200]  liberal?
[01:41.200 --> 01:46.600]  57% of the people who moved from California said they were conservative, 27% of the people
[01:46.600 --> 01:49.240]  who moved from California said they were liberal.
[01:49.240 --> 01:54.840]  And there are reasons for this, Tucker, and that is that if people like big government
[01:54.840 --> 01:59.400]  and if they like high taxes, if they like more regulations, they're going to stay in
[01:59.400 --> 02:03.560]  California and the last place they would come to is the state of Texas.
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.880]  But Tucker, I need to add this because I talk to CEOs every single week and I listen to
[02:08.880 --> 02:13.160]  their concerns whether they're coming from California or New York or some of the state
[02:13.160 --> 02:18.280]  and they've added a new reason this year, why they're coming to the state of Texas and leaving
[02:18.280 --> 02:19.680]  these other states.
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.720]  And that is because of the lack of policing in these other states.
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.800]  You see these movements to ban police or defund police, whatever they want to call it.
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.720]  In Texas, we're talking about defending police, not defunding police.
[02:36.720 --> 02:39.600]  We will support law enforcement in Texas.
[02:39.600 --> 02:40.600]  Businesses...
[02:40.600 --> 02:44.960]  Wait, may I interrupt you here because I think you make really strong points.
[02:44.960 --> 02:46.200]  Those are clearly true.
[02:46.200 --> 02:49.120]  But there's another factor that's never considered.
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.760]  Texas is a great place in part because it's a very religious state.
[02:52.760 --> 02:58.440]  No one ever says that, but you go to Dallas and people are doing Bible study at Starbucks.
[02:58.440 --> 03:01.840]  The truth is there are massive cultural differences.
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.960]  You're getting a lot of people with left-wing social values moving into your state.
[03:06.960 --> 03:09.920]  They've already completely wrecked Austin, as you well know.
[03:09.920 --> 03:12.560]  You're not concerned about that?
[03:12.560 --> 03:17.880]  I'm not, again, in part because of the studies and also in part because of the thousands
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.840]  of Californians that I have personally dealt with that have come to the state of Texas.
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.560]  It's the Californians that they believe in God, they believe in guns, and they are so
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.240]  excited about coming to the state of Texas and getting a gun that they couldn't have
[03:32.240 --> 03:33.240]  in California.
[03:33.240 --> 03:37.600]  And so it's the people who want to re-engage with their faith, the people who want to have
[03:37.600 --> 03:43.800]  guns, the people who believe in fossil fuel, and they're trying to get away from the hostile
[03:43.800 --> 03:47.400]  positions of California against all of those issues.
[03:47.400 --> 03:49.400]  And so there is a reason why they're coming here.
[03:49.400 --> 03:53.040]  But also remember this, Tucker, there are some people who are actually leaving Texas
[03:53.040 --> 03:54.880]  and going to California.
[03:54.880 --> 03:57.760]  So we have kind of a trade deal going here.
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.120]  The liberals are leaving Texas and the conservatives are coming from California to Texas.
[04:02.120 --> 04:03.280]  I hope that's true.
[04:03.280 --> 04:06.880]  I should say, in the interest of full disclosure, I am from California.
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.600]  I'd be very wary of letting people like me in, but good luck, we're certainly, if Texas
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.720]  goes, then we're done.
[04:13.720 --> 04:15.920]  So please keep an eye on that.
[04:15.920 --> 04:17.920]  Governor, great to see you tonight.
[04:17.920 --> 04:18.920]  Thank you.
[04:18.920 --> 04:19.920]  Thank you, Tucker.
[04:19.920 --> 04:22.920]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[04:22.920 --> 04:33.920]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one.
[04:33.920 --> 04:59.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[04:59.360 --> 05:04.240]  Human is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially if the globalist
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.000]  are successful in killing the dollar.
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.080]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[05:12.080 --> 05:16.560]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.800]  record sales once again.
[05:18.800 --> 05:22.240]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[05:22.240 --> 05:24.480]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[05:24.480 --> 05:29.480]  The globalist are waging siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.640]  bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[05:32.640 --> 05:37.080]  That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[05:37.080 --> 05:43.960]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up at PrepareWithAlex.com and save
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.760]  up to $850 off the highest quality storeable foods out there.
[05:48.760 --> 05:54.960]  You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in at PrepareWithAlex.com and lock
[05:54.960 --> 06:06.800]  in the lowest prices out there on high quality storeable food.
[06:06.800 --> 06:34.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, broadcasting worldwide on December 31st, 2020.
[06:34.600 --> 06:40.200]  I'll see you on the other side in the year 2021.
[06:40.200 --> 06:42.440]  Sounds like a science fiction headline, doesn't it?
[06:42.440 --> 06:44.440]  But we're here.
[06:44.440 --> 06:51.400]  The year 2021 is only hours away and we have a powerful corporate world government trying
[06:51.400 --> 06:59.240]  to put in our bodies a mutinogenic compound made up of human genomes and jellyfish genomes
[06:59.240 --> 07:09.680]  just in the Pfizer vaccine alone to reprogram the entire body.
[07:09.680 --> 07:11.000]  Now what is this?
[07:11.000 --> 07:19.200]  Well, this really is the equivalent of an intruder cell with an entire genome of multiple
[07:19.200 --> 07:27.000]  species, a chimera, a chimera clone of a human and a jellyfish coming in and assimilating
[07:27.000 --> 07:34.360]  your entire body, the jellyfish is a hive organism, a colony organism, a colony organism
[07:34.360 --> 07:40.840]  of human genomes going in and taking over every cell that replicates in your body.
[07:40.840 --> 07:46.160]  Only thing that will be the original you when it's done is the cells in your eyes and any
[07:46.160 --> 07:49.160]  eggs in a woman's ovaries.
[07:49.160 --> 07:55.680]  All other cells are to be taken over.
[07:55.680 --> 08:00.040]  And it's all happening in the year 2021.
[08:00.040 --> 08:07.080]  It didn't come from some distant galaxy.
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.320]  It didn't come from some distant star.
[08:11.320 --> 08:18.400]  It didn't come from some far away planetary system.
[08:18.400 --> 08:24.240]  It came from the mad scientist here on our planet, but it is as alien as a Martian.
[08:24.240 --> 08:27.400]  It's as alien as somebody from Pluto.
[08:27.400 --> 08:33.040]  It's as alien as some single cell organism in some planet orbiting alphas and teres
[08:33.040 --> 08:46.680]  or beetle geese.
[08:46.680 --> 08:49.600]  Cell intruder mRNA.
[08:49.600 --> 09:01.240]  Immutation cell, inject mRNA, takeover, assimilation completed.
[09:01.240 --> 09:09.600]  Now it looks like a human cell, but now it's owned by Microsoft, which really owns large
[09:09.600 --> 09:12.280]  stock in all the big foreign companies.
[09:12.280 --> 09:19.640]  Complete cell mRNA, imitation cell, now continues takeover.
[09:19.640 --> 09:27.800]  It only unclokes to fire its messenger RNA in, takes over, and continues the process
[09:27.800 --> 09:39.320]  until every cell in your body has now been reprogrammed by your new doctor, Bill Gates.
[09:39.320 --> 09:43.480]  So that's the year 2021.
[09:43.480 --> 09:50.120]  Again, if flying saucers landed like Mars attacks and little green men with eggheads
[09:50.120 --> 09:56.520]  came toddling off and began firing at us with ray guns, we'd whip their butts.
[09:56.520 --> 10:04.160]  We'd all unify like a team of heavily armed army ants, and we would destroy them.
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.280]  No matter how many of us died, we'd win, because it'd be a big frontal assault.
[10:09.280 --> 10:15.160]  But when it comes from the UN and Davos group, and the globalists, and it's to save us, and
[10:15.160 --> 10:22.280]  oh, it comes out of Wuhan, and Fauci and Gates ran the whole thing, but they always say the
[10:22.280 --> 10:25.960]  devil is in the old details.
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.480]  Oh, more deaths, by the way.
[10:29.480 --> 10:35.480]  Deaths in Spain, deaths in Israel, deaths in Switzerland, deaths, deaths, deaths from
[10:35.480 --> 10:42.320]  the new mRNA genetic takeover systems.
[10:42.320 --> 10:45.960]  Folks are taking it, and they're dead in a couple hours.
[10:45.960 --> 10:55.120]  Well, hell, it's in the major medical studies that a lot of babies, especially preemies,
[10:55.120 --> 11:05.080]  today end up dying when they're given their vaccine.
[11:05.080 --> 11:08.040]  And the nurses have to fight with the bioethics board that runs the hospital.
[11:08.040 --> 11:13.560]  You don't know what bioethics are, you might want to find out about these boys and girls,
[11:13.560 --> 11:14.560]  their eugenicists.
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.600]  The whole study of bioethics is just a field they created.
[11:19.600 --> 11:22.600]  Biological ethics, that's why they call us human resources, it's all hidden in plain
[11:22.600 --> 11:23.600]  view.
[11:23.600 --> 11:29.400]  And the nurses beg and say, can we please resuscitate them, then the board sometimes
[11:29.400 --> 11:37.360]  can't convene, and so they just order the baby to die and baby die, and they don't keep
[11:37.360 --> 11:40.320]  baby comfortable while they do it.
[11:40.320 --> 11:44.320]  So when we talk about Trump and the New World Order and the Communist Chinese and all that's
[11:44.320 --> 11:52.360]  going on, just remember, a million 200,000 Americans have taken one of two mRNA vaccines
[11:52.360 --> 12:01.800]  that up front are causing more bad reactions and more deaths than vaccines we've seen ever.
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.080]  And it's funny, suddenly flu shots are killing a lot more people, hundreds are dead, it was
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.520]  59, first report, now it's a couple hundred are dead, now they're saying it's a state
[12:10.520 --> 12:14.400]  secret in South Korea, don't want to create a panic, so now they're telling media don't
[12:14.400 --> 12:16.440]  report on it.
[12:16.440 --> 12:21.640]  And I've got articles here about people being arrested around the world, journalists that
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.400]  are critical of the vaccines and the rollout, and activists that try to organize protesting
[12:26.400 --> 12:34.520]  like in Australia, they come to their house and they arrest you in your home.
[12:34.520 --> 12:40.480]  No the New World Order is not coming, the New World Order is here, so in the new year we're
[12:40.480 --> 12:43.760]  going to take a lot more calls on this broadcast, we've been taking a lot more calls as of late,
[12:43.760 --> 12:46.960]  I've delivered on that.
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.240]  We have the new American Journal hosted by Harrison Smith doing a splendid job, a day
[12:51.240 --> 12:57.120]  mornings 8am central, I also pop in, so does Owen Schreuer, that is a total call-in show,
[12:57.120 --> 13:07.400]  but the final transmission of the Alex Jones show of the year 2020, what a year, I'd like
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.440]  to get your take on what you think is coming in the new year and what your resolutions
[13:11.440 --> 13:17.320]  are in the new year and what you think our focus should be in the new year.
[13:17.320 --> 13:24.520]  So that's all coming up, let me give you the toll-free number, it's 877-789 Alex, 877-789
[13:24.520 --> 13:34.680]  Alex, 877-789-2539, and let's give first-time callers the first round of calls, the first
[13:34.680 --> 13:43.480]  20 calls or so, then it's a free-for-all after that, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, and let's
[13:43.480 --> 13:50.640]  put nurses and doctors, if you can get through, to the head of the line, I'd like to hear
[13:50.640 --> 13:54.480]  from doctors and nurses about what you think about this carnage, and oh, it doesn't even
[13:54.480 --> 13:59.400]  protect you from COVID, and oh, it doesn't even stop you from spreading, and oh, and
[13:59.400 --> 14:05.760]  people that took the shot two weeks ago, why they are test positive for COVID now, and
[14:05.760 --> 14:12.400]  yeah, more people are testing positive for HIV when you take the shot, because you see
[14:12.400 --> 14:22.000]  the COVID virus is part HIV, there's a big video up on Bandot Video, doctors around
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.040]  the world issue dire warning, do not take the COVID vaccine, medical doctors, scientists,
[14:26.040 --> 14:32.480]  epidemiologists, virologists, endocrinologists, and guess what happens to their videos when
[14:32.480 --> 14:35.040]  they go on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook?
[14:35.040 --> 14:41.280]  They get millions of views in just a few hours and then they get taken down, because we don't
[14:41.280 --> 14:49.600]  get to hear from real medical doctors or scientists, we get to hear from Dr. Bill Gates, who does
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.560]  say he wants to depopulate you, and his father ran the World Eugenics Society, and his mother
[14:54.560 --> 15:07.520]  was on the IBM board under the man that ran Nazi Germany, Thomas Watson, IBM in the Holocaust,
[15:07.520 --> 15:14.040]  search engine for yourself, and oh, don't hold your breath for the ADL to say a word,
[15:14.040 --> 15:19.200]  the ADL works for these guys, see, when you're really the globalist and you're really the
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.960]  anti humanist, you got to own the whole show, that's what they said Hitler up for, was to
[15:23.960 --> 15:29.160]  create the paradigm paradox of Galenian separation, so people would know the real group when
[15:29.160 --> 15:38.680]  they hit him, if Hitler just would have worn a pink sweater, he would have won, like Bill,
[15:38.680 --> 15:44.000]  Bill's got something for you, wants you to take it, he says it's going to hurt you real
[15:44.000 --> 15:54.160]  bad, but it's okay, we know you're tough, infowars.com, newswars.com, banned, as in banned, banned.videos,
[15:54.160 --> 15:57.400]  stay with us.
[15:57.400 --> 16:02.200]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight, because activated
[16:02.200 --> 16:06.200]  charcoal is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there, the
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.720]  problem is a lot of the other over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very
[16:10.720 --> 16:14.880]  very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it, this does not have the fluoride, it doesn't
[16:14.880 --> 16:19.280]  have the additives, this is a concentrated, really is, high quality, it's been sold out
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.880]  for months, because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage,
[16:23.880 --> 16:30.040]  but now it's back in stock, infowars, Dr. Jones naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste,
[16:30.040 --> 16:36.960]  now back in stock at infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free, triple A-253-3139, it also
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.720]  makes a great gift for your family, for your grandkids, for your mother, your father, for
[16:41.720 --> 16:46.600]  everybody, and it supports the info war, activated charcoal from Dr. Jones naturals, available
[16:46.600 --> 16:51.760]  again at infowarsstore.com, and a lot of other products that have been sold out have just
[16:51.760 --> 16:57.200]  now come back in as well, like pollen block, so check that out when you're in the store.

[17:49.200 --> 17:53.480]  than ever, so thank you so much for keeping info wars in the fight, without your support,
[17:53.480 --> 18:00.480]  we couldn't do any of it.
[18:00.480 --> 18:26.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:26.480 --> 18:49.680]  You'll see
[18:49.680 --> 18:56.160]  Well 80 something-year-old Don Wells of Marianne fame of Gilligan's Island one of my favorite silly shows
[18:57.320 --> 18:59.560]  Some earliest memories are watching Gilligan's Island
[19:01.320 --> 19:03.320]  Dies of COVID-19 and 82
[19:04.320 --> 19:05.680]  complications
[19:05.680 --> 19:10.360]  That's right. You have a heart attack. You die of cancer. You die of pneumonia. It's complications
[19:10.360 --> 19:17.400]  You know who else just died it was the cellmate up until the last day. He was moved out of Jeffrey Epstein
[19:17.400 --> 19:24.320]  He was found dead in his apartment and Lord have mercy guess what he died of COVID
[19:26.560 --> 19:32.240]  You know if I was to die on a plane crash reviewer, they'll say you died of COVID or a motorcycle accident
[19:32.240 --> 19:34.240]  This is all part of the formulaic fraud
[19:35.560 --> 19:37.560]  They're running
[19:37.600 --> 19:39.600]  They're also saying hospitals are
[19:40.560 --> 19:42.400]  full in
[19:42.400 --> 19:47.160]  Texas in New York in Hawaii and all over and they're even arresting people now
[19:48.720 --> 19:53.960]  That go into the empty hospitals, so I want to be very very clear you need to go show the parking lot empty
[19:53.960 --> 19:57.600]  You need to show the receiving area empty. You could shoot a time-lapse
[19:58.560 --> 20:06.600]  If they tell you to leave leave, but we've got multiple videos of people being arrested in the US and the UK
[20:08.160 --> 20:10.160]  When they go into the hospitals, I
[20:10.160 --> 20:12.360]  Don't think it violates it, but I think it violates
[20:12.840 --> 20:17.200]  Prophecy, but this is this is a need to know the public has a right to know that's covered by whistleblowing
[20:17.200 --> 20:21.920]  It's covered by investigative journalism, but you just had a 10 million plus dollar judgment
[20:23.280 --> 20:30.440]  For the exact number look it up with this federal judge in San Francisco on the folks that went undercover in restaurants
[20:30.920 --> 20:36.600]  Had the meetings with the Planned Parenthood groups that said we've got live babies for you
[20:36.600 --> 20:42.240]  And the judge gave him some I think it was 16 million of memory serves
[20:42.240 --> 20:46.080]  I saw that last week meant to cover it, but I was off the headline was
[20:48.560 --> 20:50.560]  Was the exact headline
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.800]  Federal judge issues huge
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.840]  Ruling against group that
[21:00.680 --> 21:03.040]  Documented Planned Parenthood selling fetuses
[21:03.040 --> 21:10.560]  They'll pull it up in a minute, or I will during the break. I'll find it. But the point is is that that's what's going on here
[21:11.600 --> 21:14.000]  They're trying to make it a crime
[21:14.720 --> 21:20.760]  They're trying to make it a massive crime to expose their criminal activities
[21:20.960 --> 21:25.840]  But listen, I don't need to go into the hospitals though. We're gonna be doing this this this week and next week. I
[21:27.440 --> 21:29.440]  Showed you the link
[21:29.440 --> 21:36.600]  Two days ago to the CDC website where you can go look at every hospital in every town in every city. There it is
[21:37.800 --> 21:43.200]  California judge orders video journals to pay 13.6 million to Planned Parenthood
[21:43.200 --> 21:45.440]  So, I don't know why I thought 16 million there you go
[21:46.840 --> 21:52.440]  13.6 million guess my mind remember the one six, but it's one three point six
[21:54.280 --> 21:56.280]  13.6 million
[21:56.280 --> 22:00.880]  To Planned Parenthood, and they got undercover meetings at restaurants
[22:02.520 --> 22:07.680]  Where Planned Parenthood's talking about buying themselves Ferraris for all the babies they sell
[22:09.080 --> 22:11.840]  And now the mRNA vaccines
[22:12.680 --> 22:16.640]  Don't just have part of babies in them. They have the entire genome
[22:17.400 --> 22:19.400]  the Pfizer one does
[22:19.880 --> 22:21.880]  of a dead boy
[22:21.880 --> 22:26.760]  That they've been cloning since 1966
[22:28.720 --> 22:33.000]  You know, I remember I got on air 27 years ago, and I'd be reading BBC articles about
[22:33.680 --> 22:37.760]  Human animal cloning began 20 plus years ago, and they would list where it began
[22:38.280 --> 22:40.760]  And I remember even back then it was in the news
[22:41.480 --> 22:45.480]  So I'd go well wait a minute. That's 20 something years ago, and it's 1995
[22:46.800 --> 22:48.800]  1994
[22:48.800 --> 22:53.520]  1996 then you know we're talking
[22:55.080 --> 22:57.840]  This has been going on now 50 years
[23:00.760 --> 23:07.040]  But they know because of the church and people's morals and common sense that people would want that outlawed, but it's all been going on
[23:08.960 --> 23:10.960]  Right beneath the surface
[23:13.440 --> 23:15.200]  I'm gonna go to break
[23:15.200 --> 23:17.200]  too long segments coming up and
[23:17.200 --> 23:19.200]  And I'm gonna go
[23:19.360 --> 23:25.280]  Right to your phone calls Rick and Danny and Scott and Austin and Brian and many others eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[23:25.280 --> 23:30.240]  I want to hear from you about what president Trump needs to do what you're gonna be doing what you expect next year
[23:30.720 --> 23:32.720]  What happens if they do force Biden in
[23:33.400 --> 23:37.320]  But let me tell you there's a lot more election fraud coming out and big movements
[23:37.320 --> 23:43.280]  Here's two of them will cover right now vice president Pence cancels planned January 6th trip to Israel
[23:43.280 --> 23:45.280]  I've been harping on this for two days
[23:45.280 --> 23:49.040]  It's just now getting attention. He was gonna be gone on vacation
[23:49.880 --> 23:55.960]  But now he's gonna be back to oversee the debate in the Senate that could go on potentially not just for two hours
[23:56.240 --> 23:58.240]  But for days
[24:00.240 --> 24:02.880]  Somebody sees control of the Walmart account and attack
[24:03.920 --> 24:05.920]  senator Josh Howley
[24:06.880 --> 24:08.880]  Holly and said oh
[24:09.400 --> 24:12.040]  You know you're gonna bill you'll be defeated Trump will be gone soon
[24:12.040 --> 24:16.480]  Go ahead and add your two hours of debate and Walmart said somebody else did that. It was unauthorized
[24:16.760 --> 24:19.920]  Which I believe it just shows how wild left the star
[24:19.920 --> 24:27.000]  They can't even control themselves when they've got jobs in major corporations because they really believe they're fighting Hitler
[24:27.400 --> 24:33.880]  Even though they're the ones bringing in this great tyranny, but Holly is defending his decision to launch the
[24:34.480 --> 24:37.560]  contestant and to contest the election of
[24:37.560 --> 24:44.200]  Up Joe Biden by contesting the electoral college results and blast dims over their hypocrisy
[24:45.760 --> 24:47.760]  So this all ties together
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.040]  All right, we are going to go to break we're gonna come back and hit all this
[24:53.040 --> 24:55.720]  But let me tell you about some very very exciting things that are happening

[27:16.800 --> 27:21.600]  They're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power and control
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.640]  And that they're not even worried about killed in 19. That's what class while the others have said
[27:27.200 --> 27:32.240]  Think about how it's saying that it's oh and big tech's got to track you. They've got to trace you. They've got to control you
[27:32.640 --> 27:37.360]  You've got to have absolutely your house white. You've got to have secret police come disappear you because

[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  The post industrial world

[28:01.720 --> 28:03.320]  Rio de Janeiro
[28:03.320 --> 28:05.840]  10 to 21 conference back in 1992
[28:06.600 --> 28:08.600]  Now they've launched agenda

[33:34.320 --> 33:38.560]  Austin's mother teaches nursing got the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He's got a
[33:39.200 --> 33:45.040]  Report to give us and then we've got a wife as a doctor hospitals raking in millions on COVID
[33:45.600 --> 33:50.080]  I don't just have to believe robert even us today says 53 thousand dollars
[33:51.360 --> 33:55.120]  On top of what you get paid by the insurance or whatever or by their payment
[33:55.760 --> 33:57.760]  When you've got a COVID patient you intubate
[33:58.400 --> 34:00.720]  When you intubate you get higher death rates, but there are
[34:00.720 --> 34:07.520]  75 people I kept saying 77. I don't know why the statistic as of a few days ago when I covered it 77
[34:08.240 --> 34:14.240]  Was the number I said 75 is what the CDC reported and the Austin American station reported in the town
[34:14.320 --> 34:17.600]  I live of almost 2 million people in the hospital with COVID
[34:18.800 --> 34:25.600]  75 and they're saying the hospitals are full everyone's dead run for the hills my god don't ever leave your house again
[34:25.600 --> 34:30.960]  But then all the ministers and all the governors and the prime ministers and the mayors
[34:31.280 --> 34:37.600]  They all get caught in the Caribbean and on golf courses and at parties and at topless bars
[34:38.240 --> 34:41.280]  Because they're partying their asses off laughing at us
[34:42.560 --> 34:44.240]  Excuse me. I'm ranting
[34:44.240 --> 34:46.240]  Austin in Missouri
[34:46.400 --> 34:50.080]  You're on the air sir. Thank you so much for calling. Tell us what the intel you've got
[34:50.080 --> 34:55.520]  Hey, Alex. Thanks so much for taking my call. I hope everybody's having a good new year's eve
[34:56.080 --> 35:02.160]  Um, yeah, you touched on it a little bit earlier, Alex. My mother she teaches nursing at a division one university in Tennessee
[35:02.240 --> 35:04.240]  I won't go too much further into that
[35:04.480 --> 35:06.560]  Uh, just because I do want to protect her identity
[35:06.880 --> 35:11.600]  Uh, but she has been in the nursing field for over 25 years. She has her doctorate
[35:11.760 --> 35:17.200]  She teaches nursing and she works in the emergency room here, uh in the COVID unit
[35:17.200 --> 35:22.800]  And Alex, uh, she did receive the Pfizer vaccine the first shot of about a week and a half ago
[35:23.200 --> 35:26.720]  And she did let me know that she's due up for that that second shot
[35:26.880 --> 35:33.280]  And um, that is the the injection that has been causing a lot of issues from what I understand is that second shot, Alex
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.360]  Because as of right now, um, she feels fine lord bless her soul
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.360]  Uh, but that second shot has been what has been raising concerns now
[35:41.360 --> 35:47.280]  We know why would the Pfizer you you you according to Wolfgang Woodard who's a prestigious scientist and heads up an eu
[35:47.680 --> 35:52.560]  advisory commission and his associate that signed on to it the former chief science officer at Pfizer
[35:53.520 --> 35:55.520]  That the mrna
[35:55.600 --> 35:58.160]  Goes in starts taking over your cells and in a few weeks
[35:58.800 --> 36:04.160]  Then your body has an autoimmune response when you get injected the next time that's very violent
[36:04.320 --> 36:10.320]  And gage is talking about five shots and many experts believe that you will have a large portion of people die
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.000]  By the fourth or fifth shot. What is your mother who's a nurse's nurse think?
[36:15.440 --> 36:21.200]  Well, uh, you know early on in the whole COVID thing, Alex, um, you know, she was very open about how
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.640]  The hospitals are being in incentivized to house COVID patients to you know, um
[36:27.120 --> 36:32.000]  They were getting huge huge amounts of money, Alex just for innovating COVID patients
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.600]  But they weren't nearly as busy as they were trying to make people believe. I mean their evening for my mother would come home
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.680]  Uh, supposed to be coming home midnight 1am and she would come home 8 or 9 p.m
[36:41.760 --> 36:45.840]  So it was just a slower night at the emergency room, but Alex. She just has a great heart
[36:45.840 --> 36:50.960]  She wants to help people and at the beginning she kind of understood that this was a little bit bigger of a hoax
[36:51.040 --> 36:52.400]  but I believe now that
[36:52.400 --> 36:56.160]  These nurses are starting to get these vaccines and they're kind of you know, they're
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.640]  At the risk of losing their jobs to deny this vaccine and for for people like my mother who have been in the medical field for
[37:03.120 --> 37:06.960]  25 years who teach nursing and and who you know are in the field
[37:06.960 --> 37:14.800]  The cost of them not signing on in drinking the Kool-Aid and taking the vaccines are you know, they'll lose their livelihood now
[37:14.880 --> 37:17.520]  I totally understand it's killing yourself to live
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.760]  It's a cult where they make you do this to yourself to have a job or they pressure you into it
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.000]  And once they have the enforcers the nurses the doctors the police are made to do it
[37:26.080 --> 37:31.760]  They'll make us do it. That's why we got a stand with the nurses the majority of which in polls say they do not want the vaccines
[37:31.920 --> 37:33.920]  Thank you so much and god bless you, austin
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.640]  Let's talk to robert in california his wife's the doctor says hospitals raking in millions
[37:39.040 --> 37:41.600]  Yeah per hospital on covet tell us about it robert
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.000]  Hi, alex, uh, yeah, she's a physician in uh, southern california at a hospital
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.440]  And the largest part portion of the covet patients are right now about 400
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.520]  And that's that's pretty large population now if you do the math on that
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.720]  You're looking at four million dollars as a base fee
[38:00.720 --> 38:06.320]  For these admissions and that's on the average every seven days
[38:06.880 --> 38:12.320]  Could be every seven days if they just admit them declare them as covet treat them for a broken toe
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.000]  And roll them back out the door they have a revolving door
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.600]  It's like a slot machine at the casino and if only 30 of those are incubated
[38:21.840 --> 38:25.360]  That's another 1.5 million dollars and how long does that last?
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.280]  Well, the human body under intubation isn't going to last that long. So well, I'm very concerned about that
[38:31.520 --> 38:34.960]  So that's right. What they're doing is this is this is the end of medicine
[38:35.200 --> 38:41.280]  This is big corporations the un setting medical policy saying no doctors. No hospitals are allowed to deviate
[38:41.440 --> 38:45.600]  You'll be fired. You'll be censored. You'll lose your job. You know, all of this is happening
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.720]  You'll be demonized and then they say intubate at an even higher level than normal
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.640]  Knowing when you're having an auto immune response. It kills you. It's not fluid in the lungs
[38:54.640 --> 38:58.800]  It's the opposite of what they need. They need benadryl. They need steroids. I've had doctors on
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.520]  100 success rate with these steroids instantly. I mean, we're talking in 20 minutes
[39:03.680 --> 39:07.280]  They have you breathe these steroids boom you start having the auto immune response
[39:07.520 --> 39:13.520]  Instead they're giving you a vaccine that makes you have an auto immune response to other coronaviruses
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.080]  They're the most common and that's what the top scientist wolfgang wood argon others have warned
[39:18.400 --> 39:21.280]  It's going to cause massive new allergies to
[39:21.280 --> 39:26.240]  New normal non-harmful viruses. So it looks like what they're doing stay there
[39:26.240 --> 39:30.960]  I'm gonna let you finish up robert is making you allergic to your normal environment
[39:30.960 --> 39:37.680]  So you can't live in a normal environment and that's what you're already seeing is people that are getting the vaccine are suddenly getting regular colds and dying
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.080]  Wow
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.680]  They are taking your immune system away, which is exactly what wolfgang wood arg
[39:43.920 --> 39:46.960]  Warned in that report three weeks to go to the eu on member member
[39:46.960 --> 39:51.280]  Four weeks ago, December 1st. He filed it. He said this will cause an auto immune response
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.560]  Hey Alex, how you doing man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[39:59.280 --> 40:06.800]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from
[40:06.800 --> 40:07.920]  Utah
[40:07.920 --> 40:11.280]  I said man, I gotta get on that show and give him an update
[40:11.600 --> 40:14.800]  I said if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show
[40:14.800 --> 40:20.320]  I'm gonna tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally now look
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.000]  I'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this info for store products
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.440]  And by the way, I bought 800 dollars worth the other night. So I'm doing what I can brother
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.760]  What my my contention is why don't we start this new year off right?
[40:36.320 --> 40:42.080]  With everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense now. You gotta follow that up with the micros v
[40:42.080 --> 40:45.760]  Yeah, I learned that so it's like god working is so amazing
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.040]  We didn't know we didn't screen your call. We had no idea and I go to you a year later
[40:51.040 --> 40:53.760]  And you're telling people about living defense living defense living defense
[40:55.440 --> 40:58.320]  Anybody listening to my voice simply search engines in the term
[40:58.880 --> 41:00.720]  Davos group
[41:00.720 --> 41:02.720]  Technocracy or technocrats
[41:02.720 --> 41:04.240]  you will get
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.160]  Clous Schwab and John Claude Juncker and all the new order
[41:08.160 --> 41:14.240]  Globalists like G.G. Pink saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments
[41:14.880 --> 41:21.200]  But they want businessmen technocrats over it and that's who clous Schwab is you might want to look into the guy that says they've watched
[41:21.840 --> 41:27.120]  The COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor you might want to find out who this super villain is
[41:27.760 --> 41:30.240]  You see he believes because he's hidden playing you
[41:30.880 --> 41:33.200]  And you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it
[41:33.840 --> 41:36.880]  You might want to find who he works for he works directly for Prince Charles
[41:36.880 --> 41:40.880]  He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability
[41:41.360 --> 41:44.400]  That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works
[41:44.880 --> 41:50.000]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.040]  You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right
[41:56.720 --> 42:02.480]  The great reset is here world government has openly been announced and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family

[43:44.160 --> 43:48.560]  Don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us

[44:56.400 --> 45:01.920]  You know, I knew this and I'd read this but I'd forgotten this because when I say they get 53 thousand dollars
[45:02.960 --> 45:04.960]  for every covid patient they intubate
[45:05.600 --> 45:07.600]  that they put on a respirator
[45:08.880 --> 45:11.280]  A ventilator as the governor of new york calls it
[45:12.320 --> 45:15.280]  But I've forgotten this. Here's the hill newspaper analysis
[45:15.280 --> 45:21.120]  Some states getting three hundred thousand dollars per coronavirus case
[45:22.640 --> 45:24.640]  New york getting 12k
[45:28.240 --> 45:32.960]  So if you wonder why there's an incentive to keep this this hoax this exaggeration is fraud going
[45:33.360 --> 45:38.960]  And why we've had medical doctors and nurses on who show the video of the computer screens
[45:39.680 --> 45:41.680]  in the hospitals
[45:41.680 --> 45:46.080]  Where someone doesn't even have covet 19 even the fake PCR test
[45:47.200 --> 45:52.080]  Says they don't have it and they grab them and snake a tube down their lungs and kill their ass
[45:54.400 --> 45:57.360]  Because if you don't need to be on a respirator folks, it'll kill you
[45:57.840 --> 46:04.320]  It's a very desperate move to do when someone's lungs aren't working anymore. I remember my uncle god bless him. What a great guy
[46:04.320 --> 46:11.040]  I couldn't breathe had really bad pneumonia six almost seven years ago. He died in
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.160]  His january coming up seven years ago. He's seven years about 20 something days
[46:17.440 --> 46:20.000]  And man, he did not want to go on a ventilator
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.600]  And he was having trouble breathing and they did it and he was dead in three days
[46:26.560 --> 46:28.560]  After they snaked that thing down his lungs
[46:29.120 --> 46:32.240]  And boy, he was strapped down. He was fighting to get out of that
[46:32.240 --> 46:37.120]  I remember sitting there watching it. It was putting years on my life just watching him sit there
[46:37.760 --> 46:40.160]  He's just looking at me basically begging to get out of that thing
[46:40.880 --> 46:42.880]  But without it he did died right then
[46:43.680 --> 46:45.680]  But it's still he died
[46:46.000 --> 46:47.440]  Ugh
[46:47.440 --> 46:49.440]  now
[46:50.400 --> 46:52.480]  Oh, it's horrible memories. I shouldn't open those memories up
[46:53.760 --> 46:57.440]  But that's what they're doing folks just like this newly elected congressman
[46:58.720 --> 47:01.120]  He had a heart attack when they were doing the intubation
[47:01.120 --> 47:03.120]  procedure
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  You imagine he's strapped down
[47:06.080 --> 47:08.080]  It's like being waterboarded
[47:08.080 --> 47:10.320]  They run those tubes down into your bronchioles
[47:10.880 --> 47:12.880]  into your lungs
[47:13.040 --> 47:18.000]  You ever had a little piece of rice go down your throat the wrong way and you're hacking and coughing your eyes or bloodshot
[47:18.800 --> 47:22.800]  You know, it's like if you're not unconscious and they stick tubes down your lungs
[47:26.080 --> 47:28.800]  And most of the people that have died have been old people or homeless
[47:28.800 --> 47:35.600]  They scoop those homeless up at certain hospitals have almost all the death and they're killing them folks
[47:35.760 --> 47:39.600]  And you'll notice it's the same hospitals that kill the babies and sell their organs
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.960]  There it is 80 business insider of new york city's corona virus patients who are put on
[47:47.440 --> 47:51.120]  Ventilators ultimately die and some doctors are trying to stop using them
[47:51.120 --> 47:57.280]  That was months and months and months and months and months and months ago back in april
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.040]  That's why the left so pissed because most hospitals know not to use the ventilators now
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.880]  Remember quomo. We need testing testing testing ventilators ventilators ventilators
[48:11.920 --> 48:19.520]  Because he's told to say that now it's testing testing testing ventilator ventilator ventilator arrest arrest arrest
[48:19.520 --> 48:27.360]  I have Schumer. I have Whitmer. I have wolf. I have quomo. I have Newsome all on video
[48:28.480 --> 48:30.960]  Newsome with that big jack-o-lantern demon face
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.000]  I'd run from that guy. I saw him there now. He scares me. He's a people don't have the sight though
[48:36.080 --> 48:40.960]  Don't have discernment don't know like that's a whoa. That's an actual killer level demon. That's about as bad as they
[48:40.960 --> 48:45.920]  That's satan satan's helper right there. That's I mean a quomo open demon. Look at him
[48:45.920 --> 48:48.400]  Brian Stelter opened demon
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.440]  They've got the look jimmy savel's got the look
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.960]  Pull up jimmy savel for folks. He's got the look. He's got the look. He's got the look
[48:59.760 --> 49:01.760]  Hot sammy's a child molester
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.560]  Say if I was going to cast one for hollywood to play one
[49:05.120 --> 49:08.640]  Brian Stelter'd be number one hit the clown no makeup needed
[49:08.960 --> 49:11.440]  But he serves help molest the truth all day in the first amendment
[49:11.440 --> 49:14.880]  So I'm gonna go back to robert here and the rest of your calls, but the big news coming up next hour
[49:14.880 --> 49:20.720]  Linwood files emergency petition the u.s. Supreme court to stop january 5th runoff races and the u.s. Senate in georgia
[49:20.720 --> 49:24.240]  Which trump should have done those are sitting in the same fake ballots
[49:26.560 --> 49:30.480]  They're engaged the same fraud again, and if we let them do it, they'll do it again
[49:35.040 --> 49:39.040]  But right now let's go back to robert robert your wife's a doctor hospitals raking in millions
[49:39.040 --> 49:41.520]  What is what is your take on this? What is her take on this?
[49:42.400 --> 49:46.560]  Well, we're very concerned about all these first responders getting the vacs first
[49:46.800 --> 49:52.400]  I mean if you really consider what a better way to seize the country as classic poisoned the meat
[49:52.880 --> 49:59.360]  Under siege and then send it in as humanitarian relief then you watch your enemy fall by their own hand
[49:59.360 --> 50:04.400]  I mean if if all these first responders go down because they took a poison piece of meat
[50:04.400 --> 50:09.280]  Next thing you know who's going to step up their plate to save us. Well the guys that are saving the rest of the third world
[50:09.280 --> 50:16.880]  Countries china the who and the un they'll move right in as humanitarian relief and ain't going to be nobody here
[50:16.880 --> 50:22.880]  Especially the politicians in washington to stop them. They'll just spread their legs and let them come right on in
[50:23.200 --> 50:29.040]  You just said it you wonder why the blue cities are bankrupting everything you wonder why there's feces and homeless camps everywhere
[50:29.040 --> 50:31.920]  You wonder why they're trying to debase the dollar and trying to bankrupt it
[50:31.920 --> 50:38.160]  They say to bring the country down to bring us into receivership under world government and now china officially in their newspaper says
[50:38.640 --> 50:42.800]  We released coven. They just say coven was released by god out of china
[50:42.800 --> 50:49.120]  Being the communist party it hit america. We were control america. They will never reopen america is done
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.920]  And the average america thinks i'll wear my mask. I'll do what i'm told this will all end
[50:53.920 --> 50:59.040]  No, it never ends the mass don't come off till you take them off the businesses don't open until you open them
[50:59.040 --> 51:04.800]  The china is bragging. They're totally open partying. No mask was all a hoax and they control the globalist
[51:04.800 --> 51:11.200]  They and the chai comms are in league with big tech and the big tech takeover. That's why they censor you have you tell the truth
[51:11.200 --> 51:17.200]  It's why they try to block you. It's why they block the doctors because they this is their mind control chicken little takeover
[51:17.200 --> 51:22.640]  Where people never leave their houses and go bankrupt for the globalist to take over in receivership
[51:22.640 --> 51:26.160]  What you said is one trillion gazillion infidels
[51:26.160 --> 51:30.000]  What you said is one trillion gazillion infinity true robert
[51:31.120 --> 51:37.120]  Thank you, alexand just if i made make a short plug for bodies dna and vitamin mineral fusion
[51:37.680 --> 51:44.000]  I had suffered gout for years and then i started taking this and about month three it started going away
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.600]  That's three years ago. I hadn't seen gout since all you got suffers out there. Check it out. It's how fast did that?
[51:49.680 --> 51:51.680]  How fast did it kick in?
[51:51.680 --> 51:57.280]  You know, it took about six months, but the flares each month. I used to suffer two month two flares a month
[51:57.680 --> 52:02.800]  That went down to one and after six months. I started to have the twinge, but after three years
[52:02.880 --> 52:05.440]  I haven't had full blown gout since then
[52:06.720 --> 52:11.280]  Well, who knows what it was you were deficient in but if you're deficient that's where all this stuff
[52:11.360 --> 52:15.680]  That's why it's called essential ionines essential d3 is essential c is essential
[52:16.160 --> 52:18.160]  b12 it's all essential
[52:18.160 --> 52:23.360]  A body's ultimate turmeric formula again something like tumor where it's 95 percent of cumanoid
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.400]  We have the strongest one out there. It's got basically everything in one pill a different strokes for different folks
[52:28.480 --> 52:30.480]  Thank you so much brother and god bless you
[52:32.160 --> 52:35.600]  He's absolutely right folks. That's not rhetoric. It's not something we're saying
[52:35.840 --> 52:40.560]  It's a uan world government takeover where the uans the boss with the chai comms
[52:41.040 --> 52:46.880]  They're now saying everybody's got to go to sensitivity training to have any job to be taught America's bad and your bad
[52:46.880 --> 52:49.680]  The whole country's an open air reeducation camp
[52:51.680 --> 52:55.280]  And they've got all these compliant sheep going along they were always going to be sheep
[52:55.840 --> 52:57.840]  We've got to be leaders and put our foot down
[52:58.560 --> 53:01.600]  Angela in arizona. You're on the air. Thanks for calling
[53:02.400 --> 53:03.600]  Hi, Alex
[53:03.600 --> 53:07.200]  I'm asked for new regulations. I thought I just give you mine
[53:07.600 --> 53:08.800]  Yes, please
[53:08.800 --> 53:10.800]  It's to raise my children
[53:11.280 --> 53:15.440]  Um in a christian world in this free country that I grew up in
[53:15.440 --> 53:18.640]  And I'm not gonna let anyone harm a hair on their head
[53:19.440 --> 53:25.760]  And god will and I'll live 110 until my great-grandchildren helped Jesus was the one who saved us from satan's followers
[53:26.320 --> 53:28.960]  His medical technocratic tyranny is real
[53:29.360 --> 53:34.720]  But so is jesus and I'll never submit so say 10 in the world order and I just want to say I pray for you
[53:35.200 --> 53:39.680]  And in fours and god bless you all I pray for you. Thank you. It's a little beautiful voice
[53:39.680 --> 53:45.040]  And and think about this and I mean this when I say it praise the living god
[53:45.760 --> 53:53.200]  That we are of the living god who created the universe. This is the evil satan fallen trying to play god and it's ridiculous and it's a joke
[53:54.320 --> 53:58.960]  He hates free will he wants omnipresent control. He wants robots that serve him and
[53:59.680 --> 54:03.520]  It's all being manifest. It's all being proven. It's all being fulfilled. It's all real
[54:04.480 --> 54:07.040]  And I got to tell you as the evil intensifies
[54:07.040 --> 54:10.640]  My discernment has kicked up so high now
[54:11.440 --> 54:17.600]  That I don't even get into it on air. I can't even handle it. It's like the blueprints to everything just like how everything works
[54:17.680 --> 54:22.480]  The knowledge what's gonna happen next. I can't even handle it like all night long my dreams when I wake up in the morning
[54:22.480 --> 54:26.240]  I'm just so energized that I don't even feel like I'm worthy to be on air because I can't even
[54:26.800 --> 54:28.800]  Articulate at all, but I can see the matrix now
[54:29.120 --> 54:32.720]  I know you can see it now the enemy's panicking as we all begin to see the code
[54:32.720 --> 54:38.160]  And when you see the code you see if satan projected this in front of us and god's right on the other side
[54:38.400 --> 54:40.400]  We are piercing the veil together
[54:41.520 --> 54:43.520]  black
[54:44.080 --> 54:47.600]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.920]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.400]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition
[54:56.400 --> 55:04.000]  Buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[55:04.560 --> 55:12.880]  Supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.360]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system
[55:17.360 --> 55:28.720]  Recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells
[55:29.040 --> 55:37.360]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality
[55:37.600 --> 55:43.600]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store.com
[55:43.600 --> 55:50.000]  It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the u.s
[55:50.480 --> 55:55.680]  They encourage people to live in tents cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime
[55:56.160 --> 56:02.160]  It's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030. Of course the gray reset. They want to lower
[56:03.200 --> 56:08.880]  Expectations they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better
[56:09.040 --> 56:11.920]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse
[56:11.920 --> 56:16.080]  The globalists fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes
[56:16.560 --> 56:22.400]  They are separate from us their children go to private tutors. They admit this and now they want us to lock down
[56:23.120 --> 56:29.360]  Telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure
[56:29.680 --> 56:34.960]  The infrastructure that's left under 5g is going to control robot autonomous cars and trucks
[56:35.280 --> 56:41.360]  This is all they're admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's gone operational
[56:41.360 --> 56:44.160]  It's a post human future. You better find out about it right now
[56:48.160 --> 56:50.800]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[56:50.800 --> 56:56.800]  So
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.240]  Infowars the most banned network in the world
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.040]  As we prepare to close out the nightmare year of 2020
[57:17.040 --> 57:21.200]  It's important to understand the forces behind
[57:21.840 --> 57:24.960]  COVID-19 and its deadly rollout
[57:25.840 --> 57:27.840]  the Associated Press and
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.520]  Every other major establishment publication that you can find
[57:32.240 --> 57:35.520]  Are telling us over and over and over again
[57:36.240 --> 57:38.240]  that COVID-19
[57:38.800 --> 57:40.560]  Conquered the world
[57:40.560 --> 57:43.440]  The COVID-19 took over the world
[57:43.440 --> 57:48.080]  The COVID-19 is causing tens of millions to starve to death
[57:48.480 --> 57:53.200]  And sending hundreds of millions and even billions towards the edge of starvation
[57:53.840 --> 57:55.520]  and complete poverty
[57:55.520 --> 58:02.720]  It is a 100 percent verifiable fact that that is a hoax and that that is a fraud
[58:03.520 --> 58:08.480]  It is the lockdown in response to COVID-19 that's triggering the global depression
[58:08.480 --> 58:15.920]  It's the lockdown in response to the media driven and governmental driven and medical driven hysteria about COVID-19
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.040]  That is triggering this worldwide depression that is irrevocably
[58:21.680 --> 58:26.720]  Sabaging infrastructure built up over the last 200 years in the planet civilization
[58:27.760 --> 58:34.960]  Understanding who the forces are behind the COVID-19 orchestrated hysteria and what their goals are
[58:34.960 --> 58:39.440]  Are absolutely critical if humanity is going to defeat this
[58:40.000 --> 58:45.840]  Technocracy takeover. It is not COVID-19 that is conquering the world. It is the united nations
[58:46.640 --> 58:47.920]  big pharma
[58:47.920 --> 58:53.200]  Big tech and the large banks that fund them that codified this sustainability
[58:53.840 --> 58:57.120]  Post-industrial plan of the last 30 years
[58:57.600 --> 59:03.440]  Their chief engineer and science officer carrying out the operation being clow Schwab
[59:03.440 --> 59:12.400]  Working with bill gates and other top globalists clow Schwab through the un has been able to take over almost every major
[59:12.960 --> 59:18.400]  governmental medical decision making process putting the united nations big pharma
[59:18.880 --> 59:26.400]  big tech and other globalist corporations in control of seven and a half billion people's medical future bill gates and clow
[59:26.400 --> 59:36.000]  Schwab are on record saying COVID-19 is only a pretext or a drill for the planetary takeover of every aspect of human life
[59:36.400 --> 59:38.400]  global social credit scores
[59:38.560 --> 59:44.560]  Tracking apps on all your phones having to register online before even leave your house or go to the grocery store
[59:44.960 --> 59:51.280]  This is the technocracy. This is the global social credit score being hailed by zi zi ping
[59:51.680 --> 59:54.880]  Now being adopted worldwide by western nations
[59:54.880 --> 1:00:01.200]  The united nations Schwab bill gates. The communist chinese are all in an admitted consortium
[1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:11.040]  Developing and agreeing upon a planetary world standardized id barcode and qr code tracking system during phase one
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:15.600]  Phase two is liquid nano chips in the vaccine itself
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:22.960]  Proving that you've been vaccinated which then doubles as your medical passport. It is critical for you to understand
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:24.960]  That none of this is my opinion
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:28.800]  The globalists have all written books and white papers
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:31.360]  detailing this takeover plan
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:33.520]  for more than 40 years
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:41.680]  And a decade ago under operation lockstep the rockefellers detailed the specific plan and the specific attack that we are now under
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:48.880]  via the great reset bill gates zi zi ping clow schwab prince charles and others are on record saying
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:55.440]  COVID-19 is the pretext for their great reset to end the industrialized world as we know it
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:00:59.520]  And lower the human population by at least 80 percent
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:08.400]  If they are successful carrying out their global covid takeover using the fear of the virus as the pretext for their authoritarianism
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:14.160]  This will be the greatest crime and the greatest mass murder and the greatest
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:22.880]  Redistribution of wealth from the common people and the poor to the so-called global elites. The planet has ever seen
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:28.000]  This is modern warfare. This is global corporations
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:30.160]  establishing a world government
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:36.000]  To counter a global crisis of hysteria. They have created based on covid
[1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:41.920]  From which you never get out of the crisis. They only expand all right full reports of band-on video
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:45.120]  It's a good one to give people because I cover everything in one big swath
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:51.280]  It's at band.video band.video get it out to everyone you know
[1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:59.840]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the united nations the big corporations the globalists
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:04.560]  Big tech and big pharma are all pushing the cup is the most deadly thing in history even though statistically
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:10.080]  It's a very weak flu or cold, but if you are deficient then you can actually die from it
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:12.320]  That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes
[1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:18.960]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and and and researchers and former fizer head medical officers have come out and said
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:25.440]  That the covid-19 vaccine especially the mRNA ones are basically bio weapons that are super deadly and now they're having to
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:30.880]  Recessitate people that die basically when they take it just like newborn babies. They give vaccines
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:33.760]  They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:37.840]  And that's on the record. It does that gianmarais narcolepsy
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:41.760]  Cancer all these other diseases, but they tell you safe and effective. No one's getting hurt
[1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:46.160]  It's a conspiracy theory and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:03:08.160]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:14.960]  It's my final broadcast of 2020 official Alex Jones show. I'm gonna be up here tonight
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:22.880]  So hosting a live stream with Tim Dillon the comedian and who knows I might twitch the arm of some of the crew
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:27.040]  Stay up here with me. Maybe do a little live transmission over the feeds
[1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:29.760]  As we bring in the new year
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:33.360]  But I haven't gotten around to telling them now. I guess I'm telling them as we speak
[1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:39.280]  But here we are taking your phone calls in the second hour a lot of big developments around the world a lot of things happening
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:42.160]  They are trying to pass bills in new york
[1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:47.760]  To arrest and detain anyone they want if they're coughing have a runny nose or a fever
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:50.880]  And they'll just disappear you into a medical
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:55.920]  Terrany facility and intubate you with a new guillotine that is known as a ventilator
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:02.320]  And then say that you've died of COVID-19 kind of like Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate found dead in his house COVID
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:06.480]  The new congressman who just got elected had a heart attack COVID
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:12.320]  Just it's a via hit by a car if you're I guess killed on death row by lethal injection
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:15.200]  They'll just say COVID so we're taking phone calls on
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:21.360]  Your new year's resolution what you see coming. Do you think Trump's gonna be able to still squeeze this out?
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:23.360]  I know they're not giving briefings
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:26.960]  Still to Joe Biden. He's getting very very upset
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:31.360]  Massive evidence of fraud is just stacking up continually. There's a lot of big
[1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:33.760]  State houses that are having hearings
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:39.040]  And and saying they want signature verification and saying that they think the full legislature should come in and that
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:41.360]  There's clear evidence that trump really won the election
[1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:46.800]  In all five of those states, he was winning big by two three four five percentage points
[1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:51.600]  Hundreds of thousands of votes half a million votes until they closed
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:58.880]  And then the magic happened the black briefcases the black suitcases came out from under the tables and
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:04.480]  Everybody was kicked out and the magic time happened and the giant spikes for biden with the videos in georgia
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:09.120]  And other states of them counting the same stacks over and over again. It's not enough to have
[1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:15.680]  Not enough to have you know, 10 suitcases that you kick everybody out you pull out from underneath the black tablecloth
[1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:21.920]  You then got to run each stack over and over and over again as many times as you can
[1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:25.600]  And then bingo everything goes good
[1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:28.480]  And then bingo everything goes good
[1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:32.000]  Then you just have the national news say not any evidence of fraud
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:35.360]  And as the evidence of fraud comes out they go well not widespread
[1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:37.920]  Even though it's the same scam in every state
[1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:41.360]  So the globalists are going for broke
[1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:45.280]  Lynn wood follows emergency petition in the u.s. Supreme court to stop
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:48.720]  January 5th runoff races for u.s. Senate in georgia
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:54.400]  Citing the fraud citing that they're still using fake mail and ballots that aren't being verified
[1:05:54.400 --> 1:05:56.400]  The signature is not being verified
[1:05:57.200 --> 1:05:58.560]  You've got
[1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:05.760]  All the different democratic party operatives there ruling as judges to allow all this to happen. This is really a dangerous situation
[1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:12.480]  He also says you will follow petition with the u.s. Supreme court in the georgia election case
[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:16.960]  So there is a lot going on here is the petition the beginning of the petition
[1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:26.160]  Petitioner asked for an emergency order restraining respondents to halt the january 50,000 21 senatorial runoff election
[1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:32.880]  Until such time as respondents agreed to comply with georgia legislatures prescribed election procedures
[1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:36.000]  Again, they're not even following the law. It's totally illegal
[1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:40.880]  But the supreme court has a cut in dry case here, but they won't take it. I bet or they'll overturn it
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:46.720]  Petitioners further requests that this court direct the district court to order production of all
[1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:49.680]  registration dates
[1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:51.280]  ballots envelopes except
[1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:58.240]  Required to be maintained by georgia state federal law to refrain from wiping or other wise tampering with all data
[1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:01.680]  All voting machines use on number 2020 election and to produce
[1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:06.720]  One such machine from each georgia county for forensic examination by petitioners experts
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:10.720]  And by the way, they've had now I'll get to this after I take calls
[1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:13.680]  some of the top respected
[1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:18.480]  MIT and stanford research institute scientists come out and say
[1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:21.120]  We've looked at the raw data total fraud
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:28.080]  And we've looked at the dominion machines. They're designed for fraud just like the last forensic group found in michigan
[1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:36.640]  They said this is a backdoor machine. This is a swiss cheese operation. This is a submarine with screen doors on it
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:44.160]  This is a jumbo jet with with with with no glass in the windows. I mean this this this dog is a fraud
[1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:46.240]  This dog is not hunt
[1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:48.320]  Unless scamming is what you're looking for
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:53.440]  So all the top eggheads say what we've already noticed with our eyeballs
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:55.600]  that this
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:07:58.000]  Is is crooked as a barrel of snakes?
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:01.200]  All right, let's go to your calls now
[1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:03.360]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:06.160]  That would be
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:09.840]  Kevin in new jersey. Kevin. Thanks for holding. Welcome
[1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:14.160]  Hi, Alex. Yes, go ahead
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:18.080]  Hey, thanks for taking my call. Um long time listener first time caller
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:24.080]  And I just wanted to say, uh, thank you for all you do and god bless you. Thank you. There's a few um quick points here
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:28.960]  Um, the big picture of the new world order. I think this is really important
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:31.840]  So one of my ideas was if you could um speak about it
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:36.400]  Maybe like at the beginning of each of your segments just a little bit not every segment definitely
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:39.920]  Uh for the show because I think a lot of people just get overwhelmed
[1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:43.840]  And then I exactly sure how all this stuff fits together
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:48.480]  So you do break it down though, and I think just doing it more often
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:51.200]  also, um
[1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:56.960]  Methodology, you know what the goal was to do is they basically like you were talking about at different points in a show
[1:08:57.440 --> 1:08:59.440]  They create problems
[1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:03.200]  They use those as a cover an opportunity to offer a solution
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:06.480]  But that's really like a weapon disguised as a solution that
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:09.520]  Further is their agenda and you could break that down too
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:12.480]  and also, um
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:18.000]  I was thinking it'd be a good idea to have like, you know more of like
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.960]  Sort of like um almost came up with this idea
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:23.760]  A pre-market initiative
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:30.080]  Maybe bringing people on from other governments who are committed to having their economies operated in a free market economy
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:32.560]  And how that plays into the whole
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:37.440]  Opposition of the new world order system how they're competing against the free market. I agree
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:42.160]  We should be talking more about a true free market system to counter the crowning capitalist
[1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.640]  centralized system. I appreciate your call
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:47.840]  And yes, we should do more many documentaries
[1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:52.000]  Five ten minutes long like prager university does on big
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:56.240]  Subjects that give people a larger understanding of how the world works
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:03.200]  But I mean you go right with the globalists say they want a new planetary system based on carbon taxes and the surveillance of carbon taxes
[1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:05.680]  And a world court a world army
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:07.760]  of a system that
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:15.280]  Of a system that centralizes control over medicine over travel over investment over education
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:18.960]  Over religion over reproduction
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:21.680]  And that's all being standardized right now
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.960]  And so it's a private corporate world government
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:27.280]  Who's in game
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:29.280]  is depopulation of the planet
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:34.880]  And the establishment will then merge with machines and become this new evolved creature
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:38.480]  Now now whether they're going to get away with that or whether that's going to work. I don't know
[1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:41.360]  The bible says they're going to try to do it and it's going to fail
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:47.840]  And destroy most the earth which they say happened with atlantis before so things I guess repeat themselves
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:53.520]  All I know is these people are diabolical and they're super ruthless
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.600]  And yeah, they say oh, we're going to lock things down to stop covid notice
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:10:59.600]  They only lock it down more it doesn't stop covid
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:06.480]  And it gives them more power they get richer they consolidate control you get bored every time they try to help you. It's the opposite
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:11.040]  They throw you a life raft when you're in the ocean you grab it. It's electrified
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:14.800]  They give you a glass of wine. It's got poison in it
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.360]  They give you a cell phone. It tracks the controls you
[1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:22.480]  I mean they are they are committed to evil as much as we're committed to good that they are purist
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:25.680]  And they see you as idiots and have no respect for you
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:30.160]  Let's go to joey in north carolina for a minute and a half joey. Thanks
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  Hey, alice, can you hear me? I sure can't go ahead
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:38.240]  Hey, buddy. I was just wanting to call y'all was asking about um, you know
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:41.920]  What we think is going to happen with the the new year and everything that's coming
[1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:47.680]  Um, honestly, man, I'm just scared to death because why in the world would our government
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:50.320]  Give the vaccine
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:57.760]  No, only what's going to happen. Give it to our first responders and our armed forces first. I mean, is this just not stupid?
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:01.280]  I just don't get it. It makes no sense whatsoever. Why we I mean
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:06.880]  What's going to happen here in the next year whenever all of our nurses and our doctors start dying
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:09.360]  Who's going to be able to take care of us then?
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:12.400]  Well, the they think the public's so dumb
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:19.040]  See they did a test with autism. We went from one in 35,000 boys having autism to about one in 58
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.600]  It's even worse in south korea. It's like one in 30
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:25.840]  And so if we put up with tens of millions of brain damaged kids and we know it's the vaccines
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:29.040]  We're just gonna have tens of millions dying of cancer and autoimmune disorder
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:34.400]  And they'll just oh, we don't know what it is a covet 2.0 does it and they'll just give you some cover story, but
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:40.240]  Uh, you're absolutely right. This is a soft kill weapon designed to debilitate and bankrupt the country
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:44.880]  This is the war. We're under world war three attack by the globalist about the chai crimes
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:49.440]  This is an active war great point jelly. They're right back. Stay with us

[1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:23.680]  And a bolt of blue light was gone. There I was stuck back in the year 1974
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:30.080]  But now

[1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:59.520]  Let's go ahead and take a call from charles
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:03.040]  charles in georgia come on down good to have you here
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:07.440]  Hey alex man glad to get a hold of you've been trying to get a hold of you for two months
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:09.120]  um
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:16.080]  There's something really big that uh went down in that bobble inski interview with tucker that kind of slips through the cracks and nobody's paying attention to it
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:17.600]  um
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:23.280]  Do you remember the text message that julie juliani released that uh where uh hunter was complaining
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:29.040]  That um, you know i'm the one who's been uh, uh earning for the entire family for 30 years
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:32.400]  It's really hard, but don't worry unlike pop. I won't make you give you half my salary
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:34.480]  Remember that text
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:36.000]  Yes, I remember
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:40.480]  Okay, then there was another email when bobble inski was on and it showed
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:47.280]  Uh 10 for this guy 10 for the other guy 10 for hunter and then in parentheses. It said another 10 for joe
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:53.680]  Uh hunters hold another 10 for the big man. So 10 points for him 10 points for joe
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:59.120]  So it's established at the business model. It's very clear. It's a 50 50 split whatever hunter gets
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:01.920]  Um, he splits half with joe
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:05.600]  Then you look on the screen and they kept showing part of a document
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:11.120]  Tucker kept showing and it had an llc in there for hunter and another llc in there for jim
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:17.120]  That document with those little boxes in it. That's what's called a fee agreement. It's really obvious
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:20.480]  It's obvious why they're only showing part of it too, but that's a separate subject
[1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:25.040]  The point is that tells you the structure that means whoever's paying hunter
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:29.520]  Okay, whether it's coming from china, ukraine, romania, wherever it's coming from
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.960]  They're sending the money over to what's called a pay master
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:37.040]  That's why they're have that document with the little boxes on it. That's called a fee agreement
[1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:40.480]  Everybody that's getting paid on the deal signs off on the fee agreement
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:46.400]  The money comes from china, romania, whoever's paying the commissions goes over to the pay master and the pay master disperses the funds
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:48.880]  Based on what's in those boxes that they all agreed to
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:55.600]  So we know that the money goes through the pay master over to hunter's llc and then from hunter's llc
[1:17:55.600 --> 1:18:00.320]  He has to split 50 percent with joe. So that's all trump needs to know right there
[1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:06.320]  Okay, wherever that money goes out a hundred. Yes, that's the foreign money and then we have his rat son saying
[1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:12.640]  I've meet with the head of chinese intelligence and the agent I work with disappeared and are billions of my daddy
[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:16.080]  I'm being investigated by the southern district mommy
[1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:20.320]  I mean, it's cut and dry that he's a communist chinese agent
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:27.360]  That's just one piece of it. Joe goes on tv in china and says china should run every aspect of our lives
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:34.240]  This is national security trump doesn't need to go through attorneys and warrants and all this
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:39.280]  He can instruct the treasury and the fed to follow that money out of hunter's llc accounts and wherever it went
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:46.160]  Exactly, he doesn't need the justice department because he's the executive branch and just like he could put sanctions on iran
[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:50.320]  He could put sanctions on those countries and on the bidens
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:56.400]  You know truck the treasury and the fed to find those bribe money accounts in about five minutes today and expose it and say
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:02.960]  Look, here's all joe's bribe money accounts. He can find it in five minutes. In fact, that's right. He showed his swiss bank accounts, brother
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:08.000]  What's crazy is the white house knows this I got asked by one of the trump signs
[1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:11.040]  About a weekend of the election when I went out in arizona. They said
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:17.520]  And they want you to talk to this guy. It's this guy calls up and he works for a big company and he says we want you to look into
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.600]  where they get the money
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:22.640]  For staple streets and for dominion at subcompany
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:26.400]  And so I went and hired a company took them three weeks
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:29.040]  and they found the llc's in
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:31.680]  switzerland
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:36.400]  and the 400 million on october 7th of this year 2020
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:40.800]  Being sent to dominion by the communist party
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:46.880]  And it was even like the federal government sent part of it and then a local government
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:53.040]  They made a local government make the other part of the 400 million. I mean it says the chinese government brother
[1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:59.760]  The chinese government and then it took a week they ended up being in probably 20 newspapers but got no traction
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.720]  So yeah, it's just so it's not that the white house doesn't know
[1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:05.440]  I guess
[1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:07.440]  If they've got classified info
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:12.320]  The president could declassify where he wants. I don't get why they called me to look into it
[1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:15.920]  But and I wasn't the only one they were calling. So what's that sound like to you?
[1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:19.200]  Well, I don't know why they're not doing it
[1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:25.760]  I guess that the powers that we already have joe's bribe money accounts and they're gonna walk in on day one if he gets in and go
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:27.760]  Hey, joe, we know about all the accounts
[1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:34.480]  Uh, you can keep the money you can keep the accounts, but uh, in the other hand, uh, here's this green new deal sign off on this
[1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:39.200]  And we won't well, that's it exactly joe joe. They want him in there because he is the most compromised
[1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:45.200]  Slam dunk easy to destroy remember the remake of the excellent book stupid movie dune
[1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:49.360]  I mean, I mean, I like, uh, you know the director that made dune, but I don't think it's one of his better films
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:54.880]  But remember baren harkin and has a heart plug in everybody where you just pull the plug and it opens up their heart
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:21:01.120]  They're aorta. I mean, that's what joe biden's like. He literally is on a very short electrified leash
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:08.000]  And I cannot believe that we're about to let this totally compromised creature in control of the united states
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:14.080]  Expose the accounts just show the whole world on the just go on. Hey, we found all joe's bribe money accounts
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:17.120]  You're gonna let him get in office. That'll be the end of them. They'll have to indict it
[1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:22.560]  Instead of letting them get in and be told what to do hold me accounts over his head. Just show them now
[1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:27.920]  Here's his bright. Amazing points. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely correct. I remember seeing that. Thank you
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:34.800]  Let's take another call. Danny and Canada. Danny. Thanks for holding. Yeah, it's great to have great to be here. How are you? Good
[1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:42.160]  Um, yes, going up in Toronto, Canada. I'm concerned about what's going to happen on january 6
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:45.920]  Um, I mean, this is the great reset. I mean true dough up here
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.120]  My jaw dropped to the floor when Justin Trudeau made that video looking into the camera
[1:21:51.680 --> 1:21:53.680]  Saying ah building back better
[1:21:53.680 --> 1:22:00.960]  This un slogan that all these leaders are using now and he goes agenda 2030 the great reset is here. It's here
[1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:06.080]  It's here. You're not essential. You're gonna own nothing. You're gonna have nothing and you're gonna love it
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:10.720]  That's a quote. You will own nothing. You will have nothing. You will love it. It's so liberal
[1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:15.520]  And claus schwa was on tv saying this I try to show my friends and family and they're like
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:19.440]  Nobody wants to learn or really listen to what they're saying
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:24.800]  Well, let them know when they're bankrupt that you know, who did it to them? Just let them know because there's all the
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:31.040]  Being candy asses is over. This is their big but they all have these little pretty boy like little soft voices
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:36.160]  Oh, we're coming to help you. It's for the covet. Meanwhile, they've all doubled their profits last year
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:39.760]  They're just raping everyone and run giant un child kidnapping rings
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:46.320]  You're right and and he's trudeau sitting there in a room full of women saying, you know who I admire the
[1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:53.920]  Chinese the Chinese communists the way they can turn their economy around on a dime. I can't believe he's just so blatant, you know
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:58.400]  Oh, I forgot I forgot when he said they said what type of government do you like he goes?
[1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:03.200]  I like dictatorships. I like china. They got the best dictatorship and the women all getting. Oh, yeah
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:08.160]  Oh, he's so cute. Tredosal handsome. He loves concentration camps. He's so
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:13.840]  This is the sick weirdness as people are losing their souls right now. They're becoming very evil
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:17.520]  Uh, I mean, I will say one positive thing from this wild year
[1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:23.280]  If you let me just say what I think the best song of the year is was by an artist named fentanyl the chai calm dragon
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.440]  I don't know if he's gonna be putting out an album, but you sang a hilarious song together
[1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:29.440]  Or I guess a couple months ago now
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:40.080]  All right, you know, we fentanyl should make a return in fact 2021
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:47.200]  You've got a promise fentanyl will return to the airwaves. All right. Thank you or call straight ahead and stay with us
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:55.600]  The boat came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:02.720]  Universal income which of course the united nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:09.680]  It's all now completely official part of the un great reset of the devos group and claus schwaub
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:15.920]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by schwaub and rock and cellar foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21
[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:22.960]  At 20 30 it's here and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:30.640]  And the rejection starts with realizing its spiritual battle diverse evil and stopping abortion
[1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:32.960]  We must start valuing human life again
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:38.800]  We must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable that we are
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:46.480]  Essential until we do that. We are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic god-given human rights now
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:53.040]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:56.400]  Especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:02.960]  Tens of millions of americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:08.480]  But it's going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see record sales once again

[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:39.600]  2021
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.560]  We are not in cancels anymore as they say 8777892539

[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:53.680]  I want to end the year taking your calls

[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:01.600]  And I think I might twist some arms and maybe do a special live show as the new year comes in
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:07.520]  On the east coast, but we'll see if I can get the volunteers with our great skeleton crew here tonight
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:14.000]  But we are live at 12 noon and 34 minutes central standard time right now
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.760]  I want to go to steve rick brandon daemon anthony john
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:22.000]  Charles ron and lina before the sour ends but first
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:26.320]  My patreon supply has been around 14 years
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:29.600]  And they've become the largest storeable food company in the u.s
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:34.880]  For the last three because of their quality because of their service because of their good packaging
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:37.440]  Uh and because of their low prices
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.360]  Everybody else has gone up in prices most people fly by not unfortunately
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:44.320]  They don't have big amounts of food on hand or it's not fresh
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:48.160]  There are some other good outlets out there what they charge you about twice what my patreon does
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  My patreon has to go up
[1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:54.960]  On their prices january 1st
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:00.480]  For all their vendors and for everybody else and when you buy it at info or store.com
[1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:02.880]  You'll still get whatever the best price is but it's gonna have to go up
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:04.880]  I twisted their arm
[1:29:05.840 --> 1:29:10.160]  They'd done a sale two weeks ago. I never promoted it. I never pushed it. It didn't do well
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:15.360]  Because I didn't really talk about prepare with alex.com where they had the last time you could get
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  2020 prices plus a discount
[1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:19.600]  and
[1:29:19.600 --> 1:29:26.080]  They called me a few days ago and said hey, we're seeing record sales right now as people figure out that things are serious the great reset is here
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:30.720]  The globalist want to make people dependent folks one insurance. They can eat for 25 years
[1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:34.960]  We're seeing really high sales. Have you noticed you're seeing high sales on your own website?
[1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:41.440]  Not at the sales site prepare with alex.com where you get that additional savings. We were having already big sales at the regular price
[1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:45.040]  At info or short comment. I said yeah, I noticed that they said well
[1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:48.320]  We have the food on hand
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:53.040]  And we're ready to ship it out within a day or so depending on what the order is some stuff specialty foods
[1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:56.320]  They've got a package right there at the time, but but most of it's pre-packed ready to go
[1:29:57.760 --> 1:29:59.120]  And they said
[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:05.600]  You know, do you want us to extend that sale a few days? And I said yeah do it until the 8th of january and then that's it
[1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:09.280]  So they hadn't done a sale in years until earlier this year. They've done three of them
[1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:13.360]  This is their last sale. It's the last time to get the lower prices
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:18.800]  2020 prices and the sale save up to $850 depending on the food package you get

[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:29.520]  Rampage through your calls rick in massachusetts. You're on the air
[1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:33.680]  Hey alex
[1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:38.560]  I just wanted to let you know I I really believe this is part of a much bigger agenda
[1:31:39.920 --> 1:31:41.920]  As far as militarily
[1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:44.880]  I believe that
[1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:46.880]  Basically
[1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:49.440]  If
[1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:51.440]  biden
[1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:56.880]  Is installed and they were able to push off the rollout of the vaccine
[1:31:57.680 --> 1:32:00.320]  I believe that they would have waited
[1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:06.320]  If they could which is why they were trying to push that and say oh we're we're the it's not gonna be out in time
[1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:09.440]  To try to give it to our military first
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:15.200]  I believe that they're given to the old people so they can hold it from showing
[1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:20.160]  Um, because if trump sees it deflecting our military, I believe he'd stop it
[1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:24.960]  So that's a great point. They've always given experimental vaccines to the military first and then
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:27.600]  um
[1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:30.480]  The lawyer we have on literally stopped at both times
[1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:34.400]  And there's all these incredible heroes that no one even knows who they are like dr. Francis Boyle
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:42.320]  He sued twice and got them to stop the anthrax shot that in one round killed 5 000 troops the next round 10 000 troops
[1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:44.160]  They admit died
[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:45.520]  10 000
[1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:50.160]  I most people I know that have been in the military long term have friends that died
[1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:54.640]  From a vaccine. Sorry go ahead. I have one. I have a friend that died
[1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:59.120]  She came back from Iraq and they put it down as blood poisoning
[1:32:59.120 --> 1:33:05.040]  And she had just had all her shots seven days before before she had it back this way
[1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:10.560]  But what I mean is I believe that they're going to soften up all of china's
[1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:17.040]  Enemies militaries using this. I agree. No, that's what this is. This is a soft kill
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:24.480]  debilitating weapon against our military in our economy. China sir is bragging about this. They say quote America is over
[1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:28.240]  America is dead. Have you seen their top people on azual TV?
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:32.640]  They say that America is over will never reopen. We control the top of their government
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:36.560]  They'll never let them reopen America is over and the money is just flooding into china
[1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:38.640]  The world is rejoicing
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:42.960]  Authoritarians are that we're over they are crying in brazil. They are crying in italy
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:49.120]  They are they hate what's happening rushes on our side. They hate seeing this happen. The chai comms are taking over. You're absolutely right
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:51.040]  Isn't it disgusting?
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:54.480]  Oh, it is absolutely 100 and at this point
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:56.480]  I think that
[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:00.240]  One good thing that we got going for us is I do believe that
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:05.280]  Many many people that couldn't see it before I've been trying to tell people about this
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:09.520]  Since back when you did the cremation of care over 20 years ago
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.480]  When I saw that come out and everybody's
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:19.120]  Crazy conspiracy theorists at the end of the day those people have changed it too. My wife is one of my biggest
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:26.080]  Uh people that was like god. No that's not possible and now she's like oh my god
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:31.760]  You were right. God bless you. But but here's the here's the here's the poison lining to the big pretty cloud
[1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:36.880]  Instead of it being a silver lining of a bad cloud. It's the the the the lining is what's bad
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.960]  When they make a military attack, they know they're gonna get opposition
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:47.520]  And so just waking up isn't enough. I mean when hitler attacked people or the communist invaded countries. We mobilized
[1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:52.640]  But they already knew that would happen. They made their move. They're making their move and going oh, you're waking up good
[1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:55.120]  You won't be awake soon because your ass is gonna be dead
[1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:57.520]  see
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:00.000]  Signed up to wake up now. You got to tell folks. This is real
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:02.720]  You're gonna be homeless folks
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:04.720]  America's under attack
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:07.760]  Our president won by a giant landslide. They're removing him
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:11.760]  We're in trouble
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:17.760]  But the good news is at least we're in a fight now and people aren't gonna be able to sit there and sit on the damn sidelines
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:22.560]  And I believe in you and trump believes in you. That's why he hasn't given up and that's why I'm not giving up
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:28.320]  Steve in Georgia you're on the air welcome
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:32.000]  Hey, Alex, um real quick. I want to talk about
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:38.480]  With these times where everybody's like trying to stay healthy and not pass along germs problem is all the um
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:44.480]  The soap out there is antibacterial soap and that's actually counterintuitive to what you want to do
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:48.160]  You want to stay clean? You want to keep your good bacteria as well as your bad?
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:48.640]  No, that's right
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:51.840]  I'm going to hold you over I want to cut you short in fact guys pull up some studies studies
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:57.520]  hand sanitizers lower immunity hand sanitizers lower fertility hand sanitizers cause cancer
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:02.080]  Hand sanitizers kill good bacteria good bacteria are your flora buffer
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:06.080]  So that you can't get sick when you take antibiotics
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:11.840]  It'll kill stuff, but then knocks out the good bacteria. So you have no buffer then you get sick after all the studies show it
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.880]  What the caller said is 110 percent
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.360]  Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh dead on but they're telling everybody don't be around germs
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:23.520]  Don't be involved and then those people have no immune systems. We're gonna come back to steve
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:32.560]  Then we're gonna go to daemon and we're gonna go to charles and we're gonna go to lina and everybody else that's holding

[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:54.560]  You need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:37:00.080]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:05.600]  I don't I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:07.840]  Taking control of your life taking control of your health
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:10.880]  Not relying on other people to do it for you
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:13.760]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:17.840]  And thinks i'm gonna give that person over there a better life. I'm gonna wake up today
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:22.560]  You know, I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier happier and richer
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:27.200]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:31.840]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said tate. You're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:36.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought you know what?
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.720]  Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:42.400]  And that's why you need to go to info wars.com take control of your health right now and support the resistance
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:47.600]  Don't buy into the group think don't drink the kool-aid drink the turbo force kool-aid's bad. The turbo force is good
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:52.960]  It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the us
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:58.720]  They encourage people to live in tents cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:05.120]  It's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030. Of course the gray reset. They want to lower
[1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:06.880]  expectations
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:11.920]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.960]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:19.040]  The globalists fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes
[1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:25.440]  They are separate from us. Their children go to private tutors. They admit this and now they want us to lock down
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:32.400]  Telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:37.920]  The infrastructure that's left under 5g has been a controlled robot autonomous cars and trucks
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:44.320]  This is all their admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's gone operational

[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:02.320]  It's all the same agenda
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:05.920]  Let's go back to your phone call steven george that you were making a point about
[1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:09.120]  Uh, the hand sanitizers hand gel
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:12.800]  mash used to create new superbug scientists warns
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:15.520]  And a bunch of other articles about how it lowers your fertility
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:20.080]  Sterilizes you makes you sick and kills your good bacteria explain that to people
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:25.920]  well, uh, what happens is it messes up your hormones, um, because of the, um
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:32.960]  Anti-bacterial you want some good bacteria as uh on your body that actually heals you and uh, it actually
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:37.840]  Yeah, it turns out that the solid parts of our body some like a third of us is bacteria
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:40.720]  And bill gates knows that studies that he loves you though. Hmm
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:47.440]  Yeah, you want you want to castile soap you don't want this 99% of the stuff in the store is an anti-bacterial soap
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:50.160]  Which is counter interior of what you want to do you want to get your
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:56.160]  Calf's castile soap something that's not an antibacterial because you want to keep that good bacteria and here's the good news
[1:43:56.240 --> 1:43:59.440]  The public's waking up that antibacterial soap. It's just toxic waste
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:04.720]  They're waking up to bisphenol way and that's why the globalists are panicking and trying to not let us get away from it
[1:44:04.880 --> 1:44:06.880]  Do you believe this?
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:11.520]  Yeah, I mean, uh, they're trying to hold us down any way they can and uh, people are you know
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:19.200]  Trying to do the right thing by staying clean, but they're actually going backwards. Um, so I urge people you can make your own hand sanitizer
[1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:23.440]  They're simple with a half one part rubbing alcohol one part
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:28.320]  Which hazel and sprinkle in some of some of the essential oils. You probably have at the info store
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:32.400]  Um, and you can make your own hand sanitizer and guess what man?
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:37.360]  My kid goes to school and between every class she has to slather on
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:39.840]  hand sanitizer before every class
[1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:46.320]  My my niece who goes to um nursery school before she shows up at this nursery school
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:50.880]  We should walk through the door. They have to have to slide their own and it dries their hands. They absorb the alcohol
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:53.520]  It hurts their fertility. It's a carcinogen
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:59.680]  Under california and other law what's in hand sanitizer is a carcinogen and people need to start fighting it
[1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:04.560]  It's not but it's it's like something you do for yourself like a rat. Oh, let me clean my hands
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:08.000]  It's good to wash your hands. Um, when you've been shaking a bunch of hands
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:12.400]  Whatever you never know just because some people might have some bacteria that your body doesn't like
[1:45:12.400 --> 1:45:19.760]  But with your wife or people, you know, we all make each other stronger more bacteria is better. God bless you
[1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:25.040]  Again, if you have all the vitamins and minerals you need you basically cannot get
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:30.400]  communicable diseases viruses can't replicate bacteria can't take over if you're healthy
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:35.200]  I mean, I don't want to have to knock on wood here, but I get sick like every five years
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:39.360]  And it's a cleansing
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:43.440]  But everybody else I know you'd sit constantly and I just eat garlic like a pig
[1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:47.440]  I take vitamins and minerals and then I still eat ice cream and and and
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:50.880]  Porter house steaks folks. I mean, I'm a glutton. I love food
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:54.640]  You know, there's a rat watching itself
[1:45:55.840 --> 1:45:57.360]  Rats
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:02.080]  You know, we're genetically very similar to rats. We're more genetically similar to a rat or a pig. We are to chimpanzee
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:08.080]  Some weird stuff going on folks. Let's take another call. Let's talk to lina
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:10.880]  In california. Thanks for holding. Welcome
[1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:18.080]  Hi, alex. I'm so glad that I was able to make it on your show. I've tried to call and you guys have a pretty busy line
[1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:24.240]  There's two questions. I have for you. Um, the first question is in regards to the digital mobile app
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:26.320]  I've been reading two
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:32.320]  pieces of information one from your website info wars and then one from the actual cdb cdb website
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:34.560]  the center of disease control
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:37.120]  there's two apps that are in the
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:43.520]  potential of being developed digital health path and then v safe. There's actually an article on cdb cdb about
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:45.280]  v safe
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:50.720]  But these are mobile apps with personal information and qr linking your phone to your vaccination records
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:53.920]  Um, I have a theory that there's going to be two types of people
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:58.000]  There's going to be the type of people that revolts that do not want to have the app
[1:46:58.480 --> 1:47:02.160]  And then there's going to be the type of people that get the vaccine and they're going to want to show proof of it
[1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:06.480]  So they're going to have the app and my question is this for the people that?
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:11.040]  Don't want to use their social media or they don't want to use their phones
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:13.600]  To have that linked
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:19.920]  Do you think that there will be a need for the government to make sure that people have paper documents because
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:24.800]  I kind of have a theory that if people are like, okay, hey, like I don't want to use my phone or like
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:30.240]  Hey, I don't have I don't have a smartphone. I have a flip phone or I downgraded my phone because I don't want them tracking me
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:35.360]  Would there be a need for people to carry around paper documents because well, absolutely
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:42.160]  Here's what's going to happen the globalists have told us there's a 10-part series called mega opalus put out 11 years ago
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:45.040]  by the un
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:47.200]  That's shown to kids in europe
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:53.360]  In different languages, but we have the english version and they say those that don't accept it will finally be forced into ghettos
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:57.600]  You won't be allowed to live everywhere else to be smart cities smart streets
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:47:59.760]  corporate everything
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:06.160]  malls businesses jobs airplanes and then they'll they'll be what they call ghettos and certain rural
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:08.720]  Enclave's where you're forced to live in those
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:11.520]  And and so that's their big phase and then of course
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:15.600]  They'll finally fly over with drones spray us with with bio weapons and try to kill us
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:20.400]  But it's their plan is the hunger games people see that and they oh
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:28.880]  That's a woman, you know talking about the the the UN. No, that's actually predicted programming the actual plan the UN wants
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:33.520]  Is a hunger game scenario? I read a UN biological diversity assessment
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:38.240]  report put out in the late 70s that dr. Michael Kaufman told me about
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:40.880]  for in game for in game 2.0
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:43.360]  and
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:46.640]  In that it says we're going to bring back regions
[1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:51.600]  We're going to bring back games like the olympics and we're going to bring back a caste system
[1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:57.520]  And and people have to live in rural areas and have no technology or they'll live in these smart cities highly controlled
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:48:59.760]  And we're going to bring back human sacrifice
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:04.480]  At these games and we're going to have floating fortresses
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:10.080]  With UN troops everyone will be disarmed and the global global forces
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:13.600]  Will will will be delivered by giant airships
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:15.680]  so when you watch
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:21.760]  The hunger games and that happens. They said there'll be no cars allowed. It'll all be it'll all be maglev trains
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:28.080]  And then armored vehicles for this. No, I mean so you watch the hunger games. That's actually the plan
[1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:32.880]  Super high technology elite we live in huts. You understand?
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.680]  One of my theories is that the people that like don't want to get the vaccine that aren't going to comply with the mobile app
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:45.920]  They're going to need documents to prove either if they've had it or they've not had it and if and it comes down to paper documents
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:50.480]  People can fake paper documents. You can't really fake a digital app. That's how you're saying well
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:51.280]  I mean here's the deal
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:55.360]  It's all discriminatory to have your medical records and make you take a vaccine that doesn't even protect you
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:49:59.920]  That end damages others. It's all just who can they trick to do it in phase one
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:04.960]  Then they're going to start cutting off society and forcing those of us that don't comply to the ghettos
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:08.800]  You're gonna have to take sensitivity training. You're gonna have to take brainwash training
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:13.200]  You're gonna have to hand your kids over for reeducation or you're gonna have to leave their big cities
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:19.040]  That's why they already announced that in Germany and the us all liberal cities starting next year
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:23.600]  Are going to have toll roads to even enter them. You'll have to have a chip to even come into a city
[1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:30.800]  Interesting very interesting. This is a radical revolution against all freedom, ma'am
[1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:38.560]  As my grandpa, he's he's spent 50 years working in a in a hospital. We live in LA, california
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:41.200]  He's seen many many
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:46.880]  Pandemics people are very uneducated about what a pandemic really is but hiv was a pandemic and hiv was
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:51.520]  far deadlier and far worse or a disease than kovat 19 and
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:57.280]  His response to it is a lot different because with his medical experience
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:01.600]  He sees a lot of things and what he's told me is that people really aren't dying from kovat
[1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:08.480]  That they're dying from heart disease diabetes other underlying conditions. Yes, ma'am all doctors all nurses everyone
[1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:11.760]  It's all fact, but you're only allowed to say what the un says
[1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:16.880]  And again, they're not even calling this an epidemic meaning people are dying. It's a pandemic meaning it's spreading
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:21.520]  We can say everybody's got water in them. So that's a pandemic too. Exactly. It's a tracking
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:24.080]  synthetic virus to make you all guilty
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:29.040]  But it doesn't really kill you unless you have vitamin and mineral deficiencies like any other coronavirus
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:33.520]  But everyone is now going to have an autoimmune response to regular coronaviruses from the vaccine
[1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:35.680]  So that's going to cause the mass death
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:42.000]  Mountain patriot in colorado. Thank you for holding. How are you doing alex?
[1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:45.680]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother. How are you?
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:50.320]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that dna force
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:55.600]  I love it. I've been using it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day
[1:51:55.600 --> 1:51:57.600]  And I see that it contains quercetin
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:03.200]  Which according to some published studies that dr. Merkala has cited
[1:52:03.920 --> 1:52:07.520]  Is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine?
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:12.560]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells. So people might want to take a look at that
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:20.880]  To all I know is with dna force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:25.200]  That aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product
[1:52:25.200 --> 1:52:30.400]  And it was really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:33.280]  And that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug
[1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:38.480]  Mr. Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism
[1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:40.960]  Other dictionaries have similar ones
[1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:48.560]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason
[1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:52.720]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:56.320]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is
[1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:58.480]  Do you see the headlines from CNN?
[1:52:58.480 --> 1:52:59.200]  ABC News
[1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:00.160]  Dr.
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:03.760]  Say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more dumbest thing they could ever imagine
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:06.400]  They told us that
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:11.120]  Two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months. Okay
[1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:18.320]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things. We're talking 96% at co-morbidity
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:23.520]  These are real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event. We all run our houses
[1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:27.920]  Never come out and are taught. We're not essential. Well, the big box doesn't come out
[1:53:27.920 --> 1:53:31.520]  And are taught. We're not essential. Well, the big box tours in amazon take over the planet
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive
[1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:45.120]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:52.320 --> 1:53:54.320]  All right, damon and charles i'm going to you right now
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:54:00.320]  And the next segment i'll continue with calls the last broadcast i'm doing the official alex jones capacity of the year
[1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:02.640]  The war room is coming up elin shroyer
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:05.280]  And then i'm gonna be back over tonight doing interviews and stuff. So
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:11.760]  I'm i'm gonna shoot around midnight eastern to go live and you know say hey, we're here in 2021
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:15.920]  We'll see what happens. We'll see if I can muster up some of the uh some of the crew here
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:19.040]  but
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:22.960]  You heard that lady call in about her grandpa that works in the hospital and he knows what's going on
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:24.960]  Well, of course, everyone knows
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:29.760]  And then if you say anything or do anything they try to silence you or punish you because they're authoritarians
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:34.880]  We can't take that as it will be intimidated things get worse not fighting the bullies politically
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:40.720]  And I grew up learning about bullies and at a certain point you just got to roll your sleeves up and
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:43.520]  Beat the living hell out of them
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:50.640]  Or die trying and that doesn't mean physically beat the hell out of them but get in their face sue them get aggressive stand up for yourself
[1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:52.640]  They're
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:54.720]  Stampeding us into this
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:54:58.960]  Again, we're taking the calls the order they're received we've got like 20 phone lines
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:02.560]  So that's why someone you've been holding over an hour charles and maryland welcome
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:10.240]  Yes, hi alex is a good day considering circumstances very happy to get you on the line
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:13.200]  right now
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:14.320]  um
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:16.160]  I have uh
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:24.720]  I have been fighting all year alex ever since the shutdowns protesting them with a very few people that were out weekly in anapolis maryland
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:29.200]  Because I I predicted what was going to happen with the field with the election there
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:31.440]  Then i'm sure you did as well
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:36.880]  And it happened and here we are here. We are just uh less than three weeks from the uh
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:39.920]  inauguration
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:41.600]  and um
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:43.600]  I wanted to let you know
[1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:45.920]  That something very special happened to me
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:50.960]  This year and it is a direct result of you your show alex is
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:54.960]  I didn't know info wars was still on the air. I remember watching you
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:55:59.920]  About three years ago and listening to you talk about everything that's unfolding and agreeing with you
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:03.760]  I saw you pop up on facebook and youtube and then you got censored
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:08.640]  And by the grace of god you came back to me shortly before the election
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:11.360]  I was pretty much had tucker carl snub until that point
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:13.520]  and
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:15.520]  You
[1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:17.680]  Led me to christ again. I became a refabe
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:21.440]  In god, I became stable when I was young. I'm 49
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:28.400]  Years old now and the holy spirit just entered my body. It was amazing and it totally changed me as a person
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:32.640]  And I wanted to thank you for that that's been an incredible thank you brother
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:37.040]  Because I want to be with you and for an eternity with god and this is an energy issue
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.600]  It's it's it's good and there's evil and we have to decide what energy we're going with and it really
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:46.080]  Comes down to that at the end of the day and god is real the devil is real free will is real
[1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:48.240]  That's why evil exists and
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:49.760]  I'm not a Pharisee
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:53.440]  I don't sit up here and say i'm perfect and i'm the best person but my heart's with god
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:57.120]  And I want to be good and I choose god and I ask god for the strength
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:02.080]  And so i'm sorry. I've always felt the holy spirit very strong. I go in these big churches
[1:57:02.160 --> 1:57:05.200]  I pick up a fake corporate kind of positive
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:10.640]  Deal it's it's a satanic energy. It's a very sick kind of glitzy satanic energy
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:12.640]  It's it's a seductive energy
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:18.240]  But but when I get in rural areas or I get around common people or hard-working folks
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:24.400]  You can feel the holy spirit and the holy spirit's getting stronger brother. It's getting real strong. Can't you feel it?
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:29.520]  I can feel it more than ever. I can feel it right now alex and you know
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:36.720]  Couple of the other things i've done this year one of the ways i've been fighting is by making videos posting them on youtube and facebook
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:38.480]  I actually made one
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:40.480]  That was good enough to get
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:46.400]  Sensored on youtube. Good email saying. Yeah, thanks. It was actually said it's medical misinformation
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:50.480]  Um, it's six and a half minutes. I worked a day on writing it
[1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:55.280]  Um, it can actually see my video too. You can have scientists saying it
[1:57:55.280 --> 1:57:58.080]  You can have tops of hospitals saying the un's wrong
[1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:04.400]  Which has all been proven correct and the and the and big tech says the un's the boss see how we're inside world government
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:06.480]  What was the name of the video?
[1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:09.280]  if you go to truth teller
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:10.480]  at
[1:58:10.480 --> 1:58:12.480]  Charles maccas that's
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:16.320]  A-h-a-r-l-e-s-m-a-c-k-e-s. It's on my parlor
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:19.840]  And i was able to upload the video there anybody can go
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:23.120]  But you know the best way to tell folks how to find something just tell them the name of the video
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:26.720]  It'll and then put parlor.com at the side of it. What's the name of the video?
[1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:31.600]  It doesn't have a name because i don't have a name on parlor. I don't think it might state state america back
[1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:37.040]  I can't recall but it's a great job. Keep it up. Yeah, everybody needs to produce their own reality
[1:58:37.040 --> 1:58:40.320]  And i don't mean their own false reality your own truth your own justice
[1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:46.640]  You need to speak it write it say it online in the third dimension pray to god about it talk to your neighbors about it
[1:58:47.360 --> 1:58:53.120]  The great reset is here world government has openly been announced and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family

[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:07.760]  That's why it's important to pray to god be politically active and get prepared for self defense
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:14.960]  And to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need so you're not dependent on the system

[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:09.360]  You know it's all been planned
[2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:13.360]  A center once a center twice
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:17.360]  You need no confessions now
[2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:21.360]  You got to fight of your life now
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:23.360]  Hahaha
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:29.120]  Just like all those children fought for their lives when those doctors chopped them up you're gonna have to fight now
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:38.400]  You let the enemy go to the wall. We all let our own species down and now we're gonna be punished
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:43.280]  And make no mistake
[2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:50.240]  The Rothschilds the Rockefellers the Bill Gates's of the world they will go into the fire as well
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:56.720]  And their destruction will be the most painful and agonizing ever they will be judged
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:04.960]  Every man and every woman will be forced to kneel in front of god
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:12.240]  So Bill Gates can play god all all day long and
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:14.880]  President
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:19.520]  Pretender elect Joe Biden can act powerful all day long
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:22.160]  But he's a nobody
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:24.800]  And he will be brought low
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:27.200]  He will be broken
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:30.240]  He will beg
[2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:39.840]  The almighty and god will tell him the door is closed. You are damned to hell
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  Damned to hell
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  But Joe Biden knows he's damned to hell
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:51.680]  He just wants to take you with him
[2:02:52.800 --> 2:02:54.800]  So thank your lucky stars
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:02:57.360]  Every day that you're not Joe Biden
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:02:59.360]  Or Bill Gates
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:06.160]  Or any of these people who are prepared for their own annihilation and are just trying to drag us down with them
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:08.640]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls here
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:14.240]  Who's been holding the longest now that would be Damon in the great state of Kentucky go ahead
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:19.040]  Hello, thanks for taking my call. Yes, sir. Welcome
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:23.840]  Yeah, oh, thanks man. God bless you guys and all your whole crew and info awards
[2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:27.760]  We really appreciate what you all do. I get the products and support you guys doing everything I can
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:33.040]  Um, I'm the guy jumped on stage in front of me and people at the end of the million mega march
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:37.120]  November 14th and griped out the promoters for kicking you and Roger stone off the ticket
[2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:42.880]  There was probably hundreds of people up there chanting Alex Jones. Alex Jones with me. It was really a rush
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:45.680]  Well, you know
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:48.800]  I'm glad you brought that up because I was thinking about doing this and I want to be the
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:51.840]  Try to be christlike even though I'm a trillion times short of that
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:53.120]  But
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:58.960]  That's all just the confusion of all the different groups and organizations and I've now figured out the chain of events of what happened
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:04.880]  And basically everybody was wrong in that and I acted like an ass so did other people
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:09.360]  But you know what they're not gonna probably apologize for acting like asses until I do
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.520]  And so I've had a chance in hindsight and because that did become quite a circus
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:17.280]  Uh, I've just now put all the pieces together. So later today
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:20.880]  When I start the fourth hour, I'm gonna talk about that. It's funny
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:22.480]  You happen to call in about that
[2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:27.520]  But that was just a tragedy of errors because when you get a half million people out of different events things get confused
[2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:29.920]  Uh, and and and then the next time I was there
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:32.720]  I was told hey go down to the spring court and have an event
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:36.880]  And then the same people thought I was there to take that over and had people basically assault us
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:39.520]  I figured it out before it got too late and left
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:43.520]  Uh, and and you know, so that's what happens. I was at the Jericho stage a few weeks ago
[2:04:43.520 --> 2:04:48.240]  They said hey, you tell folks we're going to the spring court building at four o'clock and I said, yeah
[2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:51.920]  And I was at a restaurant at my hotel didn't want to go
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:57.760]  They made me go and I get there and all of a sudden I'm walking down the street like 50 yards away or 100 yards away
[2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:01.200]  And these big security guys go, you're not taking our stage ran into me and I'm like
[2:05:01.440 --> 2:05:03.760]  So I went across the street like bullhorn hotels going on here
[2:05:04.320 --> 2:05:08.480]  And I'd been told by one group go there and then the other group was there and it was groups fighting with each other
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:13.120]  And then Millie weavers there. So as soon as I show up they go Millie weaver come up here
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:16.720]  And they bring Millie weaver up and it's all on video that I didn't even know she was there
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:19.440]  And it's like I'm being attacked by Alex Jones and you know, so
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:25.840]  So I'll just take the high road. I apologize for what happened there and I apologize how that unfolded and and uh
[2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:29.440]  Because I could see how it looked bad for folks and I'll have them pull the video
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:33.760]  Uh that actually shows where we show up and we get ran into and I told my guys stop
[2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:39.600]  We don't want to go up there if we're not wanted and then they call Millie up because I guess oh, let's get a woman up here
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:43.840]  He's assaulting a woman now. I don't think she was part of that. I don't think the guy was part of that
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:50.000]  I think it was almost like demons or something. We're doing it because let me tell you man weird stuff goes on in dc at these events
[2:05:50.400 --> 2:05:55.760]  I mean, it is just how this weird coincidences and really crazy weird stuff goes on
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:58.240]  So I'll be talking about that start of the next hour, but go ahead
[2:05:59.760 --> 2:06:03.040]  Well, I agree with you. I've I've been there for it and the uh
[2:06:04.240 --> 2:06:11.120]  Jericho march and of course I talked to you down in uh, georgia for a little bit the first day of the stop the steel rally down there
[2:06:11.440 --> 2:06:12.880]  in Atlanta
[2:06:12.880 --> 2:06:16.000]  But uh, it's it's a lot of crazy stuff going on
[2:06:16.160 --> 2:06:21.200]  My group dc under siege that I talked to you about in front of the Lincoln Memorial the other day after the Jericho march
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:22.960]  earlier this month
[2:06:22.960 --> 2:06:25.760]  Um, we're hosting the won't back down rally
[2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:28.880]  January 2nd in front of mitch mcconnell's little kentucky home
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:33.040]  And hopefully on the 5th in front of his dc home. So you guys are all invited
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:35.200]  Uh, we're done with the
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:38.640]  Governance outside the constitution. We're done with massive spending
[2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:44.880]  We're done with all these shutdowns from their bio weapon attacks killing us and our businesses and putting hard americans into poverty
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:51.040]  Uh, you know hard working americans into poverty. We're uh, you know, we're done with the constant assault on our rights
[2:06:51.440 --> 2:06:56.800]  We're done with the censorship and not being able to get our candidates into the political sphere because they can't compete with the
[2:06:56.800 --> 2:06:59.040]  Purse of special interests and foreign entities
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:06.800]  And they can't overcome the fraudulent loading machines set up that keeps them from being to ask the establishment from their seats for probably the last 15 years
[2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:14.000]  And the obama's lower learner rs scandal that prevents them from legally declaring their candidacy that's never been addressed
[2:07:14.640 --> 2:07:19.600]  We're sick and tired of them giving everyone around the world a leg up while they squash american citizens
[2:07:19.600 --> 2:07:21.840]  So it's time for us to put some fear into mcconnell
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:26.000]  He sets the globalist agenda in the senate. So
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:28.800]  What we won't back down a rally
[2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:33.920]  Uh, january 2nd hosted by dc under siege in Louisville, kentucky on saturday january
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.280]  Well brother, I'll be watching for that and I appreciate your call absolutely
[2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:39.280]  And I know you won't be like antifa out there threatening to kill
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:44.160]  Evil turtle as he's called but definitely letting him know that his wife's a chinese communist agent
[2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:48.880]  And we know that he went along with the election fraud. The good news is pence is going to be there now
[2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:53.520]  He wasn't going to be in israel and the good news is uh senator, uh, holly
[2:07:54.160 --> 2:07:56.720]  Is going to try to block all this so it's on
[2:07:57.840 --> 2:08:01.520]  January 5th and 6th the 5th is big the 6th is even more important
[2:08:01.520 --> 2:08:03.520]  It's raw
[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:05.840]  numbers we need
[2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:07.520]  So people see
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:12.560]  Millions upon millions upon millions of people and they control the airspace or i'd run a helicopter to show you
[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:16.000]  They only show that one square full of people. That's about 200 000
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:19.200]  the one back, um
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:21.840]  Right after the election
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:24.800]  You know the first big rally that thing had I mean
[2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:28.240]  the streets pulled
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:34.080]  Down five six streets going three plus miles to supreme court all the way to freedom plaza. It was crazy
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:38.160]  I mean, I mean the dc police estimated almost a million people
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:41.680]  Uh, the the media set a couple hundred thousand. I I don't know but it was
[2:08:42.640 --> 2:08:44.640]  Absolutely crazy. All right, we're gonna go to break
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:47.200]  and i'm gonna come back with
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:49.440]  Ron's been holding the longest
[2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:53.440]  And then we will uh go to everybody else. We're gonna ring in the new year here
[2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:58.320]  taking phone calls on the alex jones show and i'm just again
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:03.680]  Very very very very honored uh to be here and very very blessed
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:06.000]  uh to be here
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:07.120]  and
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:09.120]  I just want to see humanity turn the corner
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:13.760]  We've been decadent. We've been corrupt. We've gotten away from god. We're gonna go through some hell now
[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:17.680]  But that's what gets god's people back in line
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:20.560]  So every time israel became corrupt god put them into bondage
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:25.920]  And we are going into very serious bondage. But this if you think people are awake now you wait
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:30.800]  I mean, you're gonna have people dying on every street. You know of the covid vaccine. It's already killing people everywhere
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:34.960]  Uh, when they take it's killing people. It's meant to kill you in a couple years
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:38.160]  That's it takes over every cell in your body. It's just unbelievable
[2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:50.640]  Wow, we'll be right back. Stay with us

[2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:14.080]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:18.320]  But sorrows and bill gates and the globalists are on our tail
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:21.120]  But the new website is

[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:25.440]  I think the crowd ain't lonely life

[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:34.320]  Imagine someday it'll be the year 2021
[2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:37.440]  The 21st year of the 21st century
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:40.480]  I remember being about four years old
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:42.480]  And my mom
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.080]  was
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:50.880]  Brazing a rump row. She made roast about once a week potatoes and carrots, you know classic thing especially in the winter
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:52.960]  I still remember going
[2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:55.600]  You're cooking the cooking it before she roasted it
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:04.000]  I'm going alex think you'll be this old in the year 2021 in the new century or the year 2020
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:09.600]  Or the year 2000 and then you know she was just talking about different dates coming up the year 2000 the year 2001
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:13.920]  I remember her talking about, you know, it's not really the new millennium till it's
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:16.480]  2001 but some say
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:20.800]  2000 she was like just imagine the year 2021
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:23.520]  I still remember that
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  Like imagining
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:32.400]  Back in the late 1970s. Oh the year 2000 the year 2020 2021
[2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:35.360]  2021 and here we are
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:44.240]  And guess what it's wild science fiction world government locked down to the west communist china taking over
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:47.200]  Inoculations to buy and sell
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:51.520]  They're preparing us for and the inoculation takes over our dna
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:57.840]  And top scientists look at the vaccine and say this will cause horrible out of immune responses or it'll shut your immune system off
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:01.200]  And it's got jellyfish dna in it and it's got the whole cloned
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:07.680]  Genomes of dead children and what and it and they look at it and go this won't protect you from covid
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:12.080]  This will attack protein that's in your body and cause an autoimmune disorder
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:15.440]  And sure enough people are sick. They're dying
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:18.160]  And they just go be tough
[2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:20.480]  We'll never open the economy till you take it
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:26.640]  And they're just normalizing killing us. They had to get to this point. You always wonder wonder what it would look like
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:28.720]  Here it is
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:34.160]  And that's one reason our credibility has gone superdova is everybody knows I would harp on bill gates in my films
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:38.000]  Going back 20 years. They go, why are you obsessed with bill gates because I study this stuff
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:43.280]  And bill gates is as powerful as they get cloth swab headed up
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:46.320]  the united nations
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:50.400]  operation for sustainability when you're sustainability that means mass extermination world government
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:54.880]  And so
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:59.360]  He's like the mater d at a restaurant. He he he's in charge of it
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:04.640]  So when the dinner is incredible, they have a great night. They thank the mater d. They celebrate the mater d
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:09.360]  He's the chief actual scientist in command of operations
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:13.040]  He's a scientist engineer
[2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:15.200]  Gates though is like the owner
[2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:17.680]  of the restaurant
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:21.040]  Because there was again more than 50
[2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:27.760]  Large robber baron foundations that had gotten together to carry out world government and eugenics headed up by ibm
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:30.880]  That finance hitler and all the rest of it the un
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:35.920]  And he is the officer in charge of that. He chairs
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:40.160]  The global eugenics board they have they have awards they give them awards
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:44.160]  And he he's he's the big daddy
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:48.240]  I'm not saying he's the antichrist, but like
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:54.000]  Let's use the christian allegory of lord of the rings j. R. R. Tolkien was a big christian. He did this as an allegory
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:56.560]  And and and so you've got sauron. That's
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:15:59.360]  the devil
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:04.800]  Well, technically in that lore, there was another older satan that got destroyed and then lucifer was now
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:08.640]  sauron
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:10.640]  So he was kind of like the next wave of satan
[2:16:11.200 --> 2:16:13.200]  And and and then under him
[2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:16.240]  He had the kings of the earth that had sold out their power
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:20.480]  Under him and then he gave them power but bound them to him to be living dead
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:24.560]  And that shows spiritually who they are they physically die but the spirit of them continues on
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:29.040]  And so bill gates is like the king of the nasgul
[2:16:30.480 --> 2:16:33.280]  We had to describe bill gates. He's the witch king
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:36.960]  Ruler of the nasgul ladies and gentlemen
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:41.120]  And I mean I'm serious and I'm dead serious about this. He will kill you
[2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:44.400]  Deader than a hammer if he gets away with it
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:48.400]  And then you've got his little goblin minion fouchy
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:55.440]  These are very serious people. They're like the earth is overpopulated. We don't enjoy what we do
[2:16:55.440 --> 2:17:01.200]  But we have to do it, but they love it. They love it. Hey fouchy, how about you and gates go first?
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:04.720]  I'd really respect you more fouchy if you walked out on tv
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:08.640]  With a big razor sharp butchering knife and you want there's too many of us. I'm like
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:13.840]  You started just jabbing at your carotids. I mean, I would respect you just
[2:17:16.560 --> 2:17:21.440]  Or like a samurai have your second help you like maybe commit sepicoot take a short sordid
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:26.960]  Into your right side of your liver and they like yeah, pull it right up into yourself. Then you're like
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.600]  You maybe a bill gates shoved a 12 gauge shotgun in his mouth and just said there's too many people
[2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:36.400]  Boo the top of his brains out. I'd say well, I don't agree with him, but I respect you
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:40.400]  But you don't expect that to happen fouchy. You're not going to take
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:45.120]  Ice picks and run them into your eyes, huh? No
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:53.920]  You're going to put poison in our kids that give them debilitating disorders that sterilize them and then weigh down society
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:56.560]  Because you're not even cool enough
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:18:01.520]  Like Bertrand Russell who wanted to drop neutron bombs theoritized
[2:18:01.520 --> 2:18:08.560]  On all the major cities that he populated earth, you know, he's Bertrand Russell wanted to kill everybody in five minutes. You jerk
[2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:19.520]  But you're gonna kill us real slow and real sweet because you're Dr. Fauci Dr. Fauci
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:22.240]  My name is Fauci. Oh
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:26.640]  Don't talk about vitamins and minerals. Nothing will help you
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:31.360]  Oh, uh, don't talk about vitamins and minerals. Nothing will help you
[2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:35.520]  They got your major pressure. Okay, maybe vitamins will help
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:42.400]  So they get to a point where they got to hit us with the weapons
[2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:46.160]  And we've now reached the point
[2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:50.160]  Where they're hitting us with the weapons and they have to again normalize us getting sick
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:53.360]  normalize us
[2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:57.440]  Being told to shut up normalize the liability protection. It's ambience
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:02.960]  Imagine putting a baby in a microwave and you just put it on low at first and you kind of turn it up more
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:05.440]  And and see that's what this is
[2:19:05.600 --> 2:19:07.360]  the frog in the pot
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:11.760]  Turn it up slows. It's kind of warm and comfortable. He doesn't get out. He doesn't feel incrementalism
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:14.720]  successive approximation
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:16.960]  The inform effect and he dies
[2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:24.000]  And so just like covid's very weak, but infects everybody. So we're all guilty and I'll let it be tracked and reinfects
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:25.600]  It's the perfect problem with no solution
[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:29.360]  And then it makes you have an autoimmune response once you have the vaccine to all regular cold viruses
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:34.800]  Destroying your life making you a total invalid not knowing why you're swelling up not knowing why you're dying
[2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:38.240]  And they're going to go oh covet 2.0 is causing it
[2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:44.080]  Even though it's regular cold viruses that you now have a violent spanish flu effect on
[2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:51.360]  Yeah, they really love the spanish flu and went and dug it up out of the north pole and stuff where whalers died during 1917
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:53.920]  They dug them up like 15 years ago
[2:19:53.920 --> 2:20:00.160]  Because they're like why do regular flues not even kill a million people worldwide? But but this one killed 50 60 70 million
[2:20:00.160 --> 2:20:05.600]  We're not sure and they found out it was the autoimmune response people that had a flu similar
[2:20:06.160 --> 2:20:12.000]  That caused a super reaction not just an antibody reaction, but a huge anaphylactic shock
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:15.040]  You know just total shutdown dying
[2:20:16.560 --> 2:20:18.240]  See how it works
[2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:22.880]  So that's what I figured out that one of the deployments. It's kind of a lot of little special weapons
[2:20:23.520 --> 2:20:26.000]  See, you don't want everybody dying on one thing. It's one's five viruses
[2:20:26.160 --> 2:20:29.280]  You're gonna die of this you're gonna die of that you're gonna die of this die of that die of this
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:31.040]  Die complications of that
[2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:34.640]  But they hit you and then causes an autoimmune response to any cold virus
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:40.400]  So watch everybody that takes this shot will then almost die or die from colds the common cold will now kill you
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:42.400]  Thank you bill gates. Thank you
[2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:48.640]  It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the u.s
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:54.320]  They encourage people to live in tents cities as homeless and they use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime
[2:20:54.720 --> 2:21:00.720]  It's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030, of course the great reset. They want to lower
[2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:05.040]  Expectations they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere
[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:07.600]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better
[2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:10.560]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse
[2:21:11.200 --> 2:21:14.720]  The globalists fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes
[2:21:15.200 --> 2:21:21.040]  They are separate from us their children go to private tutors. They admit this and now they want us to lock down
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:28.000]  Telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:33.600]  The infrastructure that's left under 5g is meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks
[2:21:33.600 --> 2:21:39.920]  This is all they're admitted playing the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's gone operational
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:42.800]  It's a post human future. You better find out about it right now
[2:21:43.840 --> 2:21:51.040]  Fight for Trump on January 6th in washington dc our fight to drain the washington swamp
[2:21:51.360 --> 2:21:55.040]  And reclaim america's destiny has just begun
[2:21:55.040 --> 2:21:59.040]  It's 17 76 times
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:07.680]  On november 14th hundreds of thousands of american patriots gathered in the nation's capital to stop the biggest election steal in american history
[2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:12.400]  America is going under massive martial law and as a communist chinese agent
[2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:20.000]  Joe Biden is able to get in there. He will put america under permanent lockdown siege until we're brought to our knees
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:24.560]  Hundreds of thousands returned to dc in december
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:27.040]  We will never give up. We will never surrender
[2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:32.160]  We will never back down to the satanic pedophile globalist new order
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:34.000]  january 6th
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:40.320]  Fight for trump dc be there. We will never give in. We will never give up and we will never back down
[2:22:40.560 --> 2:22:43.120]  We will never ever surrender

[2:22:51.360 --> 2:22:52.640]  Let me tell you real quick about it

[2:22:55.760 --> 2:23:02.400]  The traditional line of history means that it's clinically studied alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear signage passages and eating respiratory function
[2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:07.920]  It's amazing folks. Absolutely love it. And again, france has been shut down so we couldn't get it

[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.960]  This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail
[2:23:31.520 --> 2:23:35.840]  Don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us

[2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:35.360]  peace will protest new year's eve at the

[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:46.800]  that way
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:49.360]  They can't say there's a curfew even though he's announcing illegal curfew
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:55.600]  Hell we're allowed to burn buildings down and kill people but we're not going to do that just because we're black lives matter
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:25:01.280]  Our and if it doesn't mean we're going to shoot or kill anybody. We're going to be totally peaceful because we're being sarcastic
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:04.720]  We're not sponsored by black lives matter and
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:09.280]  Those guys what does it matter because we're not going to be burning anything down
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:13.520]  That the mayor has announced a curfew illegally the governor said it's illegal
[2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:17.520]  So is the attorney general
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:20.640]  It's big national news and everybody should just start disregarding this crap
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:26.320]  But what you saw in new york what you saw in other globals controlled areas are now trying to duplicate across the country
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:30.880]  Now they're saying oh, sorry the lockdown is never going to end. We always knew that was coming
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:35.200]  This is disgusting and it's all a fraud the hospitals are empty. It's all eyes
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:38.880]  Some emergency rooms are full of other stuff
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:41.440]  Okay, who's been holding the longest now
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:47.280]  Let's go ahead and go to ron and ohio ron. Thanks for holding go ahead. Hey, alex. I've been listening to you since uh
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:50.960]  2005 it's the first time i've ever been able to get uh
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:56.640]  Get in touch with you. I've just got two quick points and then i'll hang up and wait for your response, please
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:01.920]  Uh, I just want to give uh, I live in butler county, ohio and I want to give prompts out to our sheriff
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:07.440]  Uh, sheriff jones, uh when our wacky governor started coming out with these crazy edicts
[2:26:08.080 --> 2:26:11.040]  Back in uh, april may march april may
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:13.840]  Our sheriff basically uh
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:17.440]  Said you know what? I'm not going to enforce these mask rules. Uh,
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:19.520]  You know he
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:22.160]  There was no antifa riding anything like that
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:27.680]  So I want to give a shout out to our sheriff because that's uh, I believe the only thing standing between tyranny
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:36.240]  Uh here where I'm at but uh my main point is I do not understand why trump is not
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:42.480]  At the resolute desk like you're saying I believe that you're giving him keys to keep
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:49.040]  Uh keep people informed keep people updated and he's he's not doing that
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:57.120]  And it it just infuriates me and also I don't understand why he's not dropping the hammer on the deep state. He's got
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:03.520]  All the corruption of these politicians. He's got all this. He doesn't understand the power of the executive
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:06.880]  He's trying to work through the justice department. It's filled with a bunch of cowardly lawyers
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:10.160]  Uh at the top, you know scum rises at the top there in dc
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:15.040]  And so he's been waiting for the evidence of fraud to come in now the fraud's evidence has come in
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:18.880]  And he's going to be at the january 6th a rally at the ellipse
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:21.520]  Right across from the white house
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:26.880]  And some other events that are coming up. Uh, and so I do expect to see trump going to high gear now in 20 days out
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:31.600]  We don't we don't have much time, but I'll tell you this. He's not giving briefings to joe biden from the pentagon
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:33.040]  That's never happened before
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:37.040]  Uh, so and he's telling me we're staying in the white house. So he's got a plan
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:42.400]  And I know he was really elected people go well trump's done this and that that's wrong. Yeah
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:48.000]  Red flag laws are terrible. He least gave cash and support for that. Yeah, I don't agree with him going along with the vaccine
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.640]  That's terrible. I get why he did it doesn't mean I support it
[2:27:51.120 --> 2:27:56.560]  But it doesn't matter. He got elected. He's not the globalist chi-com agent. He's light years better than biden and so
[2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:02.480]  We have to stand with president trump because the globalists are never going to take their foot off our neck if we don't
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:04.320]  Thank you so much ron
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:05.360]  everyone
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:09.040]  Who wants trump to take action you got to go to dc by the fifth
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:14.960]  The fifth and the sixth are critical. We need a million people on the fifth. We need two million on the sixth
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:17.680]  We need to fill everywhere
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:22.880]  And we need everyone to shoot footage of it on their phones and upload it to parlor twitter facebook email it to friends
[2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:28.800]  Just just tape everything yourself. Just flood social media. Just show the world and while you're there
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:32.560]  Get up in the morning and call in to c-span
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:38.480]  And call to talk radio and tell folks what's going on all of you are in the info war all of you are critical
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:41.600]  All right
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:46.480]  Who's up now? Let me see that would be Anthony in oklahoma. Go ahead
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:53.680]  Go back to Anthony in a minute. He is on the radio. So it's delayed
[2:28:54.480 --> 2:28:57.360]  Let's go ahead now and go to john and virginia. Go ahead
[2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:05.120]  Hey, Alex, uh first time caller. I've been watching since high school. I just wanted to say I thank you for everything you do
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:10.800]  I went through a quick shout-out to brain force quick shout-out to sigma kai and alpha siforion
[2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:16.560]  I'm an Appalachian boy and I really just called you because we're just getting sick and tired of it, man
[2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:22.160]  I had to go to my girlfriend's christmas celebration with mask on to be away from everybody
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:28.400]  And uh, I really think this area is ready to not have a federal government anymore
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:33.600]  Everyone I agree but I mean I would speak out of that christmas party and show people the evidence of fraud and how
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:35.920]  mask caused bacterial pneumonia
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:40.560]  I've tried man and just because they think they're nurses they think they know everything
[2:29:41.680 --> 2:29:46.400]  Well, you know most of the nurses say that it's all a fraud to scam so these must be really young nurses
[2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:53.120]  Uh, one is her grandma and one of them is like a 30 year old woman. I don't know. They're both pretty liberal
[2:29:53.280 --> 2:29:58.720]  They both voted for I mean, that's it. No, no, they know it's about their power and they're making everybody wear a burqa
[2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:03.360]  So these women are no different than an islamic chieftain who makes his women wear burqas
[2:30:04.960 --> 2:30:08.720]  No, oh, I I completely agree. I know this is covid sharia
[2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:11.440]  Covid sharia
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:15.600]  Bum bum bum by covid sorry
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:23.920]  But I completely agree man. I think that what you've done though for this country is absolutely a good thing man. I think that uh
[2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:29.040]  You are you are one of the only few people left who's ready to speak what they think
[2:30:29.200 --> 2:30:33.280]  And I think that you just need to keep on doing it man. I'm gonna be happy to see you on the sixth
[2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:37.760]  I can't wait for that trump rally. I just want to let you know and call in and say thank you for everything
[2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:43.200]  John we love you and we appreciate you. God bless you and I'm not putting women down some women statistically
[2:30:43.920 --> 2:30:44.960]  Are as
[2:30:44.960 --> 2:30:51.120]  Mathematically smart as men. They are more aggressive than men. They're more dynamic on average
[2:30:51.920 --> 2:30:57.920]  Men are more mathematical men are more aggressive men don't bow as much men have been taught to be domesticated slugs
[2:30:58.240 --> 2:31:00.240]  But their wives and girlfriends work for them
[2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:03.120]  And and women have been taught to comply with the system
[2:31:03.120 --> 2:31:07.760]  And so that's why we're being led into bondage by women
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:10.080]  Just as the bible says will happen at the end times
[2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:15.040]  And but that's not women's fault. That's men's fault for not being leaders
[2:31:15.520 --> 2:31:18.320]  Some of the most angry people I know about mass or women
[2:31:20.240 --> 2:31:23.840]  But they're women that are smart and informed and
[2:31:25.040 --> 2:31:27.040]  Grew up around strong men
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:30.800]  strong women make strong men strong men make strong women
[2:31:30.800 --> 2:31:32.800]  And
[2:31:32.880 --> 2:31:38.240]  They don't have to manipulate women. Oh, you're a hero. Save a life be respectful. And so women are team players
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:42.240]  Well, that works great when you've got a good society women of the bedrock of society
[2:31:43.200 --> 2:31:45.920]  But it's a social contract. It's broken and the system
[2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:53.120]  Wants 90 of college graduates to be women. That's not to empower women. They want a compliant ruling establishment
[2:31:54.400 --> 2:31:59.040]  And the average feminist controller will tell you this they know they're hooked into authoritarianism
[2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:06.880]  It's been women CEOs, you know, leading the way into censorship and control and giving their sons ridlin and taking their sons to be sterilized
[2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:08.880]  Chemically because oh, he's a girl
[2:32:09.840 --> 2:32:11.840]  Very very sick
[2:32:12.400 --> 2:32:15.120]  And so I'm not a woman hater. I love women
[2:32:16.560 --> 2:32:18.560]  but
[2:32:19.760 --> 2:32:24.080]  Men are apt to tell you let's just go along to get along women are really apt to do it
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:29.680]  And I'm talking about statistics again, are there long-distance runners that can be Kenyans? Yeah
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:37.280]  Are 95 percent of the international long-distance runners Kenyans? They beat all the Africans too because genetically
[2:32:37.680 --> 2:32:48.560]  They are superior at long-distance running because of living generation for generation in very arid very dry areas where they run dozens of miles a day
[2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:53.280]  And genetically they do that. Well women know how to have babies. Men don't can't do that
[2:32:54.160 --> 2:32:58.000]  And and that's why men are all the the chess champions. They have that new
[2:32:58.320 --> 2:33:03.280]  Netflix show about the little girl. That's really a story about a little boy who she's the chess champion. It's just not true
[2:33:03.680 --> 2:33:05.680]  But it's see it's fantasy land
[2:33:06.880 --> 2:33:12.800]  It's fantasy land and then now men say they're women and go win all the sports and we go, oh
[2:33:13.440 --> 2:33:15.760]  It's a little girl. No, it's a it's a dude
[2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:18.080]  It's a little girl. No, it's a it's a dude
[2:33:19.440 --> 2:33:21.440]  With his testicles
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:23.520]  But again, it's a cult
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:29.280]  Accept the mask accept the checkpoints accept the COVID-19 accept the world government accept the new world order
[2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:36.080]  And they're just seeing what we will accept. They're destroying our roles. They're destroying our children
[2:33:36.240 --> 2:33:41.680]  They're sterilizing our boys and making it fashionable and cool. It's sick and it's satanic and it must end
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:47.280]  Fox has betrayed president trump as I predicted they would they've always been
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:50.240]  Part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:56.000]  If they're able to keep trump from rightfully taking office for second term ontarian 20th
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:34:01.760]  The system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices
[2:34:02.080 --> 2:34:06.240]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to us
[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:10.880]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:17.440]  This is economic war. We are being consolidated. We're being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:21.920]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:29.040]  Absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:33.040]  That's what the great reset is cloud swab and these other criminals admit it
[2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:38.160]  That's what social distancing is. So your business is only at 25 for several more years
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:42.160]  No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan. Say no
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:48.960]  Imagine a dystopian novel or a dystopian science fiction movie where if you've had a cold
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:52.560]  It can be locked up in your home. You can be taken away. You can be forcibly
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:58.320]  Inoculated with drugs that masquerades vaccines that actually change your very dna
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:02.480]  Well, that's where we are in the year 2020 global government of the united nations
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:09.120]  All the authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power and control
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:14.240]  And that they're not even worried about coven 19. That's what class swaps with others have said
[2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:19.760]  Think about how to say that as oh and big techs got to track you. They've got to trace you. They've got to control you
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:21.760]  You got to have actually leave your house
[2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:24.960]  Why you got to have secret police come disappear you because
[2:35:24.960 --> 2:35:31.760]  My god, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance of killing you give your ability to cancer or a heart attack
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:34.000]  This is their takeover
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:38.320]  Imagine on america's death certificate killed by the fear of the common cold
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:40.880]  Yeah, that's fair monitoring. That's my control
[2:35:43.840 --> 2:35:47.920]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming
[2:35:48.080 --> 2:35:51.280]  Especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar
[2:35:51.280 --> 2:35:57.840]  Tens of millions of americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:03.440]  But it's going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see record sales once again
[2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:09.280]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves. It's up to us to become self sufficient
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:16.560]  The globalists are waging siege against us trying to destroy our businesses trying to bankrupt our families our towns
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:21.760]  Our churches, that's why while we still can you've got to get prepared and get ready
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:28.240]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up and prepare with alex.com

[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:56.560]  And I thought that pollen block might be gone forever, but after eight months we got about 25 percent of the order we put in

[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  Where's your where's your crown
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:39.440]  I'm going half an hour into the next hour
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:42.400]  We're going to destroy her with some big breaking news
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:46.080]  And then tonight
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:52.400]  11 p.m. Central I'll be down at the W on 1st street where the degenerate evil un mayor lives
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:58.160]  Who announced martial law and said don't come out of your houses at night unless you're homeless. Please defecate everywhere
[2:38:59.040 --> 2:39:01.040]  This little new or older rat creature
[2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:05.840]  Is down there and so we're going to be down there protesting
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:10.160]  And of course the police have been told by the governor who's about to take over the police
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:13.200]  Because the mayor is trying to disband the police department
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:17.200]  That they're not going to be arresting anybody that violates his false curfew
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:21.360]  And the big restaurants
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:27.440]  The bars are all telling adler burn in hell. They're all over the news saying we're not going to follow your illegal edict
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:33.360]  We're tired of being bankrupted. We know the hospitals are empty. We know covered 19's basically a hoax. This is important
[2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:38.320]  Or we'll be just as bad as melbourne australia or new york city
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:40.640]  Or those good people are under total tyranny
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:43.040]  The spirit of liberty is rising
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:47.040]  All right, let's go to john in texas. Thank you sir. Go ahead
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me? Yes, I can
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:54.480]  Hey, god bless you and uh all of info worse
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:56.240]  um
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:39:58.480]  so, um, I what I was uh
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:05.360]  What I was really paying attention to most of is that you said, you know, how the uh, the holy spirit is is
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:12.320]  Is it's alive more than ever and it's getting stronger. Well, you know, I've I've been thinking about it and you know
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:16.160]  As I see the holy spirit blanket, you know the whole nation and people
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:18.880]  Start to grow that discernment
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:25.040]  That we've you know that we've blocked off for a very long time. Well, let me tell you I've been receiving the transmission
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:29.120]  I mean the stuff the stuff i'm getting now the downloads i'm getting is just like
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:34.560]  I can't even it's like I mean I get downloads now in the middle of the night and in the morning that are just like
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:42.000]  Total under but it's like I'm like just a human though. I can't grasp it but I can see it and then I it's like how do you articulate it?
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  It's unbelievable
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:46.720]  What I what I think we need to do is you know
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:50.080]  The american people we've become, you know, so
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:54.480]  So laxed and comfortable with with ourselves on
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:59.920]  On the nation itself that we've you know, we've kind of we've kind of stopped doing what?
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:02.160]  You know what?
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:04.480]  What we need to be doing and that's that's praying, you know
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:10.080]  Absolutely opening the channel up to god. You're totally right and I think our new year's resolution is prayer
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:15.600]  Quietly with god opening up to god asking god to give us the data and the info and what to do
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:20.080]  And just not asking god the people that you pray to tell god what you want. No
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:27.200]  You pray that god use you and lift you up to be a vessel even though you're imperfect and you ask god
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:29.680]  To help you purify yourself
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:33.680]  With god's will and then god will begin to work with you
[2:41:34.560 --> 2:41:36.560]  Like someone sculpting
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:39.520]  But and and I think what we should do is
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:43.760]  You know before, you know, everybody heads out to washington, you know the day before
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:46.640]  You know, I think we on you know or some radio waves
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:50.720]  I think we all need to just take a minute or two and pray together, you know over your show
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:56.240]  And and you know, we need to you know, we need to give that time, you know for ourselves
[2:41:56.320 --> 2:42:00.400]  You know together because the power comes in and numbers of course and that's why
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:03.120]  You know, and that's why they're scared of real churches
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:07.360]  And that's why they're scared of real people joining hands because it's all energetic. It's all spiritual

[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:03.600]  My spirit is strong but the flesh isn't as willing as it used to be but my spirit's stronger than ever
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:06.560]  Oh, yeah, holy spirit is definitely talking through you
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:14.000]  I just wanted to do a quick plug for honor roll my kids love that supplement and I really do hope you guys get it back in stock
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:18.480]  You know the supplier of that with covet has been shut down for 11 months
[2:45:18.640 --> 2:45:22.640]  So we're gonna have to either get a new supplier or something. So thanks
[2:45:22.640 --> 2:45:29.760]  Oh, well, I've been giving them the krill oil and all that stuff for so they're really liking that but just wanted to touch
[2:45:29.760 --> 2:45:34.240]  Basis with you with the march on dc or the occupation of dc
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:40.480]  I think that you I'm gonna talk to all the cajun navy and all these people that did boat parade
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:42.720]  for the past
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:44.400]  Three to four months
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:47.120]  We need to have every single one of those people
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:53.760]  Plug up the Potomac because you know that is a genius idea and can you get boats on the Potomac?
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:46:00.240]  Uh, well, I can I can set out some facebook posts and stuff, but they know what I'm asking you is
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:03.440]  I don't see a lot of boats on the Potomac. I mean boats can get on the Potomac, can't they?
[2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:08.080]  Yeah, well, I'm sure they can especially like the cajun navy when the hurricanes come in
[2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:10.080]  They have to go in there and help get people out
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:12.240]  I agree
[2:46:12.240 --> 2:46:15.040]  Well, we need to see the cajun navy come in and then get on the ground with us
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:19.360]  But I totally agree we need to see well because I'm looking at it if they tie up those boats
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:23.280]  Even if they try to shut down those bridges and that's a pre you can get into that
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:25.280]  I mean that's a that's a public area
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:29.680]  Tie up those boats if they try to shut down those bridges just imagine the info or army
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:34.400]  By the way, let me tell you what this is about. It's about global government. It's about lockdowns. It's about control
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:36.560]  That's what the whole cobit hoax is about
[2:46:36.720 --> 2:46:41.040]  But they want it where if your qr code doesn't let you go your car won't start
[2:46:41.040 --> 2:46:46.320]  That they admit that they want to end demonstrations. They are so scared everybody coming to dc
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:49.280]  Everybody's got to come then god bless you and I appreciate your call
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:56.560]  A lot of great points here, but the new year's resolution is go see your sheriffs educate them great idea
[2:46:57.040 --> 2:47:00.240]  New year's resolution educate people every day new year's resolution
[2:47:00.560 --> 2:47:05.840]  Tell folks about the band videos the forbidden videos of remote and information hit band out video
[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:12.640]  New year's resolution pray more get active stand up speak out get healthy treat everybody better be good
[2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:15.600]  Don't be arrogant. I'm talking to myself
[2:47:16.240 --> 2:47:20.320]  Let's talk to see if jeff's phones back jeff. You in a better spot now up in canada
[2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:23.680]  Hey, alex can you hear me? I can now go ahead
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:28.160]  Hey alex, uh, just want to wish you happy new year and just uh
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:31.200]  I'm gonna remind people the book of revelation says that
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:34.960]  There's gonna come a time where we have to take something called the mark of the beast
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:38.160]  Which you won't be able to buy sell or trade without that mark
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:44.480]  and the speculation is is that there's a connection with the vaccines and
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:50.240]  Another point I want to make on that before I get to my what I called in about is
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:55.040]  When your dna changes and you cease to become human
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:02.480]  There will come a point where you actually are not under the covenant of god because christ died for a human being
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:07.440]  He didn't die for hybrids and that's a very important point that
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:11.120]  People are gonna have to consider this may be the top of the slide
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:15.280]  But once you start taking the vaccine there will come a time where you will
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.880]  willingly alter your genetics and
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:23.280]  At that point you will take what's called the mark of the beast and give allegiance
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:27.520]  to lucifer who's in charge of this whole demonic system
[2:48:27.520 --> 2:48:32.160]  It's right and he impregnates you stay there. I'm gonna come back to you. Don't hang up

[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:43.600]  you will get
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:47.520]  Klaus Schwab and Sean Claude Yunker and all the new world order
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:50.400]  globalists like Gigi Pink saying
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:53.600]  that they no longer want elected leaders over governments
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:50:00.560]  But they want businessmen technocrats over it and that's who Klaus Schwab is you might want to look into the guy that says they've watched
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:06.480]  The COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor you might want to find out who this super villain is
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:09.680]  But you see he believes because he's hidden playing you
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:14.480]  And you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it chicken. You might want to find out who he works for
[2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:16.720]  He works directly for prince charles
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:20.240]  He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability
[2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:23.760]  That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own words
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:29.360]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:32.400]  You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right
[2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:38.880]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:45.760 --> 2:50:47.760]  There's foreshadowing throughout the bible
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:57.200]  There's a lot of foreshadowing in the books before and things to just repeat but if you actually read
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:04.400]  What they break down in in revelations and in Ezekiel and in daniel and in
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  Leviticus and all of it
[2:51:08.960 --> 2:51:14.000]  You have to worship the beast you have to do everything it says you have to be under its total control
[2:51:14.640 --> 2:51:19.440]  And there are these giant images of the beast 1500 feet tall in the public places in the markets
[2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:22.000]  That you worship
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  And then you have to ask questions
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:28.720]  Of the beast and it will give you answers. It will do wonders. It will give you miracles. It will give you health
[2:51:29.440 --> 2:51:32.800]  Uh, and it describes the beast having like all these little metal
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:39.360]  Locust and and dragonflies flying around watching and controlling everyone
[2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:43.360]  And whole city's being vaporized in fire and
[2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:49.440]  All these big governments warring with each other and it all just falls apart and then and then disintegrates
[2:51:49.440 --> 2:51:53.520]  Well, whether you believe that's going to happen or not the globalists have used it as a model
[2:51:53.840 --> 2:51:58.720]  And they're bringing in a world government and they describe it as a mark and ten kingdoms just like the bible says
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:05.040]  So go read revelation about the mark of the beast go read about what is unfolding and then realize that
[2:52:06.640 --> 2:52:09.040]  I remember 25 years ago
[2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:12.960]  That was a preacher they found his name again the other day
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:18.720]  I asked what I still remember the guy's name. I mean you just find out that guy's still around still alive
[2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:21.360]  Wasn't that old then he's probably like 55 then
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:26.080]  And he said I said, yeah, it'll be you know a scan of your hand a scan of your face said no
[2:52:26.320 --> 2:52:30.960]  There'll be a vaccine you're forced to take that changes your dna and takes over your body
[2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:35.680]  I said, how do you know that and he said, oh, uh, my pastor had a vision
[2:52:37.040 --> 2:52:39.360]  Now that's coming true now
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:42.240]  and
[2:52:42.240 --> 2:52:49.840]  This is bill gates literally impregnating you with a foreign alien dna of a clone child mixed with a jellyfish
[2:52:50.320 --> 2:52:52.320]  just in the fizer
[2:52:52.320 --> 2:52:55.840]  document that then changes in a chain reaction every cell in your body but
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:00.800]  Eggs in a woman's ovaries those are done when when she's formed
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:06.480]  As a baby in the mother's womb. She has the eggs left for her life sperm reform continually
[2:53:07.200 --> 2:53:09.200]  and
[2:53:09.200 --> 2:53:15.120]  Your eyes your eye cells everything will be rewritten. I mean this is so drastic like alien
[2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:22.080]  Meteorite hits and starts taking over like the blob. I mean this is it. So jeff pretty incredible times to be alive my friend
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:25.600]  Yeah, it sure is alex
[2:53:25.600 --> 2:53:32.320]  You know years ago on youtube. I watched something called this guy the isolated what's called the god gene
[2:53:32.720 --> 2:53:38.160]  Which is your way that you respond to god. I don't know if that's true or not, but with the trojan
[2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:41.440]  Uh crapshoot that they're putting in this these vaccines
[2:53:41.840 --> 2:53:44.720]  There will may come a time where you take something and you're gone
[2:53:44.960 --> 2:53:50.160]  You you you just can't come back the bible says that the first two people to enter the lake of fire
[2:53:50.240 --> 2:53:52.800]  Which is the the not the judgment seat of god
[2:53:52.800 --> 2:53:57.200]  But they go straight into the lake of fire or the false prophet and the antichrist
[2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:04.400]  But it says everybody that takes the mark of the beast joined him with the devil in the ultimate judgment in the lake of fire
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:08.880]  Now I didn't write that but that's what it says and it all seems to become in the past
[2:54:09.440 --> 2:54:11.440]  My my contention is this
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:14.240]  We have therapeutic ivermectin and
[2:54:15.280 --> 2:54:20.560]  Hydroxychloroquine which are extremely effective in fighting this vaccine. We need to come up
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:24.400]  We need to be and they're not letting us have it because they want to keep us in fear forever
[2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:27.120]  This is a problem that never ends. Hey move on from the bible though
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:30.320]  It's central and key but for a secular folks gg ping them up
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:35.360]  They go says you'll have a qr code to buy and sell and travel now. It's officially announced CNN says you must have it
[2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:39.600]  They're just doing it. It's a total authoritarian takeover
[2:54:40.720 --> 2:54:45.120]  All right, we've got some big announcements some other news to hit. Oh and shroyers are going to leave a demonstration tonight
[2:54:46.080 --> 2:54:49.840]  11 p.m at the W downtown people should do this everywhere. I'm going to be there too
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:53.760]  We're going to live stream it and info wars.com and news wars.com
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:55:00.000]  And bandot video so I think the volunteers are going to stand here tonight so that when we go out downtown to protest
[2:55:00.800 --> 2:55:04.480]  Against the martial law. He's declared the governor says his martial laws illegal
[2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:08.240]  He can't say that everybody's not essential and that bars and restaurants are closed
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:10.800]  So they're staying open all the corporate things are going to stay
[2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:14.000]  Closed because he said so because they want to bankrupt everybody else
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:18.720]  See when they have the order they closed for a few days and no one else is allowed to open but they they open back up
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:21.280]  It's a systematic demonic plan
[2:55:21.280 --> 2:55:27.520]  Also, I've got a clarification and an apology. I need to make because when I've been led astray and made mistakes
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:30.640]  I want to own up to those so I'll do that on the other side
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:36.560]  We're back ladies and gentlemen in 60 seconds news wars.com info wars.com

[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:28.080]  We shall fight and we shall never surrender
[2:57:29.280 --> 2:57:31.280]  And the good news is the bad news
[2:57:31.280 --> 2:57:38.640]  Things are getting really serious really quick. It's going to separate the boys from the men the women from the girls
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:42.320]  The goats from the sheep
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:44.320]  Okay, Owen's got some big announcements
[2:57:45.040 --> 2:57:48.480]  He's here riding shotgun with us, but let me cover this right now
[2:57:49.600 --> 2:57:53.920]  I know what trump has gone through at a microcosm level in the swamp in dc
[2:57:55.280 --> 2:57:59.360]  You know that I don't organize a lot of events around the country. We've had him over the years
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:05.200]  16 17 years ago. I was having events with 5,000 6,000 10,000 people at him
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:09.200]  We opened up venues and and and sell out of tickets in hours
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:14.800]  And you would come out to those events, but then the left would bomb thread them and cause all these problems and
[2:58:16.080 --> 2:58:22.560]  We can reach so many people making films documentaries putting out reports and doing live digital media that we stopped doing it
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:26.320]  But now because of the censorship we've gone back into the street in third dimension
[2:58:26.320 --> 2:58:28.320]  So
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:35.200]  We came before the tea party. We came before ron paul. We came before he ran for president before all of that
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:40.400]  You this audience are the hardcore americans that were aware of what was going on. You sought us out
[2:58:40.960 --> 2:58:42.960]  You are the lifeblood of this
[2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:47.840]  So I got contacted by the trump white house. I got contacted by the state department
[2:58:49.040 --> 2:58:52.320]  And they said to me hey, will you try to rally people?
[2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:58.000]  Uh in arizona in georgia in dc and here are some of the folks we're working with
[2:58:58.640 --> 2:59:00.640]  And so I work with those folks and they're nice people
[2:59:02.080 --> 2:59:08.480]  Then I get called to go to dc roger stone gets called. He's going there and then he gets told. Oh, you've been knocked off the thing
[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:13.440]  From one of the main events you're not going to speak roger pulls out doesn't go
[2:59:14.320 --> 2:59:19.280]  I get told oh, yeah, the organizers are bad folks. Whatever, you know, we got out of the spring court and we had our own deal
[2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:23.680]  I went and did it was big deal great and I said some mean things that I've heard from others
[2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:26.880]  About the organizers and really this is all just fog of war stuff
[2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:29.440]  Then I come to the next event
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:32.720]  And I'm speaking at the jericho march and a bunch of other big marches
[2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:38.880]  And I did because I've been you know, you know told not to like the folks that were doing the other big event over freedom plaza
[2:59:38.960 --> 2:59:42.480]  I did go over there because you couldn't even hear what they were doing on their speaker system
[2:59:43.040 --> 2:59:47.920]  You know 500 yards away the crowds were so big and I've been told trump was about to probably come
[2:59:47.920 --> 2:59:49.920]  I spoke there general Flynn was there
[2:59:50.480 --> 2:59:53.120]  To the big jericho deal on the mall
[2:59:53.520 --> 2:59:57.120]  So I went over there because we were waiting a few hours before I was going to speak and I said folks
[2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:01.920]  You need to come over here, you know, basically once you're done here
[3:00:02.640 --> 3:00:04.640]  Now once I got to the jericho march
[3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:13.200]  And I was told when this is over at 330 march everybody down to the supreme court because there's another event that people are putting on there
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:19.120]  And I'm told that by the people some of the folks involved the jericho march. I don't even really know what's going on
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:22.720]  I'm at my hotel eating my crew is like you got to go
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:26.640]  You got to get down there. You said you were going. I'm like, I'm tired. I don't want to do it
[3:00:27.040 --> 3:00:31.440]  So then because they had the roads all blocked. So then we walked a couple miles to the supreme court
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:39.120]  Or no halfway the truck got us about halfway and I'm walking up and these big security guys come running up
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:43.120]  And run into us and say you're not taking this over
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:46.960]  So we start to kind of push with them and stuff and then I can't see what's going on
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:50.240]  You know over the little hill there at the supreme court. I go forget it. I don't care
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:54.000]  We'll go over here. Well, the whole crowd that I already told to be there follows me
[3:00:54.640 --> 3:00:58.640]  So now I see what this looked like. I did go take over one of their events
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:05.440]  Earlier in the day to bring some of the people to the to the Jericho march. I was mad at him. I was being a stinker
[3:01:05.440 --> 3:01:10.800]  And so I apologize for that but when I came to the next event at the supreme court
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:13.760]  I was told that that was somebody else's event and that was it true
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:19.600]  And so there's a lot of these groups manipulating playing each other off fighting with each other and I'm not the middle of that
[3:01:19.840 --> 3:01:23.120]  I'm not involved in that. So let me just say uh this here on air
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:26.160]  You've got women for america first who do great events around the country
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:29.360]  I don't know hardly anything about them except that they've been around 15 years
[3:01:30.720 --> 3:01:32.080]  They put on a bunch of big deals
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:36.560]  I think Amy Kramer and Kylie Kramer her daughter are overall great people's done a great job
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:43.520]  Particularly Kylie because I did see her at the same hotel we were staying at and I did roll down the window the night before the event
[3:01:43.840 --> 3:01:48.240]  Smart mouthily said you're not keeping me from anything. I'm going to take over your event tomorrow
[3:01:48.800 --> 3:01:52.720]  Well, then no wonder when I then get told go down to the thing at the supreme court
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:54.640]  I show up
[3:01:54.640 --> 3:01:58.800]  There's securities. They're waiting for me. They run into us. You see me on video. Say forget it. We'll go
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:03.920]  And then they call up millie weaver and and go look he's attacking millie weaver
[3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:07.760]  She wasn't speaking when I got there. I like millie. She used to work here. So
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:10.960]  So I apologize to millie and I apologize to Kylie
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:17.440]  Kramer I did say something smart mouth to Kylie and we don't need to end fight. It's all stupid. It doesn't matter
[3:02:18.080 --> 3:02:19.680]  And here's why I told the rest of the story
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:22.400]  No one was going to end up paying for the event that trump said
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:25.760]  Because that's to be privately put on when trump does an event donors have to do it
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:29.040]  Everybody's deserted trump. Nobody was going to pay for the event on the fifth year
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:36.560]  I went ahead and paid the down payments and the like biblically the widows might the phone rings and this big donor
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:38.960]  Reimburses me the money
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:41.280]  Literally offers me the amount of money. I just paid
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:43.760]  She's a great lady
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:49.520]  And then all the infighting with all these groups turns up and gets crazy and I just said I prayed about it and I said
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:54.160]  I pulled some other folks last week. I said, I'm gonna apologize to the Kramer's like well, they're not perfect
[3:02:54.160 --> 3:02:57.520]  Oh, well, nobody is I'm gonna apologize and I'm gonna tell the story on there
[3:02:57.760 --> 3:02:59.600]  So people know what really happened
[3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:03.200]  And so I apologize to women for America first are doing a great job
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:08.320]  And they are putting on the big deal on the ellipse on the sixth that I'll also be at with roger stone
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:09.600]  So there hatchet's buried
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:14.560]  But let's play some of the footage of what really happened at the supreme court at the last DC event where you see
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:18.640]  I don't see millie up there. I see a guy kind of in a Santa Claus outfit kind of a cool outfit
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:24.240]  I guess a nice guy I'm told and I get pushed away and I leave and I go across the street. Everybody follows me
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:28.880]  I'm like, I'm desperate for a crowdy where I go. I get a crowd there. So that's what happened. Here's the truth
[3:03:28.960 --> 3:03:30.960]  Here's the footage
[3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:35.920]  And this happens
[3:03:45.360 --> 3:03:48.720]  At four o'clock today, we're gonna march back to the supreme court
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:52.480]  He got some other great folks at freedom plaza if some of you aren't here later
[3:03:52.640 --> 3:03:57.760]  Go get them leave him the supreme court at four at this great event, but pray for america
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:01.680]  See, I'm going to take a break for a bit, but I didn't know they were putting on too. I'm just saying go the next event
[3:04:01.680 --> 3:04:06.080]  I was told to but with trumpets as close as it got look how far we've come
[3:04:06.560 --> 3:04:10.160]  Look at what we've been able to do and this is just the beginning
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:14.000]  So we're at the back of the crowd these guys run up and this is what happens
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:27.520]  We're gonna do it. It's a good
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:32.560]  Stop pushing me we'll leave
[3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:34.560]  We
[3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:44.640]  And so the crowds there they're my fans
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:49.200]  I go across street everybody follows and they just stopped the rally and leave so it was supposed to be over anyways
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:54.320]  And so I didn't know as I guess their rally was ending it for five or whatever. I don't even care
[3:04:55.920 --> 3:04:57.920]  But I get the guy
[3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:02.640]  In the red suit, you know thought that I was there to take over the precious event. I got millions audience every day
[3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:04.880]  I won't take anything home
[3:05:06.240 --> 3:05:07.360]  Now
[3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:10.160]  Minutes later keep going they call millie lever up
[3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:16.480]  And I like millie, but she knows that she knows that the guy calls her up after I was already across the street
[3:05:17.040 --> 3:05:20.800]  And she says I came to disrupt her millie. I don't have a crystal ball. I didn't know that
[3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:24.960]  Never try to disrupt her deal
[3:05:24.960 --> 3:05:30.880]  And so again, I'm already across the street the crowds followed me and then they call millie up so she can be a victim
[3:05:31.200 --> 3:05:34.640]  That's not the Kramer's and that's not that guy. He didn't even know what's going on. It's not even millie
[3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:39.120]  It's just we're primed to be victims in this society. So I'll say it. I'm the bad guy
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:42.560]  I apologize to millie and I apologize to Santa Claus dude
[3:05:43.040 --> 3:05:46.240]  And I'm not being mean. It's kind of a cool Santa Claus. He's wearing a Santa Claus outfit folks
[3:05:46.640 --> 3:05:52.000]  Uh, but but but seriously, I'm not gonna have that happen at these events uh next week. It isn't about in fighting
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:56.800]  It's about millions and millions on the street. You being in the crowd. It's not about the speeches
[3:05:57.120 --> 3:06:03.040]  It's not about that. It's about trump giving a speech saying he's not gonna concede not standing with him and occupying dc
[3:06:03.200 --> 3:06:04.640]  Oh and 30 second comment
[3:06:04.640 --> 3:06:10.400]  Well, I was there for the entire series of events you just described and I mean it is entirely factually correct
[3:06:10.560 --> 3:06:13.520]  The problem is look, there's always going to be in fighting. These are just you know
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:20.240]  Tense times and you know our problem is we're we're like the lone rangers out here in texas, you know, they live in dc
[3:06:20.240 --> 3:06:24.720]  They live in new york. That's kind of their thing. We're just like berserkers like we're just in a war
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:28.880]  It's like we don't have time to analyze all the little blades of grass on the battlefield
[3:06:28.880 --> 3:06:33.440]  We charge in have a victory and leave and so it's all right though. We're all learning to get along and that's a good thing
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:38.960]  That's right. Let's talk about demonstration. We're having a night which everyone's welcome to come to an 11 o'clock. No one's in charge
[3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:41.920]  We're right back introducing info war's life
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:46.320]  Pure tumeric extract. This is taken under the tongue
[3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:49.200]  It is pure tumeric
[3:06:49.200 --> 3:06:57.040]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate tumeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach
[3:06:57.280 --> 3:06:58.640]  And intestines
[3:06:58.640 --> 3:07:04.480]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach
[3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:08.640]  So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different
[3:07:08.640 --> 3:07:14.000]  But both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:21.040]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies some like bodies better for me. They're both amazing for their anti inflammatory action
[3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:23.040]  It's so much more and they fund the info war

[3:07:36.320 --> 3:07:39.760]  It's so much more get yours today at infowarslife.com
[3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:44.240]  Mountain patriot in colorado. Thank you for holding. How you doing Alex?
[3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:47.920]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother. How are you?
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:52.560]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that dna force
[3:07:52.800 --> 3:07:55.520]  I love it. I've been using it quite a while and I just went
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:00.000]  Looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it contains quercetin
[3:08:00.880 --> 3:08:05.520]  Which according to some published studies that dr. Merkel has cited
[3:08:05.520 --> 3:08:12.560]  Is an ion of four similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cell
[3:08:12.720 --> 3:08:14.800]  So people might want to take a look at that
[3:08:15.680 --> 3:08:17.680]  All I know is with dna force
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:20.880]  We went out and looked at these high-end products
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:25.840]  That they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:29.040]  Because there's a lot of expensive products and it was really only cost them like 50 bucks
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:34.480]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[3:08:34.480 --> 3:08:36.480]  Thanks for the plug
[3:08:43.680 --> 3:08:46.400]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:54.080 --> 3:08:56.080]  Much as I like this song
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:01.680]  We have got a long way to go in a short time to get there with on shroyer riding shotgun
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:08.080]  The great matt bracken's about to take over for two segments. Then oh and takes over with the war room today three to six p.m. And he'll be down there
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:10.720]  11
[3:09:10.720 --> 3:09:14.560]  p.m. Tonight ringing in the new year right through midnight central time at the
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:19.520]  First street at the W. It will tell you why in a moment. It's a big national news story right now
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:22.400]  But let me add one more thing about burying the hatchet earlier
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:28.400]  These groups are in fighting. I chose a side. I think it went overboard. I think the kramers have done a great job
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:33.920]  We love kiley and I have the permit. We have the whole permit for the fifth
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:38.400]  I'm inviting them to come speak at our event and I'm inviting millie weaver to come speak
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:42.800]  So there you go at the big event in freedom plaza and we're working with them on the sixth
[3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:48.080]  So I mean again, it's not like it's like you you speak and you're my movie star and these are like these are like oscars
[3:09:48.080 --> 3:09:54.800]  We're handing out. This is about the demonstration. It's about saying no to the globalist, but that's why we all need to come together
[3:09:54.800 --> 3:09:56.080]  Owen
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:00.080]  Yeah, and that's been part of the problem. I think with the conservative side of the aisle
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:03.680]  Is it's just like trying to herd cats? I mean we have our own independent thoughts
[3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:07.520]  We have our own independent ways of approaching things and doing things
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:13.040]  So it just kind of comes with the territory, but you know, uh, we're we're we've never really been forced with
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:18.720]  You know this this time where we have to get along and we're going to lose everything. It's it's it's the
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:23.760]  Um, you know unite or fall apart when you get a million or two million people on the ground
[3:10:23.760 --> 3:10:27.440]  Uh, it's it's hard as hell to run that so I think things are going great
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:28.880]  What matters is
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:33.120]  There's no air coverage like on the first one showing over a million people are close to a million
[3:10:33.280 --> 3:10:36.800]  We need somehow to show it's going to be down all the side streets down the roads
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:40.640]  This is the beginning of the occupation of dc and the problem too is most people
[3:10:41.040 --> 3:10:45.360]  That are in political media. Like I said, they live in dc or new york. We're out here in austin texas
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:49.120]  So they've never really met us all they see is the fake news about us once they meet us
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:52.640]  They'll get to know us and by the way and and we'll talk about this now. I was just at
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:54.000]  a
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:11:00.160]  Local bar owner restaurant owner press conference here mayor adler. This is the breaking news by the way
[3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:04.720]  Mayor adler announced just a day ago. So he gives them two days notice
[3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:07.360]  Oh bars and restaurants have to be closed at 10 30
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:12.320]  They've already purchased the food the beverage for new year's eve not expecting this to happen
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:16.560]  And it's all a raw exercise of power. It has nothing to do with viruses. It's just a pure
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:20.240]  I tell you to stand on one leg. I tell you stick your thumb up your rear end
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:24.880]  I tell you to stand on your damn head. Well, they just adler's flying around all over the damn caribbean
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:29.360]  Well, and we'll maybe see him tonight at the w. He's he's welcome to come out and be a part of our event tonight
[3:11:29.680 --> 3:11:31.600]  outside of the w at 11 p.m
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:39.520]  But there was a moment today where uh, there was a gentleman from the austin american statement there and and and I was there asking the bar owners
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:43.920]  Uh questions by the way, they announced they're gonna disobey the illegal order. So I mean, of course
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:45.120]  Do you get some footage of that for your show?
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:50.720]  Yes, we have the footage. It's being uploaded to band out video right now done. No later. We have the full press conference
[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:52.080]  And we're gonna have some highlights cut up
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:55.760]  But you know what here's the thing alex at the end of this there was a guy from the austin american statement
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:01.120]  Who i'm sure we disagree on everything politically and uh, I gave him a little razzle dazzle at the event
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:05.280]  And then afterwards he came up to me and and he said hey, you know what?
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:10.000]  I still respect you. I said, hey, you know what his name was phil. I said I shook his hand and I said hey phil
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  You know what when we talk politics and and the ring goes up and we enter that arena
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:16.480]  Well, we go hard man. We throw haymakers. That's what we do
[3:12:16.560 --> 3:12:19.920]  But he needs to come in on the side of keeping the businesses open damn it
[3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:22.240]  Well, we should all be on the side of that but
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:26.240]  Here's the thing that we all have to realize alex. We have to share this earth together
[3:12:26.480 --> 3:12:30.720]  We have to share this consciousness together one way or the other. I agree the globalist one is fighting with each other
[3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:34.960]  We need to lovingly reach out for the left because they're victims of mind control in the new year
[3:12:35.440 --> 3:12:40.000]  And it's just it's just being able to put the political differences aside. Hey have those battles
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  We're always going to have and even though you're jealous of my hair. You just get over
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:49.520]  I actually I wanted to have a hair transplant here live on air
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:54.480]  Let me look I want to get the body you admit you're jealous of my hair. Give me the biden deal
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:56.160]  biden had his head chopped off
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:12:58.160]  So why don't we just chop the top of your head off?
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:03.200]  But see I have a small he's he's the president elect is is kamala Harris. He said so
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:07.760]  He said that I think three or four times now. He can't well look alex. Let's
[3:13:07.760 --> 3:13:09.760]  See
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:15.120]  Whether I have your hair or my hair tonight both of our hair is exactly you're really upset. You don't have both of our hair
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:18.880]  Crying about it a lot. I'm saying you're gonna get over in the new year. Is this projection
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:22.080]  It's called a joke. Oh, it's all right alex
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:28.160]  We can transplant my hair is one step away from a comeover. That's why as soon as I lose you need to go with the chrome
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:30.160]  Don't oh, it's it's going off. Yeah
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:34.640]  New Year's eve shave your head tonight. I don't know. I don't know you should invite mayor
[3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:38.480]  I do look a little ex luther would you should invite mayor adler to shave your hair tonight?
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:43.760]  You can shave it with a straight blade. No, I think he probably in the caribbean with no mask on with 20 hookers
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:48.640]  My last time. I mean hell. It's like this other minister in in canada got caught in the caribbean
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:54.560]  It's like the main doctor says a rescue when not wearing a mask and he's liking a photo with 12 chicks and bikinis kissing
[3:13:54.640 --> 3:13:59.120]  I mean, it's like they know it's alive folks. Yeah, it's Fauci. It's all of them
[3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:04.960]  Ah, anyways, I cannot say enough. Everybody's got to get to DC. The fifth is huge. The president wants it huge
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:06.960]  He wants it massive
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:10.960]  The fifth so try to get there on the fourth or the day of the fifth freedom plaza
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:15.200]  And uh, there was a big ridiculous stupid fight over the permits and all the rest of it
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:18.800]  But that's all been handled. So our groups got the main permit and everybody's welcome to speak
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:21.520]  It's going to be absolutely amazing on the fifth
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:25.040]  and the six a lot of big surprises and uh
[3:14:25.040 --> 3:14:29.760]  There was so much infighting going on that roger stone was going to cancel going like last time. He's coming
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:33.760]  I'm paying to get him there. That means you the listeners are paying to get in there because rogers broke
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:39.920]  So buy some products at m4warstore.com get your pollen block that's back in stock after eight months because the covid lock down
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:45.520]  Couldn't get it. That's back in. We've got x2 back in super vitality back in all discounted 50 off on those
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:51.040]  On the x2 and on the super vitality and of course, we've also got the
[3:14:51.040 --> 3:14:56.000]  Winner son that's very close to selling out the next few weeks of current prices and the fluoride free
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:15:01.920]  Activated charcoal concentrated toothpaste. It is back in stock 25% off and you guys have funded this revolution
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:07.680]  And I salute and love you and thank you. Oh, and what else you got coming up on the war room today?
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:16.160]  So we are going to be talking about the next move for President Trump and his team as they just had another hearing in
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:21.120]  Georgia yesterday the hacking of the Dominion systems now there could be potential
[3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:25.840]  Subpoenas coming forward where Dominion will have to testify. So that could be all in the future
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:28.640]  President's team said they're going to have specific evidence, but
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:34.800]  We're going to take a lot of calls. We've got Leo Zagami coming up and a couple other guests, but tonight
[3:15:35.440 --> 3:15:37.440]  Here's why I think
[3:15:37.440 --> 3:15:41.120]  Why I wanted to do this tonight and why other the crew wanted to do this night because
[3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:45.760]  There is no support for Mayor Adler in this town. I mean, there really isn't it's really got to start to recall
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:48.400]  In fact, that's the resolution is to recall that piece of filth
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:53.280]  They had there was a lady out there taking signatures to recall Adler today. I invited her to be out there
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:16:00.720]  So let's have a recall Adler rally at 11 p.m. Tonight out front the W. Absolutely. And and hey, look, it's a peaceful protest
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:04.160]  Unofficially sponsored by Black Lives Matter and the Austin homeless
[3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:07.680]  So that means we can burn it down and shoot people, but we want to do that. No, no
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:11.120]  We're not like the people we're not like the peaceful protesters that burn buildings down
[3:16:11.120 --> 3:16:15.920]  We're the peaceful type that give people pat on the back and we sign the signature to recall that little piece of filth
[3:16:16.480 --> 3:16:20.480]  I think Adler should come out with us tonight. And by the way, we'll have it's going to be
[3:16:20.480 --> 3:16:22.480]  We'll have the Tarn Feather. We'll have
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:28.720]  He should you should invite Adler to shave your chrome dome and then Tarn Feather your bald head
[3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:35.680]  He should come out and join us though. Don't you think we toasted you and I toasted to freedom in July this year
[3:16:35.680 --> 3:16:39.680]  And so now we're going to toast to bring in the new year. It's 11 p.m. Out front of the W
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:43.680]  The reason why we're at the W if people are wondering that's where Adler lives. He lives in the penthouse of the W
[3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:49.680]  I don't know how he affords that on his meager mayoral salary. The guy is owned by big tech. It's got everything locked down
[3:16:49.680 --> 3:16:54.880]  But big tech he is he's a he's a globalist operative trying to shut our city down. So I'll give mayor
[3:16:54.880 --> 3:16:58.880]  Give me an American mayor Adler. I don't want to have to do this to you tonight
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:01.680]  We've met many times you usually run away when you see me now
[3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:05.680]  But come out tonight be a part of this. You're an American too
[3:17:05.680 --> 3:17:11.680]  We'll toast to you. We'll we'll cordially come together even though we're bitter political rivals and you're going to love the tar bath
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:17.680]  So good for Alex's bald head and that you can enjoy. I'll be tartan Feather by Adam
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:21.680]  No, no, no yet. He's going to shave your head and then he's going to put the Tarn Feather on your bald head
[3:17:21.680 --> 3:17:23.680]  So that you have a new head of hair like Biden or like a founding father
[3:17:23.680 --> 3:17:29.680]  I'll be like bird man or Adler can be a coward and a fraud and
[3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:33.680]  The last few seconds of the Alex Jones show 2020
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:37.680]  We got and I made it I was on air the great Matt Bracken's coming up coming up
[3:17:37.680 --> 3:17:43.680]  It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the u.s
[3:17:43.680 --> 3:17:49.680]  They encourage people to live in tents cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime
[3:17:49.680 --> 3:17:57.680]  It's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030 of course the great reset they want to lower expectations
[3:17:57.680 --> 3:18:02.680]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:05.680]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse
[3:18:05.680 --> 3:18:09.680]  The globalist fly around in private jets they have huge private mistakes
[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:14.680]  They are separate from us their children go to private tutors they admit this
[3:18:14.680 --> 3:18:22.680]  Now they want us locked down telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure
[3:18:22.680 --> 3:18:28.680]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G is going to control robot autonomous cars and trucks
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:34.680]  This is all they're admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational
[3:18:34.680 --> 3:18:38.680]  It's a post human future you better find out about it right now
[3:18:38.680 --> 3:18:46.680]  The great reset is here world government has openly been announced and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family and to make you so poor
[3:18:46.680 --> 3:18:53.680]  You're forced onto a universal guaranteed income or synoculations and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist globalist system
[3:18:53.680 --> 3:19:04.680]  That's why it's important to pray to God be politically active and get prepared for self-defense and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:06.680]  So you're not dependent on the system

[3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:54.680]  The problem is a lot of the other over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring very very toxic and also they have fluoride in it

[3:21:15.680 --> 3:21:31.680]  Alright it's the last show of the year and I'm very proud and honored to be called in to close it out for you. You know I'm wearing an infowars shirt right there today
[3:21:31.680 --> 3:21:49.680]  I'm not a member of the infowars of the infowars team and any kind of a financial sense never been paid I'm doing this for my home in Florida but I'm wearing it because I'm proud to stand with Alex and the info wars family
[3:21:49.680 --> 3:22:05.680]  We're going into a new year and you know we're going to do this stop the steel rally next week and we don't know how it's going to turn out but there's a real serious chance that Biden and Harris are going to be the president and vice president Obama will be a
[3:22:05.680 --> 3:22:17.680]  excuse me a mile or so away in his the basement of his Washington mansion feeding their scripts to them as he has said to set on TV
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:33.680]  They'll be happy to just be the guy putting the words into the earpieces so we know what's coming the Department of Justice is going to be run by people like Andrew Weissman and it's going to be a very dangerous time for patriots because they're
[3:22:33.680 --> 3:22:49.680]  going to be out for revenge very serious revenge anybody that thinks that this is a joke let me tell you all of the hassles that we've had with the FBI and the DOJ being in a virtual state of mutiny the last four years
[3:22:49.680 --> 3:23:05.680]  That was with our guy in the White House so you you put you know Obama as the as the puppet master and others like him you know feeding the lines to Harrison and Biden picking his attorney general
[3:23:05.680 --> 3:23:21.680]  The Department of Justice is going to be out for scalps what happened to Roger Stone is going to be magnified many fold and there won't be a pardon waiting at the end of the Biden Harris administration it'll just be prison so
[3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:39.680]  anybody that that snipes at Alex and wants to wants to cut him down I'm telling you who goes to the rallies who gets right out in front excuse me who's fearless when it comes to putting his face right out in front
[3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:59.680]  You know the former head of the NSA general Michael Hayden said he wants to see Alex charged in and put in prison they're not kidding folks this is serious business anybody that thinks that this is all like some kind of a grift or a big for profit deal
[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:15.680]  I've never I've never been paid a dime I'm doing this for the love of it for the patriotism for the love of my country that's it you know I'm going to Washington next week and it'll I hope it's such a big rally that it's impossible to find anybody that
[3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:33.680]  it'll be a sea of people that's my hope that's my goal but you know to all of the anonymous ankle biters that that you know want to hack away at Alex let me tell you the man has been a fearless leader now for many years and he hasn't
[3:24:33.680 --> 3:24:48.680]  quit when it would have been easy it would have been so easy at various points in the last couple of years to say you know what I've had it I'm just gonna I've done my part I've done more than my part I'm going to exit stage left and just live a quiet life
[3:24:48.680 --> 3:25:03.680]  he didn't do it just like Donald Trump didn't do it and Trump could just just say look the odds of my winning this are slim and none so I'm just going to concede you know this way it'll put my family out of the line of fire
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:21.680]  because you know that after the you know if if if Biden is in the White House next year they're going to come after the entire Trump family they're going to do what due to everybody with it with Trump in their name what they did to Roger Stone
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:36.680]  and you know they're going to do it they're going to do it hard and that's why it's time to really stand up and be counted that's why I'm going to Washington that's why I do this show because we all are going to hang together or we're going to
[3:25:36.680 --> 3:25:54.680]  hang separately and the more of us that there are the more power that we're going to get you know this great reset that we've all been talking about for years it's really about control the global elites are now cooperating
[3:25:54.680 --> 3:26:10.680]  are trying to get us to be basically subservient peasants in a total control grid matrix and they're very close they've been using China as the test bed because there's no bill of rights obviously in China
[3:26:10.680 --> 3:26:24.680]  but they're working out all of the technology and all the methodologies in China but they're step by step going to be using it here in this country and you're not going to be able to do a lot of things without the vaccine very soon
[3:26:24.680 --> 3:26:42.680]  you know first it's everybody is trying to get the vaccine but in a short while it's going to be who are the refused mix that won't take the vaccine and they're going to be locked out professionally and locked out of travel this is all about control
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:27:02.680]  so next week on January 5 and 6 what we have to do is show who's really in control we don't control social media we don't have all of these organs of power we don't control the Department of Justice we can't decide what criminals will go
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:16.680]  uncharged and what innocent people will be arrested in the middle of the night we don't control that but we can overwhelm them with sheer numbers and that's why it's going to be our week next week
[3:27:16.680 --> 3:27:36.680]  you know we weren't around for Valley Forge we weren't around you know during any of America's darkest days and now we're so comfortable it's so easy to sit on the couch watch the TV change channels hit the refrigerator there's no problem you can just watch your country
[3:27:36.680 --> 3:27:56.680]  go down the toilet watch our elections be stolen watch our freedom being lost or you can actually rally now next week it's not going to be a quick in and out like some rallies are you know with convenient shuttle buses this is going to be a lot of confusion
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:28:16.680]  I've been told they're not going to put out porta-potties you know the DC government is going to do everything that they can to sabotage and hassle this so if you go to Washington you can't plan on just getting a hotel room anywhere in Maryland or Virginia convenient
[3:28:16.680 --> 3:28:28.680]  you're going to have to go almost with a camping trip mentality and the weather should be fairly decent the long range forecast isn't too cold no front coming through but you can't tell at this point
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:46.680]  but you're going to have to go with your own plan for for food for water and for all the bodily functions because if you are in a mob of 500,000 or a million people you're not going to be able to just look at your map and say oh now I'm going to walk down this street
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:29:00.680]  you're going to be like a fish in the middle of a giant school you're going to go where the school pushes you at some points so no matter you know unless you get there very early like on the fourth or fifth and stake out a spot
[3:29:00.680 --> 3:29:17.680]  you may not even get within sight of the Capitol but that's all right even if the DC police pull tricks like stopping the Metro from running or searching people going on the Metro to hassle them and confiscate signs things like that
[3:29:17.680 --> 3:29:32.680]  you know there are other methods that can be done you giant car caravans can just circle the DC Beltway you get enough enough Trumpsters enough stop the steel rallyers to park on the bridges
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:45.680]  you can bring Washington DC to a complete stop if they try to prevent this peaceful assembly by keeping people away from the Capitol then the people are just going to do other things
[3:29:45.680 --> 3:29:59.680]  and on the other side of this break we're going to talk some more about that but you know this I can't emphasize this is our moment you know we have never been tested in our lives like we are about to be tested
[3:29:59.680 --> 3:30:20.680]  we haven't fought a war on American soil since 1865 you know we have been blessed our wars have been fought overseas in other people's territory and we have to get off the couches break away out of our free out of our you know peaceful easy living
[3:30:20.680 --> 3:30:37.680]  to show that this country is not going to be stolen by these Democrat socialist communist globalists we're just not going to permit it and next week is when we're going to show it
[3:30:37.680 --> 3:30:53.680]  the year 2021 is almost here and so we're launching our new year's specials right now we've got two different big sales we've got Super Bowl Vitality Turbo Force and Ultra 12 part of the New Year's Resolution energized pack 40% off
[3:30:53.680 --> 3:31:08.680]  so we've got bodies, vaso beats and knockout part of the New Year's Resolution revitalized pack at 40% off but if you get both of these packs together they are 60% off with free shipping and double patriot points the best deal ever

[3:31:30.680 --> 3:31:36.680]  so thank you so much for keeping info wars in the fight without your support we couldn't do any of it
[3:31:36.680 --> 3:31:51.680]  the pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin
[3:31:51.680 --> 3:32:06.680]  all now completely official part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation all the rest of them at 10-21 and 20-30 gets here
[3:32:06.680 --> 3:32:13.680]  and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[3:32:13.680 --> 3:32:28.680]  your rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil and stopping abortion we must start valuing human life again we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable that we are essential
[3:32:28.680 --> 3:32:35.680]  until we do that we are all slaves we must stand up and declare our basic god given human rights now
[3:32:35.680 --> 3:32:48.680]  we are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer all pushing the covid's most deadly thing in history
[3:32:48.680 --> 3:32:57.680]  even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold but if you are deficient then you can actually die from it that's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes
[3:32:57.680 --> 3:33:09.680]  meanwhile all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the covid-19 vaccine especially the mRNA ones are basically bioweapons and are super deadly
[3:33:09.680 --> 3:33:18.680]  and now they are having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it just like newborn babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just die
[3:33:18.680 --> 3:33:27.680]  and that's on the record it does that, Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases but they tell you safe and effective no one's getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory
[3:33:27.680 --> 3:33:52.680]  and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly so they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe they do it
[3:33:52.680 --> 3:34:07.680]  infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned that's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:22.680]  but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail but the new website is theresistance.video, theresistance.video, they're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:37.680]  so the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video, share the link, theresistance.video, theresistance.video
[3:34:52.680 --> 3:35:11.680]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's Matt Bracken you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:30.680]  it's been pretty hard for me to think about anything except this election from November 3rd when Trump was ahead by hundreds of thousands of votes in these six key states we've been talking about now for almost two months
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:46.680]  and we woke up and lo and behold the Democrats had pulled off their operation Red Mirage they had flooded the ballot boxes with their fake ballots and yeah I absolutely now say fake ballots
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:36:08.680]  I know how many of you are able to watch the Georgia Senate hearing yesterday and I watched it all and it had some amazing testimony some from technical and engineering experts there's no question that tens of thousands of ballots in these states were counterfeit
[3:36:08.680 --> 3:36:26.680]  they were mass produced ahead of time when you look at some of these these guys like this this witness on the screen right now Jovan Pulitzer he's got 200 patents you know involved with the human machine interface like QR codes
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:42.680]  he's an expert on this and he says all he needs to see is the paper ballots that you can't fake the creases you can't fake the dots you can't fake the names if they can show the paper ballots it's obviously going to be shown a fraud
[3:36:42.680 --> 3:37:01.680]  so why are they hiding the paper ballots they're hiding the paper ballots because they are hiding the fraud another expert who is named Bobby Peton or Python PITON he's done a very fascinating mathematical analysis of the names
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:17.680]  and in Pennsylvania and Georgia among other states there are hundreds of thousands of names of people that essentially what it boils down to is they have no relatives they're like a celestial alien
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:32.680]  you know dropped onto the planet earth for the purpose of voting and then disappearing they have unique first and last names that don't have any relatives they had no mother father sister brother nephew
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:48.680]  you know this is so easy to look into if we had an honest media if we had an honest Department of Justice this would be so easy to crack so we're watching this theft in front of our faces in real time we're watching it
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:38:03.680]  and we're just going to sit on the couch and say well what can I do about it well let me tell you the path of least resistance is just to flow down the river like a cork or another way of looking at it
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:20.680]  the path of least resistance is to stay in the herd of sheep that are following a Judas goat up at the front through the ever narrowing plank board fences on each side formed into a V and at the end is the slaughterhouse
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:40.680]  because there's no doubt what is in store for us we are being set up for slavery if we let this stand if we let an election be stolen from us while our elite political bosses and media bosses say don't believe your lying eyes
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:56.680]  those ballots being pulled out from underneath the tables that were hidden you know hidden with a black tablecloths that doesn't mean anything when you see those women putting those stacks of ballots through three and four times
[3:38:56.680 --> 3:39:13.680]  something like a hundred and fifty thousand Biden votes in a spike in the middle of the night in Georgia after they said oh we have to clear the room for a burst water man folks if you let this happen that it's on you
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:34.680]  then future generations will say you just didn't really give a damn they stole the election not even hiding it hundreds of thousands of fake names people that don't exist counterfeit ballots with no creases
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:52.680]  dead people voting illegal aliens voting and none of your political bosses are giving you the courtesy or very few of even saying yeah what you see with your own two eyes is true the elite class just wants the party to continue
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:40:12.680]  the Republicans just want to go back to being the Washington generals the happy basketball team that always loses to the Harlem Globetrotters from from day one Trump has been up against all of the Democrats and at least half of the Republicans
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:33.680]  look at Mitch McConnell if he was a patriot and not a chai calm sellout look at his wife's family the billions that they make from China if he wasn't a chai calm sellout he could stop this right now instead of making a deal with Nancy Pelosi to put the knife and
[3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:54.680]  Trump's back and put Biden that the election thief in the White House he could put an end to this just by promoting the challenges to these false certified results in these swing states but he's not doing it and he's not alone
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:41:14.680]  half of the Republicans are as bad as the Democrats in fact I think I hate them more because I respect an honest enemy like a Chuck Schumer standing in front of me as a communist saying he hates me more than a Republican that says sure I'm a I'm a conservative
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:33.680]  but he's making secret deals with Pelosi and Schumer to get ready to put the knife in our back folks next week we have a chance to change the course of history it's not going to be done by by a senator holly by himself
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:53.680]  we can't wait for some you know white hat QAnon secret you know insiders going to fix it for us that's not going to happen all of that has been BS that's been meant to keep the sheep going in line to the slaughterhouse nice and calm
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:42:15.680]  believing in some deus ex machina that was going to pull a rabbit out of the hat and save us it's not that we're not going to be saved by anybody above us we're going to only be saved by millions of Americans moving to Washington occupying the entire area if if necessary
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:35.680]  we're not just storming right into the capital know there we know the rules of engagement if you have enough people you can push down any kind of a fence or a wall but if not enough patriots show up then we're just going to watch our freedom go down the drain
[3:42:35.680 --> 3:42:53.680]  if anybody thinks I hope on this show they don't think it don't worry in two years we'll win we'll get them back that's what they thought in Venezuela don't worry about this Hugo Chavez he'll wreck the economy and then the conservatives will win the next election
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:43:15.680]  so folks if they can steal an election right in front of our face one video with you know hundreds of thousands of fake ballots counterfeit ballots fake names of people that don't exist and we can't stop it do you really think we'll ever have another free election in this country do you think
[3:43:15.680 --> 3:43:35.680]  you can give us a chance to come back in two years and push the Democrats out next week is a pivot in American history next week we're going to stand up as free Americans or we are just going to cringe back to our sofa watch our country turn into
[3:43:35.680 --> 3:43:57.680]  Venezuela lose our freedom and remember our country in this scenario is just one big cog in the global great reset we're going to be nothing more than peasant slaves in a Chinese style social credit system where you just have to say yes sir no sir
[3:43:57.680 --> 3:44:13.680]  because you're afraid that if you go to the wrong websites you're going to mark get marked down on your social credit which will affect everything from your credit score to your ability to travel just like in China that's what our elites have planned for us
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:29.680]  and the only chance we have to stop this is a mass mobilization next week if we don't see a million people in Washington then I'll live I'll know just not enough Americans cared
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:45.680]  freedom just didn't matter that much as long as they had Netflix and a full refrigerator and a cozy sofa they really didn't give a damn about freedom and if that's the case then we deserve everything that comes after this
[3:44:45.680 --> 3:45:01.680]  because we will then just be saying I'm a sheep I follow the sheep in front of me the loudspeakers are saying everything is normal follow that goat towards the big building up ahead I'm not doing it I'm going to Washington
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:19.680]  I'm staying for the duration if there are debates I'm staying till the end I don't care I've heard all about the hotel situation and Antifa and black lives matter I don't care I'm going and I hope I see you there I hope I see millions of you there
[3:45:19.680 --> 3:45:25.680]  and hope I see you again on info wars thanks for listening
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:27.680]  Happy New Year
[3:45:27.680 --> 3:45:33.680]  Hey Alex how you doing man is this the guy that called in about living defense
[3:45:33.680 --> 3:45:45.680]  Yes sir yes sir I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah I said man I gotta get on that show and give him an update
[3:45:45.680 --> 3:46:05.680]  If I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show I'm going to tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally now look I'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to the info war store products and by the way I bought $800 worth the other night so I'm doing what I can brother
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:24.680]  My my contention is why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense now you gotta follow that up with the micro VX I learned that so it's like God working is so amazing we didn't know we didn't screen your call we had no idea and I go to you a year later and you're
[3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:39.680]  going to tell me about living defense living defense living defense not a secret why and left us controlled cities all over the world not just the US they encourage people to live intense settings is homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:55.680]  It's because the globalist admit under Agenda 21 Agenda 2030 of course the great reset they want to lower expectations they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere they don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better they want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse
[3:46:55.680 --> 3:47:12.680]  The globalist fly around in private jets they have huge private mistakes they are separate from us their children go to private tutors they admit this now they want us to lock down telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure
[3:47:12.680 --> 3:47:27.680]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot autonomous cars and trucks this is all they're admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post human future you better find out about it right now
