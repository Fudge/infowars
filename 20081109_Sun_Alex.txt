[00:15.720 --> 00:20.360]  Do it now or become property of the New World Order.
[00:20.360 --> 00:21.920]  Policymakers will meet here in Austin
[00:21.920 --> 00:23.320]  to work on growing green.
[00:23.320 --> 00:25.280]  Yeah!
[00:25.280 --> 00:28.400]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:28.400 --> 00:30.080]  On News Radio 590.
[00:33.080 --> 00:36.920]  By our bank, USA Radio News, I'm Pete LaValle.
[00:36.920 --> 00:39.720]  The president-elect is working to choose a cabinet
[00:39.720 --> 00:43.080]  that is diverse according to his transition sheet.
[00:43.080 --> 00:45.760]  I think his charge to us is that he wants
[00:45.760 --> 00:48.680]  a broad, diverse cabinet, one that's built
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.200]  on first criteria's excellence,
[00:51.200 --> 00:52.520]  and that's what we're trying to produce.
[00:52.520 --> 00:55.200]  John Podesta appeared on Fox News
[00:55.200 --> 00:57.400]  as did Congressman Eric Cantor,
[00:57.400 --> 01:00.240]  who says House Republicans are willing to work
[01:00.240 --> 01:02.880]  with the Obama administration to get the job done.
[01:02.880 --> 01:05.760]  I think you will see a Republican party in Congress
[01:05.760 --> 01:08.160]  serving as a check and a balance against
[01:08.160 --> 01:11.240]  Mr. Obama's power and Speaker Pelosi's power.
[01:11.240 --> 01:13.760]  Podesta also says the incoming administration
[01:13.760 --> 01:16.640]  is reviewing President Bush's executive orders
[01:16.640 --> 01:20.400]  on stem cell research, oil and gasoline, and other matters.
[01:20.400 --> 01:22.800]  Hurricane Paloma is now weakening.
[01:22.800 --> 01:24.880]  The once powerful storm has lost its function.
[01:24.880 --> 01:27.000]  It's now a tropical storm.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.280]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:30.240 --> 01:32.800]  The following from News Broadcast Network.
[01:32.800 --> 01:35.120]  If you haven't had CPR training for a while,
[01:35.120 --> 01:37.680]  you may be surprised to learn that doctors are now saying
[01:37.680 --> 01:40.240]  you should skip the mouth-to-mouth part of resuscitation
[01:40.240 --> 01:43.280]  in most cases and concentrate on restarting the heart.
[01:43.280 --> 01:45.520]  Dr. Charles Otto of the University of Arizona
[01:45.520 --> 01:47.600]  College of Medicine told the American Society
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.560]  of Amnesthesiologists annual meeting,
[01:49.560 --> 01:52.080]  research shows that starting the heart in most cases
[01:52.080 --> 01:54.480]  will allow the person in distress to get some oxygen
[01:54.480 --> 01:56.960]  on his own, one side benefit Dr. Otto says,
[01:56.960 --> 01:58.880]  more bystanders may be likely to help
[01:58.880 --> 02:00.880]  because people are often less comfortable
[02:00.880 --> 02:01.960]  giving mouth-to-mouth.
[02:01.960 --> 02:04.080]  John Dritton, Orlando.
[02:04.080 --> 02:06.080]  To educate our community about breast health
[02:06.080 --> 02:08.400]  and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Yo-Ple's
[02:08.400 --> 02:10.360]  Safe Lids to Safe Lives campaign,
[02:10.360 --> 02:12.720]  Cheryl Crow joined forces with Yo-Ple.
[02:12.720 --> 02:15.120]  The goal is to raise 1.5 million dollars
[02:15.120 --> 02:16.920]  to go to the Susan G coming for the cure.
[02:16.920 --> 02:19.280]  Join Cheryl and Yo-Ple in the fight against breast cancer
[02:19.280 --> 02:22.000]  by mailing in special pink lids from Yo-Ple yogurt cups.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.880]  For every pink lid mailed in by December 31, 2008,
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.080]  Yo-Ple will donate $0.10 to Susan G Komen for the cure.
[02:28.080 --> 02:30.680]  I'm Jennifer Morrow.
[02:30.680 --> 02:33.640]  A deadly accident on a Russian submarine.
[02:33.640 --> 02:36.440]  20 people suffocated when a fire extinguishing system
[02:36.440 --> 02:40.520]  aboard a new Russian sub-mouth function during a test run.
[02:40.520 --> 02:43.320]  The accident released free on gas.
[02:43.320 --> 02:45.360]  Correspondent Vladimir Izachevkoff
[02:45.360 --> 02:47.000]  is following the story in Moscow.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  There are unconfirmed at the stage reports
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.840]  that the submarine was to be leased by India for 10 years.
[02:54.840 --> 02:57.880]  And the trials were actually part of preparations
[02:57.880 --> 02:58.920]  for the lease.
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.880]  The Russian Navy says the sub itself was not damaged.
[03:02.880 --> 03:05.880]  The owner of a collapsed school in Haiti is in custody
[03:05.880 --> 03:08.120]  as a desperate search for survivors continues.
[03:08.120 --> 03:10.720]  At least 88 children are known dead.
[03:10.720 --> 03:12.320]  Many are still missing.
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.440]  The owner is charged with involuntary manslaughter.
[03:15.440 --> 03:17.480]  There's new evidence that people not normally thought
[03:17.480 --> 03:20.840]  to get major risk can reduce their chances of a heart attack
[03:20.840 --> 03:22.720]  using a cholesterol drug.

[04:00.760 --> 04:03.200]  Doctors are treating dozens of cholera cases
[04:03.200 --> 04:05.640]  outside a refugee camp just outside Congo's
[04:05.640 --> 04:07.960]  eastern provincial capital of Goma.
[04:07.960 --> 04:11.280]  They treated 13 new cases of cholera on Sunday
[04:11.280 --> 04:13.600]  and have seen 45 cases since Friday
[04:13.600 --> 04:15.680]  at the Kibati refugee camp.
[04:15.680 --> 04:17.960]  They say shortages of water in the Queens
[04:17.960 --> 04:19.880]  make the outbreak dangerous.
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.240]  Britain is remembering its war dead,
[04:22.240 --> 04:25.080]  including troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[04:25.080 --> 04:27.040]  The service is held on the nearest Sunday
[04:27.040 --> 04:29.400]  to the anniversary of the end of World War
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.160]  1 on November 11, 1918.
[04:33.160 --> 04:35.600]  Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on Germans
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.120]  to stand together against racism and anti-Semitism,
[04:39.120 --> 04:42.800]  as that nation marks the 70th anniversary of the Nazi program
[04:42.800 --> 04:45.680]  known as Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass,
[04:45.680 --> 04:48.560]  to mark the anniversary of the Nazi incited riots that
[04:48.560 --> 04:52.880]  killed more than 91 Jews and damaged some 1,000 synagogues.
[04:52.880 --> 04:56.720]  A female suicide bomber has detonated her explosive vest
[04:56.720 --> 04:59.560]  at a hospital west of Baghdad, killing three people,
[04:59.560 --> 05:00.960]  injuring five others.
[05:00.960 --> 05:03.720]  Three Indonesian bombers have been executed
[05:03.720 --> 05:08.600]  for helping plan and carry out the 2002 ballad bombings.
[05:08.600 --> 05:11.120]  People with pacemakers or other heart devices
[05:11.120 --> 05:14.800]  should be careful with headphones from portable music players.
[05:14.800 --> 05:17.240]  The study presented at an American Heart Association
[05:17.240 --> 05:19.280]  conference lines that some headphones
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.040]  can interfere with heart devices if held too close to them.
[05:23.040 --> 05:24.480]  I'm Pete Lavalle.
[05:24.480 --> 05:30.400]  You've been listening to IRN, USA Radio News.
[05:30.400 --> 05:32.800]  Are you one of the people who think, I have plenty of time.
[05:32.800 --> 05:34.600]  Nothing's ever going to happen bad to me.
[05:34.600 --> 05:36.640]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare,
[05:36.640 --> 05:38.120]  our corporate controlled government
[05:38.120 --> 05:40.040]  will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[05:40.040 --> 05:42.920]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.680]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist,
[05:44.680 --> 05:45.680]  heard on this network.
[05:45.680 --> 05:48.560]  Survival enterprises sells real food, canned for long term
[05:48.560 --> 05:51.280]  storage, beef, chicken, turkey, bacon, butter, cheese, eggs,
[05:51.280 --> 05:52.840]  freeze-dried fruits and vegetables,
[05:52.840 --> 05:55.200]  Mountain House freeze-dried meals, MREs,
[05:55.200 --> 05:58.160]  a full nutritional line, the British Birkfeld water filter,
[05:58.160 --> 05:58.720]  and more.
[05:58.720 --> 06:01.760]  If you want to prepare now, go to beforeitstoolate.us.
[06:01.760 --> 06:06.560]  That's before itstoolate.us or call 1-800-753-1981.
[06:06.560 --> 06:09.400]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[06:09.400 --> 06:11.080]  Or you can put your head in the sand
[06:11.080 --> 06:13.800]  and be just another sheeple in the corporate controlled flock.
[06:13.800 --> 06:16.120]  But remember, those who don't learn from history
[06:16.120 --> 06:17.320]  are bound to repeat it.
[06:17.320 --> 06:19.360]  And my own blood and blood will die
[06:19.360 --> 06:22.320]  if I break your bones and break your bones.
[06:22.320 --> 06:23.320]  Leave!
[06:23.320 --> 06:24.320]  Ah!
[06:24.320 --> 06:25.320]  Leave!
[06:25.320 --> 06:26.320]  Ah!
[06:26.320 --> 06:27.320]  Ah!
[06:32.320 --> 06:35.320]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio.
[06:35.320 --> 06:37.320]  A talk radio experience.
[06:37.320 --> 06:39.600]  Don't act like you know nothing.
[06:39.600 --> 06:42.240]  Scrap yourselves in and hold on.
[06:42.240 --> 06:45.000]  He stands for truth.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.240]  He stands for justice.
[06:48.240 --> 06:50.640]  He stands for what's right.
[06:50.640 --> 06:53.960]  This is the Alex Jones show.

[07:10.240 --> 07:11.240]  That's right.
[07:11.240 --> 07:16.000]  Coming to you out of the studios of News Radio 590-KLBJ here in Austin, Texas.
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.040]  It's indicated across the United States on AM and FM.
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.520]  There's a little shortwave satellite on the Internet.
[07:21.520 --> 07:23.520]  I am Alex Jones.
[07:23.520 --> 07:24.520]  Thank you for joining us.
[07:24.520 --> 07:27.840]  We'll be live here for the Sunday abbreviated edition than I do.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.080]  I'm on the air six days a week.
[07:29.080 --> 07:34.320]  But until Friday, then I come back here on Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[07:34.320 --> 07:36.600]  Standard Time.
[07:36.600 --> 07:43.840]  I want to take a ton of phone calls today on the economy, on Barack Obama, on where you
[07:43.840 --> 07:46.360]  think this country is headed in the future.
[07:46.360 --> 07:52.800]  Are you happy with the direction that Barack Obama, the 44th president, the 44th president
[07:52.800 --> 07:57.600]  now president, elect moving quickly into the presidential role, the radio addresses and
[07:57.600 --> 07:59.080]  press conferences.
[07:59.080 --> 08:02.160]  Are you happy with what he is doing?
[08:02.160 --> 08:10.560]  Every number to join us, 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525, and if those lines fill up, you can always
[08:10.560 --> 08:17.120]  call if you're listening in Texas, 8360-590.
[08:17.120 --> 08:22.400]  I want to go over Barack Obama and who he really is and what he really stands for, but
[08:22.400 --> 08:26.480]  this has to be done delicately or it only empowers the globalist.
[08:26.480 --> 08:29.400]  It only empowers the New World Order.
[08:29.400 --> 08:34.600]  Through this psychological trap that they've set up, then I want to get into the Denver
[08:34.600 --> 08:39.600]  Post reporting what we told you two months ago.
[08:39.600 --> 08:44.960]  When I was in Denver, we witnessed police staged opposing those demonstrators and we
[08:44.960 --> 08:50.800]  talked to witnesses who had seen police posing as demonstrators trying to stir up trouble.
[08:50.800 --> 08:58.240]  Now the police have been forced to admit now that they did stage attacks on other police
[08:58.240 --> 09:01.720]  as a pretext to be able to attack the peaceful crowds.
[09:01.720 --> 09:06.160]  Now we've caught them in Seattle, we've caught them in DC, we've caught them in Austin, Texas
[09:06.160 --> 09:13.480]  doing this, we've caught them in other countries in Italy and Canada.
[09:13.480 --> 09:20.160]  Well they've now been caught in Denver doing this and the police admit they did it.
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.400]  You understand there's a whole world that the general public has not made privy to.
[09:25.400 --> 09:34.280]  Why would police go out and attack their own police as a pretext to demonize demonstrators?
[09:34.280 --> 09:41.440]  What does that tell you about major metropolitan police department's mindset?
[09:41.440 --> 09:47.800]  Well I mean we've seen cases every few weeks about major police departments framing people.
[09:47.800 --> 09:52.800]  It's institutionalized, it's not one bad cop in the crime lab that frames people in Houston.
[09:52.800 --> 09:56.760]  It was over 4,000 people framed and they were ordered to.
[09:56.760 --> 10:01.280]  That came out and was barely a blurb two years ago in the Houston Chronicle.
[10:01.280 --> 10:05.560]  In Dallas they like your car, they pull it over, they throw a bag of chalk in the back,
[10:05.560 --> 10:06.560]  they take your car.
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.560]  No judge, no jury.
[10:07.560 --> 10:09.680]  It's acid, forfeiture, seizure.
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.560]  There's no bill of rights, no due process, no constitution and they don't care.
[10:14.560 --> 10:23.600]  I had a police officer call me on Friday's show and actually in hindsight I know who
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.600]  the guy was because he said his name and then I googled him and I heard about him as a police
[10:28.600 --> 10:34.400]  detective in New Jersey, he was involved on 9-11 responding and he's had Richard Gage
[10:34.400 --> 10:38.280]  and architects and engineers from 9-11 Truth and the Speak and he said you know I get police
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.520]  to tune into your show and tell them they need to hear this information and then you're
[10:42.520 --> 10:43.520]  bashing them.
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.480]  Hey man, I mean if cops are attacking other cops and blaming it on the American people,
[10:47.480 --> 10:52.200]  I mean I'm not going to sit here and say it's a good thing.
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.200]  I'm tired of it.
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.960]  I grew up in Rockwall, Texas knowing the police dealt the drugs and sure enough later the
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.840]  sheriff Jack McCorder went to prison for it.
[11:02.840 --> 11:07.440]  I mean I'm not going to live in La La Land, I'm going to live in the real world.
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.280]  I'm not against a cop living in his house with his wife and children or husband and
[11:11.280 --> 11:16.720]  children living their life, you know outright in tickets or responding to burglaries or
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.040]  house alarms but you know I've had Austin cops come up and tell me we're going to arrest
[11:21.040 --> 11:24.080]  you if you don't stop protesting on the street corner and I've had to say well I'm going
[11:24.080 --> 11:28.320]  to sue you then and make them back off and I've seen them arrest people in wheelchairs
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.920]  protesting out front of the governor's mansion, you know for handicapped rights or whatever.
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.040]  You know I'm an American, I'm a human being, I've got rights, I've got a soul, I have value
[11:39.040 --> 11:43.440]  and I don't want to fight with you mindlessly but I know the government itself is corrupt
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.200]  and evil, state, federal, international.
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.280]  I mean evidenced by this banker takeover known as the bailout, over a trillion bucks has already
[11:52.280 --> 11:57.400]  been handed out directly to banks as being used as bonuses and to buy banks and other
[11:57.400 --> 12:04.560]  financial institutions, banks that are in good shape, there's a major Texas bank based
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.720]  in Houston that's going to be announcing it was bought Monday, I'll give you a hint it
[12:09.720 --> 12:15.440]  has a founding father in its name and that bank is in really good shape, I have to know
[12:15.440 --> 12:21.520]  well I'll just say I know some of the governors of the bank and the point is that's one of
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.720]  the healthiest banks in Texas so it's being bought with the bailout money by one of the
[12:26.720 --> 12:29.760]  big four international banks.
[12:29.760 --> 12:34.280]  Now now let me explain something, you're going to pay for that money and tax money and you're
[12:34.280 --> 12:41.920]  going to pay through inflation, now that is a heist, this is a robbery, this is a crime
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.280]  going on and it tells me if government will do things like this which our government's
[12:46.280 --> 12:49.600]  never done anything like this, I mean they've done a lot of bad stuff but they've never
[12:49.600 --> 12:54.320]  grabbed a trillion bucks and publicly handed it over to the private bankers who gave them
[12:54.320 --> 12:59.040]  campaign contributions while telling the public it was to get the economy going again and
[12:59.040 --> 13:08.280]  giving no money into the economy, I mean that's a big deal, by the way Barack Obama, he is
[13:08.280 --> 13:13.720]  appointing and he set up a new commission on the economy of the very insiders that have
[13:13.720 --> 13:20.080]  engineered what we're seeing right now, not only have the banks cut off credit and currency
[13:20.080 --> 13:25.320]  and liquidity to the population in Main Street and to the auto makers and everybody else,
[13:25.320 --> 13:29.160]  they are cutting it off in their own documents or public, we've posted them at infowars.com
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.600]  and prismplanet.com to cause an implosion in the economy so they can buy everything
[13:34.600 --> 13:40.720]  up that much cheaper, but that isn't enough, they then panic you and say give us an limited
[13:40.720 --> 13:44.520]  governmental power and give us trillions of dollars or there'll be a depression a month
[13:44.520 --> 13:51.200]  ago, we've got to have it today and as of a month plus not one cent's been given to
[13:51.200 --> 13:58.200]  any of the quote banks in trouble, it's not been used to quote freeze up mortgages, the
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.880]  truth is that was all a red herring as I told you almost three years ago, long before any
[14:02.880 --> 14:07.720]  discussion of subprime mortgages was in the news I said they're going to stage the implosion
[14:07.720 --> 14:15.680]  of the economy starting with the subprime mortgages, the adjustable rate mortgages,
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.800]  it's on record, it's in articles we wrote, it's in end game, film that's been out for
[14:20.800 --> 14:27.720]  year and a half and you saw what happened because we had spies inside an elite meeting
[14:27.720 --> 14:33.400]  in Canada, Bilderberg, we actually fly on airplanes and get arrested and interrogated
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.520]  and go through hell to bring you information that of course turns out to be absolutely
[14:37.520 --> 14:43.080]  accurate, I mean this is the real world, I hope people value what they're hearing here
[14:43.080 --> 14:47.400]  and understand is it a bunch of phony liberal media or a bunch of fake right wing media
[14:47.400 --> 14:53.160]  that's all bought and paid for by the establishment and then they keep you within that small reservation
[14:53.160 --> 14:59.600]  than that limited area of debate and discussion instead of looking at the wider world and
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.000]  information around it, so when we get back what I'm going to do is we're going to talk
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.320]  to Robert and Steve and JD and Jeremy and Mike and John and Juan and many others folks
[15:09.320 --> 15:15.680]  from DC to New Hampshire from Texas to Tennessee and Colorado, we're going to take phone calls
[15:15.680 --> 15:22.440]  and then later in the hour, I'm going to go through Barack Obama, his new chief of staff
[15:22.440 --> 15:29.040]  Rahm Emanuel wrote a book back when he was working for Clinton and in his book he said
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.800]  we want to disarm the American people and we want to have national compulsory service
[15:32.800 --> 15:41.000]  for all and we want to have a national draft again and then Barack Obama has called for
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.400]  a national one million man spy force to spy on you and your family, we played that clip
[15:45.400 --> 15:50.240]  last week and he had all this up on Friday, I covered it on the radio, he had it all up
[15:50.240 --> 16:00.240]  at change.gov, that's his presidential transition website, change.gov and they said mandatory,
[16:00.240 --> 16:02.920]  they're going to mandatory even old people that said they're going to have to work for
[16:02.920 --> 16:08.240]  the government as slaves, guess what, they took it down and some newspapers picked up
[16:08.240 --> 16:14.680]  on it, they took it down so we're going to cover that, hey look, this isn't about Barack
[16:14.680 --> 16:20.440]  Obama or George Bush, don't you dare say I'm a George Bush supporter, I'm against what
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.960]  the puppet Barack Obama is pushing, you got it, I don't like the policies, I'm not into
[16:24.960 --> 16:31.880]  all the Hollywood baloney blitz, I see through it, stay with us, I am so frustrated, I can't
[16:31.880 --> 16:37.240]  seem to remember anything anymore, what, seriously my memory and attention span is terrible,
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.560]  I read something and forget, I forget people's names, I hear all this great information on
[16:41.560 --> 16:46.400]  the radio and I want to tell people but I forget, okay, slow down, poor attention and
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.320]  memory loss is not your fault, factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants,
[16:51.320 --> 16:56.120]  genetically modified foods the way the education system taught you, it's all meant to dumb
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.760]  you down, you know, I can remember everything now, even entire books, what how?
[17:00.760 --> 17:06.000]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory, their online course is a real breakthrough

[18:30.480 --> 18:34.120]  Hello Ted Anderson, listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[18:34.120 --> 18:38.680]  and understand the risks of deficit spending, therefore with catastrophic events it comes
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.040]  as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.360]  can remove from their accounts, a fractional reserve system means only a small portion
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.560]  of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal, deficit spending will skyrocket
[18:51.560 --> 18:55.920]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed
[18:55.920 --> 19:00.520]  by a depressed economy, a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central
[19:00.520 --> 19:04.960]  banks to increase liquidity for depositors, however an increase in money supply without
[19:04.960 --> 19:09.400]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation, in order to achieve strength and
[19:09.400 --> 19:14.560]  stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[19:14.560 --> 19:19.680]  into gold and silver, while paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on
[19:19.680 --> 19:26.560]  its own has held value for over 6,000 years, for more information call 1-800-686-2237,
[19:26.560 --> 19:35.160]  that's 1-800-686-2237.
[19:35.160 --> 19:41.680]  What will you do when it happens, when you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation

[20:33.560 --> 20:38.360]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio, well search no more, we are the GCN
[20:38.360 --> 20:48.280]  Radio Network.
[20:48.280 --> 20:56.560]  Welcome back folks, thank you for joining us today, I'm going to get into Barack Obama
[20:56.560 --> 21:02.200]  later, you know not what color he is or how his suits hang on his body or how they choreograph
[21:02.200 --> 21:07.720]  his victory speech back on Tuesday night and had really fancy Hollywood boom cameras zooming
[21:07.720 --> 21:12.640]  over the crowd that thought that Jesus Christ had landed.
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.800]  It's that Barack Obama is announcing the exact same agendas of George W. Bush which
[21:18.800 --> 21:22.960]  was the exact same agendas of Bill Clinton which was the exact same agendas of George
[21:22.960 --> 21:28.680]  Herbert Walker Bush, you have to go back that far before you find a president who actually
[21:28.680 --> 21:36.800]  did a few things different like get us out of the United Nations UNESCO program or engage
[21:36.800 --> 21:42.600]  in daytime, I'm not even saying Reagan was good, my point is that you can't eat, I mean
[21:42.600 --> 21:48.880]  the total New World Order since then and a lot of New World Order presidents before that
[21:48.880 --> 21:54.600]  and it's real simple that the multinational corporations own both parties, they put out
[21:54.600 --> 22:03.520]  different PR spin for the public, different flavors of the same junk but see George Bush
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.360]  after seven well almost eight years, seven and three quarter years couldn't carry the
[22:08.360 --> 22:14.440]  New World Order ball down the field, national drafts, police state, surveillance, wars,
[22:14.440 --> 22:24.640]  taxation, regulation control, gun control, disarming the slaves, Barack Obama can and
[22:24.640 --> 22:30.120]  he is and the guy finally, I mean only four or five days, I say finally but that's quite
[22:30.120 --> 22:33.800]  a while, people should have seen it earlier, a lot of even liberal groups are going, wait
[22:33.800 --> 22:37.200]  a minute, now he's saying we're going to stay in Iraq, now he says we're going into Pakistan,
[22:37.200 --> 22:41.600]  now he says we're going to keep spying on the American people without warrants, well
[22:41.600 --> 22:49.880]  wait, now he's saying all down the line being deceptive and of course he was the biggest
[22:49.880 --> 22:58.240]  cheerleader, more than John McCain for the banker takeover bill, the heist, the robbery,
[22:58.240 --> 23:02.920]  didn't matter if 98% of you didn't want it, didn't matter if they were getting a thousand
[23:02.920 --> 23:06.360]  to one phone calls in Congress against it, both parties were for it because they don't
[23:06.360 --> 23:11.320]  work for us, they work for offshore corporations, all right let's go ahead and go to your phone
[23:11.320 --> 23:17.800]  calls, let's go to Juan in New Hampshire first, Juan you're on the air, welcome.
[23:17.800 --> 23:19.520]  Yeah Alex, how you doing?
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.520]  Good.
[23:20.520 --> 23:26.960]  I wanted to tell you, I'll ask you about a problem I'm having, about six years ago when
[23:26.960 --> 23:33.040]  I went to enroll my son in the public school system in New Hampshire, they adamantly told
[23:33.040 --> 23:36.360]  me they wouldn't take him because he didn't have the shots.
[23:36.360 --> 23:39.720]  They're liars, they're criminal liars who lie and say it's the law and it's not because
[23:39.720 --> 23:41.720]  we have a bankrupt criminal government.
[23:41.720 --> 23:42.720]  Exactly.
[23:42.720 --> 23:46.240]  The government exists to steal tax money and give it to private banks, that's it.
[23:46.240 --> 23:50.560]  That's right, now four years go by and all of a sudden we get the tune officer at our
[23:50.560 --> 23:56.800]  house two years ago, now my wife listens to you and she wouldn't open the door, so he
[23:56.800 --> 24:01.760]  came back with the Department of Child and Family Services and everything like that.
[24:01.760 --> 24:06.600]  And let me guess, they didn't have a warrant either, by a judge, they just make it up because
[24:06.600 --> 24:13.640]  they're dirt bag criminals, see they're violating the Fourth Amendment, they're violating everything
[24:13.640 --> 24:14.840]  and they do it.
[24:14.840 --> 24:19.440]  First they lie and say you've got to take shots, then they trigger because your child's
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.200]  not in a government brainwashing camp, you're obviously homeschooling, which is your right,
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.400]  California says it's illegal, then they come without a warrant and violate the Fourth Amendment,
[24:28.400 --> 24:32.760]  all part of the vicious dirt bag criminalness, but we're supposed to fall down and lick their
[24:32.760 --> 24:37.160]  boots and go, oh, because you've got a uniform, go ahead and destroy America, I love you.
[24:37.160 --> 24:38.480]  Okay, so what happened next?
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.160]  All right, that was two years ago, now I call him.
[24:42.160 --> 24:46.680]  What did the Department of Child Kidnapping Services do when they showed up at your house?
[24:46.680 --> 24:47.680]  Pardon?
[24:47.680 --> 24:49.840]  What did the child kidnappers do when they showed up at your house?
[24:49.840 --> 24:55.640]  Oh, they were with him and they were just like spying and, but.
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.700]  And if your wife wouldn't have been informed, she'd let him in, one dog here, one dirty
[24:59.700 --> 25:02.160]  plate, never seen your child again.
[25:02.160 --> 25:03.160]  That's right.
[25:03.160 --> 25:05.800]  Be often some Malaysian rape camp.
[25:05.800 --> 25:10.480]  Then I called him and I said, I want to see you, John, I said, I want to see you.
[25:10.480 --> 25:14.280]  And he says, okay, he says, how about meeting me at Dunkin' Donuts?
[25:14.280 --> 25:18.760]  So I went down to Dunkin' Donuts and I got an account with him and we talked for an hour
[25:18.760 --> 25:23.880]  and I told him the whole nine yards, I said, John, I said, you broke my son's civil rights,
[25:23.880 --> 25:25.920]  I said, the school system broke our civil rights.
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.600]  I said, you wouldn't accept him because you said it was the law to be vaccinated.
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.600]  It's not.
[25:31.600 --> 25:35.920]  And so we got to, and I was telling him about you and telling him about, you know, I was
[25:35.920 --> 25:36.920]  probably evil.
[25:36.920 --> 25:37.920]  Yeah.
[25:37.920 --> 25:41.240]  And so he gave me these papers for homeschooling, right?
[25:41.240 --> 25:45.840]  So after an hour, you know, I get back to the house, have to talk to my, look at them,
[25:45.840 --> 25:47.080]  the policy papers.
[25:47.080 --> 25:48.080]  Okay.
[25:48.080 --> 25:49.080]  That all came from you.
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.280]  So I spot him.
[25:50.280 --> 25:53.080]  So I give him a call and I leave him a message.
[25:53.080 --> 25:55.480]  He doesn't bother us for two years.
[25:55.480 --> 25:56.480]  He's back.
[25:56.480 --> 26:01.080]  Now, last Wednesday, the day after the election, he appears at the house again.
[26:01.080 --> 26:02.080]  My wife doesn't.
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.080]  Yeah.
[26:03.080 --> 26:08.320]  The color of law illegally has no reason to be there, but that you are a fat hog.
[26:08.320 --> 26:10.080]  You're a fat slave to them.
[26:10.080 --> 26:11.160]  They want some bacon.
[26:11.160 --> 26:12.160]  They're hungry.
[26:12.160 --> 26:13.320]  They've got quotas.
[26:13.320 --> 26:15.120]  They've got children to kidnap.
[26:15.120 --> 26:19.520]  Now what, when I called him, I said, John, you were at the house today, he was surprised
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.080]  because we got people that watch and my wife watches too.
[26:24.080 --> 26:31.400]  And he said, no, I got a phone call that he said the DCFS call me that there's a child
[26:31.400 --> 26:32.400]  there.
[26:32.400 --> 26:36.800]  I said that hasn't been in school and all and that's again, the tattletale neighbors
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.480]  think it's illegal to not be in a vaccination death camp where you learn how to be a prisoner
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.800]  and thumbprint to get school lunches and learn how to learn how to be obsessed and feel bad
[26:45.800 --> 26:50.160]  about yourself and learn how to take Ritalin and Prozac and learn how to sort cocaine.
[26:50.160 --> 26:52.360]  So you don't want to put your child in a death camp.
[26:52.360 --> 26:58.680]  And so a scumbag filth neighbor, part of the filth of America called him.
[26:58.680 --> 26:59.680]  Hello?
[26:59.680 --> 27:01.520]  Yes, sir.
[27:01.520 --> 27:03.520]  So where are you now with the scum?
[27:03.520 --> 27:04.520]  Okay.
[27:04.520 --> 27:11.080]  I, when I called him last Wednesday, I said, John, I said, the papers you gave me were
[27:11.080 --> 27:12.080]  policy papers.
[27:12.080 --> 27:16.600]  And he goes, yeah, I know, and then I goes, policy is not the law, John.
[27:16.600 --> 27:17.600]  That's right.
[27:17.600 --> 27:18.600]  Scum filth.
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.000]  No, no, they want to get in your house to find something to hit you and hit you hard
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.080]  because the Saudis need more children.
[27:25.080 --> 27:26.080]  Okay.
[27:26.080 --> 27:29.680]  So then he says, he says, well, I said, John, you gave me the policy papers.
[27:29.680 --> 27:31.920]  I said, that's not, that's not right at all.
[27:31.920 --> 27:35.080]  I said, I tried to call Parker, which is the capital.
[27:35.080 --> 27:38.280]  So he's all color of law line because he's a hardcore crook.
[27:38.280 --> 27:39.280]  What happened?
[27:39.280 --> 27:40.280]  Now that's criminal.
[27:40.280 --> 27:41.680]  It's criminal when they do this.
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.120]  It's criminal when Denver cops attack other cops to put news cameras on it and make protests
[27:46.120 --> 27:48.800]  look bad, but they've got a job to ban free speech.
[27:48.800 --> 27:50.960]  They've got a job to demonize demonstration.
[27:50.960 --> 27:53.160]  They got a job to take America down.
[27:53.160 --> 27:55.880]  They got a job and they're doing it good.
[27:55.880 --> 27:57.240]  So what else happened?
[27:57.240 --> 28:00.840]  So he was going to call me back the next day.
[28:00.840 --> 28:02.200]  He never did.
[28:02.200 --> 28:04.320]  So then I called him Friday twice.
[28:04.320 --> 28:05.320]  He never returned.
[28:05.320 --> 28:06.800]  You better watch yourself.
[28:06.800 --> 28:11.200]  And if I was you, I would go ahead and move and then I would register your house in some
[28:11.200 --> 28:12.200]  corporation's name.
[28:12.200 --> 28:13.920]  I'd set up your own little corporation.
[28:13.920 --> 28:15.480]  That's totally legal.
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.720]  And because black, you know, the little black ops operation is mad that your child's not
[28:19.720 --> 28:23.360]  in a fluoride facility where they give them the fluoride water and give them the fluoride
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.840]  pills to eat to brain damage him and the injections and the, to be just like the rest of the zombie
[28:27.840 --> 28:28.840]  scum.
[28:28.840 --> 28:29.840]  Right.
[28:29.840 --> 28:30.840]  Yeah.
[28:30.840 --> 28:36.720]  So, and he said to me, he said, DCFS is going to take you to court is what he said.
[28:36.720 --> 28:37.720]  That's fine.
[28:37.720 --> 28:38.720]  My child and family.
[28:38.720 --> 28:39.720]  Yeah.
[28:39.720 --> 28:40.720]  The scum is coming.
[28:40.720 --> 28:41.720]  You don't.
[28:41.720 --> 28:46.000]  The California state court said parents, you don't, you aren't the parents.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.320]  It says the state owns your children and we're going to carry eugenics out against you.
[28:51.320 --> 28:57.840]  The CPS was set up 100 years ago by the British to carry out eugenics operations and listen,
[28:57.840 --> 28:59.960]  it's all terrorism.
[28:59.960 --> 29:01.400]  You would have already had your child kidnapped.
[29:01.400 --> 29:03.000]  You just never let them in.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.480]  Just don't ever let them just stay calm with them.
[29:05.480 --> 29:09.400]  Remember that their, their pieces of filth and just call me on the air if you have any
[29:09.400 --> 29:10.400]  other problems.
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.400]  All right.
[29:11.400 --> 29:12.400]  I appreciate it.
[29:12.400 --> 29:13.880]  You don't worry about those hardcore criminals.
[29:13.880 --> 29:14.880]  Okay.
[29:14.880 --> 29:15.880]  They're scum.
[29:15.880 --> 29:16.880]  They're filth.
[29:16.880 --> 29:21.480]  And we're going to rise up against them and defeat them.

[33:37.720 --> 33:47.280]  Yeah, I want to explain something everybody out there listening why I got so angry during
[33:47.280 --> 33:48.280]  the last segment.
[33:48.280 --> 33:53.920]  I'm going to tell you one story of thousands that are declassified.
[33:53.920 --> 33:56.280]  One story.
[33:56.280 --> 34:03.000]  The Department of Child Services, they have different names, different states, kidnapped
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  over 4,000 children in the 1940s and 1950s.
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.080]  This is all on the Atomic Energy Agency website, Department of Energy websites here in the
[34:12.080 --> 34:15.320]  U.S. But internationally they reported as well.
[34:15.320 --> 34:21.000]  They took the small children and radiated them to death in radiation chambers.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  That's your government.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  I'm sorry if you don't want to hear it.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.400]  I can give you over a thousand stories of them taking our troops into chambers and nerve
[34:28.400 --> 34:31.280]  gassing them to death in the 90s.
[34:31.280 --> 34:35.920]  That was to test and see if the U.S. Army will murder our own troops.
[34:35.920 --> 34:40.720]  One time I had one of Governor Perry's top people.
[34:40.720 --> 34:42.200]  You see the guy on TV with him all the time.
[34:42.200 --> 34:44.680]  In fact, the guy who gave me his card, I need to get him on.
[34:44.680 --> 34:47.920]  He admitted, he said, oh, yeah, the governor's not all bad, but I know you're telling the
[34:47.920 --> 34:49.720]  truth here in your film in-game.
[34:49.720 --> 34:50.720]  He just seen in-game.
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.720]  He goes, you know, I was at Fort Sam Houston as a medic and they brought in the Special
[34:54.720 --> 34:56.720]  Forces guy from Bragg.
[34:56.720 --> 35:01.000]  They've been in the medical facility to give him shots and they all died in three days.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.960]  Then it was a bio weapons test.
[35:02.960 --> 35:03.960]  They were murdered.
[35:03.960 --> 35:05.360]  You know, he wasn't part of it.
[35:05.360 --> 35:08.040]  He just said they were taken there and killed right in front of him.
[35:08.040 --> 35:14.640]  They had to go into decontamination suits and clean out the barracks and that just
[35:14.640 --> 35:15.640]  how it works.
[35:15.640 --> 35:23.320]  I mean, we have people running things that openly will murder you at the drop of a hat.
[35:23.320 --> 35:25.880]  And you see, that kind of makes me not sleep at night.
[35:25.880 --> 35:34.120]  That makes me as someone of aggressive guy, I haven't been gilded, I haven't been neutered.
[35:34.120 --> 35:35.800]  I get threatened by that and I get angry.
[35:35.800 --> 35:41.440]  So a father calls in to tell the story I've heard a million times and says, yeah, they
[35:41.440 --> 35:44.160]  wouldn't take my son in the public school because I wouldn't take the shots and they
[35:44.160 --> 35:45.160]  told me I was a liar.
[35:45.160 --> 35:46.640]  There was no federal or state law.
[35:46.640 --> 35:51.440]  There's both for a waiver form, but it's a waiver to a law that doesn't even exist and
[35:51.440 --> 35:53.160]  that by law they're supposed to give you the waiver.
[35:53.160 --> 35:59.320]  That's really the only law that the school through its policy is demanding it without
[35:59.320 --> 36:04.440]  law that they have to give you the waiver and they lie everywhere.
[36:04.440 --> 36:07.000]  You'll watch school starting in next year and they'll say it's the law.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  You'll be arrested.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.280]  Total lie.
[36:09.280 --> 36:13.280]  You can type Texas vaccine waiver, you know, New York vaccine waiver.
[36:13.280 --> 36:14.280]  They'll be on the state website.
[36:14.280 --> 36:18.280]  You'll find out and they'll say there is no law, but if the school is giving you trouble,
[36:18.280 --> 36:24.000]  you know, print this off and give it to them.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.720]  But I have been there in the court cases in Austin where they steal people's children
[36:27.720 --> 36:30.280]  for not giving them shots and they don't care.
[36:30.280 --> 36:32.560]  There's no law in these family courts.
[36:32.560 --> 36:38.840]  They set up through eugenics in England about 110 years ago, the U.S. about 95 years ago.
[36:38.840 --> 36:47.720]  They would, in my film, we have little newsreels and little clips of the family courts that
[36:47.720 --> 36:54.720]  were set up for eugenics in the early 30s where they're sterilizing women.
[36:54.720 --> 36:56.600]  See, there's no jury.
[36:56.600 --> 36:57.800]  There's no habeas corpus.
[36:57.800 --> 37:02.040]  There's no, you murdered somebody so you're going to prison.
[37:02.040 --> 37:04.040]  It's just we're a kangaroo court.
[37:04.040 --> 37:08.800]  We have men that have guns that enforce for us and that's the end of it.
[37:08.800 --> 37:15.520]  So I hear about these creatures circling a family, like sharks, circling a family.
[37:15.520 --> 37:21.040]  Like huge sharks around a tiny lifeboat and they're fins and the family's scared.
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.160]  I think about their horror and I empathize with them and my primitive level is a warrior
[37:25.160 --> 37:27.560]  I want to defend them.
[37:27.560 --> 37:32.760]  And I just think about how this evil is going on everywhere.
[37:32.760 --> 37:37.080]  I think about how wicked this government is, how criminal it is, the things it's committing
[37:37.080 --> 37:46.280]  to us right now and just how evil they are.
[37:46.280 --> 37:50.680]  How they show up with the police and the CPS with no warrant, no bill particulars, nothing.
[37:50.680 --> 37:55.560]  They're just there to threaten and force their way in.
[37:55.560 --> 38:02.800]  And hey, you know what cops, you commit that crime and go with that extra jiu-jitsu fascist
[38:02.800 --> 38:06.680]  and you go to a house and you commit those crimes, you bet you're a jackbooth thug and
[38:06.680 --> 38:09.240]  I hope God curses you straight to Hades itself.
[38:09.240 --> 38:10.240]  I do.
[38:10.240 --> 38:11.880]  You keep your hands off the kids.
[38:11.880 --> 38:15.800]  Now if you're a good cop and don't go along with that, you're going to be fired.
[38:15.800 --> 38:19.120]  But I mean, I'm not going to sit here and kiss your hind end anymore.
[38:19.120 --> 38:20.120]  It's over.
[38:20.120 --> 38:23.360]  Now I said I wasn't going to take a lot of calls today, but I have the police in Denver
[38:23.360 --> 38:24.840]  as we reported to you two months ago.
[38:24.840 --> 38:28.520]  I don't need the Denver Post to tell me this.
[38:28.520 --> 38:34.200]  Probe into police stage DC DNC protest.
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.800]  Another one here ACLU once probing the police stage DC DNC protest and it says right here
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.320]  cops went in and attacked other cops for the news cameras that first day in Denver and
[38:46.320 --> 38:48.800]  I reported that sucker was staged.
[38:48.800 --> 38:54.600]  I mean, number one, little bitty scrawny anarchist or a huge six foot two guys with
[38:54.600 --> 38:55.600]  Johnny at arms.
[38:55.600 --> 38:57.480]  I mean, I've been at these events over and over again.
[38:57.480 --> 38:59.080]  Here come the cops dressed up.
[38:59.080 --> 39:00.440]  They want to ban the protest.
[39:00.440 --> 39:02.320]  They want to attack the First Amendment.
[39:02.320 --> 39:03.320]  They stage events.
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.720]  I mean, number one, I'm not an idiot.
[39:07.720 --> 39:09.720]  And we've caught you over and over again.
[39:09.720 --> 39:16.920]  I don't forget in Austin, was it 98 or 99?
[39:16.920 --> 39:19.920]  They had the Fortune 500 meeting in 98 or 99.
[39:19.920 --> 39:22.600]  I think it was 99 in downtown Austin.
[39:22.600 --> 39:24.920]  There were these giant anarchist huge cops.
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.960]  One was like six foot six, probably weighed 300 pounds.
[39:28.960 --> 39:31.320]  They were starting fights, pushing people.
[39:31.320 --> 39:33.000]  And I said, these are cops media.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  These are cops.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.040]  This is not us.
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.240]  And then all these cops ran across the street and they said back off Jones and they pulled
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.960]  those two guys out and stuck two more cops in to start fights and stuff.
[39:44.960 --> 39:50.520]  But since we had video cameras on them, they had to back off.
[39:50.520 --> 39:56.200]  Now again, why would the Austin police want to stop people protesting and set a precedent
[39:56.200 --> 39:58.520]  to ban it?
[39:58.520 --> 40:01.280]  Why would they want to go all over the city and lose scores of lawsuits?
[40:01.280 --> 40:04.280]  The city of Austin, it's up to like, what, $10 million?
[40:04.280 --> 40:08.280]  Last time I checked on lawsuits, they've lost for coming up to people protesting peacefully
[40:08.280 --> 40:11.360]  on the street corner and arresting them saying, you got to have a permit for that.
[40:11.360 --> 40:12.360]  No, you don't.
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.520]  And so taxpayers of Austin had to pay that.
[40:16.520 --> 40:20.440]  Why does the city of Austin police hate the First Amendment?
[40:20.440 --> 40:21.960]  Why do you want to stop it?
[40:21.960 --> 40:24.800]  Why do your higher ups order you to do this?
[40:24.800 --> 40:26.600]  Why do you carry this out?
[40:26.600 --> 40:32.200]  Why do you go out and pose as demonstrators to attack other cops?
[40:32.200 --> 40:33.200]  Most of the time it's rigged.
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.920]  In Seattle, they had cops break bottles over cops heads and I interviewed the cops there
[40:37.920 --> 40:41.080]  and I filmed police at the takeover and they're like, yeah, I found them later.
[40:41.080 --> 40:48.120]  Those were cops and I was ordered to stand there and let them throw bottles at me.
[40:48.120 --> 40:49.120]  Nobody's throwing a bottle at me.
[40:49.120 --> 40:52.120]  I mean, I want to get that out in the open here.
[40:52.120 --> 40:57.240]  You know, police, you should think you're lucky stars for people like Alex Chodes because
[40:57.240 --> 41:07.000]  I'm here on air decrying police being asked to engage in crime, to engage in corrupt things.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.560]  So the message is things are far more corrupt than you know.
[41:11.560 --> 41:15.560]  They're far worse than you know.
[41:15.560 --> 41:19.840]  And the public are a bunch of idiots and don't know what's happening on average.
[41:19.840 --> 41:24.360]  And I don't know when I said I take calls the whole show and I haven't hardly done that.
[41:24.360 --> 41:29.320]  Let's talk to, let's talk to Robert in Colorado.
[41:29.320 --> 41:30.320]  You're on the air, Robert.
[41:30.320 --> 41:32.720]  Well, hello, Alexander here, McJones.
[41:32.720 --> 41:33.720]  Thanks for taking my call.
[41:33.720 --> 41:34.720]  I do appreciate that.
[41:34.720 --> 41:37.000]  A couple of things.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.160]  Thank you for several things.
[41:38.160 --> 41:40.240]  Number one, thanks for what you do.
[41:40.240 --> 41:46.360]  I appreciate you standing in the gap as a good book says and finding a good fight.
[41:46.360 --> 41:48.240]  Thank you for installing that call in number.
[41:48.240 --> 41:51.040]  You can listen to 512-646-5000.
[41:51.040 --> 41:52.040]  That's pretty cool and pretty handy.
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.200]  You can call them any phone, listen to your show if you can't get to the computer.
[41:57.200 --> 42:00.520]  Ignore the attacks calling you a bigot because you're the farthest thing but you're just
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.640]  a man who cares about society and you're manly and tries to do the right thing.
[42:04.640 --> 42:07.160]  So people who call you a bigot are just small minded.
[42:07.160 --> 42:08.720]  Well, I mean, that's the new thing.
[42:08.720 --> 42:11.200]  You're called a communist if you're against Bush.
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.040]  And then if you criticize Obama according to the media, he can do no wrong.
[42:16.040 --> 42:17.880]  And so it's only because he's black.
[42:17.880 --> 42:21.680]  It's not that you don't want to have your kids in a draft or compulsory service yourself
[42:21.680 --> 42:22.680]  or be a slave.
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.160]  If you're against being a slave to the federal government, that's what he's openly stated.
[42:26.160 --> 42:27.600]  It's coming up in the next hour.
[42:27.600 --> 42:29.640]  You are now against the Messiah.
[42:29.640 --> 42:34.200]  And Obama's a bad guy and we haven't seen the worst thing yet.
[42:34.200 --> 42:38.080]  But what happened in Alaska with baggage versus Stevens?
[42:38.080 --> 42:40.160]  How did that Senate race play out?
[42:40.160 --> 42:41.160]  Do you know?
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.680]  I know Stevens, the criminal, I heard him defended here locally, got convicted on all
[42:45.680 --> 42:46.680]  seven counts.
[42:46.680 --> 42:48.800]  I believe baggage one, didn't he?
[42:48.800 --> 42:49.800]  Did he?
[42:49.800 --> 42:50.800]  Okay.
[42:50.800 --> 42:51.800]  I wasn't sure.
[42:51.800 --> 42:52.800]  I knew it was somewhere close.
[42:52.800 --> 42:57.480]  Well, no, just go to Google and type in Alaska Senate race and we'll find out the numbers.
[42:57.480 --> 42:58.720]  I appreciate your call.
[42:58.720 --> 43:03.000]  You know, we're going to come back and I'm going to get to your calls.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  I just start talking about all the crimes I know that illegitimate criminal government
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.480]  commits every day.
[43:11.480 --> 43:12.480]  It's now institutionalized.
[43:12.480 --> 43:17.280]  I mean, they just commit crime right out in the open and just, yeah, yeah, we're dealing
[43:17.280 --> 43:18.280]  the drugs.
[43:18.280 --> 43:21.760]  Yeah, we're posing as anarchists and starting fights so we can ban protests.
[43:21.760 --> 43:26.760]  Yeah, we're taking people's kids with no warrants or no probable cause and yeah, a lot of them
[43:26.760 --> 43:30.440]  died in our custody, but so what?
[43:30.440 --> 43:35.280]  Led from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings, vaccines, arsenic
[43:35.280 --> 43:36.280]  in the water.
[43:36.280 --> 43:40.120]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[43:40.120 --> 43:44.080]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[43:44.080 --> 43:48.040]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure,
[43:48.040 --> 43:52.240]  including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders,
[43:52.240 --> 43:55.720]  neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[43:55.720 --> 43:59.840]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and
[43:59.840 --> 44:01.880]  potentially deadly toxins.
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.320]  That's why there's puricleer from Ripple Creek puricleer contains a proprietary blend
[44:06.320 --> 44:11.080]  of ingredients including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid, among other ingredients
[44:11.080 --> 44:14.400]  formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[44:14.400 --> 44:18.840]  Puricleer also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity
[44:18.840 --> 44:22.760]  so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.

[44:30.160 --> 44:35.560]  With the days getting shorter and the nights getting longer, being out after dark increases
[44:35.560 --> 44:39.480]  your odds of being mugged, assaulted, or even worse.
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.600]  Studies show 45% of violent crimes happen after dark.
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.920]  No matter where you are, being unprepared in the wrong place at the wrong time can be
[44:48.920 --> 44:50.720]  extremely dangerous.

[46:47.360 --> 46:49.000]  removal of secondhand smoke.
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.440]  Padotors, you name it.
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.000]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone do?
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.720]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[46:58.720 --> 47:01.040]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[47:01.040 --> 47:04.560]  IonicZone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.920]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which study

[47:29.080 --> 47:39.080]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[47:39.080 --> 47:51.040]  Yeah, Barack Obama wants to bring in to place with Bill Clinton and George Bush.
[47:51.040 --> 47:54.040]  Both have called for National Compulsory Service.
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.560]  They've got bills introduced for that to make you join the military.
[47:58.560 --> 48:04.920]  The new chief of staff wants to make you join the military for one year and, of course,
[48:04.920 --> 48:07.120]  be a slave, the slave master Obama.
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.760]  But because I don't want to be his slave, I mean, you can't have a black guy who's
[48:10.760 --> 48:11.760]  for slavery.
[48:11.760 --> 48:14.520]  Funny, it was black selling blacks on all the slave ships.
[48:14.520 --> 48:18.320]  We've got slavery worldwide over and over again by every group, slaving.
[48:18.320 --> 48:21.200]  I mean, Rome enslaved mainly white people.
[48:21.200 --> 48:22.640]  See, folks don't know that.
[48:22.640 --> 48:27.200]  They think, well, you know, if Obama says the government's going to own me, that's great.
[48:27.200 --> 48:30.120]  You got all these people saying, well, I don't have to worry about my bills anymore if you
[48:30.120 --> 48:31.120]  heard these clips.
[48:31.120 --> 48:32.880]  I don't have to worry about my taxes anymore.
[48:32.880 --> 48:35.680]  My whole future's solved with Obama.
[48:35.680 --> 48:39.520]  Meanwhile, with the bailout, he's just giving all the money to foreign banks and laughing
[48:39.520 --> 48:40.720]  at you.
[48:40.720 --> 48:46.120]  And he's keeping all the bankers on from the Bush takeover plan with his policy.
[48:46.120 --> 48:47.760]  But just get ready.
[48:47.760 --> 48:48.760]  Find out for yourself.
[48:48.760 --> 48:52.360]  And then when they, when you finally wake up that Obama's bad, they'll give you a Republican
[48:52.360 --> 48:56.360]  and then you'll get fooled by that again and take a few years to figure that out.
[48:56.360 --> 48:57.920]  It's the new world order.
[48:57.920 --> 49:03.680]  They own both the parties and until we turn that around, you know, all these smiley corporate
[49:03.680 --> 49:05.760]  faces are going to keep fooling us.
[49:05.760 --> 49:08.200]  I mean, look at that insincere.
[49:08.200 --> 49:09.200]  I'm holding up time.
[49:09.200 --> 49:13.840]  This is Newsweek with Barack Obama, President 44 on there.
[49:13.840 --> 49:14.840]  Just totally insincere.
[49:14.840 --> 49:19.560]  But it doesn't matter, you got to find out and as long as you feel good about yourself
[49:19.560 --> 49:20.560]  while you're being screwed.
[49:20.560 --> 49:27.160]  So what, you know, land of the delusional Prozac heads, no longer land of the freedom
[49:27.160 --> 49:33.400]  of the brain, which is land of the delusional land of the lied to land of the PR addicted.
[49:33.400 --> 49:35.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in DC.
[49:35.600 --> 49:36.600]  You're on the air, Steve.
[49:36.600 --> 49:37.600]  Go ahead.
[49:37.600 --> 49:44.280]  Hey, Alex, um, I'm black myself and to be quite honest, Obama is a piece of trash.
[49:44.280 --> 49:50.360]  I mean, I have a friend from Nigeria and he doesn't support Obama because he's seen this
[49:50.360 --> 49:53.040]  back there and it's nothing new.
[49:53.040 --> 50:00.440]  But I did want to ask you, have you seen, um, Obama's Jesus statue in Chicago and supposedly
[50:00.440 --> 50:07.880]  his hands are in the same position as a baffle met is it's, uh, as above so below.
[50:07.880 --> 50:13.480]  And also if you know that's the same one that the famous George Washington, um, statue
[50:13.480 --> 50:15.720]  were one hands above one hands below.
[50:15.720 --> 50:16.720]  Yeah.
[50:16.720 --> 50:17.720]  Yeah.
[50:17.720 --> 50:21.320]  I know I haven't seen the Obama statue saying he's Jesus, but I've seen all these headlines
[50:21.320 --> 50:25.920]  and articles in the mainstream corporate press that told us that Iraq had aluminum tubes
[50:25.920 --> 50:30.520]  and uranium and WMDs and carried out 9 11 and the same corporate press that told us
[50:30.520 --> 50:34.720]  George Bush was a great guy is now calling him the one.
[50:34.720 --> 50:39.600]  And I feel so sorry for all these folks, not just black folks, but I mean white folks think
[50:39.600 --> 50:45.280]  everybody thinks I mean, you know, 30 40% of the population thinks that literally God
[50:45.280 --> 50:48.280]  has arrived and I got news for you folks.
[50:48.280 --> 50:53.080]  He's just got a different paint job than George Bush and people better get ready because it's
[50:53.080 --> 50:57.520]  the same thing under the hood and people better get ready for the new world order.
[50:57.520 --> 51:05.600]  I mean, Barack Obama out of the gates is going to have carbon taxes, youth brigades handing
[51:05.600 --> 51:08.160]  everything over to the bankers, more wars.
[51:08.160 --> 51:10.480]  He's announcing is going to go into other countries.
[51:10.480 --> 51:12.840]  I mean, I don't know how people think this has changed.
[51:12.840 --> 51:14.600]  That's what I'm asking Steve.
[51:14.600 --> 51:15.600]  Yeah.
[51:15.600 --> 51:19.040]  My last statement is Obama has his true squad.
[51:19.040 --> 51:24.080]  Why isn't he denouncing all the calls for him to be this Messiah or Jesus?
[51:24.080 --> 51:28.560]  Supposedly, they're supposed to catch these things that aren't true, but he's not addressing
[51:28.560 --> 51:29.560]  these issues.
[51:29.560 --> 51:32.200]  So I guess he is accepting his Godhood.
[51:32.200 --> 51:38.000]  Well, I mean, if you go to his websites, they talk about him being the one, the answer.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.760]  He ran TV ads where they're, I mean, get ready folks.
[51:41.760 --> 51:47.800]  I've never seen the media so behind somebody and again, they're not liberal.
[51:47.800 --> 51:48.800]  They're not conservative.
[51:48.800 --> 51:49.800]  All the liberal media.
[51:49.800 --> 51:50.800]  What do you expect?
[51:50.800 --> 51:51.800]  It's not liberal.
[51:51.800 --> 51:53.480]  They're owned by the military industrial complex.
[51:53.480 --> 51:56.000]  Well, sir, I am so sad.
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.560]  I wish because, I mean, on the surface, frankly, I'm tired of racism and classism and infighting.
[52:01.560 --> 52:04.560]  Man, I would love it if we had a black president who was anti-new world order.
[52:04.560 --> 52:06.000]  I love it if the guy had green skin.
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  I don't care.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.920]  And, but, but now I think it's going to increase all the race fighting and all this because
[52:11.920 --> 52:16.440]  now it's going to all be about, oh, you just don't like him because he's black or, well,
[52:16.440 --> 52:21.880]  no, look, he is bad because he's black and then it's just going to, I mean, every angle
[52:21.880 --> 52:26.280]  I look at this, instead of it being about the issues or about who's funding him or
[52:26.280 --> 52:30.240]  who's behind him, it's all going to be about what color he is.
[52:30.240 --> 52:33.640]  And that's why the new world order loves it so much because it's the perfect distraction.
[52:33.640 --> 52:34.640]  Perfect distraction, Steve.
[52:34.640 --> 52:37.080]  I mean, what are other folks saying in D.C.?
[52:37.080 --> 52:40.840]  Oh, well, basically, my coworkers asked me, um, was I voting?
[52:40.840 --> 52:41.840]  I told them no.
[52:41.840 --> 52:46.800]  I really wanted to vote, but I just was just so down about the whole issue.
[52:46.800 --> 52:52.600]  When I told them I wasn't voting, they looked like I, I committed a blasphemy myself and
[52:52.600 --> 52:57.520]  I told them I wasn't supporting Barack Obama because he was the same as he is the same
[52:57.520 --> 52:58.520]  as Bush.
[52:58.520 --> 53:04.880]  I voted for Lock and Step, voted for Patriot Act, uh, funding of the war in Iraq, different
[53:04.880 --> 53:05.880]  issues.
[53:05.880 --> 53:08.600]  And basically I've gotten the silent treatment at work.
[53:08.600 --> 53:13.440]  So I've learned it's best not to blaspheme against Obama, I suppose.
[53:13.440 --> 53:14.440]  Well that's it.
[53:14.440 --> 53:17.200]  You know, maybe you should just slowly educate them and explain, hey, I'm not for George
[53:17.200 --> 53:18.200]  Bush.
[53:18.200 --> 53:20.320]  Do you know what corporate PR is?
[53:20.320 --> 53:25.920]  Like a car commercial or a, or a, or a soft drink ad, you know, this is corporate PR like
[53:25.920 --> 53:28.240]  diamonds forever, the beers.
[53:28.240 --> 53:32.760]  You know, I mean, again, the American people aren't aware they're being showered.
[53:32.760 --> 53:36.840]  They're being bombarded with propaganda.
[53:36.840 --> 53:40.800]  And then they're convinced propaganda doesn't exist instead of looking at what somebody
[53:40.800 --> 53:41.800]  actually does.
[53:41.800 --> 53:46.160]  But bottom line, again, they love Obama because he makes it look like we're going to have
[53:46.160 --> 53:47.160]  change.
[53:47.160 --> 53:51.960]  Meanwhile, the whole new order agenda continues and I appreciate your call, sir.
[53:51.960 --> 53:59.000]  And you know what, oh man, I mean, any way you cut this, we're in trouble.
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.680]  People say, well, why didn't you vote for McCain?
[54:00.680 --> 54:06.840]  Because I can't endorse eight years of George Bush and lying and warmongering.
[54:06.840 --> 54:10.800]  I can't go along with all of this.
[54:10.800 --> 54:12.800]  I didn't vote for Obama either.
[54:12.800 --> 54:18.000]  I'm not going to be part of this anymore to understand folks that the police are still
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.640]  going to stage riots.
[54:19.640 --> 54:22.840]  The government's still going to ship heroin and cocaine in, they're still going to arrest
[54:22.840 --> 54:26.320]  people and secretly torture them to death and torture them for confessions.
[54:26.320 --> 54:29.320]  They're still going to hand trillions of dollars of the foreign private banks.
[54:29.320 --> 54:33.520]  It's just now, instead of people not trusting George Bush, knowing he's a lion's scumbag,
[54:33.520 --> 54:37.840]  after eight years to figure it out, the new old orders put on a new set of tires.
[54:37.840 --> 54:40.160]  They've put on a new birdcage liner.
[54:40.160 --> 54:41.480]  They have put out another distraction.
[54:41.480 --> 54:43.120]  It's so simple.
[54:43.120 --> 54:44.720]  And our caller from DC gets it.
[54:44.720 --> 54:45.720]  Other people don't.
[54:45.720 --> 54:47.720]  JD in Mississippi, you're on the air, JD.
[54:47.720 --> 54:50.800]  The truth is stranger than fiction, my friend.
[54:50.800 --> 54:51.800]  It is.
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.480]  I just wanted to run past you a few things.
[54:55.480 --> 55:02.160]  First, on November 22nd, there's going to be a in the fed national protest.
[55:02.160 --> 55:06.800]  It's going to be all over the Federal Reserve, places around the United States.
[55:06.800 --> 55:07.800]  That's right.
[55:07.800 --> 55:09.720]  It's got 12 regional banks and Gary French.
[55:09.720 --> 55:10.720]  He's heading that up.
[55:10.720 --> 55:15.480]  People should go out and protest the private Federal Reserve.
[55:15.480 --> 55:16.760]  That's the real government.
[55:16.760 --> 55:18.400]  Not Barack Obama, folks.
[55:18.400 --> 55:21.920]  Under the banker takeover bill, they were given governmental power.
[55:21.920 --> 55:22.920]  Exactly.
[55:22.920 --> 55:27.840]  And where I'm me being here in North Mississippi, we're going to be up in Memphis.
[55:27.840 --> 55:31.840]  It just got me a Gadsden flag to take up.
[55:31.840 --> 55:32.840]  Take up there.
[55:32.840 --> 55:33.840]  This is don't tread on me.
[55:33.840 --> 55:36.040]  It's got the coil snake on it.
[55:36.040 --> 55:38.800]  We're going to be up there filming it, trying to bullhorn them.
[55:38.800 --> 55:41.680]  There's going to be a Nashville all over.
[55:41.680 --> 55:44.280]  I'd like to see it international.
[55:44.280 --> 55:47.840]  Well it is going to be international because they have the same private families that
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.640]  on the Federal Reserve, on the Bank of England and the Bundesbank in Germany and others,
[55:51.640 --> 55:52.640]  it is the same.
[55:52.640 --> 55:56.120]  By the way, they're the ones openly announcing world government run by the bankers.
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.600]  They engineer the crisis and say, the answer is setting up a world government we run.
[56:00.600 --> 56:03.360]  We're going to give you a carbon tax on everything you do.
[56:03.360 --> 56:06.600]  They have all these idiot school kids go out and, yeah, ban carbon.
[56:06.600 --> 56:10.320]  There's nothing to do with hurting the environment, put plants, breathe.
[56:10.320 --> 56:13.600]  By the way, the earth is getting cooler now because the sun just cooled off.
[56:13.600 --> 56:15.320]  It's a normal to have climate change.
[56:15.320 --> 56:17.840]  Now they're not saying we've got to stop global warming.
[56:17.840 --> 56:19.800]  Now it's climate change.
[56:19.800 --> 56:22.240]  Pretty soon, it's a conspiracy theory.
[56:22.240 --> 56:24.200]  There are no seasons.
[56:24.200 --> 56:29.240]  The old timers claim that once the earth temperatures change, but not anymore.
[56:29.240 --> 56:31.880]  That's a lie of al-Qaeda.
[56:31.880 --> 56:33.040]  Al-Qaeda tells you there are seasons.
[56:33.040 --> 56:36.600]  Al-Qaeda tells you some decades are cold, some are hot.
[56:36.600 --> 56:38.600]  Some winters cold, some not.
[56:38.600 --> 56:39.600]  Some moderate.
[56:39.600 --> 56:40.600]  That's a lie of al-Qaeda.
[56:40.600 --> 56:47.520]  If you question that, the great lawgiver, Lord Obama, sends you to the love camp.
[56:47.520 --> 56:49.880]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[56:49.880 --> 56:52.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Tennessee.
[56:52.360 --> 56:54.320]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[56:54.320 --> 56:55.320]  Welcome.
[56:55.320 --> 56:56.320]  How are you doing, Alex?
[56:56.320 --> 56:57.720]  Got a bit of a cold, but I'm good.
[56:57.720 --> 56:58.720]  Go ahead.
[56:58.720 --> 56:59.720]  That's why I sound a bit different.
[56:59.720 --> 57:00.720]  Hey, Alex.
[57:00.720 --> 57:01.720]  I'm a soldier.
[57:01.720 --> 57:06.080]  I've been calling you on your show for about two years.
[57:06.080 --> 57:10.560]  I think honestly, even though Obama won, and I don't agree with him at all, but the
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.480]  best thing I think could have happened to our movement is that, because there are so
[57:15.480 --> 57:19.840]  many conservatives that used to snicker at me and laugh at me at work, you know, I'm
[57:19.840 --> 57:20.840]  around a lot.
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.200]  I'm in a special operations unit, and I don't support Bush.
[57:24.200 --> 57:25.200]  I don't support McCain.
[57:25.200 --> 57:29.200]  And now suddenly they're worried about FEMA, and they're worried about youth brigades.
[57:29.200 --> 57:35.360]  I had a female captain come up to me on Friday at the gym, come up going, you know, we're
[57:35.360 --> 57:36.920]  all going to die now.
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.440]  And I'm like, yeah, welcome to my nightmare.
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.080]  I've been telling you about Obama for a year, you know.
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.720]  So I had a story, it's kind of positive about something I learned from you.
[57:46.720 --> 57:50.600]  I'm an NCO in the Army, and there's a lot of good people.
[57:50.600 --> 57:52.320]  Listen, can you stay there through the news?
[57:52.320 --> 57:53.320]  Yes, sir.
[57:53.320 --> 57:54.320]  I can.
[57:54.320 --> 57:55.320]  I promise we'll go to you.
[57:55.320 --> 57:56.840]  I mean, it's so childish.
[57:56.840 --> 58:01.040]  Frankly, I don't even feel like being here most days, because why do I have to explain
[58:01.040 --> 58:05.400]  to the audience, not my listeners, but other people, you know, on AM and FM listening,
[58:05.400 --> 58:07.520]  that it isn't about George Bush or Obama.
[58:07.520 --> 58:11.080]  Honestly, guys don't run anything.
[58:11.080 --> 58:12.240]  They're cutouts, folks.
[58:12.240 --> 58:13.740]  They're fronts.
[58:13.740 --> 58:18.520]  We're talking about what's going on in the back room, the big boys, the bankers.
[58:18.520 --> 58:19.520]  Stay with me.
[58:19.520 --> 58:20.800]  We can save the Republic together.
[58:20.800 --> 58:25.120]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[59:21.400 --> 59:26.000]  SurvivalProperty.com Longtime survivalist author Ragnar Benson wrote,
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.600]  A survival retreat is a place you go to live, not die.
[59:29.600 --> 59:33.680]  It is a place out of the mainstream of events that contains the means to survive without
[59:33.680 --> 59:34.920]  outside support.
[59:34.920 --> 59:40.800]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine and warmth you prepared
[59:40.800 --> 59:42.000]  for yourself.
[59:42.000 --> 59:46.440]  It is defensible and is put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers
[59:46.440 --> 59:47.440]  will be.
[59:47.440 --> 59:50.520]  Ragnar Benson also said, Why retreat?
[59:50.520 --> 59:55.000]  This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer.
[59:55.000 --> 59:59.720]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they
[59:59.720 --> 1:00:00.800]  are now.
[1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:05.120]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat, something completely impossible
[1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:07.400]  for the average American to do.
[1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:09.280]  Act now before it's too late.

[1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:32.320]  It is fun.
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:38.000]  Hi, all in USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.640]  President-elect Obama's transition chief suggests the incoming administration may take a page
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.680]  from the outgoing one to get some things done faster.
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:50.800]  John Podesta tells Fox News Sunday a review is underway of executive orders on stem-cell
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:53.760]  research, oil and gas drilling, and other matters.
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:58.840]  He also says the current administration must work on new legislation to aid the economy.
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:05.760]  The job is up to President Bush to move that legislation forward and try to keep economic
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:06.760]  recovery moving.
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:11.720]  Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, says the ailing auto industry will need to be revived
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:13.320]  to keep the economy going.
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:17.560]  President-elect Obama has asked his economic team to look at different options of what
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:23.520]  it takes to help bridge the auto industry so they're a part of not only a revived economy,
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:27.720]  but part of an energy policy going forward where America is less dependent on foreign
[1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:28.720]  oil.
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:31.320]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:35.200]  When I first enrolled in the program, getting all those collection calls and letters, I'd
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:36.200]  get overwhelmed.
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.880]  And a couple of times, I called Panicky.
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:42.560]  Everyone at that professional of America just called me right down.
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:46.640]  How would you like to wipe out 30 to 60 percent of your credit card debt?
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:50.400]  There are secret programs most credit card companies won't tell you about that can allow
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:53.000]  a portion of your debt to be forgiven.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.520]  Debt professionals of America can help you avoid bankruptcy, save thousands, and get

[1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:12.400]  now live from Austin Texas here Alex Jones alright it's the second final hour I haven't
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:17.680]  even gotten into all my documentation clips of Obama Obama pulling it down off his site
[1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:25.800]  national compulsory service youth brigades gun confiscation brigades domestic spy teams
[1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:30.340]  I mean this is going to make Nazi Germany and Russia under the Soviets look like child's
[1:07:30.340 --> 1:07:35.640]  play they pulled this off as presidential website but we have it all right here I've
[1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:41.520]  got a bunch of economic news too and mainstream media is admitting that the chemicals in the
[1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:50.160]  one plastic age that became universal is sterilizing men all over the western world
[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:54.320]  so I want to warn folks about that coming up to but let's just go to your calls right
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:58.640]  now Jeremy in Tennessee says he's with special operations group in a special operations group
[1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:02.200]  and they couldn't wake up to the new world order he tried to warn them try to talk to
[1:08:02.200 --> 1:08:06.720]  them but that's impossible George Bush is a good Christian conservative but now because
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:11.200]  Obama's in office suddenly they're all worried and concerned and yes it's true cops and
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:17.200]  military generally when Democrats get in and kind of go with the left step see these are
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:21.360]  legs on the new world order they take a step of the left take a step of the right step
[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:26.320]  of the left step of the right right now it's a left step and a big step of Barack Obama
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:30.560]  but I've never seen and my mother you know been a liberal but a Democrat but you know
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:35.000]  woken up in the last few decades that doesn't mean becoming a conservative the point is she's
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:40.160]  woken up with a bigger paradigm she says I'm scared I'm concerned she said that I've never
[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:44.960]  seen them call somebody a Messiah the one the leader folks that's not what a free country
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:49.600]  does with the president but but anyways I digress the corporate system is doing that
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:54.400]  because they want him to do things they know we're going to be very unpopular go ahead
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:09:00.440]  and make the point you're saying he's a God send he will actually wake people up with
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:08.920]  his openly fascistic agenda yes yeah that's what I've seen I've had seen a lot of people
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:13.880]  freaking out in my area I had another comment to say about something I learned from you
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:18.520]  uh... as in shows when we get a long weekend we have to give a safety briefing to our lower
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:23.160]  and listed to make sure that over the weekend they don't do anything stupid but you know
[1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:27.760]  like drinking and driving or doing something that nature and uh... you know military believe
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:32.120]  or not we do a lot of good things because we get do the right thing preach to us so
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:37.200]  much so I had two soldiers on Friday night call me about two thirty in the morning to
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:41.120]  come pick them up because they have been drinking in their d.d. left them so I did the right
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:46.360]  thing went and got them and we were and they wanted to eat so we walked to the uh... restaurant
[1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:51.320]  which is only about seventy meters from where they were at and on the way back I had a cop
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:57.040]  pull over and was about to arrest us for walking on the side of the road yeah this is a country
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:02.840]  so free yeah so I I did what I learned from you by watching your movies I didn't stop
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:06.000]  even though he was telling me to stop because I hadn't done nothing wrong and I had not
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.240]  been drinking I just picking them up
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.320]  he called another police officer
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.020]  to make me stop
[1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:15.040]  and then they completely detained me
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:18.640]  and I told the cops straight to his face I wish I'd had a camera but I know this was
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:19.640]  going to happen
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.120]  but I told him what I learned from you is that hey you may beat the rap right now because
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:25.120]  you've got a gun in a badge in back up
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:28.200]  but you're not going to beat the ride and I told him straight to his face that I'm not
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:29.520]  going to sue Tennessee
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:32.560]  I'm not going to sue your police they want to sue you
[1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:36.160]  you know and I it took about twenty minutes but they finally just let us go
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:39.680]  but why why when you go protest today
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:43.320]  poses protesters and beat people up and then arrest everybody
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:47.120]  you know why do they come and say you can't walk down the street in America
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:49.480]  why are we treated like scum I mean
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:51.440]  and then why are we bad
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:55.160]  when we say we don't want you to do this to us
[1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:58.400]  I don't know but I told him that he was civilian I said you know
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:02.600]  need to get out of this mentality you're state funded you're not that you you are not
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.160]  calling you a civilian
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:08.560]  yeah and I said no I'm told me you you're a civilian I'm not a civilian
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:10.760]  it's all military nomenclature though
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:13.960]  well no I know the military is made up of the very best people
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:17.360]  in the country we have a lot of family and they're so gung-ho they love america so
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:18.120]  much
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:20.520]  and they're so blind though the programming
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:23.720]  I'm like don't you understand they're dismantling what the country is
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:25.880]  and a lot of cops are good too
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:28.800]  it's just they've been taught you've got the authority you've got to maintain
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:30.360]  control the situation
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:32.800]  you've got to keep these people in line
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.120]  and it's sad
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:37.080]  well the cop is so arrogant and so cocky with me
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:40.800]  I know it's disgusting I was saying sir and I was answering his questions but I
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:44.320]  like it so how did this end I mean did you say so I'm not allowed to not allowed to
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:46.680]  eat food in America just not allowed to be here

[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.160]  know hey what's your probable cause what are we doing wrong
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:54.720]  they asked for my driver's license I wouldn't give it to him I said tell me

[1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:56.920]  you know
[1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:00.200]  and they you know finally they just had to let us go because they realize man

[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:12.840]  they thought you were criminals or whatever
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:14.320]  the point is
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:15.440]  is that
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:17.840]  he should be glad because of you

[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:08.160]  g's guns and gm
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:12.280]  uh... today i went to the uh... gun show outside of comro texas
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:16.360]  and i mean to pay it was so crowded that you can hardly walk that record gun
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:18.840]  cells to spend the new york times never before
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:22.980]  have more guns around open sold because the people know
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:23.880]  and uh...
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:28.320]  let me ask you about me a a uh... one or two error in one car being uh...
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:28.960]  rifle
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:30.240]  thirty caliber
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:33.680]  it's not a pretty good choice for a defense weapon
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:37.200]  well i'm not like an armor or something from the army but uh... you have a
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:38.560]  little thirty cows
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:40.160]  that's good up close
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:43.120]  and it'll certainly uh... make somebody think twice they get it with a couple
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:44.320]  of those
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:49.240]  absolutely i mean i mean if i could have say one gun one rival
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:52.600]  it probably something like an m fourteen three oh eight
[1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:55.920]  well i've talked to several or two but better than they told me uh... that they
[1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:59.480]  were able to catch a machine guns because uh... they were good shots
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:02.160]  no no absolutely that's a good little lightweight
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:05.360]  and i mean something comparable to two two three range rifle
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:09.440]  yeah or a many fourteen i've got i've got one of those
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:12.040]  shot up some wild hogs this weekend with them
[1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:15.120]  and uh... the out the other gun i bought was an old west single action forty
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:16.760]  five long colt
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:19.840]  because i like the old cowboy guns is that uh...
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:21.680]  that another on that right
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:24.960]  there's nothing you know what it's all about your will right let's say you're
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:26.720]  defending the republic from enemies
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:30.760]  you can have any gun you want any handgun any rifle with a knife
[1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:32.000]  uh... you know just
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:36.340]  i mean so when it comes down to it yes those are wonderful firearms are
[1:15:36.340 --> 1:15:39.800]  and uh... but today guess what i try to find some forty five long colt uh...
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:42.760]  ammunition and it was totally sold out i could not believe it
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:46.080]  that forty five long colt that's a neat round
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:49.280]  it's also shoot the old uh... a little reaction right well that's what's good

[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:01.000]  right but it's a large amount
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.840]  and uh... let's just say this i love them all the death
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:07.920]  yeah i think uh... look like these parasites in government that want to
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:09.360]  make us their slaves
[1:16:09.360 --> 1:16:12.040]  and all their brainwashed jellyfish servants

[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:16.880]  they hate it that we're still on
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:20.800]  because that means we're not the new world orders total slaves yet

[1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:12.240]  terrorizes into giving them total governmental power and then looting our

[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:25.600]  a world government for and by the private banks where they will have
[1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:31.880]  control over all the nations of the world's finances and where they will
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:36.040]  regulate the stock markets when they're the ones that engineered all this and
[1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:39.760]  they're calling it a new world order and meanwhile the public's talking about
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:45.440]  you know Texas Tech and LSU or you know what happened with the Easter Bunny you
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:50.840]  know coming up and so all I can say is believe whatever you want say whatever

[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:37.360]  those are white guys that's not what this is just just mindlessness they can't
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:43.760]  even get their minds past that into real issues but you can't get the yuppies to

[1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:49.280]  happening but they were preconditioned that didn't exist so they just say

[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:26.400]  long time John and Austin you're on the air welcome hello John it's good to talk
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:32.040]  to all good good good hey I just want to say thanks for all the good work you're
[1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:36.880]  doing I know you're a very humble person I just want to throw a quote at you from
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:41.960]  Thomas Jefferson he said all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of
[1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:47.800]  good conscience to remain silent and you know the longer that silence is out
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:53.920]  there the we're gonna head down the doom and gloom that you've been not yeah the
[1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:58.960]  actual quote is I mean it was a great one you paraphrased is that all the
[1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:03.920]  evil men in tyranny to flourish is that good men do nothing right and boy look
[1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:07.400]  at tyranny flourishing because the public's looking at iPods and look at
[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:11.760]  the latest you know bling and they have no idea that systematic tyranny has
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:16.360]  come to our shores and I was watching the McLaughlin group this morning and
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:23.440]  they went into this little piece about the meeting on November the 14th or the
[1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:27.480]  15th World Economic Meeting and now the new Bretton Woods the end of the
[1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:32.040]  dollar basically right and so they started talking about globalization so I
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:36.440]  was thinking wow okay they're gonna discuss this right so they come back to
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:43.320]  the group and they said Brock's hands are tied on this one okay next topic you
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:47.400]  know the world of bats in the glory of Barack Obama now that's what they're
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:51.720]  saying is that both parties are not going to discuss it we're handing
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:56.280]  everything over including governmental power to private banks in England next
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:25:01.000]  story bye bye right right you know that's the McLaughlin yeah and I'm
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:07.560]  curious about the situation with the attorney general is there any any hope
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:13.680]  and I'll I'll get off here but it as far as as a real attorney general that's
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:19.120]  gonna come in there and take a 9-11 and no I mean usually our attorney generals
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:24.120]  are foreign intelligence operative so no and by the way I was wrong the last hour
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:28.720]  I didn't pay a lot of attention to Senate races and I knew that Ted Stevens and
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:34.080]  baggage were neck and neck and then I've seen baggage ahead in Alaska Ted
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:40.120]  Stevens with seven convictions is in the lead right now but it's still being
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:48.840]  contested so whatever there's the basics with that okay let's go ahead and talk
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:56.680]  to bode in Ohio do things bode well bode welcome hi
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:26:00.520]  peace to the world it's actually died and I could understand why they didn't
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:04.280]  quite it's all right I would welcome to the airwaves yes first of all I have to
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:09.120]  just let you know who you're speaking to I am an African-American male 51 years
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:14.200]  old and I have never supported Barack Obama and I am catching a lot of flak
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:18.280]  from both white and blacks out here in Columbus Ohio I bet the whites are
[1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:24.640]  really arrogant on power trips I'm not racist you are you don't like him what
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:28.320]  is so amazing is when I asked him any questions about what they know about him
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:33.000]  no one knows anything everybody's wearing t-shirts it is so crazy yeah all I
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:38.360]  know is he is more handsome than Bush and knows how to give a speech better but
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:43.040]  if you look at who runs him it's total new world order well when I start talking
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:46.880]  about the corporate dictatorship that we have in this country we've had for many
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:50.240]  many years and I start talking to him about the history that this country has
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:54.600]  been the history of this country has been fighting against central banks that's
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:59.240]  it and I break out so many different historical facts and people start really
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:03.080]  really really I said do you understand what why Lincoln was assassinated to
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:06.440]  understand why Andrew Jackson was attempted to be assassinated it's
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:10.280]  Kennedy had to do with the central bankers exactly that's it because if you
[1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:14.360]  control the issue with some money your king dog that matter what anybody does
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:18.560]  and they're to their two quotes which I throw out and people listen to me after
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:23.160]  I throw them out and one is a financial times attempt to be times of London
[1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:30.560]  editorial from 1863 which came out right after Lincoln decided to print
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:35.560]  greenbacks and they talk about the the directness of the of the new world order
[1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:39.600]  and it reads I'm gonna try to read this real quickly if this mischievous
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:43.360]  financial policy meeting right at meeting a government actually controlling
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:47.600]  its own currency which has its own which has its origin in North America shall
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.800]  become enduring down to a fixture then that government will furnish its own
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:58.560]  money without cost it will pay off debt and be without debt it will have all the
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:02.720]  money necessary to carry on its commerce it will become prosperous without
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:07.520]  precedent in the history of the world the brains and wealth of all countries
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:12.560]  will go to North America that country must be destroyed or will destroy every
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:17.120]  monarchy on the globe and that's from the times of London from 1863 it was in
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:23.000]  response to Lincoln printing greenbacks I know in fact I even sent off years ago
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:26.720]  I was making a banking documentary never finished for the real you know times of
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.960]  London and and that was really in there and the banking associations here were
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:34.960]  saying that and that's why Burr you know went out and killed Alexander Hamilton
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:38.360]  because he was trying to push that through absolutely that our whole
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:44.080]  country a whole world is run by these people and Obama is literally their man
[1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:50.200]  he he is he is such a puppet it is unbelievable and I don't it just really
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:54.280]  hurts me because as a black man growing up here in the United States of
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:59.960]  America you get a lot of messages that try to tell you and convince you that
[1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:04.840]  you're not a full-fledged citizen of the United States and I could tell you even

[1:33:51.320 --> 1:34:00.120]  week's election the 44th president Barack Obama yeah let me just say this
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:05.640]  what I hate about it is is that I love Bill support America's first you know
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:10.480]  president who's got African blood in because they let me wonderful the
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:14.200]  problem is I don't support any of these presidents since Kennedy they blew his
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:19.680]  head off he didn't play ball and we had bad presidents before that Woodrow
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:22.800]  Wilson started speaking out saying look I got conned by some private banks I
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:29.000]  didn't know this was a takeover suddenly they poison him he goes into a coma then
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:32.200]  he comes out of the coma and writes letters publicly exposing it again
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:36.520]  saying he thought he was poisoned I mean that's mainline information folks the
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:40.000]  average people though aren't aware even who Woodrow Wilson was he was our
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.040]  president back in 1913 when we got the private fellow reserve when we got the
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:49.040]  income tax and and you can read all the documents of the bankers books they wrote
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:56.040]  things they say they're doing it now and it's so painful because it is positive
[1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:00.840]  that people are getting along better that a lot of people I've talked to a lot
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:04.440]  of black folks and I know we're saying yeah man I you know I understand that
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:08.160]  Barack Obama is you know is owned by the very same people and quote owned by the
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:11.560]  man but you know at least it says that a whole bunch of white folks would have
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:15.600]  heard black guy and so there is that good news but let me tell you something
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:20.520]  here's the bad news when they are done with Barack Obama they're gonna blame
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:24.320]  everything on him just like George Bush it's bird cage liner they come in with a
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:28.920]  honeymoon they get a bunch done the New World Order bird soils everything and
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:33.960]  the bird cage liner gets blamed they pull that out and stick a new one in let
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:37.320]  me tell you for folks watching here locally in Austin on television on
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:43.200]  channel 10 you see this right here Barack Obama that's just bird cage liner
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:47.720]  they're just gonna place him up in there and the bird that's the New World Order
[1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:52.680]  is gonna do his business why don't we talk about the bird the creature that's
[1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:58.560]  doing this going back to our caller in Ohio I don't want to butcher his name
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:01.080]  again so I'll just let him state his name when he comes back on you had one
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:04.720]  more quote sir and you were talking about growing up the images of the
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:09.800]  bling the image of the culture the the the corporations pick out to try to
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:14.200]  stereotype black males especially I mean I'm putting words in your mouth that
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:17.880]  you were about to get to that versus what reality is and how you didn't listen
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:22.800]  to the propaganda and then you were going to continue go ahead exactly Alex
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:26.720]  I was really fortunate you know growing up in Newark, New Jersey I grew up in the
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:31.760]  east and my teachers that we had all the way through were exceptional and they
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:36.880]  really made sure we all were educated even the dumbest guy in my class would
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:41.840]  be an A student today and they cared about education and that was really out
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:46.480]  of the Eisenhower mode mode Eisenhower was such a key in all the things that
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:50.800]  happened for all of us going through the 60s and just even within my family
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:54.840]  thought it's been an oddity because I just never understood why other people
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:59.040]  in my own family saw things so differently to me because I really did
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:02.760]  believe the things that we were taught about being a United States citizen all
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:06.240]  the way through and I never thought I'd live to see the day that Russia would be
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:10.760]  telling my government not to start a war meaning that the Iraq war and they
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:15.520]  were absolutely right you know so I just really asked everyone out there
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:19.960]  regardless of what your group is to really understand the history of this
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:24.840]  great nation that we have and fully understand things before we speak and
[1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:28.760]  we need to get out there and challenge this government another point I wanted
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:32.200]  to make is that I've asked many people black and white if they knew who
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:36.520]  Christmas Attics was and most people don't even know I said so you're happy
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:40.280]  about having a black president and you don't even know the history of the
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:43.000]  of the revolution and who Christmas Attics was I said because you know what
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.960]  you may be looking at another Christmas Attics looking at me right now why
[1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:50.080]  don't you tell folks who it is Christmas Attics was the first person he was
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:55.320]  African who died in the revolutionary yeah and people forget that that there
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:38:00.480]  was a struggle here from day one against international bankers and the one
[1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:04.640]  court I want to leave with real quickly it's from Otto von Bismarck and I got
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:08.520]  this out of the creature from Jekyll Island and he this was he was quoted
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:11.840]  after Lincoln had been assassinated regarding the impact that this was going
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:16.880]  to have on the on the on the world the death of Lincoln was a disaster for
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:21.120]  Christendom there was no man in the United States great enough to wear his
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:26.240]  boots I fear that foreign bankers with their craftiness and and torturous
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:31.200]  tricks will entirely control the exuberant riches of America and use it
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:35.680]  and use it systematically to corrupt modern civilization they will not
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:41.040]  hesitate to plunge the whole of Christendom into wars and chaos in order
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:44.840]  that the earth should become their inheritance you know exactly what has
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:49.880]  happened no I mean exactly and back then people even knew who the enemy was and
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:53.640]  we couldn't beat them now the public doesn't even know and laughs at bankers
[1:38:53.640 --> 1:38:57.680]  while they're openly setting up world government run by him and we're gonna
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:01.000]  have to buy carbon taxes from him I appreciate your call sir it's a lot
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.520]  Alex peaceful world you bet yeah guys a great speaker he needs a radio show he
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:10.080]  does I love that tone of voice in the way he was speaking I just like it look
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:16.480]  at this look at this right here this is out of news week and it's it's a
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:20.080]  cartoon we'll show a close-up of this trail give this to you for the TV shows
[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:25.280]  we put it on and it's the it's it says the Constitution Bill writes it's a
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:29.000]  piece of paper and Barack Obama is piecing it together with tape and
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:37.880]  fixing it after Bush Cheney folks Barack Obama out of the gates is saying
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:45.840]  Patriot Act warrantless spying more wars letting the bankers take over I just
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:53.080]  can't handle it anymore I mean we've got this translucent green skin George Bush
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:58.480]  who just radiates deception and lies notice how they set that up their
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:06.400]  masters of eight years of this and they give us this Hollywood just exudes
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:10.920]  confidence and smarts and slick good-looking it's over folks we're
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:14.720]  screwed it's over because the public is just somehow been trained that old white
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:18.800]  guys which really do run things you know are the evil so they look at some old
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:21.200]  white guy down the street and think he's the evil and no he's not the evil one
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:28.160]  he's watching you know dancing with the stars just like you but now that they've

[1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:51.960]  was a savior remember seven and a half years ago he was the savior from Bill
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:55.240]  Clinton because Bill Clinton did stuff was unpopular just like George Bush the
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:59.040]  stuff was unpopular and what's Obama saying every day in the papers now I'm
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:02.480]  gonna do stuff you're not gonna like so he's getting you ready for it I'm gonna

[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:31.760]  they're finally given the documents can't believe it and remove the fluoride
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:38.600]  and the feds come in try to pay them off to put it back in let's go ahead and
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:53.240]  talk to Paul in Flugerville Texas you're on the airport I have a question on
[1:50:53.240 --> 1:51:01.240]  the unfairness doctrine and I wish you for now on would refer to it as the
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:06.720]  unfairness dog I mean how about the Soviet Free Space Bear that sounds good
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:11.600]  you know what what are you going to do when that comes down do you have any
[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:19.680]  really a plan to fight it or you can you I mean it basically it's the the
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:24.160]  stations oh yeah yeah yeah they're going to target AM and FM's but they're
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:29.280]  saying under fairness now they're going to shut down internet radio so they'll
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:33.400]  try to use examples that look good in the media you know they'll try to set
[1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:36.680]  precedence but these crooks aren't going to get away with it you know they try to
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:43.680]  claim with the with the you know so-called campaign finance reform that
[1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:46.880]  doubled the money corporations can give a restricted free speech that I couldn't
[1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:52.880]  interview groups that were say pro land grab anti land grab or a pro gun group
[1:51:52.880 --> 1:51:57.080]  or anti-gun group that I couldn't have my own opinions and people just ignored
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:52:02.320]  that so let these smiley face criminals tell tell us that we don't have free
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:06.120]  speech we still have it and I'm not going to go along with it but but but it's not
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:11.640]  just there they're coming out with a violent radicalization act where they
[1:52:11.640 --> 1:52:17.440]  openly want to ban 9-11 truth and a lot of other things well but they're not
[1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:22.000]  going to be directly attacking you because you're too tough of a bird no
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:25.640]  they'll go out and they'll go after stations stations they'll go after
[1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:30.120]  stations yeah and then the station will kick you off the air that's their plan
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:34.720]  isn't it not that is their plan sir I appreciate your call that is land the
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:37.960]  free home of the brave I mean you can't have free speech in a can't protest on
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:41.440]  the street can't have a radio show I mean America's not about being able to say
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:46.520]  what you want I mean that's a conspiracy theory some people said that
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:50.600]  once you could say what you wanted in America that was a lie that was al-qaeda
[1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:57.040]  saying that no no some people said that Obama wasn't born from a virgin birth
[1:52:57.040 --> 1:53:01.760]  some people said that he didn't have little wings under his jacket they were
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:09.840]  al-qaeda members no Obama is the savior save us Andrew and Arizona you're on
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:17.840]  the air hello this is um Andrew um I just wanted to talk about Obama you mean
[1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:25.640]  please don't blaspheme sirs Lord Obama Lord the one the Savior go ahead talk of
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:32.320]  his grace yes what of his grace what of the Savior oh I'm just waiting to see
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:38.760]  that will Obama be a better president than any other one no George Bush ran
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:44.640]  nothing George Bush was a puppet that's what we're saying he doesn't matter but
[1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:51.280]  his policies hymns are for total corporate raping of the population
[1:53:51.280 --> 1:53:58.720]  um don't do you think um Obama will be protected or would be a staff meeting I
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:04.720]  think he'll be protected but they're gonna have horrible degenerate distasteful
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:09.080]  ugly racist groups attacking and that will fool a lot of folks in the
[1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:14.000]  supporting so there's a lot of tricks they can play with Obama let's talk to
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.600]  Isaiah in California you're on the air Isaiah hey how are you doing Mr. Trump
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:23.800]  Isaiah welcome yeah I had a question and I want to tell you why I'm asking a
[1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:29.440]  question okay all right what is the club of Rome club of Rome is a globalist
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:32.760]  think tank consortium calling for the extermination of 80% of the world's
[1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:40.640]  population and a neo feudal planetary system run by a basic international
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:44.520]  corporate elite okay well the reason why I'm asking this question is because
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:50.800]  there's a there's a man in Japan called Daisaku Ikeda he is the president of
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:54.360]  Soka Gakkai International a Buddhist association which claims 12 million
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  members and in more than and 190 countries and territories and this man is
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:06.920]  is an honorary member of club of Rome right no that's who they recruit they
[1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:12.400]  recruit influential people now but this this I've researched about this Buddhist
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:16.240]  and they didn't they've done a lot of good things around the world but see I
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:21.440]  don't know because you always say it's compartmentalized and also this Buddhist
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:29.040]  Association called Soka Gakkai has a own party in the in the Japanese government
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:34.840]  and it's called the new Komeito and yeah that was it's the third biggest party
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:39.720]  in Japan so what are you Japanese yeah called in before you've heard you're
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:42.880]  asking me how to say end game in Japanese all that stuff yeah you speak
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:46.600]  really good Japanese I figured we're just be Japanese yeah I can hardly speak
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:52.480]  English I'm very fancy that you can speak both probably more than two that's
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:56.640]  what they do they have outer and inner rings of the CFR trilateral Commission
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:02.840]  Club of Rome and they go and they get an Angelina Jolie to join the CFR so that
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:06.840]  that gives them the look of being mainstream but she's never let in on the
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:12.320]  inner policy meetings that go on so it's a it's all about of all part of
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:18.320]  influence peddling okay well what do you think about this man I second get
[1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:22.160]  he's the president of Soka Gakkai I mean he has a lot of people on his side you
