[00:00.000 --> 00:24.760]  You know when I was 18, you could go down here at Junior Brown at the Continental Club
[00:24.760 --> 00:25.760]  for $2.
[00:25.760 --> 00:31.560]  Now, of course, he's a big hit in Nashville, he's one of those guys that's a 30 year overnight
[00:31.560 --> 00:32.560]  success.
[00:32.560 --> 00:39.440]  Listen to that, he plays surf medley better than anybody.
[00:39.440 --> 00:43.760]  Ben Garrison's our guest, I got pretty wound up today on here and everybody knows that
[00:43.760 --> 00:46.520]  they've been behind the scenes, that's not an act with me.
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.440]  I've studied history, so I know real authoritarianism when I see it and I see the globalists
[00:52.440 --> 00:56.480]  that run our country, ally with communist China, they're totally ruthless and all of
[00:56.480 --> 01:05.600]  you that are siding with Hollywood, mainstream media, I don't even hate you, I hate the controllers,
[01:05.600 --> 01:12.880]  I am frustrated that I'm not smart enough, that's it, to save you and I don't mean that
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.280]  as some goody two shoes thing, you know, some savior complex, I mean I need to save you
[01:17.280 --> 01:18.600]  to get my family out of this.
[01:18.600 --> 01:25.440]  See, I think of you as myself because I know we're all interconnected and Ben Garrison
[01:25.440 --> 01:29.200]  top editorial cartoonist in the world and it really is true, you know, you don't want
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.280]  to say that till you realize it, he's here with us and we're taking some phone calls,
[01:33.280 --> 01:37.040]  Paul Watts is about to take over, we're gonna go to Pennsylvania, we're gonna talk to Holly
[01:37.040 --> 01:41.240]  who's been holding very patiently about the omnibus as Garrison said he's right, it's
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.720]  not a budget, that's for the year, it's one of 12 bills a year when they combine them
[01:45.720 --> 01:49.680]  for spending, everybody got on my ass about, I love the audience is so informed, I said
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.200]  it's just, Holly you're on the air with Ben Garrison, go ahead.
[01:53.200 --> 02:00.880]  Hi Ben, hi Alex, thanks for taking my call, but real quick how about a bumper sticker
[02:00.880 --> 02:06.040]  that says gun free, or gun free zones are where the shootings happen?
[02:06.040 --> 02:10.720]  Well that's totally true, I mean, there are some good public schools in this country with
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.080]  some good people at them, but if they're blue city areas the police always stand down, why
[02:15.080 --> 02:20.160]  would you send your child to the only place they statistically might get killed by a lunatic
[02:20.160 --> 02:23.760]  because the media advertises that's where a lunatic goes, Ben Garrison.
[02:23.760 --> 02:31.440]  Yeah, isn't that the case, you know, I've noticed another thing you mentioned about Hollywood
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.000]  is that you watch these movies and you see them, if somebody brings out a gun, oh do
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.080]  you have a permit for that?
[02:38.080 --> 02:42.600]  And I always think the perfect line is yes, my permit is a second amendment, there's
[02:42.600 --> 02:47.960]  nothing, they've demonized these guns and boy, you watch Bill Moore, I watch him every
[02:47.960 --> 02:53.920]  week because I like to see what the enemies are doing, he's really pushing this idea that
[02:53.920 --> 02:55.680]  gun ownership should be a privilege.
[02:55.680 --> 02:58.880]  Now if they ever do that, where they make gun ownership a privilege, you might as well
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.880]  kiss your guns goodbye because they'll make the permit process and the testing so elaborate
[03:04.880 --> 03:06.640]  and impossible, the fees, the funding.
[03:06.640 --> 03:09.960]  It'll be like New York City where only basically the mafia at the ends of a few thousand have
[03:09.960 --> 03:10.960]  it.
[03:10.960 --> 03:14.160]  Yeah, exactly, I watched Bill Martin when I was in Colorado, just happened to catch
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.040]  it, he's like, it's time to repeal the second amendment, well that's what the Supreme Court
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.480]  Justice came out and said, I mean, don't they get that we've been warning people forever
[03:23.480 --> 03:29.000]  and they were denying that, Ben?
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.720]  They keep pushing gradually but now they seem to be going all out, which is actually in
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.760]  a way is good because that's all that's going to do is tighten, our grip on our weapons
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.880]  are going to tighten the more they come out and say that and so it's going to be, okay,
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.520]  well, let's get it on then, come and try to take them, see what happens.
[03:49.520 --> 03:56.720]  All right, Ben Garrison, we salute you, we appreciate you, people can go to grrgraphics.com,
[03:56.720 --> 04:00.560]  you're busy, I'm busy, we talked a year ago, I sell some of your books, I've got a whole
[04:00.560 --> 04:04.520]  plan to fund our operation in yours, with limited edition prints that are valuable to
[04:04.520 --> 04:10.240]  the audience, they become collectors, we need, you and I both are so busy, believe me, we
[04:10.240 --> 04:15.240]  need to get together, we need to launch a plan and it's non-exclusive, you can do whatever
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.840]  you want anywhere else, I want to do a deal with you with your best prints so people can
[04:18.840 --> 04:23.560]  hang these in their shops, their businesses, their churches, it's absolutely amazing,
[04:23.560 --> 04:26.520]  so let's get on the phone today or tomorrow, let's just have it happen because I don't
[04:26.520 --> 04:30.680]  do it and then a year goes by and let's do that because we've all got to come together,
[04:30.680 --> 04:34.920]  the audience wants to support the economy of freedom, support free speech and you're
[04:34.920 --> 04:37.000]  one of our leading voices, so thank you so much.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.760]  Thank you, Alex, can I make a quick shout out to my friend Corey Simpson in Seattle,
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.920]  he's your biggest fan and he buys all your stuff and he's really devoted to you, so I
[04:45.920 --> 04:47.960]  just have to mention his name.
[04:47.960 --> 04:48.960]  Absolutely, God bless him.
[04:48.960 --> 05:00.360]  Alright, I'll introduce Paul Watson, more calls straight ahead, stay with us.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.360]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy, we went
[05:04.360 --> 05:08.720]  out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy
[05:08.720 --> 05:14.560]  stamina, mental clarity, you name it, and we created a stronger formula than some of
[05:14.560 --> 05:17.680]  the best-selling formulas out there, it's very simple, we went out and looked at what
[05:17.680 --> 05:21.120]  is the top, what is the best, we'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better,
[05:21.120 --> 05:26.520]  leading competitors, put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it and sell
[05:26.520 --> 05:32.360]  it for $30, it's $19.95 right now, so you get an incredible top of the line new tropic
[05:32.360 --> 05:38.560]  for $19.95, believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15, $20 we
[05:38.560 --> 05:42.160]  make to fund this operation in the face of the global, the rest of it, but I'm doing
[05:42.160 --> 05:46.600]  this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks, I want to shell it all out before
[05:46.600 --> 05:50.800]  the big supply comes in, and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and
[05:50.800 --> 05:57.720]  find out why, it's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews, it's amazing, infowarstore.com, infowarslive.com
[05:57.720 --> 06:06.720]  or AAA-2533-139.
[06:06.720 --> 06:13.640]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.160]  You can run on for a long time, run on.
[06:18.160 --> 06:21.760]  We're back live, Paul Watson's riding a shotgun, I'm getting out of here in a segment, we're
[06:21.760 --> 06:26.440]  taking calls with Paul, he's got a big guest coming up, don't forget BrainForce Plus is

[06:56.280 --> 07:00.400]  absolutely by the products with us have changed the whole game, they're panicking, they don't
[07:00.400 --> 07:08.600]  know what to do, infowarsstore.com, Paul, tell us what you got coming up today, my friend.
[07:08.600 --> 07:12.520]  We've got roaming millennial coming up at the bottom of the hour, Alex, but before I
[07:12.520 --> 07:17.640]  get into that, I want to talk about this second amendment issue because they got new polls
[07:17.640 --> 07:23.240]  out today which show that the lead that Democrats had for the House going into the midterms,
[07:23.240 --> 07:27.560]  it was 15 points back in October, everybody's been saying for months, the Republicans are
[07:27.560 --> 07:30.840]  going to get an absolute shellacking, they're going to lose the House.
[07:30.840 --> 07:36.880]  Now the polls say that lead is down to five points almost within the margin of error,
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.120]  and typically in the past, if Democrats are slightly ahead in the polls, they've lost
[07:41.120 --> 07:44.320]  the House, so they have to be way ahead to win it.
[07:44.320 --> 07:48.960]  That's all Alex taking place over the last couple of months or so, especially in the
[07:48.960 --> 07:53.760]  last month, and I think it's related to this second amendment issue.
[07:53.760 --> 08:00.000]  The march for our lives, as we know, was basically a recruitment voter drive for Democrats,
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.960]  less than 10% of the attendees were kids, they're doing it to recruit voters, they don't care
[08:04.960 --> 08:09.600]  about gun violence, it would be naive to think that they do, it's all about power, so that's
[08:09.600 --> 08:11.000]  why they're doing it.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.480]  But again, this second amendment issue is so toxic, they're not going to get significant
[08:15.480 --> 08:19.520]  gun control through this year, maybe they'll get it next year if they get the House, but
[08:19.520 --> 08:21.360]  they're not going to get it this year.
[08:21.360 --> 08:28.760]  What single issue, Alex, would get Republicans out to vote in the midterms above all others?
[08:28.760 --> 08:30.880]  What fear would get them out to vote?
[08:30.880 --> 08:33.680]  Well, it would be the confiscation of their firearms.
[08:33.680 --> 08:39.360]  This is backfiring, it's backfiring big time, especially now that we see the true face of
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.280]  it with this call, you saw the protest signs on Saturday, ban all guns, we're going to
[08:44.280 --> 08:46.240]  take them from your cold dead hands.
[08:46.240 --> 08:51.720]  You got the New York Times editorial today, op-ed, repeal the second amendment.
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.280]  This is going to backfire, this is working in our favor, because it might get Republicans
[08:56.280 --> 09:01.680]  out to vote, it might give them an issue, a point on which to vote, which they don't
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.760]  have right now, this is going to backfire and the polls suggest that it already is.
[09:06.760 --> 09:13.120]  So far from being worried about this, we should be supporting the Parkland students, we should
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.200]  be encouraging them to continue getting up on national media platforms, calling for all
[09:17.200 --> 09:22.000]  guns to be banned, doing it in the kind of vulgar language that we've seen from David
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.760]  Hogg recently, because it's not good PR, it's blowing up in their faces, and the polls
[09:27.760 --> 09:32.640]  are beginning to show that, Trump's approval's up again as well, by the way, on a CNN poll.
[09:32.640 --> 09:39.160]  So I think we really need to support the Parkland students, we need to amplify those who are
[09:39.160 --> 09:43.800]  calling for a repeal of the second amendment, because tactically, it's going to work in
[09:43.800 --> 09:44.800]  our favor.
[09:44.800 --> 09:52.120]  Paul, I know Gallup, I know the other major polls generally sample 9 to 15 points more
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.080]  Democrat, they claim there's more Democrats, that's not really true, and we saw that during
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.520]  the presidential campaign and they admitted that it was fake, and that Trump was actually
[10:00.520 --> 10:04.280]  generally about 5, 10 points ahead.
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.520]  The problem is, I'm looking at their actions and the way they're behaving, they know short
[10:09.520 --> 10:11.120]  term, this is going to hurt them.
[10:11.120 --> 10:15.520]  I think they're winding up jihadi attacks, I think they know about other mental patients
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.720]  that are going to attack, Broward Cowards stood down, we believe the attack happened,
[10:19.720 --> 10:24.240]  but they stood down, and I think just like Vegas was tied to jihadis, that's now been
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.480]  confirmed, and we now have the Pulse nightclub father and son reportedly being up behind
[10:29.480 --> 10:34.400]  the performance, we first broke that back when it happened, I think they've got some crazies
[10:34.400 --> 10:37.120]  there watching that they know are getting ready to do something big, that they're going
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.680]  to let attack, and they've set this precedent saying never again, not one more.
[10:41.680 --> 10:48.280]  I agree the Stormy Daniels thing about consensual sex 11 years ago and him treating her great,
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.200]  and then talking about not wearing a condom is so humiliating, how could you not feel
[10:52.200 --> 10:56.280]  sorry for the president, who never claimed he was a goody two shoes, it's like breaking
[10:56.280 --> 11:00.880]  into somebody's bedroom, it's pure harassment, it's stalking, so yeah, that's got him even
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.360]  in CNN polls that sample 20 something percent more Democrat, it's got him up 5, 6, 7 points,
[11:06.360 --> 11:11.400]  same thing with Gallup, same thing with Mason Dixon, same thing with all of these, I'm
[11:11.400 --> 11:18.080]  just saying, I don't think we can be too confident though, because Soros has successfully overthrown
[11:18.080 --> 11:23.320]  dozens of countries, including Ukraine four years ago, and they've got a plan.
[11:23.320 --> 11:30.320]  I agree they're arrogant, why would you have TAR go on and say we're going to give us an
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.480]  inch, we'll take you a mile, why would you have the former Supreme Court Justice John
[11:33.480 --> 11:37.280]  Paul Stevens say repeal the Second Amendment mass gun confiscation, why would you have
[11:37.280 --> 11:41.320]  Democrats say we don't care, don't turn your guns in, we'll kill you, I'm going to ask
[11:41.320 --> 11:44.640]  you that question a moment and let you take over with all the great job you're doing,
[11:44.640 --> 11:48.600]  Paul Watson at prison planted on Twitter, one of the hottest Twitter accounts out there,
[11:48.600 --> 11:54.160]  despite the censorship, but let's go to TAR admitting Saturday their game plan.
[11:54.160 --> 12:01.360]  There are so very many things, so many steps to take, like right now, sign our petition,
[12:01.360 --> 12:06.320]  it takes two seconds and it matters, we will take the big and we will take the small, but
[12:06.320 --> 12:11.360]  we will keep fighting, when they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.480]  mile, we are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here for real change.
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.480]  But again, she's up there, the very same group that funded Madonna to be there a year before
[12:20.480 --> 12:24.720]  the women's march is funding this, total astroturf, they tried to ban us from criticizing them
[12:24.720 --> 12:30.720]  a month ago, shang they were astroturf, now it's all admitted, private jets, money, everything
[12:30.720 --> 12:36.400]  Paul, what is their ace in the hole, or are they just crazy and think they can finally
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.160]  announce we're coming to take your guns, what type of strategy is that, because Bill Marr
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.880]  said ban him two weeks ago, the New York Times said it, CNN, they're now as a talking point
[12:44.880 --> 12:49.760]  saying fine, we're taking everything, do they think psychologically we'll go okay, just
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.920]  take the semi-autos, do they, because we get the formula worldwide from where you live
[12:54.920 --> 13:00.840]  to Australia was to first ban the semi-autos, then ban people up to 21, then register, I
[13:00.840 --> 13:03.280]  mean, we know the formulae Paul.
[13:03.280 --> 13:10.080]  Well, I've seen other activists, prominent people within this march for our lives movement,
[13:10.080 --> 13:13.520]  saying to these others who are saying, yeah, let's just take all the guns, we'll take it
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.120]  from your cold dead hands, we saw the protest signs as well, saying basically, we're going
[13:17.120 --> 13:22.040]  to do it violently, they're saying, no, no, what are you doing, stop, stop saying that,
[13:22.040 --> 13:27.360]  stop admitting that this is the true agenda, because that's going to cause a massive resentment,
[13:27.360 --> 13:33.200]  a massive result, revolt amongst Republicans, and they'll go out and vote in these midterms.
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.800]  These polls have become, they've gone from 15 points, Democrats in front, everyone's
[13:37.800 --> 13:42.560]  pessimistic, it was a lost cause, now it's down to a five point lead, it's almost within
[13:42.560 --> 13:46.800]  the margin of error, and it's happened while this gun control narrative has built up.
[13:46.800 --> 13:51.320]  So you've got people within that movement saying, what on earth are you doing, saying,
[13:51.320 --> 13:54.800]  we're going to take all the guns, if you give us an inch, we'll take a mile, what are you
[13:54.800 --> 13:55.800]  doing?
[13:55.800 --> 13:58.200]  So I think it's a massive strategic error.
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.680]  Also the other factor that I've pointed to is, never in this discussion of, oh, we're
[14:02.680 --> 14:06.520]  going to confiscate all the guns, we're going to repeal the Second Amendment, is the question
[14:06.520 --> 14:13.560]  of, what consequences are you going to see if you take 300 million guns from roughly
[14:13.560 --> 14:20.760]  70 million American gun owners, even if Alex, 1% of those people resisted, and the media
[14:20.760 --> 14:24.600]  is going to be all like, oh, you're calling for civil war, no, we're asking, what will
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.960]  the potential consequences be if you have police or whoever, military confiscating millions
[14:29.960 --> 14:34.120]  and millions of guns from people who don't want to give them up?
[14:34.120 --> 14:37.600]  That question is never asked, it's never part of this narrative.
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.400]  So that's, that's another issue.
[14:39.400 --> 14:42.800]  But I think it's a massive strategic error on their part.
[14:42.800 --> 14:45.680]  We've seen the true, the teeth of this movement.
[14:45.680 --> 14:46.840]  No, no, I totally agree.
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.400]  So then why is Trump paying it lip service and finally starting to go sideways here?
[14:52.400 --> 14:55.920]  Well, why did he sign the ominous omnibus bill?
[14:55.920 --> 14:57.080]  It's the same thing.
[14:57.080 --> 14:59.280]  The base needs to hold his feet to the fire.
[14:59.280 --> 15:02.760]  We've done it before with Syria, where that was a mistake.
[15:02.760 --> 15:05.440]  And then they backtracked from it, it hasn't happened since.
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.520]  So don't give them that inch in the first place.
[15:08.520 --> 15:11.120]  That's one thing we can do, put pressure on Trump, but also-
[15:11.120 --> 15:12.120]  Absolutely.
[15:12.120 --> 15:13.120]  Whoever is-
[15:13.120 --> 15:15.120]  Alex, don't interrupt the enemy when it's making a mistake.
[15:15.120 --> 15:17.160]  They're making a huge mistake right now.
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.360]  Let's give them a platform to keep saying the same thing, because it's working against
[15:21.360 --> 15:24.440]  their favor politically right now and in the polls.
[15:24.440 --> 15:25.440]  That's right.
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.640]  Trump is a populist, a free market classic America, but really kind of a libertarian liberal.
[15:30.640 --> 15:32.440]  He was anti-war.
[15:32.440 --> 15:38.520]  He is kind of a liberal, but in a good way, and so his wife and his daughters are telling
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.240]  him to do the gun control, and it's horrible advice, Trump.
[15:42.240 --> 15:43.240]  It's terrible advice.
[15:43.240 --> 15:44.240]  All right.
[15:44.240 --> 15:47.480]  I'm sorry the other callers were out of time, Paul's taking over, Chris and everybody else.
[15:47.480 --> 15:48.480]  We love you.
[15:48.480 --> 15:49.480]  Put them all on hold.
[15:49.480 --> 15:50.480]  Give them a free t-shirt, wherever they want.
[15:50.480 --> 15:51.480]  They're awesome.

[16:05.960 --> 16:08.440]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.

[16:09.600 --> 16:11.160]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[16:11.160 --> 16:14.440]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.

[16:15.520 --> 16:18.720]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[16:18.720 --> 16:22.160]  It's got the preglinone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.

[16:31.560 --> 16:35.680]  toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[16:35.680 --> 16:36.680]  That's a spray you do.
[16:36.680 --> 16:37.920]  You can also swallow it.
[16:37.920 --> 16:43.400]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.

[19:30.440 --> 19:31.440]  That's amazing.
[19:31.440 --> 19:32.440]  That's really incredible.
[19:32.440 --> 19:35.560]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt
[19:35.560 --> 19:36.560]  sweet.

[19:42.160 --> 19:46.720]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[19:46.720 --> 19:48.840]  John, buy it, you will love it.
[19:48.840 --> 19:51.160]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.560]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[19:55.560 --> 20:03.520]  It's a win-win, infowarslife.com.
[20:03.520 --> 20:30.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.320 --> 20:37.160]  If you want to stop tyranny, well, so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's
[20:37.160 --> 20:42.240]  Alex Jones.
[20:42.240 --> 20:46.560]  There are so very many things, so many steps to take.
[20:46.560 --> 20:49.440]  Like right now, sign our petition.
[20:49.440 --> 20:51.400]  It takes two seconds and it matters.
[20:51.400 --> 20:55.920]  We will take the big and we will take the small, but we will keep fighting.
[20:55.920 --> 21:00.520]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[21:00.520 --> 21:06.320]  We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here for real change.
[21:06.320 --> 21:07.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[21:07.640 --> 21:08.640]  Mike Cernvich is here.
[21:08.640 --> 21:09.640]  Your phone call is coming up next segment.
[21:09.640 --> 21:13.120]  I'm going to give him to Russia with him as well and what Trump's up to, and what his
[21:13.120 --> 21:15.520]  information is and what's happening inside the Trump administration.
[21:15.520 --> 21:21.520]  But you are getting into the incredible persecution of conservatives, libertarians, of just nationalists,
[21:21.520 --> 21:23.400]  of just free speech activists.
[21:23.400 --> 21:25.400]  You're a lawyer in your own right.
[21:25.400 --> 21:28.080]  I know you've looked over some of the lawsuits against us, and I'm not just putting a good
[21:28.080 --> 21:29.280]  face on it.
[21:29.280 --> 21:30.280]  These will cost money.
[21:30.280 --> 21:31.280]  We've got to beat them.
[21:31.280 --> 21:36.920]  But my lawyers tell me, some of the top guys in the country defamation wise, they say,
[21:36.920 --> 21:38.600]  we've never seen suits like these.
[21:38.600 --> 21:44.800]  These are defamatory themselves, but it's defamation protected by court because it's in a lawsuit.
[21:44.800 --> 21:49.440]  And again, they even say, Jones says that they were connected to the FBI, that Umar
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.440]  Mateen was.
[21:50.440 --> 21:52.640]  Well, that was in the news then, it's in the news now.
[21:52.640 --> 21:58.720]  So it's just next level, this intimidation and where they're going, and it makes me ask,
[21:58.720 --> 22:04.160]  what's the next step just in the violent rhetoric and where are the Republicans?
[22:04.160 --> 22:06.240]  Where is Trump?
[22:06.240 --> 22:07.240]  It's just crazy.
[22:07.240 --> 22:11.760]  Well, I mean, the next step is for them for us to be assassinated.
[22:11.760 --> 22:15.040]  I mean, there's no, there's no nice way to put it.
[22:15.040 --> 22:20.360]  We all know that the family research council shooting happened in 2013.
[22:20.360 --> 22:25.240]  And Floyd Lee Corkins went on to the SPLC target list website.
[22:25.240 --> 22:27.480]  He went in to murder as many people.
[22:27.480 --> 22:28.480]  This is what he said.
[22:28.480 --> 22:32.920]  He said, I want to kill as many people, he said, he said he wanted to kill as many people
[22:32.920 --> 22:33.920]  as possible.
[22:33.920 --> 22:36.920]  And he said this to the FBI.
[22:36.920 --> 22:40.560]  And the only reason he was stopped is by a good guy with the gun.
[22:40.560 --> 22:46.080]  So the SPLC has actually directly in ways that you and I never have, even though the
[22:46.080 --> 22:50.960]  fake news wants to say otherwise, directly inside in a mass shooter, media doesn't care.
[22:50.960 --> 22:52.120]  They don't talk about that.
[22:52.120 --> 22:53.280]  They don't report that.
[22:53.280 --> 22:59.600]  Instead, they'll dox for young Jewish women because they don't like the mom, Pamela Geller.
[22:59.600 --> 23:00.600]  So I, there's no way.
[23:00.600 --> 23:01.600]  Well, that's the thing.
[23:01.600 --> 23:03.280]  The left's always been dirty and bad.
[23:03.280 --> 23:04.280]  World wine.
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.920]  And I thought that maybe they were nicer here, but really it's just time in the phase for
[23:08.920 --> 23:11.320]  them to go into the red terror.
[23:11.320 --> 23:17.920]  Yeah, I, every day that I wake up is for me, a relief that I haven't been, I haven't been
[23:17.920 --> 23:22.320]  murdered or targeted because we, I haven't targeted for assassination, of course.
[23:22.320 --> 23:23.320]  There's no question.
[23:23.320 --> 23:24.640]  The family research council happened.
[23:24.640 --> 23:25.640]  Yeah.
[23:25.640 --> 23:30.200]  I mean, if you, if somebody said they went on our website and they clicked on a target
[23:30.200 --> 23:35.960]  list and they went to commit a shooting, oh my God, because they called it a targeting
[23:35.960 --> 23:37.400]  list for those that don't know.
[23:37.400 --> 23:38.400]  Yeah.
[23:38.400 --> 23:42.960]  So the SPLC literally has a target list and then a man goes on a mass shooting.
[23:42.960 --> 23:45.560]  The SPLC is never apologized to the victims.
[23:45.560 --> 23:47.920]  They have not disavowed that shooting.
[23:47.920 --> 23:51.120]  They try to pretend it doesn't happen and the media is complicit.
[23:51.120 --> 23:57.320]  There may be four or five articles tops on it and they bury the lead about how that was
[23:57.320 --> 24:00.480]  a direct incitement by the Southern poverty law center.
[24:00.480 --> 24:04.000]  And now the Southern poverty law center had 10,000 people hired by YouTube and Google
[24:04.000 --> 24:05.000]  to censor us.
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.560]  What do you make of that whole purge that's still ongoing?
[24:08.560 --> 24:13.360]  Well, my YouTube channel, I was gaining 1500 new subscribers a day.
[24:13.360 --> 24:19.720]  My videos were doing 20,000 views a day and now I actually hardly even do much on YouTube
[24:19.720 --> 24:25.960]  because my videos are doing like 1500 views, 2000 views because the SPLC has unsubscribed
[24:25.960 --> 24:28.520]  people and gutted my YouTube channel.
[24:28.520 --> 24:29.520]  They've already taken.
[24:29.520 --> 24:30.520]  Oh, that's the thing.
[24:30.520 --> 24:31.880]  Our YouTube channel was at over 2 billion.
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.400]  It's now reversed to 1.5 and almost no one is getting our videos and they're all being
[24:36.400 --> 24:37.400]  unsubscribed.
[24:37.400 --> 24:39.640]  So they've got to go keep subscribing every day.
[24:39.640 --> 24:42.280]  Yeah, I actually, this was last week.
[24:42.280 --> 24:46.280]  I have 66,000 subscribers even after the unsubscribes.
[24:46.280 --> 24:49.360]  I had three live viewers Alex when I went did a live stream.
[24:49.360 --> 24:51.160]  No, no, I saw you link to that show it.
[24:51.160 --> 24:52.160]  That's impossible.
[24:52.160 --> 24:56.960]  They're not even that means three people had to be on your YouTube page to see it.
[24:56.960 --> 24:58.120]  That's called shadow banning.
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.040]  They, you were, they, you were not able to hit any of the subscribers.
[25:02.040 --> 25:03.040]  Yeah.
[25:03.040 --> 25:04.040]  And it's interesting.
[25:04.040 --> 25:05.040]  And then I'll point that out.
[25:05.040 --> 25:08.640]  And then suddenly like the next day, then I'll get a couple hundred or something.
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.360]  And then, you know, cause they think that we're going to forget about it and not pay
[25:11.360 --> 25:12.360]  attention.
[25:12.360 --> 25:13.360]  Right.
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.440]  So three, three live viewers on a 66,000 subscriber channel, it just doesn't really add up.
[25:18.440 --> 25:22.040]  So what they're doing is they're trying to play a Psyop.
[25:22.040 --> 25:25.840]  Hey, we're banned from our main channel from streaming still.
[25:25.840 --> 25:26.840]  So at least you get your three.
[25:26.840 --> 25:28.200]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[25:28.200 --> 25:29.200]  It's here folks.
[25:29.200 --> 25:30.200]  It's here.
[25:30.200 --> 25:33.200]  And it's the so-called left, the champions of speech that are doing it.
[25:33.200 --> 25:34.200]  Yeah.
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.560]  I actually unpublished every YouTube video that I had ever done because what they done
[25:39.560 --> 25:44.400]  is they went back to someone's channel who actually, um, Wayne Dupree, African American,
[25:44.400 --> 25:46.600]  very powerful man, powerful voice.
[25:46.600 --> 25:48.600]  They found a video from four years ago.
[25:48.600 --> 25:53.240]  So they're going through every video and watching every video with a fine tooth comb.
[25:53.240 --> 25:58.320]  And if you say one wrong word or one foul language or, you know, there's a word begins
[25:58.320 --> 26:03.040]  with C that was common during the election, they've decided now that if you say anything
[26:03.040 --> 26:07.360]  like that, even four years ago, they'll ban you or they'll, you know, they'll suspend
[26:07.360 --> 26:08.360]  it.
[26:08.360 --> 26:09.360]  So that, that's where we are.
[26:09.360 --> 26:12.040]  That's why I tell people this, cause I'm asking a lot of questions.
[26:12.040 --> 26:13.240]  What's on your radar?
[26:13.240 --> 26:14.240]  What's next?
[26:14.240 --> 26:16.080]  How'd the big gun grab March go yesterday?
[26:16.080 --> 26:20.200]  I know you made the point where the Republicans in the funding, I mean, this is the real fight.
[26:20.200 --> 26:22.360]  This is bigger than the election 2016.
[26:22.360 --> 26:24.000]  People better understand that.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  Yeah.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.680]  It was a highly successful March and the left has shown that they can mobilize and organize
[26:31.680 --> 26:34.200]  and bust people in less than a month.
[26:34.200 --> 26:40.120]  So if the Democrats can get 800,000 people out into Washington, DC alone, and they can
[26:40.120 --> 26:45.440]  have coordinated marches all throughout the country, that shows that they can bust people
[26:45.440 --> 26:46.440]  in.
[26:46.440 --> 26:49.600]  There is going to be a major blue wave in November.
[26:49.600 --> 26:53.480]  There's no question about it, the Republicans don't want to win Trump.
[26:53.480 --> 26:58.680]  Trump went on stage with Charlie Kirk and said, Oh, and Tifa, is it really a big deal?
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.720]  You know, who, oh, that they just get too much attention, despite the fact that multiple
[27:02.720 --> 27:06.200]  Trump supporters have been assaulted and almost murdered.
[27:06.200 --> 27:10.360]  And in fact, that there's a pending criminal case in New York, where an Intifa terrorist
[27:10.360 --> 27:11.520]  attempted to murder.
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.040]  He's charged with mob action and was trying to strangle it.
[27:15.040 --> 27:22.360]  I saw, I saw Trump in that interview that he did and it was on Fox last Friday and I'm
[27:22.360 --> 27:23.360]  going to try to attack Trump.
[27:23.360 --> 27:24.360]  It's true.
[27:24.360 --> 27:29.000]  They'd go, you know, we, they really attack us on campus and we're being shut down nationwide
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.320]  or 20,000 campus groups.
[27:30.320 --> 27:32.880]  Trump goes, yeah, but you're still really popular.
[27:32.880 --> 27:35.440]  The left, nobody really agrees with them.
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.320]  And the guest host is like, no, they're attacking us and shutting us down.
[27:39.320 --> 27:41.880]  He's there telling the president, we're under attack.
[27:41.880 --> 27:45.160]  We need federal funding to be pulled with these universities.
[27:45.160 --> 27:49.080]  These universities are out of control saying no whites on the weekend, no whites on the
[27:49.080 --> 27:53.080]  commons and it's weird white teachers leading this classic racism crap.
[27:53.080 --> 27:56.040]  I mean, Trump, have they compromised him?
[27:56.040 --> 27:57.360]  Because I got to be honest here.
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.160]  He's still done a lot of great things, but man, I mean, he is starting to really slide.
[28:01.160 --> 28:03.280]  What in the hell is going on, Mike?
[28:03.280 --> 28:09.680]  Well, I'll tell you the truth that nobody really wants to hear and it's cost me thousands
[28:09.680 --> 28:11.400]  of followers and I'm fine with that.
[28:11.400 --> 28:14.320]  So I don't want anybody to blame you for what I'm about to say, but I'll just tell you the
[28:14.320 --> 28:15.640]  truth.
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.600]  If Alec Baldwin makes fun of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, Trump will tweet about
[28:20.600 --> 28:21.600]  it.
[28:21.600 --> 28:26.480]  If a Trump supporter and a Trump hat is knocked unconscious, Trump says it's no big deal.
[28:26.480 --> 28:33.200]  I just don't see him caring about the patriots who are on the front lines really making things
[28:33.200 --> 28:34.200]  happen.
[28:34.200 --> 28:36.640]  But does he know how much those people love him and how important they are?
[28:36.640 --> 28:38.480]  Because I know for a fact he does.
[28:38.480 --> 28:41.560]  I think he's in a bubble and doesn't know.
[28:41.560 --> 28:44.800]  Well, I'm only going to apologize for him for so much.
[28:44.800 --> 28:45.800]  I'm, I believe.
[28:45.800 --> 28:46.800]  No, I hear you.
[28:46.800 --> 28:47.800]  Well, you know what?
[28:47.800 --> 28:48.800]  You know what?
[28:48.800 --> 28:49.800]  Because it's fair to do.
[28:49.800 --> 28:50.800]  Let's look at the negative of a Trump.
[28:50.800 --> 28:52.920]  We come back and they go to phone calls because I, because what I've been told is you've got
[28:52.920 --> 28:57.000]  to get on his butt and us just blindly supporting him makes him go to sleep.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.560]  So let's go after Trump when we come back.
[28:59.560 --> 29:02.560]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[29:02.560 --> 29:06.760]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[29:06.760 --> 29:11.400]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[29:11.400 --> 29:14.120]  narrative over and over again.
[29:14.120 --> 29:19.600]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make
[29:19.600 --> 29:26.400]  them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows,
[29:26.400 --> 29:31.920]  burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until
[29:31.920 --> 29:38.000]  the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.080]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[29:42.080 --> 29:48.720]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[29:48.720 --> 29:53.200]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[29:53.200 --> 29:58.680]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[29:58.680 --> 30:03.760]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[30:03.760 --> 30:05.600]  in stock at inforestore.com.
[30:05.600 --> 30:09.360]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week, I thought it would be a six-month
[30:09.360 --> 30:10.440]  supply for listeners.
[30:10.440 --> 30:14.640]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[30:14.640 --> 30:15.640]  Super Blue.
[30:15.640 --> 30:17.520]  Research across the board is clear.
[30:17.520 --> 30:18.880]  In fact, it's certified.
[30:18.880 --> 30:22.520]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and if you contribute to
[30:22.520 --> 30:24.040]  blood clots and heart attacks.
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.480]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[30:28.480 --> 30:30.800]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[30:30.800 --> 30:35.200]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[30:35.200 --> 30:37.520]  iodide, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[30:37.520 --> 30:42.080]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[30:42.080 --> 30:44.520]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[30:44.520 --> 30:48.940]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[30:48.940 --> 30:52.040]  peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver, and more.

[30:57.160 --> 31:01.160]  the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[31:01.160 --> 31:05.040]  The reason InfoWars Life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[31:05.040 --> 31:06.480]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[31:06.480 --> 31:07.480]  I take this.
[31:07.480 --> 31:11.360]  My family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful

[31:22.040 --> 31:23.240]  I don't feel good.
[31:23.240 --> 31:26.840]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[31:26.840 --> 31:29.640]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[31:29.640 --> 31:35.720]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[31:35.720 --> 31:42.040]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[31:42.040 --> 31:44.160]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[31:44.160 --> 31:45.160]  I love it.
[31:45.160 --> 31:47.840]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[31:47.840 --> 31:48.840]  Survival Shield X2.
[31:48.840 --> 31:52.200]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[31:52.200 --> 31:56.440]  iodine, Survival Shield X2, it's got a five star rating.
[31:56.440 --> 32:00.080]  So win-win, infowarslife.com.

[32:09.280 --> 32:13.320]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[32:13.320 --> 32:17.680]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[32:17.680 --> 32:23.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[32:23.000 --> 32:29.400]  Remember and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.

[32:34.520 --> 32:36.640]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[32:36.640 --> 32:40.920]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[32:40.920 --> 32:43.680]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[32:43.680 --> 32:47.880]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed

[32:56.240 --> 33:03.520]  of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[33:03.520 --> 33:22.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.320 --> 33:29.040]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:29.040 --> 33:30.040]  the info war.
[33:30.040 --> 33:33.720]  All right, we're going to your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[33:33.720 --> 33:39.320]  Mike Cernan, which is our guest, but I'm very thankful for President Trump.
[33:39.320 --> 33:45.960]  I like the things he's done on NAFTA and GATT, the TPP and tariffs on China, and the
[33:45.960 --> 33:48.800]  four trillion, the stock market, and the two million new jobs, and I'm not going to go
[33:48.800 --> 33:50.160]  through that all take a long time.
[33:50.160 --> 33:54.640]  But markedly, in the last month, I've seen some big changes.
[33:54.640 --> 33:58.880]  But the big one isn't even that omnibus, because he got handed that by Congress that
[33:58.880 --> 34:00.240]  was stalled the whole government.
[34:00.240 --> 34:01.240]  It's big pork barrel.
[34:01.240 --> 34:05.520]  I'm not saying I absolve him, but I understand why he did it, because it's it's it's the
[34:05.520 --> 34:06.520]  cheesy Star Trek.
[34:06.520 --> 34:10.920]  It's like the Kobayashi Maru saw an article where it's like there's no good choice, probably
[34:10.920 --> 34:15.280]  the least of but but I get the principal choice still shut the government down, but they
[34:15.280 --> 34:16.880]  would have blamed him.
[34:16.880 --> 34:18.520]  But now Russia vows revenge.
[34:18.520 --> 34:21.200]  The U.S. only understands force.
[34:21.200 --> 34:25.040]  That's a Kit Daniels article breaking it down, kicking all these diplomats out, calling
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.520]  them spies, no proof saying these people got nerve gas to buy Russia over in the UK.
[34:30.520 --> 34:35.640]  Meanwhile, China flies bombers and fighters near Taiwan, threatens attacks against our
[34:35.640 --> 34:36.640]  ships.
[34:36.640 --> 34:37.640]  That's Reuters.
[34:37.640 --> 34:44.080]  Meanwhile, we've got the big news here being reported that even the FCC is talking about
[34:44.080 --> 34:50.080]  how the Communist Chinese have infiltrated the companies inside the United States.
[34:50.080 --> 34:56.400]  The control through one central system, all of our phones and all the phone number indexes.
[34:56.400 --> 34:58.080]  That's just one example.
[34:58.080 --> 35:02.640]  Overhaul of U.S. telecommunications database sparks fear of catastrophic failure.
[35:02.640 --> 35:09.240]  That's how to free beacon, but you've got to read all the way on page three.
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.880]  How was Chinese engineers infiltrating and getting the database now not on some China
[35:13.880 --> 35:16.880]  bashing thing, even though they're the biggest mass murders in history.
[35:16.880 --> 35:23.120]  It's just that Trump's not going after the vaccines now, even though it hurt Barron.
[35:23.120 --> 35:27.280]  Trump is, he's only turned a certain amount, but if he stays on that course, it's pretty
[35:27.280 --> 35:29.560]  soon he'll be back to Hillary Clinton.
[35:29.560 --> 35:34.000]  And they're out to get him and it's his supporters fighting hard and under attack and the bullying
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  and all of it.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.160]  He needs to fire up and get more aggressive.
[35:37.160 --> 35:39.880]  He needs to be exposing election fraud in the States.
[35:39.880 --> 35:41.880]  He needs to be out there.
[35:41.880 --> 35:48.560]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are full steam ahead and the more he rolls over to them, the worse
[35:48.560 --> 35:50.560]  they get.
[35:50.560 --> 35:54.040]  And so again, I think Trump looks at mainstream media too much.
[35:54.040 --> 35:56.400]  I think the old Republican leadership does.
[35:56.400 --> 35:57.400]  They don't matter.
[35:57.400 --> 36:02.800]  I go out there in the country and the young people, the Hispanic folks, the black folks,
[36:02.800 --> 36:06.240]  the white folks, they don't know who these senators and congressmen are.
[36:06.240 --> 36:07.560]  They know who I am.
[36:07.560 --> 36:11.400]  They know who Stephen Crowder is, who's just exploding, by the way.
[36:11.400 --> 36:13.280]  This is Paul Watson, Mike Cernovich.
[36:13.280 --> 36:14.760]  They know who Jack Passoba is.
[36:14.760 --> 36:16.840]  They know who my son is.
[36:16.840 --> 36:17.840]  That's who's popular.
[36:17.840 --> 36:23.720]  I'll be sitting there again with famous people and who are national TV hosts.
[36:23.720 --> 36:25.520]  No one knows who they are than who I am.
[36:25.520 --> 36:26.840]  And I'm not bragging.
[36:26.840 --> 36:28.760]  It's just Trump 71.
[36:28.760 --> 36:31.160]  He's dialed into mainstream news.
[36:31.160 --> 36:37.720]  And what Mike Cernovich said about, he's obsessed with what Alec Baldwin does on stupid programs
[36:37.720 --> 36:42.880]  like Saturday Night Live, instead of when his people rally by the thousands and get
[36:42.880 --> 36:45.640]  physically attacked, that's the meat and potatoes.
[36:45.640 --> 36:46.640]  That's the issues.
[36:46.640 --> 36:50.920]  Instead, he thinks he'll virtue signal with Milani and go, good job, kids, protesting
[36:50.920 --> 36:51.920]  for safety.
[36:51.920 --> 36:53.840]  As if he's going to neutralize it.
[36:53.840 --> 36:55.920]  No, they're calling for his head.
[36:55.920 --> 37:00.240]  They're run by savage political operatives and get programmed and get a talking point
[37:00.240 --> 37:01.680]  sheet on record.
[37:01.680 --> 37:04.280]  They're not going to listen to you being nice to them.
[37:04.280 --> 37:08.320]  So Mike Cernovich, what in Hades, before we go to Jeremy, Rick and everybody else, I promise
[37:08.320 --> 37:11.440]  I'm going to go to, what do you think is really going on with Trump?
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.560]  Well, you nailed it.
[37:13.560 --> 37:19.440]  It isn't that Trump doesn't care is that he is still in that old media bubble and he
[37:19.440 --> 37:24.200]  doesn't actually know who matters and who is influential.
[37:24.200 --> 37:30.200]  There's a reason that these groups are going after you and not Fox News.
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.560]  There's a reason that they want to destroy you.
[37:34.560 --> 37:37.320]  It is, again, you and I have talked about it.
[37:37.320 --> 37:39.080]  I wrote this article, it bothered people.
[37:39.080 --> 37:42.240]  I was kind of like what it's like being famous and people go, oh, you're fully yourself.
[37:42.240 --> 37:44.440]  I'm like, no, actually, I don't, I want to be less famous.
[37:44.440 --> 37:51.280]  I'm actually trying to keep a lower profile, but we're more recognizable than almost anybody
[37:51.280 --> 37:54.480]  that you see on the so-called news.
[37:54.480 --> 37:56.680]  People are talking about the Stormy Daniels ratings.
[37:56.680 --> 38:02.440]  Well, when I went on 60 Minutes, 15 million people tuned in to watch the most since Michelle
[38:02.440 --> 38:04.360]  and Barack Obama had done their special.
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.800]  I was the biggest ratings draw 60 Minutes had had other than Barack Obama inauguration
[38:09.800 --> 38:14.280]  and Paley lost his job after it.
[38:14.280 --> 38:18.880]  He was because they realized that and that's why they won't debate us.
[38:18.880 --> 38:21.960]  They realize that the truth is on our side.
[38:21.960 --> 38:27.320]  Look at Megyn Kelly, she totally botched it, she lost that show after the interview.
[38:27.320 --> 38:28.320]  Exactly.
[38:28.320 --> 38:33.120]  And Trump was obsessed with Megyn Kelly for years, even though he didn't realize she
[38:33.120 --> 38:34.680]  was a paper tiger.
[38:34.680 --> 38:38.640]  These people are paper tigers who frame us and they lie to us.
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.840]  And if we don't let them lie about us and we actually say, no, actually, what you're
[38:42.840 --> 38:44.680]  bringing up isn't true.
[38:44.680 --> 38:45.680]  Yours was actually really true.
[38:45.680 --> 38:49.000]  Oh, so, you know, you're actually, you said Hillary fell down.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.680]  He goes, yeah, cause she did and he goes, but the campaign says she's fine.
[38:52.680 --> 38:56.640]  You know, the campaign's a bunch of liars and they thought that was a got you a moment,
[38:56.640 --> 38:57.640]  but it blew up.
[38:57.640 --> 38:58.640]  That shows how delusional they are.
[38:58.640 --> 39:01.560]  So in a way, just like mainstream media doesn't get it.
[39:01.560 --> 39:06.040]  Trump gets it because he's like a throwback to McCarthyism and stuff in a good way.
[39:06.040 --> 39:07.800]  But that's only his instincts.
[39:07.800 --> 39:11.120]  When he doesn't follow him, he's in the crap house.
[39:11.120 --> 39:13.000]  He's just like mainstream media.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.040]  He's just like old people.
[39:14.040 --> 39:16.280]  He still doesn't get it.
[39:16.280 --> 39:19.880]  He doesn't understand new media at all.
[39:19.880 --> 39:26.320]  He has great, here's a great example that I use, which is why has Trump given multiple
[39:26.320 --> 39:30.600]  exclusive interviews to the New York Times, but he's never sat down with Bill Mitchell,
[39:30.600 --> 39:32.840]  who, you know, you're a controversial guy.
[39:32.840 --> 39:36.440]  I'm a controversial guy, even though the media lies about us like I understand.
[39:36.440 --> 39:40.240]  But Mitchell is very well spoken, looks great, right down the line.
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.120]  The perfect kind of guy to be in the Trump administration.
[39:43.120 --> 39:44.120]  No.
[39:44.120 --> 39:45.120]  Right.
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.680]  I would just give the guy an interview and completely change Bill Mitchell's business
[39:49.680 --> 39:50.680]  overnight.
[39:50.680 --> 39:54.400]  Bill Mitchell would get 10 times bigger and that'd be nothing but good for Trump.
[39:54.400 --> 39:55.400]  Exactly.
[39:55.400 --> 39:57.160]  And Trump doesn't care about Bill Mitchell.
[39:57.160 --> 39:58.520]  Bill Mitchell is on there.
[39:58.520 --> 40:01.040]  You know, Trump cheerleader leads the Trump cheerleading squad.
[40:01.040 --> 40:02.040]  Trump doesn't care.
[40:02.040 --> 40:04.280]  Trump doesn't say, you know what, Bill, you're a great guy.
[40:04.280 --> 40:07.480]  I want to do an interview with you, somebody who actually likes you.
[40:07.480 --> 40:09.800]  Could you imagine Bill Mitchell as press secretary?
[40:09.800 --> 40:12.080]  I mean, he's good on every topic.
[40:12.080 --> 40:13.080]  Exactly.
[40:13.080 --> 40:17.040]  So even if that's not an administration job, there's no reason Trump can't sit down with
[40:17.040 --> 40:18.040]  him.
[40:18.040 --> 40:19.520]  That's, that's new media.
[40:19.520 --> 40:23.360]  Sit down with Bill Mitchell, give Bill Mitchell that one hour exclusive interview.
[40:23.360 --> 40:25.000]  You know, but they don't want to do that.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  Bannon went on 60 minutes.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.240]  I told Bannon, I said, Bannon, you need to try to go on the Joe Rogan podcast or Dave
[40:30.240 --> 40:33.080]  Reuben or something during the Don Jr. stuff.
[40:33.080 --> 40:35.360]  And I said, you should go on Alex Jones and do new media.
[40:35.360 --> 40:37.320]  Bannon didn't get it either.
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.600]  So they, they, they, they think like you get on the establishment, you've arrived.
[40:41.600 --> 40:42.600]  No.
[40:42.600 --> 40:48.000]  And as I get on these big things, the audience doesn't even like it unless you totally overthrow
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  the tables.
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.160]  Like I did on Pierce Morgan.
[40:50.160 --> 40:51.160]  It's a joke.
[40:51.160 --> 40:56.840]  If I go on one little Christian station in Alabama and plug my videos, I would sell a
[40:56.840 --> 40:57.840]  thousand copies.
[40:57.840 --> 41:00.800]  I'd go on CNN and plug it and sell none.
[41:00.800 --> 41:02.200]  There's zombies watching.
[41:02.200 --> 41:03.600]  It's background noise.
[41:03.600 --> 41:05.760]  It's elevator music.
[41:05.760 --> 41:06.760]  People are not listening.
[41:06.760 --> 41:07.760]  Well, yeah.
[41:07.760 --> 41:11.560]  And actually NBC wanted to do a big interview with me.
[41:11.560 --> 41:16.560]  And I told the guy who seemed like a nice guy said, I go, look me in no offense, but
[41:16.560 --> 41:22.400]  I'm just bored with people coming in and trying to bring up irrelevant stuff because it doesn't
[41:22.400 --> 41:23.400]  move the needle for me.
[41:23.400 --> 41:27.600]  Being on NBC for me just doesn't move the needle at all.
[41:27.600 --> 41:28.600]  60 minutes.
[41:28.600 --> 41:29.600]  I didn't sell any books.
[41:29.600 --> 41:31.160]  Alex, 15 million people watched.
[41:31.160 --> 41:34.080]  I sold zero books, not at all.
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.000]  So I'm thinking my God, I went on HBO vice.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.480]  They spent 13 hours with me, 13 hours.
[41:40.480 --> 41:44.320]  I didn't sell one book of Gorilla Mindset from that video.
[41:44.320 --> 41:49.160]  But when I come on your show and I talk about how Gorilla Mindset has over a thousand reviews
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.960]  on Amazon and also a hundred just like that, people go, oh, wow, over a thousand reviews
[41:53.960 --> 41:54.960]  on Amazon.
[41:54.960 --> 41:55.960]  Like almost no.
[41:55.960 --> 41:58.160]  Because we have an awake, active audience.
[41:58.160 --> 41:59.840]  It's a totally different world.
[41:59.840 --> 42:01.080]  And that's why they hate M4s.
[42:01.080 --> 42:02.080]  Not because of me.
[42:02.080 --> 42:05.320]  It's because of all the guests and that we're awake and we have an audience as awake.
[42:05.320 --> 42:07.440]  That's why I keep telling the audience, you're the secret.
[42:07.440 --> 42:09.080]  Stop telling me how great I am.
[42:09.080 --> 42:14.280]  They see M4s and other outlets like ours and yours as focal points of awake people.
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.480]  And that's what they want to shut down is that we're able to come together and realize
[42:17.480 --> 42:18.480]  we're not alone.
[42:18.480 --> 42:20.880]  Well, and they hate the liberals too.
[42:20.880 --> 42:21.880]  They hate Dave Rubin.
[42:21.880 --> 42:24.840]  Dave Rubin's channel is constantly under attack.
[42:24.840 --> 42:30.040]  They hate Joe Rogan because Joe Rogan is talking about Seth Rich and saying, man, this is really
[42:30.040 --> 42:31.040]  weird.
[42:31.040 --> 42:33.840]  The problem is Joe is so popular right now.
[42:33.840 --> 42:34.840]  That's why I worry about him.
[42:34.840 --> 42:36.880]  I think they might frame him for something.
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.600]  Joe is so popular that they can't go after him the way they've gone after the Rubin
[42:41.600 --> 42:42.600]  report.
[42:42.600 --> 42:43.600]  So Dave Rubin is a liberal.
[42:43.600 --> 42:45.080]  Jordan Peterson is a liberal.
[42:45.080 --> 42:48.720]  So even if you're a liberal, if you're waking people up and getting people to think for
[42:48.720 --> 42:54.160]  themselves and not be zombies, they're going to target you so it isn't even a war on conservatives
[42:54.160 --> 42:55.160]  per se.
[42:55.160 --> 42:57.280]  It's a war on independence.
[42:57.280 --> 42:58.280]  It's a war on independence.
[42:58.280 --> 42:59.280]  We'll be back with calls.
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.160]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWarsLife.
[43:03.160 --> 43:06.720]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[43:06.720 --> 43:10.000]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.320]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[43:17.320 --> 43:19.780]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[43:19.780 --> 43:24.280]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[43:24.280 --> 43:26.720]  reactive oxygen species.
[43:26.720 --> 43:31.880]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[43:31.880 --> 43:34.800]  these reactive oxygen species.
[43:34.800 --> 43:39.840]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.640]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[43:44.640 --> 43:47.320]  species and other free radicals.
[43:47.320 --> 43:52.480]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[45:29.760 --> 45:34.760]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[45:34.760 --> 45:38.800]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[45:38.800 --> 45:44.600]  Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.080]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[45:48.080 --> 45:51.560]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.640]  Harvest Rights is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[45:59.880 --> 46:05.360]  InfoWars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and
[46:05.360 --> 46:06.360]  for a good reason.
[46:06.360 --> 46:10.120]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were, what
[46:10.120 --> 46:14.680]  were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.720]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[46:19.720 --> 46:23.480]  We only have 150% and then it helps funder operation.
[46:23.480 --> 46:26.280]  Well now it's 50% off.
[46:26.280 --> 46:33.000]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that
[46:33.000 --> 46:34.640]  takes about seven days to kick in.
[46:34.640 --> 46:40.080]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together, it's the mind and body challenge.
[46:40.080 --> 46:47.160]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.360]  combo at InfoWarsLife.com, but it's got to end in a couple days because both of these
[46:52.360 --> 46:58.120]  best sellers are about to sell out InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and real red
[46:58.120 --> 47:03.440]  pill today.
[47:03.440 --> 47:06.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:06.440 --> 47:17.200]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth, a lie.
[47:17.200 --> 47:19.200]  No man is obsolete.
[47:19.200 --> 47:24.160]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth, you're on anachronism like a ghost from another time.
[47:24.160 --> 47:29.200]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.320]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misformed little creature who has
[47:35.320 --> 47:37.360]  no purpose here, no meaning.
[47:37.360 --> 47:39.040]  I am a human being.
[47:39.040 --> 47:46.680]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like a wind.
[47:46.680 --> 47:47.840]  I don't care.
[47:47.840 --> 47:49.440]  I tell you I don't care.
[47:49.440 --> 47:50.440]  I'm a human being.
[47:50.440 --> 47:51.440]  I exist.
[47:51.440 --> 47:58.240]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives even after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[47:58.240 --> 48:05.720]  Illusions, Mr. Wordsworth, delusions, that you inject into your veins to make you think
[48:05.720 --> 48:09.120]  you have a strength when you have no strength at all.
[48:09.120 --> 48:16.760]  You have nothing but spindly limp to the dream and mistake has no use for your kind.
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.360]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[48:20.360 --> 48:23.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.000]  We got phones loaded with great people, great comments about the gun grabbing, about Trump
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  on Russia, you name it.
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  Mike Cernovich is our guest.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.520]  Mike, you were getting to a point where we hit break, finish up with that.
[48:32.520 --> 48:33.920]  And then I was getting into Russia.
[48:33.920 --> 48:37.920]  How the more he expands operations against Russia, the more they say, oh, look, you're
[48:37.920 --> 48:38.920]  just backing off.
[48:38.920 --> 48:40.560]  You're going to get us off your back.
[48:40.560 --> 48:41.560]  And then it's just made up.
[48:41.560 --> 48:42.960]  I'm not in love with Russia.
[48:42.960 --> 48:47.240]  The Communist China is so, so in control of our country at so many levels.
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.160]  I just wish Americans realized how perilous the situation was.
[48:51.160 --> 48:52.160]  So please continue.
[48:52.160 --> 48:53.160]  Yeah.
[48:53.160 --> 49:00.520]  The Trump is not a bad person, the issue is that he surrounded himself with really dumb
[49:00.520 --> 49:01.520]  advisors.
[49:01.520 --> 49:05.080]  I don't know, for example, if you saw the GOP ad, I don't want to single it out too
[49:05.080 --> 49:09.400]  much because it's a good kid, a high school kid, but the GOP goes, oh, this kid is going
[49:09.400 --> 49:12.320]  to use his tax cut to pay for college.
[49:12.320 --> 49:15.760]  And the answer is like, well, no, the college is too expensive to do that.
[49:15.760 --> 49:19.240]  And two, tax cuts aren't how you get the youth vote.
[49:19.240 --> 49:21.800]  But if you're the GOP, that's what they think.
[49:21.800 --> 49:22.800]  Oh, tax cuts.
[49:22.800 --> 49:23.800]  I don't realize.
[49:23.800 --> 49:29.640]  No, college kids can't write Trump and chalk on the sidewalk without facing death threats.
[49:29.640 --> 49:30.640]  That's what matters to you.
[49:30.640 --> 49:31.800]  The issue is the free speech.
[49:31.800 --> 49:33.880]  The issue is the authoritarian left.
[49:33.880 --> 49:37.880]  The issue is that they're out of control, but the old elites are so used to living in
[49:37.880 --> 49:38.880]  freedom.
[49:38.880 --> 49:41.880]  They have no idea we've got a giant Bolshevik's infection.
[49:41.880 --> 49:42.880]  Exactly.
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.200]  Our leg is rotting off with green pus coming out and the Republican establishment's playing
[49:48.200 --> 49:49.200]  golf.
[49:49.200 --> 49:50.200]  Yeah.
[49:50.200 --> 49:53.400]  So you wear a Trump hat on a college campus, so kick you out of class.
[49:53.400 --> 49:57.040]  There was a student kicked out of class for claiming that there were only two genders,
[49:57.040 --> 50:00.640]  even though that was the topic of the discussion for debate.
[50:00.640 --> 50:02.520]  There's nothing from this from the Republicans.
[50:02.520 --> 50:04.080]  There's nothing from this from Trump.
[50:04.080 --> 50:10.120]  So the issue is that Trump has buffoons all around him, GOP Stooges.
[50:10.120 --> 50:14.280]  His number one advisor is now a guy by the name of Johnny De Stefano, whose previous
[50:14.280 --> 50:18.000]  job was driving John Boiner to spray tants.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.760]  Last who he has, that's kind of the running inside joke is how Johnny De Stefano, who
[50:22.760 --> 50:27.360]  his last job is taking John Boiner to a spray tan appointment, how does that become Trump's
[50:27.360 --> 50:28.360]  chief advisor?
[50:28.360 --> 50:31.360]  Well, it really does say it all.
[50:31.360 --> 50:37.560]  So these people are telling Trump, and this is why I threw a big fit about the omnibus
[50:37.560 --> 50:38.560]  bill.
[50:38.560 --> 50:39.560]  People go, Cernovich, you're fair weather.
[50:39.560 --> 50:40.560]  You're this.
[50:40.560 --> 50:41.760]  I go, first of all, I'm not fair weather or anything.
[50:41.760 --> 50:42.760]  I don't work for the GOP.
[50:42.760 --> 50:43.760]  I don't work for Trump.
[50:43.760 --> 50:49.160]  I don't work for the people, and my job is that when you turn into a Mike Cernovich transmission,
[50:49.160 --> 50:52.440]  you don't know what you're going to get because you know that I always bring the fire.
[50:52.440 --> 50:57.880]  So what I told people though is, if you supported Trump signing the omnibus bill, Johnny De
[50:57.880 --> 51:02.520]  Stefano and all these other advisors are going to say, see, see, Don, you know, we told
[51:02.520 --> 51:04.840]  you that this was no big deal.
[51:04.840 --> 51:05.840]  You're based, wouldn't care.
[51:05.840 --> 51:07.840]  And then Trump will say, oh yeah, you guys are real smart.
[51:07.840 --> 51:08.840]  You guys are real right.
[51:08.840 --> 51:11.880]  And then they get more to understand that we don't stay on Trump.
[51:11.880 --> 51:14.520]  He will get influenced by the people around him.
[51:14.520 --> 51:15.520]  Exactly.
[51:15.520 --> 51:20.320]  So when we push back and then that gets on Fox News, Trump goes, well, wait a minute,
[51:20.320 --> 51:22.080]  you guys told me this was a good idea.
[51:22.080 --> 51:26.280]  You guys told me that the people weren't going to care and they do care.
[51:26.280 --> 51:31.640]  So that's why we have to raise a holy heck whenever Trump does something like the omnibus
[51:31.640 --> 51:32.640]  bill.
[51:32.640 --> 51:35.680]  But likewise, we don't want to be negative and when he does great things and he's done
[51:35.680 --> 51:36.680]  many amazing things.
[51:36.680 --> 51:41.560]  Sure, all the stuff he was planning for 20 years, China, the economy, all this he's
[51:41.560 --> 51:43.440]  doing is that's what he believes in.
[51:43.440 --> 51:48.320]  But the problem is he only watches basically Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, as you said, the New
[51:48.320 --> 51:53.000]  York Times, they try to keep info wars, your material away from him.
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.400]  And so that's why this is happening.
[51:54.400 --> 51:55.640]  We've come so far.
[51:55.640 --> 51:59.640]  I want to go to some phone calls here, but what about the Russia situation?
[51:59.640 --> 52:05.200]  I mean, that is really dangerous because there's no evidence Russian nerve gas these people.
[52:05.200 --> 52:07.280]  And now we're just barreling towards war.
[52:07.280 --> 52:13.240]  Yeah, well, they've always wanted World War Three and it looks like we're now going to
[52:13.240 --> 52:19.080]  have a proxy war in Syria and it'll be the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[52:19.080 --> 52:23.640]  I don't know if you saw this, but there are things that you can watch that if you're woke,
[52:23.640 --> 52:25.040]  you know what is happening.
[52:25.040 --> 52:31.760]  So there was a bunch of news footage of Saudi anti air strike missiles shooting so-called
[52:31.760 --> 52:33.360]  Iranian missiles.
[52:33.360 --> 52:36.840]  And then that went viral and you're like, well, wait a minute.
[52:36.840 --> 52:39.600]  Why is that clip going viral?
[52:39.600 --> 52:43.200]  So we'll talk about the Trump Russian diplomats, but something important yesterday happened
[52:43.200 --> 52:48.600]  that all woke people notice is whenever you're starting to see a new messaging, you're like,
[52:48.600 --> 52:49.600]  oh, wait a minute.
[52:49.600 --> 52:52.320]  They got their talking points now from the deep state.
[52:52.320 --> 52:56.720]  Oh, that's how I mean, they still attack us with stuff that Podesta wrote two years ago.
[52:56.720 --> 53:00.080]  You know, gay frogs, nobody died in Newtown all exactly.
[53:00.080 --> 53:04.280]  So you see the new talking points coming out that Saudi Arabia is going to help in Syria.
[53:04.280 --> 53:08.600]  Saudi Arabia's got weapons to fight Iran, if Iran attacks them, it's the idea that Iran's
[53:08.600 --> 53:10.360]  getting ready to attack.
[53:10.360 --> 53:11.360]  Exactly.
[53:11.360 --> 53:15.600]  So, so you're now seeing these great viral videos and I retweeted one of the videos yesterday.
[53:15.600 --> 53:19.840]  They go, the Houthi rebels and Yemen backed by Iran.
[53:19.840 --> 53:24.680]  So you're like, wait a minute, now that they're doing this brilliant propaganda because they're
[53:24.680 --> 53:27.640]  going to propagandize us into war.
[53:27.640 --> 53:29.120]  So war is coming.
[53:29.120 --> 53:34.120]  The movie is the movie is turning dark and it's going to be there was even an article
[53:34.120 --> 53:38.920]  is Saudi Arabia opened up planes to Israeli air airspace for the first time.
[53:38.920 --> 53:43.600]  So now the Saudis and the Israelis in the United States and the Saudis are secretly
[53:43.600 --> 53:46.640]  meeting with Israel every day in Cairo.
[53:46.640 --> 53:47.640]  Exactly.
[53:47.640 --> 53:48.840]  And so they don't have to put pressure on Trump.
[53:48.840 --> 53:51.320]  A lot of wild stuff behind the scenes getting more confused.
[53:51.320 --> 53:52.840]  Tell me there's wars coming.
[53:52.840 --> 53:53.840]  He's got to defend America.
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.480]  Get it all rolling and they go, sir, this will get us out of the Russia thing, even
[53:58.480 --> 53:59.920]  though it's not true.
[53:59.920 --> 54:04.960]  Be hardline with Russia, which is in Syria and then get with Saudi Arabia and exactly
[54:04.960 --> 54:06.200]  in the whole thing unfolds.
[54:06.200 --> 54:07.200]  Yes.
[54:07.200 --> 54:09.200]  So we're headed towards World War three.
[54:09.200 --> 54:12.480]  I've told people that you're crazy.
[54:12.480 --> 54:19.320]  If you're not stacking up survival food, survival water, Nacey and iodine, I have, I, I have
[54:19.320 --> 54:20.320]  it.
[54:20.320 --> 54:21.720]  I use the, um, the infowars iodine.
[54:21.720 --> 54:23.120]  People go, what supplements do you take?
[54:23.120 --> 54:28.000]  And I go, I take like 50 different supplements and I do take the iodine because we have
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.840]  to realize that it's, it's coming and I'm not a doomsday person.
[54:32.840 --> 54:37.200]  When people watch me, that if anything, they're like, why aren't you freaking out more?
[54:37.200 --> 54:40.840]  This is a bigger deal than you make it out to be, but people have to have canned foods
[54:40.840 --> 54:41.840]  or survival foods.
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.720]  It's about to say even mainstream news admits that the billionaires are fleeing to New Zealand.
[54:46.720 --> 54:48.560]  They built the bases years ago.
[54:48.560 --> 54:49.800]  Now they're leaving.
[54:49.800 --> 54:50.800]  That's in the news.
[54:50.800 --> 54:51.800]  The jets are leaving.
[54:51.800 --> 54:52.800]  They're saying, we're gone.
[54:52.800 --> 54:55.000]  What are they thinking?
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.280]  All this travel from Argentina to Antarctica, right?
[54:59.280 --> 55:00.280]  What's going on there?
[55:00.280 --> 55:04.000]  And in article, there's all this travel and all of a sudden this new found interest.
[55:04.000 --> 55:05.000]  What's going on?
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.320]  So when you, when you watch the, when you watch the news, you're like, wait a minute, the news
[55:09.320 --> 55:14.640]  is now telling us that we should like Saudi Arabia, even though they sponsored 9 11.
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.240]  We just did a, how big of a arms deal now with the Saudis.
[55:18.240 --> 55:22.000]  I think one billion Saudis are going to get nuclear, nuclear technology.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.960]  Oh, the Saudis like Israel for the first time.
[55:24.960 --> 55:27.680]  For the first time, use their airspace.
[55:27.680 --> 55:33.640]  Oh, and the Saudis are shooting down missiles by rebels in Yemeni given them by Iran.
[55:33.640 --> 55:38.480]  So anybody intelligent sees the table as being set for World War three.
[55:38.480 --> 55:42.800]  Well, I got to tell you, it's an incredible time to be alive.
[55:42.800 --> 55:46.200]  And we got the left, the global is trying to shut down free speech, trying to take our
[55:46.200 --> 55:47.700]  second amendment.
[55:47.700 --> 55:52.440]  World War three, Iran vows to obliterate Israel in 25 years as Middle East engines escalate.
[55:52.440 --> 55:53.440]  It's all insane.
[55:53.440 --> 55:56.440]  You know, I promise to go to all these calls, we'll go to break up, go to Jeremy, I promise
[55:56.440 --> 55:57.440]  and a few others.
[55:57.440 --> 56:01.760]  And I'll try to go some into the next guest that's coming on to guest host with us, Gerald
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.080]  Salente, always informative, but a few more minutes with Mike Cernovich just briefly.
[56:06.080 --> 56:07.080]  We got to pray.
[56:07.080 --> 56:08.080]  We got to be involved.
[56:08.080 --> 56:09.280]  We got to reach out to the White House.
[56:09.280 --> 56:12.760]  You've got to call, talk radio, you know, they hate info wars as we can force the story
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.480]  out that then just picked up by the rest of talk radio and then Fox News.
[56:16.480 --> 56:21.080]  And so get these issues out, however you see them, however you take what we've said, make
[56:21.080 --> 56:23.000]  up your own mind because we're not giving you talking points.
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.040]  We're just having a discussion and let's let's raise this alarm about World War three, about
[56:27.040 --> 56:31.080]  a new Cold War with Christian Russia, about the police state here at home, about the attack
[56:31.080 --> 56:36.720]  on free speech, about the gun grabbers, about Jordan Soros and just realize that most of
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.520]  us can't afford a bunker to run the New Zealand.
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.520]  I know I can.
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.320]  So please let's pray for peace for peace and let's pray for great awakening.
[56:43.320 --> 56:47.040]  Briefly before we go to break them back a few more minutes with Mike Cernovich, it calls.
[56:47.040 --> 56:52.360]  We sell products here to fund their operation and we have the great new tropic brain force,
[56:52.360 --> 56:56.200]  which is about to sell out in the next few days, but I'm going to head doing 50% off.
[56:56.200 --> 56:59.160]  This war comes in in two weeks, 1995.

[57:02.600 --> 57:04.600]  This is really high quality stuff.
[57:04.600 --> 57:06.640]  Normally at $39, it's a good deal.

[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  hormones.

[57:34.560 --> 57:37.520]  So again, it's an incredible time to be alive.
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.080]  I personally think we're going to make it out of this.
[57:39.080 --> 57:42.240]  It's God's grace, but we got to be focused and involved.

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:33.280]  Well we knew it, going back a month ago we knew the Democrats were organizing select
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:38.960]  young people to go out and be anti-gun spokesperson to launch a nationwide youth movement against
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960]  guns.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.960]  It's not just earlier of movements being launched on MSNBC to have young people bully their
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:51.080]  parents into signing pledges that they will, in fact here it is right here, promise to
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:01:00.000]  kids contract that we will vote for legislative leaders who support our children's safety
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.760]  over guns, but I thought it's guns protecting our children.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.960]  I thought it was Broward County, Coward County standing down.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.480]  Why are you blaming gun owners?
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.920]  Mass shootings only kill 40-something people a year, it's still too many.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.360]  But why are you hyping all this and then saying I as a father that protect my children with
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.200]  firearms or that police officers that protect people, that somehow we're collectively to
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:28.640]  blame when a jihadi runs over somebody, they don't say the trucks to blame.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.800]  So now we have definitive proof that this is AstroTurf.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.720]  Now we have definitive proof funded by Soros, the women's march, the Democratic Party that
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:43.840]  less than 10% even MSNBC admits we're about to play the clip of the people at those events.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:48.320]  At these anti-gun events were actually even young people, it was mainly the Department
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.480]  of Education and government workers and Democrats, the exact same speakers, the same crowds we
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.880]  saw with Linda Sorcerer and the women's march that Soros spent 287 million on the day after
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.960]  Trump's inauguration.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.600]  I was there, I saw hundreds of buses just on the streets, I was and we didn't block
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.560]  them from marching to the mall the day before, they beat us up, they attack women and children,
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:15.040]  they wouldn't let people into the Trump event and CNN showed the rally before the gates
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.880]  even opened and said no one was there to hear Trump.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.400]  That's the weaponized evil, that's the globalist and CNN and MSNBC.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.720]  So let's go to MSNBC admitting one more piece of evidence that this was totally synthetic
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.560]  AstroTurf and when I pointed that out a month ago, they made a good run at banning me off
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.680]  YouTube and still thousands of other channels like the health ranger and others are still
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.040]  banned and thousands of gun channels are being banned, this is the assault.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.880]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.240]  Talk about the makeup of this crowd in the protests this weekend, who was there, how
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.440]  many first timers and what impact do you think it's going to have in the long run in American
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440]  politics?
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.920]  Well, these are great questions show, I mean first and foremost, I think it's important
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.720]  to note here that while young people mobilize people to participate, what's really interesting
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.720]  is that less than 10% of the people in the crowd were actually under the age of 18.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.680]  So that's 90% of the people there who actually can vote today.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.640]  In addition to that, I think what's really important is that it turned out over a quarter
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.000]  of the people who had never participated in a protest before.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.120]  So these are people who are mobilizing around the issue potentially.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.120]  And finally, I think what's really interesting is that 16% of them were politically moderate
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.600]  and that's the highest percentage of moderates that I've seen at any of these protest events
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600]  since the inauguration.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  Alright, so let's stop right there.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.240]  Yeah, they call themselves moderate because they're told, you're moderate, you're not
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.840]  anti-gun and the schools organize them and they say I'm going to give you all your credit
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.840]  for the year.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.400]  Hog brags that he's getting all his credits by not going to school and doing this.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.880]  So they basically get given their diplomas if they go out, they get given their grades
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.120]  if they do this.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.280]  But hiding in plain view, there is the facts.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.480]  Jack Pasobit was there, he shot the video of just one road, looks like a hundred buses.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:14.560]  But I was in DC, I left that Saturday after the inauguration on Friday and it took us
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.040]  two hours to get to the airport because there were so many buses going out of town and they
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:25.360]  were just, I mean, I saw hundreds of buses just on the routes where I was getting out.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.320]  And it was a million, million and a half women and they were Department of Education, they
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.040]  were wearing the stupid pink hats.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.480]  They were there and this is who they are, this is the government, this is the bureaucrats.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.280]  These are the people that want to run this country, they want flowered in pebbin.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.960]  We'll talk with Jack Pasobit how we counter it, is Trump starting to go sideways on us?
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.360]  The big news on China and their warships threatening blood and war, I forgot that part.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:58.520]  The battle, the Chinese dictator, Xi Jinping, it's all coming up, stay with us.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.280]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.440]  We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.440]  for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.120]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best selling formulas out there, it's
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.120]  very simple.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.320]  We went out and looked, what is the top, what is the best, we'll just put even more product
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.320]  in, we'll make it better.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.480]  We're making competitors, put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it,
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]  and sell it for $30.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:31.480]  It's $19.95 right now, so you get an incredible top of the line new tropic for $19.95.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:37.240]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15, $20 we make to fund this
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.200]  operation in the face of the global, the rest of it, but I'm doing this because we got a
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.800]  ton of it coming in in two weeks, I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.960]  in, and I want people that haven't tried, BrainForce, to try it and find out why, it's
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:06:19.800]  got $6,000 plus, five star reviews, it's amazing, infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com, or AAA
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:33.120]  Wars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jack Pasobic joins us for the hour, I intend to open the phones
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.400]  up coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm Alex Jones, your host, Jack Pasobic, of course
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:48.080]  his lead citizen for Trump.com, one of the top three biggest citizen Trump organizations
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080]  out there.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.560]  He also got outed as being a naval intelligence, not that that was a bad thing last year, they
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.640]  said the president tweets him, but he's really a naval intelligence, he should be kicked
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.160]  out of the Navy because the president likes him.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.960]  That's how whacked out the globalist star, he's on Twitter at Jack Pasobic, he's a great
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.920]  investigative journalist, he shot video of hundreds, it's like an hour long video of
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:14.360]  him walking down the road, hundreds of these buses, I mean just every major road is just
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:20.160]  filled with them, BuzzFeed and others admit, Soros is funding it, the Million Mom March,
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.280]  all of it is funding it.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:28.520]  So I want to get his take on the Supreme Court justice coming out, John Paul Stevens, former
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.840]  justice saying it's time to repeal the Second Amendment, have nationwide gun confiscation,
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.160]  you can read it in his editorial article in the New York Times, we've also got Wasserman
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.400]  Schultz once background checks for ammunition buyers, it just goes on and on, that's up
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:50.400]  on info wars.com, sociologists less than 10% of the marchers for lives, participants
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:57.880]  were children, Trump set sites to extraditionally ban bump stocks, he is really appeasing them,
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:04.120]  that is a huge mistake, so we've got all those reports on what's happening on that front,
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:09.440]  this is quite a time to be alive, and also if you just joined us, I should have led the
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.880]  broadcast with this, but the open calls to repeal the Second Amendment all over CNBC,
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:23.640]  MSNBC, CNN, everywhere, China sends massive Navy for South China Sea War games after President
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:29.080]  Xi Jinping vows to wage bloody battle for world domination, so Pasobic can specifically speak
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.080]  to this as he's lived in China, he's been in the Navy, he's been stationed over there,
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.760]  he's been in naval intelligence, Russia, China eclipsed US in hypersonic missiles, promoting
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.080]  fears, the Hill, FCC wants Chinese tech out of US phones and routers, I told you about
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.800]  that 15 years ago, so you get next year's news today, now it's mainstream news from
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:56.400]  the FCC, yeah folks, Russia is not the issue other than their hypersonic satan missile,
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.640]  that's what we call it, the rest of it, by the way if you think they really got stuff
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:06.320]  faster, the stuff you see is US 1980s technology, but it doesn't matter, we can all still kill
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.800]  each other, it's stupid, six countries are planning state boycotts in the 2018 World
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.640]  Cup, child gangs fight for garbage on Venezuela streets, more video of that, the heaven of
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:23.120]  socialism that Bernie Sanders wants to give us, that is just some of what we've got and
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:28.600]  Obama and Hillary violated federal laws coming out in the news with Facebook fully behind
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:34.680]  them in both campaigns, that's right, so this Cambridge Analytica thing, they work for everybody,
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:39.160]  but by the media going after this and telling the big secret that Facebook's a giant data
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:45.760]  mining, the Democrats are blowing up their own ship, there's a lot to cover, congratulations
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:49.280]  on getting married and all the great stuff you're doing and still doing the great work,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.840]  I see it's so prolific as you reach millions a day, I know you've got a lot of exciting
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.120]  stuff to be announcing soon, we can't get into on air, but congratulations on all your
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.600]  great work, what do you want to tackle first of that palette of information I just laid
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600]  out?
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.480]  Thanks, Alex, I appreciate your kind words there and Maui appreciates it as well, so
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:13.400]  we just had the March for Our Lives here in Washington D.C., that video I shot on Saturday,
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:19.080]  of course the March for Our Lives got huge coverage in the mainstream media, the press,
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.920]  but the March for Life, the pro life march that was just held last month in D.C. that
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.720]  I also attended, was not covered in the mainstream media, it was covered, if they did they gave
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.080]  a thimble of worth of coverage to it and they covered a little bit of President Trump's
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.240]  remarks, President Trump has been called the greatest pro life president we've ever had,
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:41.320]  but the media didn't cover that, instead they covered this thing and so we were told, you
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.000]  know, we were told that this was spontaneous, that it was an organic outflowing of passion
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  and emotion.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.880]  And that was a lie, that was a lie, that is a lie.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.800]  Yeah, as I went there, I mean, you could see the level of organization and Alex, to be
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:59.000]  quite honest, I've never seen so much organization for a private event and I've never seen so
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.840]  much security as they had, this was presidential level security they had there from private
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.800]  security services, from D.C. police and from National Guard military vehicles that were
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.440]  brought out onto the streets of D.C. This was something that D.C. hasn't seen this level
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.040]  of security since President Trump's inauguration, I know you saw that.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:23.080]  And by the way, you were there, I was there, they ordered the D.C. police to stand down
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.840]  at most of the entrances and not let people in, that came out on the news, the police
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:33.520]  said that, so Trump is classy, he gave massive protection to this Soros march when the Democrats
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.640]  wouldn't give us protection.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.280]  That's exactly right, and of course there were no issues with this march whatsoever.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.040]  Now, one interesting thing that was going on as well is that this game they're playing
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.920]  with the numbers, they're trying to say that this was bigger, but actually the women's
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.240]  march was much bigger than this event, this only had about 200,000.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.640]  The way they did it was, they crammed everyone onto Pennsylvania Avenue and sort of instead
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.640]  of the big wide Washington mall, the national mall that's right there, so you can still
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:04.040]  get that background shot of Capitol Hill, but the street itself, it's a D.C. street,
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.520]  it's much more narrow.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.000]  So it seems like it's a lot of people, it was actually almost half the size of the women's
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  march.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.640]  And by the way, this is something I noticed with mainstream media, they've only got 10
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.480]  tight gunners out, they get them all together and then shoot up towards the Capitol here
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.480]  in Austin.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480]  It's the same trick.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:24.320]  You could tell those over the headshots were in streets, all crammed in at the stage like
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:30.200]  it was a rock concert, and again, the Capitol Police estimated 300 to 400,000, as you said,
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.120]  seeing in and others claimed a million, you were there, you're estimating 200,000.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.160]  I'd say 200 to 250 tops.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.920]  I mean, even that street itself, you can see that some of the lanes are blocked off from
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.240]  security cordons.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.640]  Of course they built major barricades around this whole thing.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.080]  They built a wall as a matter of fact, and you couldn't get anywhere near the stage.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.800]  They have, because of the way it was all crammed in, so they had TVs all over the place.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.960]  I kind of ducked out after, after a little while because it was clear that they weren't
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.840]  even allowing people to get up to the front.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.240]  They just wanted their TV shots.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.280]  You were there, I was watching on C-Span as they rolled loops of Ted Nugent, myself, Dana
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.400]  Loesch, and the crowd would chant, how bizarre was it actually be there?
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.000]  You know, it was really weird because when they showed Dana Loesch and yourself and Ted
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.120]  Nugent and everybody else, you know, I saw that and I said, yeah, I don't really have
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.080]  a problem with anything anyone, anyone of these people are saying.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.320]  But then I realized that you could hear the crowd, they were being urged to boo.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.960]  They were being urged to sort of see, see everyone who was pro-gun as an enemy.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.640]  Everyone who talks about this as an enemy, so they were urging people to boo these videos.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.000]  They were urging people to see, see anyone as pro-second amendment as an enemy.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.840]  That's essentially what was trying to come up.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.120]  Oh, that's another thing.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.040]  Can we cue up the sheriff?
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.440]  I went and looked at Paul Watson's article on Info Wars.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.720]  I went and looked at Stephen Crowder's article.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:52.360]  I looked at stuff you tweeted that night.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.000]  And it looked like about a third of the signs said, we're going to ban all the guns.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.840]  We're going to kill you if you don't turn your guns in.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.000]  And then I heard talk like that from the speakers.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.320]  I saw other people.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.080]  This is a new theme where they're not denying they want to ban the second amendment.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:11.720]  What do you make of this calls to ban it and calls for violence?
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.440]  Well, you know, what's interesting is that, you know, I've talked to so many people in
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.240]  law enforcement and the military about this.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:22.120]  And I'd say a good sizeable amount of them are saying that they would not follow that
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.120]  order if that was given.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.560]  If that was ever given in our country, that people need to understand there are so many
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.320]  police officers, so many American military members that know that they swore no to the
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.840]  Constitution and that includes the second amendment.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.080]  And if that was ever given, you'd see a lot of badges in, in dustbins and trash bins.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.240]  If that actually happened, they were trying to confiscate guns because they're not, they're
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.200]  just not going to do it.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.600]  That being said, there may be troops, there may be police that would of course continue
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.440]  with that, with that order would comply with that order.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.160]  So you'd get this huge split kind of situation.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.080]  Just like happened in Russia in 1917, I was just going to say that exactly like Russia.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.520]  They get the central government and they kind of cut off the food and over a couple of years
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.320]  make us all turn everything in.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.680]  That is a real scenario.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.360]  They're talking about a civil war.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.960]  We're not the ones pushing this.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.400]  Why do you think they're suddenly going from denying they want the guns to officially saying
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.600]  in the New York Times everywhere, we want to completely ban them and confiscate them?
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.640]  They're overreaching as the left always does.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.640]  They're overreaching and telling you for once what they truly believe.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.680]  Usually they're, you know, Obama was smart enough to say that, oh, we just want regulations.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.480]  Then you actually saw the regulations and realized how bad it was.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.040]  Now they're coming out and specifically just saying what it is.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.520]  They want to ban guns, they want to ban air 15s, they want to ban what they call assault
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.520]  weapons.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.840]  Well, well, yeah, I mean, now they want to ban all the semi-autos, but now they just
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840]  say ban them all.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.520]  In fact, that's what he argues.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.640]  John Paul Stevens has go back to only black powder that all citizens can have.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.960]  I mean, talk about a recipe for crime and enslavement.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.440]  We'll be back with Jack Passo, but stay with us.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:02.080]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:08.840]  cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:14.800]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.320]  and other proteins better.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:23.520]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.720]  in fluorolife advanced restoration.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.280]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolife everyday maintenance, but all of
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:40.640]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.160]  affordable price.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.920]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.800]  When you purchase it at m4store.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.520]  and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.960]  InfoWarsLife Brainforce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960]  for a good reason.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.760]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nutropics were, what were
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.280]  most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.320]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:21.080]  We only have 150 percent, and then it helps funder operation.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.920]  So now it's 50 percent off.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.720]  That means we've got a 25 percent markup, and we've got it paired with the real red
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.280]  pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.640]  Brainforce takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.720]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.560]  They're both 50 percent off individually, or together they're 50 percent off and free
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.200]  shipping with the combo at m4warslife.com.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.600]  And it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:58.040]  out m4warslife.com to get your Brainforce Plus and real red pill today.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.080]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.680]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100 percent organic coffee on the
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680]  planet.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:11.240]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.600]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.920]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:27.320]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100 percent organic coffee at m4warslife.com.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:32.440]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.560]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.800]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.600]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.280]  Stop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.360]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:54.240]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.000]  my favorite coffee.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.160]  Available at m4warslife.com.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.080]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.440]  Introducing pollen block.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.600]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:15.400]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:21.280]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.600]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.280]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.600]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.600]  symptoms.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.480]  If pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.200]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:50.000]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.680]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:20:02.160]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:31.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:42.920]  This is Alex Jones, and I'm going to leave it at that, but tomorrow's news or next month's
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:47.480]  news today is our specialty, and we're just really excited to see the things that are
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.200]  happening in the media, in libertarian, nationalistic, conservative media.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:55.760]  Now, I want to shift gears into an area where you've got expertise living in China, being
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.440]  in the Navy, in the South China Sea, doing clandestine things that you obviously can't
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:05.120]  get into, Jack, with your great career in the Navy, and now fighting for the Republic
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.640]  right here in America.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.120]  What do you make of this headline?
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:15.120]  China sends massive Navy for South China Sea war games with the President, Xi Jinping
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.560]  vows to wage bloody battle for world domination.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:26.200]  Again, that ties into FCC wants Chinese tech out of U.S. phones routers.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.040]  They're able to kill our entire phone grid because they control the database, ladies
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.400]  and gentlemen, through this Swiss and Dutch companies that the Chinese own and control.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.200]  Apple is now merging with Communist China officially, giving them the keys to the kingdom.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.560]  That's mainstream news.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.200]  Talk about a national security threat.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.560]  Look, I'm not a Russophile.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.040]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.800]  I intend to go over there sometime and meet my bosses supposedly, but they're becoming
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800]  Christian.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800]  They're becoming nationalists.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.120]  Hollywood hates them because they're Christian, and I see all the things the President's doing
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.320]  with no proof of this nerve-gassing.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.040]  We don't even, they don't even say if this Russian and his daughter are alive or dead.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.560]  They won't give us any info.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:13.160]  This former GRU colonel, we're just told all these new sanctions, 14 countries, banned
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.520]  playing soccer in Russia, Putin's the enemy.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:22.480]  Meanwhile, from my research and just what's open source, China has a footprint thousands
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.360]  of times more intense in the U.S. They're taking over rare earth minerals.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.040]  They've got the huge Navy.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.800]  They've got submarines.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.800]  Their actual ground forces dwarf the Russians.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.800]  They're in our business.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800]  They're buying up Hollywood.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.800]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.840]  All I'm saying is I'm all about dealing with foreign enemies.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.040]  I'm all about U.S. dominance if we're projecting the American way of life.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:51.560]  But I see Russia lined up more and more with us and with the Trump nationalist agenda.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.200]  So what is Trump doing?
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.880]  Virtue signaling to the left, virtue signaling to neutralize Mueller and his fake investigation.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.720]  I mean, I see this as a serious problem.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.560]  So A, what do you make of Trump on this front?
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.560]  I'm not mad at him.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.560]  I trust him.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.560]  He's doing a great job.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.560]  Lightyear's better than Hillary.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.560]  Thank God.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.560]  The global is hating.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.480]  But still, what is going on here?
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:17.120]  It isn't very Trumpy in to give in to his critics and then destroy Detente with Russia.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.040]  And then what's the big enchilada with China, Jack Pesovic?
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.560]  Well, Alex, the president is trying to walk a fine line when it comes to Russia.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:29.720]  He's trying to, essentially, as you said, appease some of these critics of Russia, appease
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.440]  some of the, what's going out in terms of this screed pile situation, whether or not
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.880]  screed pile and his daughter are dead or not.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.880]  We don't even know.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.440]  He's trying, they're trying to appease critics.
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:42.840]  They're trying to push back on the Russia collusion narrative by being a little bit more
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.520]  heavy-handed when it comes to Russia on the diplomatic front.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.640]  That being said, the U.S. and Russia are also both involved in military operations in Syria,
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.720]  where they've got to fly a lot of de-confliction.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:57.920]  They've got to make sure there are situations where we're not killing Russian soldiers and
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:02.160]  obviously we don't want Russia attacking any of our troops that are on the ground there.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.280]  We do have troops on the ground in Syria, even though it's not talked about a lot.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.280]  So we have to be very vigilant of that.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.680]  And there is a lot of information and operation sharing that goes on just for that de-confliction.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.000]  Now, at the same time, what China is doing in turning around is, while all of this is
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  happening, Trump is trying to use China as leverage on North Korea right now.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.840]  They know that he needs their leverage.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.440]  That's why Kim Jong-un is in Beijing right now.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.920]  He took the armored train up there, the same one that his dad used to ride.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:35.160]  And they're using all of this to go and lay claim, really solidify their claim to the
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.640]  South China Sea.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.360]  They see it as the Chinese lake.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.800]  And they've drawn lines saying essentially that all of the Pacific should be part of
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.040]  China, should be China's sphere of influence.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.160]  And they're really laying down their markers hard on the South China Sea.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.600]  They were building islands, building bases there, armed bases there during the last bit
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.280]  of the Obama administration.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.160]  The Obama administration was very weak towards them.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.760]  They didn't really do too much with it.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.760]  So now they're waiting.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.080]  And while Trump is distracted on Russia and North Korea issues, they're using it to make
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.960]  their final push to grab the South China Sea and solidify it with a huge show force they're
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.760]  doing right now at this exercise, unprecedented for China, by the way, to do this kind of
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.840]  exercise so far off of the Chinese coast.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:19.040]  And normally, you know, we used to joke that the Chinese Navy was a brownwater Navy because
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.520]  they stayed so close to the coast.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.040]  Well, this is the first time that China is getting into the blue water in such a major
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.400]  show of force like this.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.720]  You could almost compare this in some ways.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.120]  It's not quite as big yet.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.720]  But if you remember back to our history, the great white fleet of Teddy Roosevelt in the
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.800]  early part of the 19th century, just about, excuse me, 20th century, just about a hundred
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.920]  years ago, that was really showing the U.S.'s dominance around the world.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.920]  Now, China has studied the U.S.
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:43.920]  Sure.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.160]  It's just like with the singing of the Maine and President McKinley and then the launch
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:52.880]  of the U.S. from a nation into a global empire, taking over the former Spanish and Portuguese
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.080]  polling stations throughout the Pacific and even the Southern Atlantic and Central Atlantic
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.320]  are absolutely right.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:05.080]  And China now sees itself modeling that in a major breakout into the world, but unlike
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:08.080]  the U.S., we just declared we had navigation rights.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.040]  They are declaring they control not just the South China Sea, but all the way down into
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.540]  the Philippines.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.640]  We haven't seen this since the Japanese did this in World War II.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.440]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.800]  In fact, a lot of this territory is the same territory where World War II was fought all
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:29.760]  the way from Iwo Jima, from Okinawa, which is very close to this area, to Taiwan, which
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.960]  of course is still under a major part of conflict between the two countries and all the way
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:39.760]  down to the Philippines, which the U.S. took in the Spanish-American War, 1898.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:45.480]  Now it's coming back to that's exactly right next to where the Philippines had had their
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.480]  territorial claim.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]  That's right.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.880]  And the Chinese are studying that and their war planners are admitting they're preparing
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.880]  for war.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:57.840]  So, by Xi Jinping, the dictator, he's ready for bloody to wage bloody battle for world
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.840]  domination.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.760]  I mean, talk about incredible rhetoric.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  What is going on there?
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.440]  At the last time that China got involved in this area, they had a skirmish with the Vietnamese
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:13.360]  in the 1970s over some of these islands, and they won, but they had a very bloody time
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:18.840]  of it because they had trouble getting their supplies out to sea there for these island
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.840]  battles.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.760]  Now, with these islands that they've created, these artificial islands are going to be outposts,
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.360]  coaling stations, supply stations, and possibly armed stations.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.800]  They could also put what they're trying to do is with their aircraft carrier, they're
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.080]  going to basically station an air wing down in the South China Sea and then use that for
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:39.560]  operations on and off that aircraft carrier and really project their air.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.560]  And let's be clear.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.400]  Imagine how much distance you get out of that.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.400]  And let's be clear.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.680]  Our navies bragged that they only had a brownwater navy.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.680]  Now they have a bluewater navy.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.440]  They've got a bluewater navy in their merchant fleet, which is Chinese intelligence, as you
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:58.320]  know, and they're more projected than we are globally into every sector of the planet.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.320]  Go ahead.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.320]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.480]  And this is something that we see with North Korea as well, that these civilian ships will
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.080]  be used for intelligence collection.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.640]  And occasionally with, with special forces, they were in China, they referred to sort
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:15.800]  of as the little green men, basically irregulars or ununiform members of the Chinese Communist
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.960]  Party or militia.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:17.960]  You'll see it.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.400]  Sometimes he referred to in Chinese writing in their newspapers and their academic journals
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.440]  and this, they're outwardly saying this, this isn't classified information.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.280]  You can go and read any Chinese naval journal and they're telling you this is exactly what
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.280]  they're doing.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.280]  Exactly.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.560]  They said, first we took over 98% of the rare earth minerals.
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.000]  Now they're going in and buying all the local governments in Africa, Latin America, Asia,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.560]  and now they're building artificial islands.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:46.000]  Now they're preparing all sorts of low cost attack drones to take on our larger ships.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.680]  I mean, China is in a stand up military mode and thank God Trump's standing against them
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.520]  because previously Hillary was on their payroll.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520]  Stay well.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.520]  We'll be back.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.320]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:06.680]  It's Michael ZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:12.680]  with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer scalability, but now we're able to
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:19.440]  go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39 50% off because there's a lot of product and a lot
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.440]  of ingredient.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.440]  Michael ZX.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.440]  Now it's the other side of the equation.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.160]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.040]  in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.200]  probiotics help display yeast mold creates slime walls.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.760]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.760]  all sorts of serious issues.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.480]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.480]  that slime wall.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.760]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:58.160]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Michael ZX plus now from the M4 Wars store.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:04.480]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:10.880]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:18.120]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:23.040]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear and so it is essential that you purchase the products

[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:43.840]  That's my dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or AAA2533139 and
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:48.240]  your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:52.080]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:58.040]  and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:23.040]  I can Arizona here on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:40.400]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:46.120]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:50.680]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.880]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:32:03.600]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.600]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.600]  That's right.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:12.280]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:17.520]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology

[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:26.040]  meats, dairy products, desserts and entire meals.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.960]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about and when compared to traditional methods of preservation
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:35.120]  like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.840]  no comparison.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:42.680]  Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:46.160]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.600]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.760]  Harvest Rights is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:33:01.680]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:20.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:26.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  We're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.480]  Alright folks, I want to open the phones up specifically for Jack Pesovic on the Second
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:46.000]  Amendment attack on the army spending bill on the communist Chinese.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.480]  But if you want to get hysterical, if you want to get upset, if you've studied history
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:57.880]  like I have, it's addicting, the communist Chinese funded by Goldman Sachs and the big
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:03.960]  banks have gone from 90% of their public being basically dirt farmers with no electricity
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:15.320]  to 300, 400 million people that are industrialized and a total economic takeover based on how
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.880]  enslaved the Chinese people are.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.800]  And the fact that our media ignores that it's authoritarian, the fact that they ignore
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:26.280]  the biggest mass murders in history, the fact that they ignore that they're in every country
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.280]  in the world.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:32.400]  I mean, it was even in the Washington Post a month ago that they caught Chinese intelligence
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.880]  basically running UT.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:38.440]  Well, yeah, you show up with $100 million, the Chinese don't play games, folks.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.440]  They just start giving people million dollar checks.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.680]  And it's so embarrassing for UT, I knew about this couple of years ago.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:51.440]  It's so embarrassing to UT because they got into all the DARPA stuff.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.800]  This stuff's not really guarded, okay?
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.640]  I know what's at UT.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.680]  I shouldn't even know.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.320]  I was led into a DARPA area 16 years ago and I couldn't believe the guy let me in.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.120]  I said, are you crazy?
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.120]  And he later went to MIT.
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.400]  He's one of their top people.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.160]  And he said, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.160]  They don't care.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.080]  And I was, I was shown incredible stuff.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.600]  And again, the rooms weren't classified.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.760]  They had DARPA on the wall.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.080]  It was the terminals that went to buildings outside Austin.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.720]  And it was, it was primate research.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.200]  And let's just say it was like a nightmare and I only looked at it for a couple of minutes.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.040]  And I was just getting a late night tour of the psychology department.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.600]  The Communist Chinese were given control of that.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:44.640]  In fact, type it in, UT caught getting Chinese government intelligence money.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.640]  I'm just using UT as a microcosm of two miles from where we broadcast from, okay?
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.880]  That's what I'm getting at, how crazy all this is and how they've got this giant blue
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:36:00.840]  water merchant Navy that's really intelligence and military operatives.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.200]  And they're buying everybody off.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.400]  They bought up Hollywood.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.360]  They're moving against everybody.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.320]  And Trump is absolutely right to be standing up against them and having our ships go through
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.320]  the South China Sea.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.960]  They've always gone through there.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.880]  And the last time somebody said no was the Japanese.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:21.240]  So this is such a big deal and then to see Russia being, who's being demonized.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.880]  If the Russians were blocking the North Sea and saying we couldn't navigate through it,
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.480]  I'd say that's an act of war.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.520]  If the Russians had bought up most of Hollywood, I'd be very upset.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.920]  If the Russians were involved at UT in the physics department, the psychology department,
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:40.120]  which is really the department of war, I would be very upset.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.840]  They are in our business.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.960]  Because Jack Busovic, not wearing your naval intelligence hat, which is a patriot and a
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:50.480]  citizen as a reporter, how do we quantify how big this threat is?
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:56.120]  Because I'm not defending Russia, but the distraction of Russia for me is a major issue
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:00.680]  because we're looking at a group that can barely get their stoplights working nationwide.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:03.080]  It has major collapse issues.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.880]  That's why Soros is on their ass in my view.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.280]  Give me your expert opinion.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:11.360]  And I look at China, who is just leveraging their hardworking people that are slaves and
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.960]  our media rolling on a red carpet, and it just makes me get angry.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:21.080]  Yeah, Alex, what people don't understand is how much US trade and how much of world trade
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:25.840]  and in just in terms of goods and products are going through the South China Sea that
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:29.760]  are going through merchant shipping lanes through the Straits of Malacca there that are coming
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.760]  up through.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.920]  So pretty much almost all of the world's oil is coming through a lot of these areas,
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.880]  so much in terms of energy, so much in terms of just our regular consumer products are
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.080]  coming through these areas and going to our trading partners as well.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:49.200]  So what we've got to look at is what do we get to a situation where China, now they're
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.800]  not focusing on this in a direct confrontation because that's what China does, but what they're
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:38:01.160]  focusing on is slowly but surely gobbling up all the avenues of economic power, economic
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.160]  security.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.160]  Got a great view here.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.920]  You can show this where so much trade even coming out of Korea, so much of the Korean
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.080]  situation goes through this that people aren't pointing two and two together on because this
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.880]  is the power that China is trying to achieve.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.120]  They're not just looking at the military power, they're having economic power first and then
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:23.200]  they're backing that up with their military, they're backing that up with their navy.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:29.840]  And even today, we live in the 21st century, but still something like 95% of goods are
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.960]  shipped on the seas.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:35.720]  So any of the goods that you're getting, especially with China there, how they have
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.320]  their economy set up is a manufacturer.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.440]  They don't have the raw material themselves.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.440]  They don't have raw minerals.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.000]  They don't have the raw resources.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.600]  They purchase it from us and places like Africa, other different countries around the world.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.120]  They manufacture it and then they ship it back out.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:57.120]  So they understand that for them, this is a pressure point that they know they need to
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.280]  focus on imports and imports because if we were ever to get into a situation with China
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:07.320]  and place an naval embargo on them or place a blockade on them, that they wouldn't be
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.800]  able to fund their economy.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:14.560]  And clearly they're gearing up for war and saying for war and they're the ones belligerently
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.760]  saying they control the South China Sea, which is a blockade of Japan and the Philippines
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.880]  and Taiwan and everybody else.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.120]  I mean, we have to respond to this.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:28.280]  This is just outrageously aggressive and I think they're arrogant because the CFR said
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:33.360]  the Chinese century is coming, the globalist bet on this, Davos bets on this.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.640]  They say that Jim Peeing is basically their globalist God.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:42.040]  And so I think it's that arrogance of the globalist that has empowered the Communist
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.200]  Chinese to be this delusion.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:50.320]  What it is, Alex, is they see the Chinese as going to be the winners regardless, one
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:51.320]  way or the other.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:55.240]  They all view the people in this sort of the Wall Street set, the New York set.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.160]  They view the U.S. as in decline.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:00.800]  They think the U.S. doesn't have a chance of coming back to power or coming back to
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:01.800]  that.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.800]  And they're doing everything they can to make us.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:03.800]  They're doing everything they can.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.800]  They're doing everything they can to make us decline.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.800]  Sorry, you're absolutely right.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.800]  Start over.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:08.800]  Sorry.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:09.800]  Right.
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.000]  So they've decided to pin their hopes and pin their dreams and pin all of our economic
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.360]  successes and all of their, they're putting their money in China.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.920]  They're putting their money overseas.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.560]  They're investing in China, all the foreign direct investment they're putting out is going
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560]  into China.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.560]  They're filling up the coffers of the Chinese army, the Chinese military, which gets so
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.680]  much of this money.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.680]  And they know it.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.680]  They know exactly what they're doing because they've decided that America should be on
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:35.440]  the decline, that China is the future and they want to be in bed with these leaders.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.040]  You know, I jumped in there because as an American, I get so upset, but it's not just
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.600]  about an ego like they're a football team, we're a football team.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.280]  They sell Christian's organs, they sell Buddhist organs, Mao killed 80 plus million people.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.880]  They've killed tens of million cents.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:54.560]  They now have a dictator in Xi Jinping and our media defends it and it just shows how
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.600]  authoritarian they are when they have these kids' marches over 16 dead trying to take
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  our rights.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.080]  And I know the Communist Chinese are on record, Jack, funding Hollywood, funding liberal media,
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:11.000]  funding universities, literally pushing this anti-America agenda to make sure with regulations
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  and control.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.600]  Well, using children is a Maoist tactic.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.720]  This goes back to the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao and the Red Guards.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:23.840]  It was all led by these hyperpartisan children that were targeting teachers, targeting parents,
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:28.120]  targeting anybody that was considered against the revolution, they called it counter-revolutionary,
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.320]  struggle sessions out in public, forcing apologies, and if they didn't believe you enough, well,
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.320]  you got offed.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.880]  Now, what you just said is so critical.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.280]  You're a naval officer, a patriot, a successful guy in the free market of ideas, one of the
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.560]  biggest Trump organizations out there, and you're laying out what is known fact in the
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.920]  Pentagon, what is known fact in Hollywood, the globalist Lloyd Blankfein bragged a few
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.560]  months ago and said, you'll never build America's infrastructure.
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.560]  You're done.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.560]  It's over.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.200]  Well, notice, he's out.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:00.640]  Trump is literally standing up and trying to just be fair and get a some industry, some
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:06.120]  jobs, some future when everything's been decided to sell out America.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.560]  And this is an anti-American 21st century war to deindustrialize us.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:16.920]  It's a fact, and it's being orchestrated and funded by the Communist Chinese at the universities
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:23.240]  with literal mal-youth brigades as the model to intimidate us into submission.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:28.240]  How could all Americans not join Trump and us to say no to this, Jack?
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:33.600]  Yeah, you know, I've actually talked to some folks over in Europe, people that the family
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.840]  members of mine and friends in Poland that said, don't give up your rights.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.840]  Don't do it.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:38.880]  This is what they make you do.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.280]  This is they make you think it's smart, but don't give up your rights.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.440]  Never give up your rights.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.600]  Jack, you just hit it.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:50.480]  Why is Eastern Europe the most on fire sector of the world awake to what's happening?
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.680]  People talk about that, Poland, Hungary, they get it, they understand it.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:55.960]  What's happening in the East?
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.960]  We'll be back.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:58.960]  I'm so excited.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:05.640]  The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim,
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.080]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:14.520]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:17.520]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:23.840]  Now, frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:30.120]  it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:35.200]  And I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:41.840]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it,
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:46.280]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.760]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:57.760]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:01.600]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have an
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.600]  m4warslife.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.100]  It'd take hours.
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:06.640]  Michael's the X-plus, and now is a lower price.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.640]  It's stronger.
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.640]  It's the other equation in probiotics, it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:13.720]  It's back in stock.
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.920]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:20.400]  It's got the preglonone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body,
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:24.720]  then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.760]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.480]  toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.480]  it.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:41.600]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.800]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:48.560]  So thank you all for remembering m4warsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.000]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  the word.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:58.280]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:02.240]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:07.360]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.400]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:15.760]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:21.080]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:27.480]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at m4warslife.com.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:32.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.720]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.760]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.440]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.520]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.520]  my favorite coffee available at m4warslife.com.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.960]  M4Warslife Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.960]  for a good reason.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.720]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were, what
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.240]  were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:18.280]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.080]  We only have 150%, and then it helps funder operation.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.880]  Well now it's 50% off.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:31.760]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.280]  about seven days to kick in.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:38.640]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together, it's the mind and body challenge.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:45.760]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:48.160]  combo at m4warslife.com.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.560]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:47:14.400]  out m4warslife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and real red pill today.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.320]  We are now, ladies and gentlemen, under the globalist bloodscree.
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:20.120]  I said I'd go to calls, but our guest is leaving us here.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.800]  I'm going to open the phones up for Ben Garrison coming up.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:24.800]  He likes to take phone calls.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.000]  Maybe we'll take a few here with Jack Pesovic.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.960]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:36.120]  Alex, first time callers again, 877-789-2539.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.080]  I promise just to end the show with like 15 callers on hold.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:43.720]  I will get to all your calls, at least those that call in right now.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.120]  Look, I'm going to go back to Jack Pesovic here in just a moment.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.520]  I'm going to lay it out to you.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.040]  I studied the Renaissance, I studied Western civilization, I studied China, I studied Japan,
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.640]  I studied Latin America, I studied it all.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:01.960]  Not because I was a bookworm, it was so incredibly interesting when I was 10 years old and started
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:02.960]  reading history books.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:07.640]  I've read thousands of history books, I haven't read one in a couple years, I'm too busy now.
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.160]  But I've got my world database.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:13.920]  And when you know history, that's why Pesovic's so smart.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:19.160]  He immediately started saying the Communist Chinese are modeling after US expansion, after
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.640]  William McKinley and the Spanish American War.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:26.160]  Now that's actually what the Naval War College and all of them actually understand and what
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:27.600]  the Chinese War College has said.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.680]  So you're not telling you something classified, but that's actually the thinking.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.680]  This is going on.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.840]  The decision has been made that China is the model for global domination.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:45.400]  If China was free market and China treated people with respect, I don't care.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.720]  The left has made America go into decline.
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.720]  We're using leftist controls to make us sabotage.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.920]  China has zero taxes on the elite.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.800]  China has it all set up so we can't compete.
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:57.320]  That's how evil the left is.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.600]  They are out to destroy the country.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.600]  They want your guns.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  They want your churches.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:02.600]  They want your life.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.600]  They want to break you.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.440]  They want to dominate you.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:09.560]  And the decision has been made by the big banks in Hollywood to do this.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.440]  That's why this is such a war and why it's so critical.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.040]  And that's why things are so serious.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.960]  Now I want to get into Eastern Europe.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.280]  Article came out this weekend.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.720]  The head of the Hungarian Parliament came out and laid out.
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:23.880]  They want to end our families.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:24.880]  They're erasing all culture.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.880]  They're the enemy.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:26.880]  We must stop it.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.880]  Why does Eastern Europe get it?
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.320]  We'll talk to Jack Mesopek in a moment.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:36.960]  But first, we are running a special 50% off on BrainForce, which is the ultimate
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.920]  Neutropic out there for the price.
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:42.280]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $50 to $80.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.440]  They're not even as strong.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.720]  They're not even as organic.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:53.520]  BrainForce, ladies and gentlemen, all said and done, cost us over $10 a bottle.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.560]  At $19.95, that's insane.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:59.280]  The average supplement has a seven-time markup.

[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.160]  BrainForce kicks in in 30 minutes.

[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.000]  for limited time.

[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:36.960]  We've got books, t-shirts, videos, radios, water filtration, all of it's just high-quality
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:38.320]  products that you and your family need.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:42.160]  David Hogg on C-SPAN goes, you notice Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:46.720]  are bad for you and that give you cancer, and then he sells you water filters.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.920]  Hogg, you caught me in my slick deception.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:56.520]  Now, see, Hogg, teleprompter readers, actors, decepticons, they're always thinking of the
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:57.520]  angle or the scam.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.200]  Now, see, with me, it's all slamming into you, straight on, straight shooting.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.560]  That's how old-fashioned Texas do it.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.680]  See, yes, I filter my water, yes, the water's full of glyphosates and poison, yes, we have
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:13.360]  the very highest-rated, rabbity-fed filters and other systems.
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:15.200]  We have six or seven of the best companies out there.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.200]  They're all apples and oranges.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:17.200]  Some are better at this.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:18.200]  Some are better than that.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.160]  But whatever the highest-rated stuff is, I go become a distributor, I get the best sales
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:25.240]  of it, I get the lowest price to buy it in bulk so we can find the operation.
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:30.200]  So, yes, David Hogg's like, notice, he says the water's got toxins and then you should
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:32.320]  filter it and then he sells filters.
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.760]  Oh, my gosh, oh, my God, oh, wow, you figured it.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.640]  Again, he thinks that's a scam.
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:41.800]  See, you can't cheat an honest man, they used to say.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:45.920]  But it's always the people that are into scams and deception that see everything else as
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:46.920]  a scam.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.040]  Yes, Hogg, we're selling water filters.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.360]  I really believe you need them.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:51.360]  The studies show it.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.360]  All right, enough of me.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:56.120]  There's a little segment and one more with Jack Pasek, then calls coming up.
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:02.640]  Jack, Eastern Europe, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Russia, to a great
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:07.640]  extent, rediscovering Christian roots, rejecting Islamic invasion, rejecting Soros.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.880]  I read the statements of the speeches of the presidents and prime ministers.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:12.960]  It's like in full wars.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:17.920]  It's like Jack Pasek, the eugenics, the end of our family, the global corporate takeover.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:20.160]  What is going on in the East?
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:25.120]  Well, Alex, in Eastern Europe, they've been through this so many times before with different
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:29.280]  invasions, whether it be from the Ottoman Turks, whether it be from the Huns in Central
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.760]  Asia that have come through, they've fought for their civilization, they've fought for
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.800]  their culture so many times, and they just got over the Communist, essentially Soviet
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.360]  occupation of Eastern Europe with the Warsaw Pact.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.440]  They're still digging out from under that.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.200]  And that's why they understand and are so sensitive to any of these takeover attempts,
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:52.840]  any of these foreign ideologies that are being pushed on top of them by these people
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:56.720]  that are going after, they're trying to change this, and they're trying to stop anyone who
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.840]  speaks out against it.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:00.040]  They're trying to shut anyone down who is a whistleblower.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:04.960]  We now know, of course, one piece of the information that my sources are telling me, Alex, is you
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:08.240]  mentioned Cambridge Analytica earlier and the investigation.
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:13.880]  What I've heard is that actually they're trying to tie that back to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.720]  and his activity that had gone on during the election.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:20.840]  They're trying to tie it back, say that he took stolen documents and posted them on Facebook
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:24.800]  and posted them on Twitter, and that Cambridge Analytica was driving the whole thing.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:30.400]  And they're trying to use this to pin down a charge on Assange to essentially indict
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.720]  him and Mueller knows this, and Mueller is looking at this.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:38.840]  This is something that MI6 really wants, this is something that US secret agencies want,
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:42.440]  the intel agencies that wanted for a long time to get Assange under something.
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:47.440]  They're trying to pin this all on Assange to shut him up, to shut down WikiLeaks because
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:50.840]  they don't want anyone, essentially, and what was their crime, right?
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.880]  They told you what the leaders were doing.
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:55:00.520]  Jack, you talk about the instinct in Eastern Europe to stand up against being overrun.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:04.480]  How do we reach out to the average leftist that's brainwashed so they understand?
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:10.720]  You are being enslaved, you are a chump, you are buying Soros propaganda.
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.440]  You know, one thing I like to do is to say, why is it that all of these celebrities agree
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:16.440]  with you?
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:20.600]  Why is it that when everyone in power, everyone in the mainstream media agrees with every
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.560]  single one of the talking points that you're saying, are you really being rebellious when
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.360]  you've got this entire establishment that's echoing the exact same talking points and
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:29.360]  phrases that you are?
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:33.760]  And I've noticed that with some of them, with the ones that are at least willing to have
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.680]  some of that introspection, they will actually kind of consider that and say, you know,
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.680]  that's weird.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.680]  I didn't think about it that way.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.840]  And again, less than 10% MSNBC admits were actually under the age of 18.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.720]  This is giant ridiculous astroturf.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:53.680]  And I go back to that question, Trump on the omnibus bill, you know, giving lip service
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.680]  to the gun control.
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:58.160]  What do you think he's doing there?
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.200]  You know, I think it's appeasement, Alex.
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.560]  He's trying to appease the left.
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:04.560]  He's trying to say that he's doing something that's bipartisan.
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:08.280]  I agree, but that only encourages these people.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:13.040]  They said there was a one student that gave a speech at the March for Our Lives and said,
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.120]  if you give us an inch on bump stocks, we will take a mile.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:19.760]  That was specifically what the quote was.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:22.080]  Yeah, that was Delaney Tarr.
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.320]  Do we have that clip of her?
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:26.400]  Here she is.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:33.600]  There are so very many things, so many steps to take, like right now, sign our petition.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.600]  It takes two seconds and it matters.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:40.080]  We will take the big and we will take the small, but we will keep fighting.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.680]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:45.680]  We are not here for breadcrumbs.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:48.520]  We are here for real change.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.520]  And there you go.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:53.200]  I mean, they just, I said that in my, my ears went straight up.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:55.520]  My antenna went straight up and said, there it is.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:56.760]  That's the signal right there.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:59.960]  We got to go to break to five more minutes with it because I want to ask you a critical
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:00.960]  question.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.400]  I want to ask the audience this question and I want to ask them to think about this.
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.280]  Why after decades of saying they don't want to confiscate the guns, they don't want to
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:10.720]  repeal the Second Amendment?
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.400]  Why suddenly at the March to grab your guns, at the March to enslave America on the New
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.640]  York Times, former Supreme Court justices, why are they suddenly admitting they want
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.480]  to confiscate the guns?
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:24.720]  Why are they now admitting it?
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:28.480]  Because when they finally get to the point of doing it, they've got to go from denying
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.640]  it to doing it.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640]  That's why.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.640]  That's my answer.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.680]  I'm going to ask the subject what he thinks.
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.200]  Your phone call is coming up.
