[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:40.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network back off modium live from Austin Texas alex jones
[00:40.800 --> 00:47.120]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for joining us today it is
[00:47.120 --> 00:52.280]  all ready the 4th of day of September 2008 we're gonna be live here for the
[00:52.280 --> 00:55.840]  next four hours Paul Watson's gonna be popping in for only about 20 minutes
[00:55.840 --> 01:00.040]  towards the end of the show to break down record cold temperatures since they've
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.760]  been recording temperatures in the last 300 plus years also that corresponds
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.440]  with the 200 plus years of scientific records of sunspots the sun has never
[01:11.440 --> 01:18.560]  been completely clear in over 200 years of sunspot activity being recorded it's
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.920]  one of the longest continually measured phenomenons in the natural world that
[01:23.920 --> 01:31.840]  and Terra temperature here on Terra firma record cold temperatures on the way and
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.400]  the global taxers have already shifted overnight saying global cooling we need
[01:37.400 --> 01:43.840]  a world tax to stop the global cooling that is supposedly man-made the UN
[01:43.840 --> 01:47.800]  zone fraudulent climate report where they forged the names of hundreds of
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.180]  scientists that's now been admitted that they forged them lied and said they
[01:52.180 --> 01:56.760]  endorsed the idea of man-made global warming and then it was caused by CO2
[01:56.760 --> 02:02.760]  one of the four major ingredients to life by that I don't mean classical
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.560]  element I mean true element or I mean classical element in life not one of
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.440]  the periodic tables but we have sunshine we have oxygen we have carbon
[02:11.440 --> 02:14.960]  dioxide we have water and those are the main ingredients or the elements you
[02:14.960 --> 02:22.880]  need for life but they are now well first they said in the 50s and 60s we
[02:22.880 --> 02:26.960]  need a global tax to stop the ice age which was in a way more accurate not
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.960]  that man was causing it but that an ice age was set to appear according to ice
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.240]  core samples then they decided well we're having a little warming period here
[02:34.240 --> 02:37.920]  a little mini hot spot because of sun activity and they knew that all along
[02:37.920 --> 02:42.280]  you're not stupid they're scientists the globalist are scientists of tyranny and
[02:42.280 --> 02:48.400]  so they came up with that it was man-made global warming and the UN's own
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.160]  report as I mentioned says that man's only six percent of it if you believe
[02:52.160 --> 02:59.080]  they're fraudulent numbers volcanoes and the sun and solar radiation of all
[02:59.080 --> 03:05.920]  types but also just space space radiation different types of particles
[03:05.920 --> 03:11.320]  coming into the atmosphere forming clouds but don't confuse the public with the
[03:11.320 --> 03:16.880]  facts they love a good hoax kind of like Russia invaded Georgia Russia snuck
[03:16.880 --> 03:22.040]  attack Georgia in the truth but let's go ahead and say it or that Sarah Palin
[03:22.040 --> 03:29.560]  is a good conservative not true but we can just say it or the Barack Obama is
[03:29.560 --> 03:33.520]  a you know good guy who's going to fight the establishment isn't true but you know
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.320]  might as well just believe it I mean nation of suckers born and bred to be
[03:37.320 --> 03:43.320]  suckers but he'll pop in later on that issue I've got a lot of news here and so
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.560]  we're not going to have any other guest today but Paul popping in briefly I want
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.960]  to take a lot of your phone calls any issue you want to discuss a lot has
[03:51.960 --> 03:57.120]  happened the response to the little hurricane locking down the areas of
[03:57.120 --> 04:03.160]  Louisiana saying martial law 24 hours a day leave your house you go directly to
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.400]  the state pen no judge no jury the government arbitrarily decides we're
[04:08.400 --> 04:16.320]  seeing similar things pop up in Arkansas and Ohio this idea of martial law is
[04:16.320 --> 04:20.040]  just being brought into the mainstay of American thinking it's being introduced
[04:20.040 --> 04:25.560]  on the main street we can talk about the economy what's happening there we can
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.800]  talk about the Georgia situation the Iran situation we can talk about the
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.880]  stupid VP candidates I mean who cares their puppets but you want to discuss it
[04:34.880 --> 04:41.360]  fine we can discuss police brutality versus the anarchist there is a whole
[04:41.360 --> 04:46.200]  host of issues any angle any issue you want to bring up today you have a

[07:05.440 --> 07:08.840]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.400]  when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they
[07:12.400 --> 07:16.920]  evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin the KDF dual media shower

[08:11.680 --> 08:16.040]  all right I have a newscast with their telling you you're not allowed to gather
[08:16.040 --> 08:22.520]  your own rainwater that ties into the global standardization of zoning and of
[08:22.520 --> 08:27.120]  state and federal laws international laws under conventions and treaties and
[08:27.120 --> 08:33.240]  general agreements I've got a story I never really got to yesterday Israel
[08:33.240 --> 08:38.720]  Mossad let Nazi Mingola get away Associated Press I got a story I want to
[08:38.720 --> 08:43.280]  hear from the callers on I want to hear from you on this sudden death after
[08:43.280 --> 08:50.040]  arrest may be new syndrome this out of Reuters and this is the story originates
[08:50.040 --> 08:54.560]  out of Madrid Spain the reason we're hearing about this in Europe now is
[08:54.560 --> 09:01.520]  they're adopting a fraud that was invented here in the U.S. about three
[09:01.520 --> 09:07.280]  years ago there have been over 500 taser deaths in the U.S. alone there are
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.040]  scores in Canada all over Europe total it's around a thousand the numbers
[09:12.040 --> 09:18.720]  vary just in the last five six years as tasers have become prolific and when
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.280]  you get tasered over and over again and just so happened to die they now say it
[09:23.280 --> 09:27.760]  is a syndrome they say well this never happened before but it's not the
[09:27.760 --> 09:31.040]  electroshock even though the coroners say no they died of a heart attack from
[09:31.040 --> 09:36.680]  being tasered five times 20 times you know sometimes more sometimes they
[09:36.680 --> 09:44.000]  taser people 30 40 times you'll get cops there with three or four taser lines
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.440]  into somebody just tasering over and over again and they'll die of a heart
[09:47.440 --> 09:52.520]  attack you get a 15 year old an 18 year old a 35 year old and they're dead when
[09:52.520 --> 09:55.840]  the cops always say oh they were on drugs in the corner report comes back
[09:55.840 --> 10:00.720]  no there were no drugs and you know the first the story was it was cocaine the
[10:00.720 --> 10:03.800]  you know they were on drugs and then you'd find out no they weren't on drugs
[10:03.800 --> 10:09.080]  that's so the government doctors went you know what it's a syndrome it's not
[10:09.080 --> 10:13.400]  that when we taser you or when we beat you or when we jump on your head with
[10:13.400 --> 10:18.760]  our knees that your neck breaks no no no you died of over excitement it was a
[10:18.760 --> 10:25.400]  syndrome says a sudden death after arrest it may be new syndrome young men
[10:25.400 --> 10:29.400]  who died suddenly after being arrested by the police may be victims of a new
[10:29.400 --> 10:34.480]  syndrome similar to one that kills some wild animals and that's prey animals
[10:34.480 --> 10:48.160]  doves quail chickens hairs I rabbits deer prey species have it almost designed
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.600]  into them to once they get grabbed once they're dying they go into shock and
[10:52.600 --> 11:01.200]  die quite easily I remember being a little boy on the farm when one of my
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.640]  uncles or my great uncle who would live nearby be over at their house and it
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.800]  wasn't some brutal thing it was dinner time and they would grab a chicken and
[11:08.800 --> 11:15.200]  take it over and hack a set off with a meat cleaver or they would grab a rabbit
[11:15.200 --> 11:18.640]  out of them that's dinner time you know it's four o'clock and go cook this grab
[11:18.640 --> 11:21.800]  me I'm hillbillies folks I guess it's okay to go eat at the store you just
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.800]  better not kill yourself grab the rabbit out by its legs hold it up by its
[11:25.800 --> 11:32.880]  hind legs take a broken ore is what Pat Lynn one of my great uncles would use
[11:32.880 --> 11:39.840]  and just bam hit it one time back of the head and then he'd skin it and take it
[11:39.840 --> 11:47.080]  and cook it and gourmet believe me but that's how domesticated we've gotten
[11:47.080 --> 11:50.280]  people are like recoiling and horror that's what human beings have done for
[11:50.280 --> 11:56.680]  thousands of years tens of thousands that's what we do you know those chickens
[11:56.680 --> 12:03.680]  you're eating those the pork you're eating it it had lives of inhumane
[12:03.680 --> 12:06.920]  torture on average now cows still have pretty good lives until they're slaughtered
[12:06.920 --> 12:13.360]  well it's a very humane food to eat not the case with pigs and chickens now but
[12:13.360 --> 12:19.800]  I'm I'm already digressing how did I get off into that oh a lot of times you
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.480]  grab a rabbit by the hind legs and a week before it saw one of its brethren
[12:24.480 --> 12:30.240]  be killed with a with a with a poleaxe basically it will just have a heart
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.600]  attack right in your hands I've seen that happen or let's say I've been hunting
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.320]  dove before you just wing one it just breaks its wing you go pick it up dies
[12:41.320 --> 12:45.840]  right in your hands by the way you just tear its breast right out drop it right
[12:45.840 --> 12:49.480]  into a baggie in your backpack that's got the seasoning whatever you're
[12:49.480 --> 12:53.720]  seasoning whether it's a some type of Asian sweet sauce or maybe just lean
[12:53.720 --> 12:59.240]  parents Worcestershire just drop the breast brought right into that it
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.120]  marinates while you're out there in the in the 95 degree fields and you come back
[13:04.120 --> 13:10.520]  four hours later and you go and put them right on the skillet and it's not that I
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.120]  even enjoy killing the dove it's a primitive instinct to go out and hunt
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.760]  it's the hunting itself that is fulfilling and then to actually butcher it
[13:19.760 --> 13:23.840]  yourself takes about three seconds tear the breast meat out throw it in your
[13:23.840 --> 13:29.840]  bag and then you go cook it yourself and it didn't full of hormones it isn't
[13:29.840 --> 13:39.720]  filled with antibiotics it didn't lead lead a tortured life and some big pin
[13:39.720 --> 13:43.200]  with mites all over it I'm sorry I'm digressing I said I was gonna take your
[13:43.200 --> 13:50.560]  calls the point is I know what sudden death is and it's in prey animals it is
[13:50.560 --> 13:57.480]  not in what you call predators or aggressive mammals if the going gets
[13:57.480 --> 14:00.760]  tough for a killer whale it doesn't just give up and die if the going gets tough
[14:00.760 --> 14:06.440]  for an African great ape a silverback it doesn't just die of a heart attack
[14:06.440 --> 14:14.640]  unless it's around the age for heart attacks older if you get a tiger doesn't
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.480]  just die of a heart attack fights to the death an elephant doesn't die of a
[14:18.480 --> 14:22.200]  heart attack fights to the death higher intelligence is associated with not
[14:22.200 --> 14:26.240]  giving up and dying prey animals have it designed into them for whatever reason
[14:26.240 --> 14:32.640]  to give up and die they are falsely claiming that now that when the police
[14:32.640 --> 14:35.800]  grab you and take you behind closed doors and of course beat your brains out
[14:35.800 --> 14:40.040]  that or taser you to death or jump on your head with their you know this
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.840]  famous video what was just about nine months ago eight months ago up in
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.440]  Canada and this Polish fellow who didn't speak English his mother was unable to
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.800]  get through to getting he was immigrating here immigrating to North
[14:52.800 --> 14:59.600]  America to Canada and he throws a fit after 30 plus hours of no food no water
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.440]  he's just back there in a holding area very frustrating I had it happen to me
[15:03.440 --> 15:08.680]  in Canada but not for that long just about 15 hours and he kicks a trash can
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.280]  and starts screaming for help they come up tasering the officers jump from about
[15:14.280 --> 15:18.720]  three feet in the air with their knees on the back of his head bye bye he's dead
[15:18.720 --> 15:28.360]  broke his neck they said it was a syndrome and I guess if you ever get the
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.040]  fist fight with somebody and you hit him and they happen it happens to break a
[15:31.040 --> 15:36.440]  blood vessel in their brain and they die when the cops show up just say you
[15:36.440 --> 15:41.680]  know what it's a syndrome of course they're gonna laugh at you but this is
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.240]  really gonna wreak havoc that they're now saying no no no what people just die
[15:45.240 --> 15:51.280]  in police custody from fear well yeah if it's a 60 year old guy with heart
[15:51.280 --> 15:56.240]  problems or 75 year old person with heart problems or that certainly does
[15:56.240 --> 16:03.640]  happen happens a lot it doesn't happen at 25 year old males they said that woman
[16:03.640 --> 16:09.320]  that died in that airport a few months ago they said she died of fear a syndrome
[16:09.320 --> 16:12.920]  40-something year old woman
[16:15.080 --> 16:20.600]  of course the coroner's report said she died of blunt force trauma to the head
[16:20.600 --> 16:26.600]  but hey that's a syndrome too but this now Europe's picking up on the lies and
[16:26.600 --> 16:30.240]  propaganda young men who died suddenly after being arrested by the police maybe
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.880]  victims of a new syndrome similar to one that kills some wild animals when they
[16:34.880 --> 16:41.360]  are captured Spanish researchers said on Tuesday man I sort of thinking about
[16:41.360 --> 16:44.480]  dove hunting my neighbor was going down on the other day and almost begged to go
[16:44.480 --> 16:51.560]  along I never get to hunt fish nothing anymore but Manuel Martinez sell us the
[16:51.560 --> 16:57.880]  Madrid's Hospital Giorgio Myronian reached the conclusion after
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.680]  investigating 60 cases of sudden unexplained deaths in Spain following
[17:01.680 --> 17:08.160]  police detention oh yes yes Jack in one-third of the cases death occurred at
[17:08.160 --> 17:13.200]  the point of arrest while in the remainder death was in 24 hours cellist
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.520]  told the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology all but one of the
[17:17.520 --> 17:23.040]  casualties were male and their average age was just 33 years with no previous
[17:23.040 --> 17:29.360]  history of cardiovascular disease something unusual is going on cells
[17:29.360 --> 17:34.800]  said just why they died remains a mystery but he believes young men in
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.000]  particular may experience surges of blood levels and chemicals when under
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.520]  severe stress adrenaline is one of the most abundant of these chemicals we
[17:44.520 --> 17:47.200]  know that when a wild animal was captured sometimes the animal died
[17:47.200 --> 17:51.240]  suddenly he said probably when these young males are captured it's very
[17:51.240 --> 17:56.960]  stressful and their level of these chemicals goes very high and that can
[17:56.960 --> 18:04.160]  finish their life by ventricle fibrillation or cardiac arrest that's
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.640]  not that they're being tasered or beaten to death cellist compiled a study the

[18:16.760 --> 18:22.480]  of unexplained death or police detention over the past 10 years only sudden
[18:22.480 --> 18:27.880]  deaths with no clear causes were included in the autopsy reports were checked
[18:27.880 --> 18:31.000]  to exclude the possibility of mistreatment or past serious medical
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.680]  conditions 12 of the victims were drug users but cellist said that that was not
[18:34.680 --> 18:39.320]  thought to be contributed to their deaths Jonathan Harlepen of the Missouri

[18:44.240 --> 18:47.880]  concept of the heart stress syndrome triggered by flood of adrenaline or other
[18:47.880 --> 18:53.080]  chemicals was a reasonable hypothesis we all know stress is bad for you and
[18:53.080 --> 18:59.880]  this may be stress in the extreme he said yeah 25 30 year old males fall into

[24:25.040 --> 24:31.760]  central asia prayers someone who cares and i've got comments on palin as well
[24:31.760 --> 24:35.840]  you're on but right now let's go to the calls john in illinois
[24:35.840 --> 24:40.320]  disagrees so he goes to the head of the line welcome to the airwaves john
[24:40.320 --> 24:45.200]  good to be here alex three or four weeks ago you're commenting on the uh...
[24:45.200 --> 24:50.080]  possible punishment for those who ran the nine eleven op
[24:50.080 --> 24:55.120]  and uh... if i'm not mistaken you said you did not favor the death penalty for
[24:55.120 --> 24:58.800]  these people but i take strong exceptions of that
[24:58.800 --> 25:03.760]  i think that is necessary although i am usually opposed to the death penalty
[25:03.760 --> 25:06.720]  because usually these guys are railroaded
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.280]  uh... it is necessary for us to execute
[25:11.280 --> 25:14.720]  those men who have been found guilty at the very top
[25:14.720 --> 25:21.520]  that means cheney rumsfeld mayer they have to be publicly executed as a
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.840]  lesson to all others not to do the same thing
[25:25.840 --> 25:31.200]  well listen i appreciate your call but uh...
[25:31.200 --> 25:34.560]  i want to be clear about all this you're still there john
[25:34.560 --> 25:39.600]  yes i am okay i appreciate the call is the cue to hang up on people when i'm
[25:39.600 --> 25:43.120]  done with them but i didn't mean that is the cue that time so i was uh...
[25:43.120 --> 25:46.160]  i was uh... making sure they hadn't let you go because i want you to be able to
[25:46.160 --> 25:51.120]  counter back with what i say i believe i was talking about when we if we have a
[25:51.120 --> 25:53.920]  revolution in this country i would like it to be peaceful
[25:53.920 --> 26:00.160]  and not be violent because the vast majority of the time i would say ninety
[26:00.160 --> 26:04.000]  nine percent of the time a violent revolution ends up with something as
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.320]  bad or worse and then what you have is you have the
[26:08.320 --> 26:14.160]  uh... lazy uh... population or that sector
[26:14.160 --> 26:18.080]  that takes over from the elite and then loots
[26:18.080 --> 26:21.520]  the middle class uh... and and they set up their own
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.760]  tyranny and the whole economy basically collapses because
[26:25.760 --> 26:29.760]  sometimes the new tyranny you get is worse than the old tyranny you had
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.000]  uh... my whole point is it's very dangerous to start executing people
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.320]  in a revolution you end up with a french revolution
[26:36.320 --> 26:39.680]  when it rages for years you know eight nine years and
[26:39.680 --> 26:42.720]  hundreds of thousands get their heads chopped off and it turns out
[26:42.720 --> 26:48.080]  like the camera rouge with pole pot over twenty years emptying out the cities
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.520]  killing more than two million people anybody was a doctor or a lawyer who
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.040]  had glasses was considered to be wealthy
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.680]  and so i think that uh... rather than open up that genie out of the box i mean
[26:59.680 --> 27:03.040]  once you say let's execute political leaders
[27:03.040 --> 27:05.680]  uh... then it it it it it it it
[27:05.680 --> 27:08.560]  it's kind of like when kings would dominate other kings they would never
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.600]  kill the king they would exile them or when they finally
[27:11.600 --> 27:16.080]  captured napoleon well twice they would exile him
[27:16.080 --> 27:19.600]  uh... to all but another island because
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.600]  because they want to set the precedent of of of
[27:23.600 --> 27:29.200]  of you know elitist being killed well it's the same thing here i don't want to
[27:29.200 --> 27:33.200]  set the precedent of bloody lynch mobs
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.960]  uh... and cities burning uh... i mean i don't want cruel and unusual punishment
[27:38.960 --> 27:44.000]  now federal and state law states were high treason is punishable by
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.640]  and uh... if grand i mean i uh... i believe we had a caller or a guest i
[27:48.640 --> 27:51.440]  can't remember i mean i remember a few weeks ago this being discussed about
[27:51.440 --> 27:54.880]  about a month ago people were talking about just rounding them all up
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.480]  putting them them all in camps you know executing the elitist
[27:58.480 --> 28:02.320]  and you know i was saying
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.360]  that whereas i would like to see them swing from the
[28:05.360 --> 28:08.640]  from a rope and i've gotten angry before and said you know after people been
[28:08.640 --> 28:12.080]  convicted of a crime and after they've been you know convicted of carrying out
[28:12.080 --> 28:15.200]  terror attacks i'd like to see them punished when i'm being more
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.240]  intellectual and more cold in my analysis uh...
[28:20.240 --> 28:25.600]  it's just a more dangerous also if elites know they're going to be executed
[28:25.600 --> 28:28.960]  they'll go ahead and just nuke our cities instead of being captured
[28:28.960 --> 28:32.320]  but if other elites who are below them know that
[28:32.320 --> 28:36.000]  they'll just get jail time they won't go all the way to the wall
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.280]  i mean do you understand the british ministry of defense
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.160]  ten-year prospectus on what they believe will happen
[28:42.160 --> 28:47.120]  said that the money to interest in europe the u.s and england and australia
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.000]  canada will wage war against the they're in domestic populations they admit
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.280]  the riot police the whole structure of our governments
[28:55.280 --> 29:00.640]  is the wage war against the people and they said that if the population ever
[29:00.640 --> 29:04.720]  starts uh... really looking like they're going to take over the government
[29:04.720 --> 29:08.160]  that that they that the neutron bomb arsenals which again don't destroy
[29:08.160 --> 29:13.200]  real estate just kill all life no damaged buildings or telecommunications
[29:13.200 --> 29:16.000]  they just kill every bug every plant every human

[29:21.840 --> 29:26.240]  dolphins at sea world everything that in in the area that's it
[29:26.240 --> 29:30.240]  and they said the neutron bomb arsenal is for us
[29:30.240 --> 29:33.360]  so they that you that's what shayan mountains for
[29:33.360 --> 29:37.680]  to direct through north north north com the

[33:28.880 --> 33:32.960]  they want us to just lay there and take their eugenics program
[33:32.960 --> 33:36.560]  so it's all done scientifically it's all publicly stated
[33:36.560 --> 33:40.880]  it's not advertised but it's it's it's all in textbooks it's all in government
[33:40.880 --> 33:45.600]  documents it's all stated they want to build and they are building
[33:45.600 --> 33:51.920]  a world government with a world currency world tax a regulatory system
[33:51.920 --> 33:57.120]  over your carbon footprint they know it isn't your carbon dioxide you exhale
[33:57.120 --> 34:01.920]  that's causing the earth to warm they know the earth is set to cool
[34:01.920 --> 34:06.000]  but it's something they can sell the public on an outside crisis to get a
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.240]  monitoring system in through your world ID card
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.840]  that will say national ID which is already standardized by treaty in 2000
[34:15.840 --> 34:18.880]  that then tracks every purchase every sale
[34:18.880 --> 34:22.320]  everything you eat everything you do so they can gauge
[34:22.320 --> 34:26.080]  what your carbon footprint is and it's designed according to richard in haas
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.400]  head of the cfr in one of the papers he wrote for the club of
[34:30.400 --> 34:34.240]  rome to make humans of the enemy and the state
[34:34.240 --> 34:39.200]  will organize against the enemy which is humanity
[34:41.120 --> 34:46.000]  and so the state makes us the enemy it codifies that and they train us to think
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.960]  of human life is bad from birth they train us to think of the family is bad
[34:50.960 --> 34:55.120]  they train us to to to literally take our own
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.800]  self-preservation instinct the propulsion system
[34:58.800 --> 35:02.560]  of humanity to protect ourselves our children our tribe to build
[35:02.560 --> 35:07.520]  a better system they they take that and they turn it against itself they
[35:07.520 --> 35:11.520]  convince you the earth is what you've got to say
[35:11.520 --> 35:14.480]  of course they have no intention of quote saving the earth
[35:14.480 --> 35:17.680]  like they're the ones actually threatening it with their fish infusion
[35:17.680 --> 35:21.440]  systems their heavy colliders their nuclear weapons their neutron bombs
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.520]  their antimatter weapons they admit they have their genetic engineering
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.280]  but but they sell you at a very fundamental base level
[35:29.280 --> 35:34.080]  of don't don't crap where you eat i mean people knew
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.000]  5000 years ago to go out in the woods to not
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.680]  do their business inside the camp and so they say we don't want to foul the
[35:41.680 --> 35:45.040]  stream we don't want to foul the hunting ground we
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.200]  don't want to scare the game away it's basically that instinct
[35:49.200 --> 35:53.920]  and that's actually how the priest class going back about 8 000 years ago
[35:53.920 --> 36:00.000]  got control of societies through superstition through give me the power
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.760]  give me the control do what i say or the harvest won't be good
[36:03.760 --> 36:07.840]  or there won't be any caribou there won't be any gazelles
[36:07.840 --> 36:14.960]  there won't be any white-tailed deer the management of the environment is one
[36:14.960 --> 36:20.000]  of the most base things for tribal societies
[36:21.120 --> 36:23.920]  and so they come in with something that's very legitimate our fundamental
[36:23.920 --> 36:29.520]  makeup and they say to us
[36:30.880 --> 36:34.640]  you have to give control over your life and over your decision-making process
[36:34.640 --> 36:40.160]  and over private property and over your reproductive rights
[36:40.160 --> 36:43.680]  we're not being told don't have more than one child it's very uncouth it's very
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.240]  bad it's very evil don't you dare
[36:48.240 --> 36:51.760]  one child policies are needed in the u.s and in europe
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.000]  as we told you they would propose we're being sold
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.480]  on a new system to be regulated and controlled
[37:00.480 --> 37:07.200]  and the criminal world corporate system
[37:07.600 --> 37:11.040]  the global crime syndicate we covered it in in-game
[37:11.040 --> 37:15.920]  150 years ago the sax coberg gothers which are the royal family
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.680]  of germany england the netherlands russia
[37:19.680 --> 37:30.480]  greece same family austria idly same family
[37:30.480 --> 37:33.360]  and we want a history lesson on that it's because the royal dynasties of
[37:33.360 --> 37:40.640]  idly in spain and england were original royal dynasties
[37:40.640 --> 37:45.600]  and their lines would burn out because part of inbreeding is infertility and
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.320]  disease and stillbirth and retardation
[37:50.320 --> 37:54.480]  and so after 300 400 500 600 years of interbreeding
[37:54.480 --> 37:57.760]  all of those original dynasties burned out and there was one place
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.640]  that had been intermarrying with everybody else because it had what
[38:02.640 --> 38:06.320]  can debate at 14 16 different counties with kings
[38:06.320 --> 38:10.080]  with dukes over each one of them in germania
[38:10.080 --> 38:15.600]  and so they were the only ones by 1750s
[38:16.480 --> 38:21.680]  who had a royal bloodline left that was married in to all the other royal
[38:21.680 --> 38:25.040]  bloodlines and so the german sax coberg gothers
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.160]  was that became the super genetic european royalty bloodline
[38:30.160 --> 38:33.600]  and they took over
[38:33.600 --> 38:40.720]  just giving you basic mainline history but i i digress there
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.720]  and so eugenics ideas had been developed in the 1750s before it was called
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.480]  eugenics by sir francis galton in the 1840s by
[38:52.480 --> 38:55.440]  mr malthus
[38:56.800 --> 39:00.560]  and those ideas were codified and then integrated with the theory of evolution
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.480]  i'm not debating evolution one or the other i'm just coldly
[39:04.480 --> 39:08.640]  pointing out how this plan developed
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.920]  so you have eugenics coming out of darwinism
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.240]  and malthusianism
[39:18.720 --> 39:21.520]  the malthusians
[39:22.080 --> 39:28.000]  and within 40 years by the 1890s it was the dominant science in the u.s
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.320]  russia mexico japan globally anybody who had an intelligency anybody who had a
[39:34.320 --> 39:38.560]  phd because the phd was started simultaneously
[39:38.560 --> 39:45.920]  right around that same period in prussia as an elite management force
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.760]  same thing the french did with their phd's in the 1850s
[39:51.760 --> 39:57.360]  20 years after or to be technical 15 years after they took over algeria
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.360]  they went in and created a roundtable or cfr or
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.560]  intelligentsia a small ruling class a small imperial
[40:06.560 --> 40:10.720]  management viceroy system
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.960]  and then it was that inner party in algeria in the 1950s and 60s that then
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.440]  rebelled against french rule so the elites always watching their
[40:19.440 --> 40:23.680]  inner party more closely than even the general public
[40:23.680 --> 40:27.520]  again i'm just skipping around giving you little little snapshot
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.160]  microcosm examples of how all this works
[40:34.400 --> 40:39.120]  i meant to bring a brief history of the world uh to barns and nobles
[40:39.120 --> 40:42.320]  300 to 3000 years of revolution but it's a good little book
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.160]  a few hundred pages long because each page has it nice synopses of what
[40:46.160 --> 40:49.680]  happened and you'll see how it repeats itself
[40:49.680 --> 40:55.760]  and how their interactions secret groups uh black op organizations front
[40:55.760 --> 40:58.000]  groups and so when you read history none of that's
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.880]  hidden because it doesn't matter anymore you know because the people aren't
[41:00.880 --> 41:03.920]  empowered now and so you can admit how things
[41:03.920 --> 41:09.440]  work 100 years ago 200 years ago you just don't admit how that works today
[41:09.440 --> 41:15.520]  because by god you know i've got a real choice between
[41:15.520 --> 41:22.320]  mccain and obama and by god nobody runs my life i'm in control
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.720]  no you're not i said i take calls but i'm i'm
[41:26.720 --> 41:33.760]  i'm off on a jag here because you get this scientifically
[41:33.760 --> 41:42.880]  and by the 1890s well really mouth is codified all in the 1750s
[41:42.880 --> 41:46.400]  but but it was now official policy health department social services
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.160]  everything social hygiene racial hygiene
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.080]  well three rails of eugenics positive eugenics breeding elites to be better
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.560]  looking live longer be smarter negative eugenics sterilizing killing
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.720]  newborn babies that are deformed but then the real rail of eugenics
[42:02.720 --> 42:08.000]  the true secret rail the third rail of dumbing down the middle class
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.320]  and rogue intelligence which the elite says are the only ones threatening
[42:14.320 --> 42:18.480]  their codal complete domination
[42:19.920 --> 42:23.840]  and by the 20s they discover that sodium fluoride brain damage as you
[42:23.840 --> 42:27.360]  reduces your life expectancy literally causes arthritis
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.120]  attacks every gland and organ and then the elites are really into being the
[42:31.120 --> 42:33.920]  best and the smartest and they hate what they call
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.480]  you know native rogue intelligence out of the middle class and so
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.200]  they lay down a screen to to to block that out and dumb them down
[42:43.200 --> 42:46.720]  and then of course in 1933 all this huxley writes brave new world where
[42:46.720 --> 42:51.120]  they take the embryos and x-ray them to make them stupid
[42:51.120 --> 42:53.600]  and then he later said no that's actually what the elite does just with
[42:53.600 --> 42:57.360]  chemicals in the water and the vaccines in 1962 when he spoke at
[42:57.360 --> 43:00.560]  berkeley and in other speeches and in revisiting
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.240]  brave new world he wrote in the fifties
[43:04.240 --> 43:07.600]  he's telling you know this is actually the plan i married into a eugenics
[43:07.600 --> 43:10.480]  family i married into galton family in the
[43:10.480 --> 43:14.960]  darwin family only four families bred together in that particular scientific
[43:14.960 --> 43:18.960]  experiment they did starting in the 1840s
[43:18.960 --> 43:22.320]  most of the children died at birth the others had to be locked away you
[43:22.320 --> 43:25.120]  occasionally would get a huxley somebody like aldis
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.200]  who would be genius it actually did produce super geniuses
[43:29.200 --> 43:33.040]  but uh again most of them were completely
[43:33.040 --> 43:38.720]  out of their minds schizophrenics it's well known throughout history that
[43:38.720 --> 43:42.960]  hyperintelligence is also associated with the edge of madness but but i digress
[43:42.960 --> 43:47.600]  now the point here is that you were having
[43:47.600 --> 43:54.320]  scientific war waged against you and in all these textbooks and
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.360]  documents and books written by hg wells non-fiction
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.840]  and books put out by oxford press and in all these publications hundreds of
[44:03.840 --> 44:09.600]  they stated the scientific plan and now they're very close to it a computer
[44:09.600 --> 44:13.760]  tracking system a technological enslavement grid a control grid
[44:13.760 --> 44:19.040]  tracking every movement predicting mass movements predicting mom psychology
[44:19.040 --> 44:22.160]  the final revolution
[44:22.160 --> 44:27.200]  which is brainwash police forces brainwash populations played off
[44:27.200 --> 44:34.960]  against each other centralized cities an intensifying threat of terrorism
[44:36.080 --> 44:40.960]  an intensifying threat of biological calamity they engineer biological
[44:40.960 --> 44:45.840]  crises then always poses the savior with with the new crisis they usher in
[44:45.840 --> 44:49.440]  there are other crises that develop on their own that they then pose as saviors
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.480]  on as well
[44:52.480 --> 44:55.920]  they also turn everything into a glitz and glamour you know
[44:55.920 --> 45:00.160]  the fact that cancers become epidemic and is increasing thousands of percentile
[45:00.160 --> 45:03.680]  points every decade and the diabetes is in all of this they then
[45:03.680 --> 45:07.680]  institutionalize that and fund their own organizations that cover
[45:07.680 --> 45:11.840]  all this up in the name of the drives to stop it all
[45:11.840 --> 45:18.080]  in the name of the uh you know programs to get the cure
[45:18.080 --> 45:21.360]  and then they turn it into a celebrity thing that oh your three-year-old has
[45:21.360 --> 45:24.320]  cancer oh a bunch of the three-year-olds on the block have cancer
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.240]  oh your 22-year-old wife has a brain tumor or lung cancer oh your husband
[45:28.240 --> 45:33.120]  at at at 31 has to secular cancer don't worry bob down the street does
[45:33.120 --> 45:36.320]  we're all going to beat this together and here are these organizations that are
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.240]  going to help us and you find out they're all Planned Parenthood former heads
[45:40.240 --> 45:43.120]  or vice chairman or involved in eugenics organizations
[45:43.120 --> 45:48.080]  or black op government and everything is about exterminating us in an orderly
[45:48.080 --> 45:50.480]  fashion
[45:51.120 --> 45:56.960]  you find out that millions of dosages of hiv go out in the factor rate
[45:56.960 --> 46:00.640]  millions are infected no one gets in trouble
[46:00.640 --> 46:06.320]  you find out that every major vaccine is triggering diabetes attacking the
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.560]  pancreas they don't care it intensifies
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.440]  they give the girls the hpv shot they get cancer they get autoimmune diseases
[46:15.440 --> 46:17.920]  doesn't matter they've already got a new syndrome
[46:17.920 --> 46:21.520]  so when you so so when your baby dies of a convulsion they say you shook your
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.440]  baby or they say it's sudden death it's the it's the it's the it's the it's the
[46:25.440 --> 46:28.160]  mattress never kill the baby before now it does
[46:28.160 --> 46:32.000]  or they say you shook your baby and arrest you it's a syndrome
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.880]  and the cops don't know the doctors don't know they're just giving the new
[46:34.880 --> 46:41.920]  syndrome by the experts it's quackery it's fraud it's scams
[46:41.920 --> 46:45.360]  and then they state in the british 10 year plan
[46:45.360 --> 46:50.240]  ministry of defense that western governments
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.000]  have deployed neutron bombs
[46:56.720 --> 47:01.600]  and that neutron bombs will be used i mean they know you're getting mad when
[47:01.600 --> 47:04.240]  they take everything you've got your pension funds everything that they
[47:04.240 --> 47:06.960]  know the police are going to riot with us
[47:06.960 --> 47:09.440]  they know the military there's a very good chance in fact they say it's
[47:09.440 --> 47:12.000]  probably going to happen in england the us and europe
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.600]  are going to march on capitals and the microwave guns don't work if the
[47:15.600 --> 47:18.560]  mercenaries flee if that doesn't work if the
[47:18.560 --> 47:21.840]  helicopters in every major city with knockout gas
[47:21.840 --> 47:25.360]  opiate gas don't work they'll use nerve gas and kill you
[47:25.360 --> 47:29.440]  and if that doesn't work they'll use a neutron bomb on you and they've said
[47:29.440 --> 47:35.840]  the neutron bombs are for us
[47:35.840 --> 47:39.520]  they're developed in the 60s publicly announced in the 70s
[47:39.520 --> 47:42.800]  and then you never hear about them again and that's because france
[47:42.800 --> 47:46.320]  in italy and south africa and england and germany
[47:46.320 --> 47:49.760]  and russia and japan and china and the united states
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.200]  are all together against the enemy that is the people
[47:53.200 --> 47:56.560]  do they still fight with each other occasionally do they jockey jockey for
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.960]  oil and power yes you know just like a local loco sinos per fights with each
[48:00.960 --> 48:05.600]  other every decade or so but they don't ever scare off
[48:05.600 --> 48:08.640]  their quarry they don't ever scare off who they're feeding on
[48:08.640 --> 48:12.640]  they don't ever scare off their slaves they don't ever scare off the deer
[48:12.640 --> 48:17.840]  the prey just like pelicans may fight over a school of fish
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.800]  but they never warn the fish so another pelican doesn't get them
[48:22.800 --> 48:26.320]  your pelicans fight over a great spot right off the jetty where the fish like
[48:26.320 --> 48:29.440]  to come in at the tide yeah i've seen pelicans getting
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.720]  fights with each other little arguments but they sure don't
[48:34.720 --> 48:43.120]  run the fish off and see that's how it works here
[48:43.120 --> 48:46.240]  and so that's what we face that's what we're under
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.240]  institutionalized mass murder you think the nazis were bad
[48:50.240 --> 48:54.320]  killing millions of people in death camps putting fluoride in the water
[48:54.320 --> 48:58.000]  using ibm international business machines donated
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.600]  by thomas watson to decide who to kill who to work
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.160]  how long to work somebody what to feed them with their id number
[49:06.160 --> 49:09.840]  you know who was given the contract by the new world order
[49:09.840 --> 49:13.520]  over 60 years ago to run the global grid ibm ibm is
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.680]  global government it is an institution it is run by zealots

[49:50.960 --> 49:55.840]  and what makes the power elite tick and sure everybody isn't going to listen
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.320]  to us at first but as they see everything we've talked about unfold
[50:00.320 --> 50:03.920]  then they'll finally look at globalist documents then they'll finally look at
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.920]  think tank planning and long-term strategic operations
[50:07.920 --> 50:13.520]  then serious people intelligent people will finally look at what we've claimed

[50:17.120 --> 50:23.920]  not about sarah palin or john mccain or rock obama

[54:19.440 --> 54:22.160]  and i hear some of the talk show host starting to pick up on it but they'll
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.160]  just use catchphrases and repeat the terms we use
[54:26.160 --> 54:30.240]  we need all of us seem to really get into this in depth maybe i'll have erin
[54:30.240 --> 54:33.920]  in there in the third hour because we did a four part series on eugenics and

[54:36.720 --> 54:40.320]  they've used basic psychology to neutralize us and tell us the elite
[54:40.320 --> 54:43.680]  doesn't exist so we can't even ever get to the point of
[54:43.680 --> 54:47.200]  resisting them i mean it's it's just amazing to watch it all
[54:47.200 --> 54:51.040]  happen uh but look john john eddie

[54:54.800 --> 54:58.240]  uh now i'm just going to calls i've got to just shut up and take your calls
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.480]  john in illinois twenty thirty minutes ago i've answered your question i think
[55:02.480 --> 55:06.800]  about you know not wanting to execute the elite
[55:06.800 --> 55:09.840]  but to put them in prison for the rest of their lives because it's a very
[55:09.840 --> 55:14.320]  dangerous pandora's box to start political executions
[55:14.320 --> 55:19.840]  well i agree i concur all a a french revolution style
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.160]  uh a thing can really get out of control but i'm saying if we have a peaceful
[55:24.160 --> 55:29.040]  revolution we impanela grand jury these men are indicted and found guilty i
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.200]  think that the top guys need to answer for their crime
[55:33.200 --> 55:38.160]  they must answer and uh that's it and uh also i was at the rally for the
[55:38.160 --> 55:43.520]  republic it was very inspiring jesse ventura surprised us all
[55:43.520 --> 55:47.680]  by coming out for nine eleven truth basically now i know most of the paul
[55:47.680 --> 55:51.440]  supporters uh are nine eleven truthers but that's something that
[55:51.440 --> 55:55.040]  is kept in the closet did you see any gas but by
[55:55.040 --> 55:59.920]  some of the main line republicans going no no i did not but there's also
[55:59.920 --> 56:03.360]  another uh something i'd like to relate to you
[56:03.360 --> 56:06.720]  during the evening before representative paul spoke
[56:06.720 --> 56:11.520]  there was an announcement between speakers for all republican delegates
[56:11.520 --> 56:14.720]  to return to st paul to the convention
[56:14.720 --> 56:18.240]  and i don't know if the gentleman who was making the announcement was pulling
[56:18.240 --> 56:23.040]  everybody's legs but he said that that means there's 500 more spaces down
[56:23.040 --> 56:27.040]  here on the floor folks come on down
[56:28.240 --> 56:31.520]  absolutely a lot of them were ron paul supporters i appreciate you
[56:31.520 --> 56:38.640]  calling in john uh let's go to john in california you're on the air
[56:38.640 --> 56:42.240]  okay he dropped off eddie in new york you're on the air okay i have a
[56:42.240 --> 56:45.280]  suggestion for you and also i think i discovered a name for the syndrome that's
[56:45.280 --> 56:47.120]  killing all the young men around the world
[56:47.120 --> 56:50.800]  it's a variation of cleaners syndrome you know cleaners are the guys who go and
[56:50.800 --> 56:53.760]  kill all the witnesses after the fascination so this is a slight variation
[56:53.760 --> 56:56.400]  of that yeah i mean when you get tazard and died it's not the tazer it's a
[56:56.400 --> 56:59.680]  syndrome mm-hmm and look they'll tell the cattle that they'll
[56:59.680 --> 57:03.200]  believe it my suggestion is something i picked up from
[57:03.200 --> 57:06.640]  ron paul campaign they used to have a little uh
[57:06.640 --> 57:09.200]  what he called a rubber stamp saying ron paul for president
[57:09.200 --> 57:13.120]  i just heard two more rubber stamps me the first line says 911 with an inside
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.880]  job second line says www.infowars.com
[57:16.880 --> 57:20.320]  i stamp it on every dollar bill every 20 dollar bill everything i spend on all
[57:20.320 --> 57:22.800]  my checks so people can order these things online
[57:22.800 --> 57:25.120]  just go get a rubber stamp saying yeah the government wants to
[57:25.120 --> 57:27.360]  surveil us and watch us and try to intimidate us
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.720]  how about tens of millions of us just make so much noise
[57:30.720 --> 57:34.160]  that i mean that there are millions more of us and there are them
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.840]  literally it's like mark kornke always says using a hunting analogy
[57:37.840 --> 57:41.200]  it's like moose hunting they have to have a lottery because only one out of five
[57:41.200 --> 57:43.360]  or six people gets to actually go moose hunting
[57:43.360 --> 57:47.680]  because there's not enough moose i mean this is like a million to one here
[57:47.680 --> 57:52.720]  the new world order operates off of allusion off of lies and fraud and we
[57:52.720 --> 57:56.080]  have the power what's your take on prince charles couple
[57:56.080 --> 57:59.200]  with the same jim oh food with that everybody should go organically
[57:59.200 --> 58:04.320]  so it'll become a good guy or is there some other aspect to it well no uh the
[58:04.320 --> 58:08.640]  elites do know that gmo's bad they are aware of what's going on and so
[58:08.640 --> 58:11.760]  they have to get ready to pose as the good guys in fact it's come out the
[58:11.760 --> 58:15.760]  royal family owns controlling stock in one of the big three
[58:15.760 --> 58:20.720]  gmo companies but see they're creating the crisis but then he has to position
[58:20.720 --> 58:24.320]  himself as the good guy for the solution
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.720]  and then oh we need a global government to stop gmo you understand
[58:28.720 --> 58:31.760]  just like they create the terrorist and fund them and then oh give your rights
[58:31.760 --> 58:33.840]  up we'll protect you from the terrorist or oh

[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:26.320]  i want to talk about the big picture today
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:29.760]  yeah it's annoying having 30 million illegal aliens
[1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:33.200]  predominantly from mexico running around saying the u.s belongs in mexico
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:36.960]  get the gringo and to have the media cover it up
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:39.360]  because the globalists want to break down our borders and destroy the middle
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:43.280]  class turn us all into slaves
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:47.120]  but if you pull back past the propaganda you can see how the poor mexicans are
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:51.200]  being manipulated just like americans are manipulated to want to kill iraqis
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:54.480]  and you realize that they're engaging in eugenics that about one third of the
[1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:58.560]  mexicans born in mexico city 30 plus million people
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:03.760]  are born with a syndrome without their brains because of the toxic waste
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:06.320]  you know what and i love those poor children being born without brains i
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:08.960]  want that to stop that's real environmental degradation
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:12.800]  that's a real crisis but you'll hear nothing about stopping that
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:16.000]  no they want you to tax yourself and what you breathe
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.680]  and what you exhale for a global tracking grid to make humans
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:25.520]  an enemy and to make breathing attacks so when i know that they've got death
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:29.280]  mills set up by eugenicists that call black people in hispanics
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:33.120]  human weeds and i know that it's quote liberal
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  i know that i can expose them and stop the murder of blacks and hispanics and
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:40.080]  whites i don't care what color you are are your
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:43.600]  mexican are your black are your conservative leaders
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:47.280]  telling you are your white leaders telling you
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:51.440]  that it's a eugenics operation no they're not
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:54.240]  let me tell you something i've had larika and quiches in my face yelling and
[1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:58.000]  screaming i just happened last week in denver
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.440]  and i said to them you know what uh why are you liberal foundation liberals
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:06.000]  talking about plant parenthood in the latino and black communities there to
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  openly exterminate them and boy those foundation liberals
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:15.120]  the color goes out of their face and they turn and they walk away
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:18.800]  because they know you got them
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.680]  you understand so they can tribally play us off against each other and i'm
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:26.880]  tribal i believe in the united states it's not perfect but it's the best that's
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:30.240]  been here and it's my heritage and i believe in the bill of rights and
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:33.760]  constitution it's better than anything else
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:41.040]  but at the end of the day i don't hate mexicans even if on the mexican radio
[1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:44.800]  in texas they say we're taking over ha ha ha dumb green goes
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:49.440]  i mean it sounds like a kookluck's clan rally but the other way around
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:52.800]  i don't hate them i understand they've been manipulated
[1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:55.840]  they've been brainwashed all the bad things that have happened to them
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:59.360]  have been blamed on the united states and to a certain extent it's true
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:03.600]  but it's our elites doing it and i know the mexican elite
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:06.080]  one of the most corrupt and powerful in the world
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:09.440]  is bought and paid for by chase manhattan city bank
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:12.640]  and i know that they're using the u.s as a revolutionary steam valve
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.000]  to keep their people from ever taking over i'd love mexico to become a first
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.200]  world nation i'd love the people to be able to have their own land and make
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:22.720]  their own money i'd love to go down there and be friends with them
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:31.680]  it's a beautiful place i'd love to go live down there
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:34.800]  well we have to be enemies don't we because the new world order said so in
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:37.920]  divide and conquer people go oh wait if it's divide and conquer alex why
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:40.400]  then are you against the open borders and let me come keys to
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:43.520]  because i understand they're using the divide and conquer so i have to be
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:47.120]  against the new world order program if the new world order is for vaccines i'm
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:49.440]  against it if the new world order is for
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:52.800]  planned parenthood i'm against it if the new world order
[1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:57.120]  is for open borders i'm against it and then i could intellectually and
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:02.960]  scientifically go analyze from a socio economic
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:09.120]  political sociological anthropology i can look at it from the anthropology
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:12.560]  angle and i can go and study and sure enough anything
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:16.480]  they're doing i need to be against now i mean they're real programs they're
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:20.560]  real operations they've got that other trick where they'll play a
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:27.600]  palan off against a biden and then debate who's the best vp when
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:30.480]  the president doesn't run anything much less of vp
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:33.920]  and then conservatives hear liberals attacking palan
[1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:37.840]  so oh she must be good and liberals hear conservatives attacking
[1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:41.840]  joe biden so he must be good so they also have false
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:47.920]  fights to manipulate you and i know you know that but i mean it
[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:51.120]  be really consciously i hear the other patriot talk shows they're all
[1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:54.560]  discussing the different vp's i mean we're not really doing that here

[1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:51.040]  on that subject really throwing a monkey wrench into the global taxers i mean
[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:54.160]  they knew it was going to cool off all their internal reports knew that
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.000]  uh decades ago but this kind of cool faster than they predicted
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.640]  so it's really kind of monkey wrenching them now but they're just saying it's
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:05.040]  global cooling man-made greenhouse gases now so that's coming up

[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:32.000]  hey alex go ahead i was uh i just wanted to uh make mention of an unrelated
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.240]  thing i was watching the um republican convention yesterday
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:40.400]  and the coolest thing happened in the first opening shot
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:46.160]  that my dvr caught here while baby it was you know doing his introduction
[1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:50.480]  someone was holding up a great big god i'm 11 truth now
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:55.760]  banner on a pole right over his left shoulder
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:10:00.640]  well i know that on msnbc for several hours off and on
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:05.840]  9-11 truthers had huge investigate 9-11 9-11's an inside job banners and
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:10.640]  signs and visually took it over and off and on because the police said no
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:14.960]  bullhorns were able to chant 9-11's an inside job
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:18.320]  and they also gave speeches but those didn't go across it's too complex it
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:21.520]  won't make it across when you're talking over somebody you got to make it
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:26.160]  simple but are you talking about something separate
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:30.080]  oh right on the tv screen as during what
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:35.760]  uh... at the very beginning of the uh... cnbc coverage their seven-hour stretch of
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:40.560]  uh... republican uh convention coverage so you saw that today or
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:45.360]  yesterday i thought today on the dvr taken yesterday it was i
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:48.720]  it started recording like sixty well they're gonna be out there uh today
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:51.760]  this is the last day of the convention and they'll be a wind down tomorrow so
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:55.200]  everybody should be in st paul out of these parks
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:59.120]  uh... yeah but i mean if five of you go and chant together
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:03.200]  9-11's an inside job or info wars dot com or we are change
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:09.120]  dot org it will go out over tv i mean if people will just unfortunately the 9-11
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:12.960]  truthers are mainly giving speeches and then all you hear is
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:20.160]  again because you have the host talking over you but but even
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:23.440]  let's do a test right now i'm going to be talking normal and then i want you to
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:26.400]  just say 9-11's an inside job over and over again
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:31.440]  and listen to this listeners you can't help but focus on what tim in texas is
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:32.080]  saying
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:35.600]  tim are you ready i'm gonna talk like i'm normally talking
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:38.720]  ready well i uh... got up this morning
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:42.640]  and uh... i want you to go ahead and say 9-11's an inside job ten times over me
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:47.200]  okay talk talk over me tim go ahead you start saying 9-11 is an inside job
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:52.240]  anyways i uh... got up this morning i got i got up this morning and i uh... 9-11
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:55.920]  is an inside job help make my children breakfast with my wife
[1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:59.200]  by job and then i uh... 9-11 is an inside job
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:02.320]  ready for about an hour and a half reading this is an inside job
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:05.840]  and then i went and i got on the steps effort for twenty five minutes
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:11.680]  9-11 is all the time i have to do that 9-11 is an inside job now now
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:15.920]  that's enough thanks now now listeners compare it to if he just starts
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:16.480]  talking
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:19.680]  okay start start giving a speech tart start talking about what you did this
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:22.000]  morning and i'll talk about what i did this morning
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.200]  and then all it does is become unintelligible
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:28.960]  but if we chant simple things it goes over
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:30.960]  and i'm not trying to tell people what to do
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:34.160]  i just it's ineffective when other groups go out and give speeches
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:38.640]  over the person it doesn't work now now you go ahead tim
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:42.000]  and the best thing about okay well i'm gonna start talking over you too
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.120]  and uh... just keep talking no don't be polite just keep talking about the
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:47.760]  alright and then what i did was is uh...
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:52.000]  i went out and i got in the car and then i noticed that i had forgotten my
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:56.720]  papers cv screen outside i noticed that i left my papers in the
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:00.800]  printer in my house yeah so i was almost like into the studio to turn around
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:04.800]  and uh... come back home now folks you notice you couldn't really
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:08.880]  that was very annoying i just made you tune out but if you chant the same
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:11.600]  thing or basically nine eleven to the inside job ten times
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:15.680]  and then investigate nine eleven ten times then google inside job ten times
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:19.680]  and then info wars ten times or whatever you want you will take over these
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:24.880]  transmissions okay i'm gonna stop interrupting you now tim go ahead
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:28.400]  well the best thing is uh... to me is that
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:31.920]  rather than anything audio it was a great big blue
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:36.160]  visual banner yes right over his left shoulder
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.680]  doesn't matter what he was saying people were seeing that by the way
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:42.880]  i did confirm with we are changing nine eleven trip minnesota
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:46.960]  that the local uh... republican supporters are attacking
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:50.960]  the banners and trying to pull them down uh... and the same thing happened with
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:55.200]  democrats so again they think you're attacking their party
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:58.000]  the two parties prop each other up go ahead
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.440]  all the great thing is though i torch the end of that while uh... Sarah palin
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:05.920]  was speaking uh... cnbc flashed over to where they were
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:09.200]  actually four guys in suits escorting
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:12.800]  uh... uh... this young woman out of the uh...
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:17.360]  stadium and as uh... the four guys in suits were escorting her out another
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:20.000]  guy in a suit look just like him
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.520]  was bringing down a sign uh...
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:27.760]  that had a pro-sera palin message on it
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:30.160]  it was just odd
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:34.560]  well that's why when barack obama went to berlin they said no signs no barack
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:39.840]  obama no uh... because if they just pull down investigate nine eleven signs
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:44.400]  you'll have a sea of blue and red barack obama with the all-seeing i rising up of
[1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:46.880]  saran behind them
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:50.480]  but in austin and other cities i'd investigate black and white sign the
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.560]  local peanut guys did that here
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:55.120]  project for new america citizen great folks
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:58.720]  they raise up their what black and white sign totally took over the image
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:01.840]  really good psychological counter warfare
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:06.320]  totally dominated so they're afraid of that so they banned signs
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:09.920]  uh... again first amendment at most of these events now that's really
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:13.040]  unenforceable the police are losing lawsuits
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:15.760]  they don't care that's all it's our money to begin with
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:18.720]  but but i i i i misunderstood you're saying
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:22.160]  during uh... sarah palin speech
[1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:26.000]  somebody held up and investigate nine eleven tell us from start to finish what
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:27.120]  you witnessed
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:29.760]  actually not the uh... start nine eleven as a risk
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:32.960]  courting a um... uh... a young woman out
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:36.800]  these four guys in our suits that you know
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:39.200]  probably with republican party for all i know
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:42.320]  we're squirting her out another guy that looked just like them
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:44.120]  was bringing down
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:46.640]  a hand-painted uh... palin power
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.280]  signed i don't know if uh... the party was passing them out to people that
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:54.160]  didn't think to make them beforehand or whatever but
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:58.240]  she's flashing the peace sign as she's been escorted out of the building
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:00.480]  and uh... another guy in a suit
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:04.480]  is bringing down another palin power sign on poster board
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:07.440]  yeah that's because they can't allow any signs
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:11.200]  that don't look official again anything official is okay it's all
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:12.960]  selectively enforce anything
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:17.040]  not uh... official isn't allowed that's in some cases that sounds like what
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:19.360]  you're saying here but in the case of
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:21.920]  berlin and other places they're just saying no signs
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:25.760]  i appreciate your call tim let's go to uh... georgia
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:27.920]  in new mexico you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:33.760]  hi there alex hi i've uh... watch your dvd the end game i love it i have watched
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:36.400]  uh... truth uh... rising i love it
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:40.160]  i also had a subject about four five things i'm going to ask you
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:43.280]  since i don't get your radio program here i have to dial in long distance and
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:45.760]  just didn't listen to the program that way
[1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:49.280]  i'm always behind or i missed out on things but when you were in Denver you
[1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:50.560]  were going out to a
[1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:54.240]  com a concentration camp investigate that and then i did never get to hear
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:55.520]  what you found
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:59.440]  okay uh... it was a secret camp you know the news issue is is that the federally
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:01.840]  funded local denver police run camp
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:03.000]  was a secret
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:04.560]  out in this big warehouse
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:07.280]  they told reporters to leave and threaten to arrest him at the time we got
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:09.080]  there were more p r savvy
[1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:11.760]  and we're really somewhat nice to us other than saying that arrest us if we
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:12.480]  crossed
[1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:14.880]  any of the police line tape around the whole facility
[1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:17.800]  okay uh... but they did overall arrest about
[1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:19.920]  three hundred people that they reported
[1:17:19.920 --> 1:17:22.680]  last weekend in around three hundred
[1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.160]  in the five days
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:26.120]  uh... and did take them to that facility
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:28.240]  we'll let them out of Denver
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:28.960]  pardon me
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:32.160]  but where was it i don't know i i don't have the address in front of me okay
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:35.720]  and secondly i was going to ask you did you know that there's a Mediterranean
[1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:38.600]  Union that was formed in june of thirteen
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:43.160]  it was announced by the french uh... a u president of the of the e you yes they
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:47.240]  announced a year ago the asian union and then officially formed
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:48.880]  about three weeks ago
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:52.840]  and they officially announced with sarcozy about seven months ago
[1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:56.200]  a Mediterranean Union and officially formed a few weeks ago
[1:17:56.200 --> 1:18:00.760]  and there are actual news articles saying i'm insane me personally
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:02.520]  and that none of this exist
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:06.240]  well African union doesn't exist they have a capital building it was built ten
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.440]  years ago they have meetings every day
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:09.520]  doesn't exist
[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:11.480]  european union doesn't exist
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:13.680]  north american union doesn't exist
[1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:15.640]  asian union doesn't exist
[1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:17.640]  and the public just says you know what
[1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:20.560]  it doesn't exist and russia attack georgia
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:24.240]  well since i don't have a computer i'm an older lady i don't have a computer i
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:26.640]  just call the main library here in albuquerque
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:29.680]  and they told me all about the north american union and they told me all
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:30.520]  about the
[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:34.240]  mediterranean union now i learned uh... through a different newspaper article
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:38.080]  but the south of the south american states have now joined a month ago
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:41.120]  i was actually two months ago chavez kicked that off and they're claiming it's
[1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:43.800]  separate from the new world order but it's part of the false left-right
[1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:44.760]  paradigm
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:48.200]  in uh... nineteen ninety-eight there was a
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:50.520]  huge article they printed in whole
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:52.200]  a u n plan
[1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:55.400]  they said the world's getting wise to world government
[1:18:55.400 --> 1:18:56.520]  and they don't want it
[1:18:56.520 --> 1:19:01.400]  so we've got to give them a left choice that's quote anti-us socialist
[1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:03.040]  and a right choice
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:06.200]  that's basically george w bush this is right before you got into office
[1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:09.000]  alright uh... and uh... they were even talking about you know right wing
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.040]  government and again it's that false choice
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:14.280]  that props up the overall world government instead of saying we don't
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:18.040]  want a world government they say okay you've got a choice strawberry ice cream
[1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:19.880]  or vanilla ice cream
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:23.000]  and then you think you're having a choice but what if you don't want ice cream
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:24.320]  you see
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.200]  or you know instead of giving it something that sounds tasty a bucket of
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:30.960]  nails you can eat these three penny nails of these four penny nails
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:34.720]  which we know which nails do you want to eat instead of no i don't want to eat
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:36.680]  either bucket of nails
[1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:38.800]  and uh... it's the same thing
[1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:42.560]  you know it's it's all my god i'm for obama i'm not for mccain or i'm for mccain
[1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:47.400]  i'm not for obama the to prop each other up it props up the two-party system
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:50.800]  it props up the two-party dictatorship the twins
[1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:57.800]  we'll be right back stay with us

[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:24.880]  Gary in Illinois first-time caller welcome Gary hey Alex I've been
[1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:28.240]  listening to you for about 10 years and I think had a bunch of stuffed event on
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:34.040]  you I hope you have some time I'll start out with an idea are you familiar with
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:38.960]  chip ins for our contributions for different causes or yes someone's
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:43.920]  familiar how about you know they got the voice stress evaluators out there they
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:49.680]  have stated the art stuff that looks pretty good you can find film on that
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:55.960]  on the internet but get a lie detector and use a split screen so when these
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:01.440]  bozos go on TV and tell their lies you can show what the machine is saying and
[1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:05.680]  have somebody giving an analysis of it how does that sound well that's more of
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:11.360]  an art form than a science and you know for 40 years plus people went to the
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:15.560]  electric chair the people went to the gallows people got lethal injections
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:21.480]  all the lie detectors and it turns out if you know they've got you in a police
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:25.080]  room and they've got you hook up to a lie detector and you're freaked out
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:29.400]  thinking that they think that you killed somebody obviously your heart rates gonna
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:33.840]  jump obviously your stress is going to increase when they say did you murder
[1:25:33.840 --> 1:25:39.000]  the little girl and then you know they think you did and so they really found
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:44.160]  that it was used to frame people and now with DNA they found that more than a
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.720]  third of people on death row in every case where they get DNA were not the
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:52.560]  individuals a lot of times people confess later and release photos of even
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:57.360]  how they did it so it's a hundred percent so a third of the people and a lot
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:01.680]  of times the police even know that they just go out and grab somebody generally
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:05.240]  who's already been an ex-con so their rationale is well they deserve it anyways
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:12.000]  and so now because the lie detectors have been discredited they're moving on
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:18.480]  to MRI brain scans they're moving on to new lie detectors and which which have
[1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:21.440]  been proven to be frauds like where they where they hook you up to a brain
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:27.000]  machine and it decides if you've seen that image before if your brain fires up
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.280]  the area that's seen say a person dead and bloody on a floor well who hasn't
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:36.360]  seen that a million times on television and then who says you can trust that
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:40.480]  government technician or corporate technician even if the machine can be
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:45.720]  proven to work you see I'm for the death penalty in a 10,000 bc scenario I
[1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:49.040]  believe that if somebody's caught doing something and you know they did it kill
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:56.000]  them but you know wise counsel you know or wise you know group of jurors to
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:59.240]  decide that that's where the old wise men come in but you can't trust the old
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:04.880]  wise men now you probably never could they will set people up for political
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:10.480]  expediency the government is so corrupt and evil and so tyrannical you can't
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:16.040]  trust them to carry out the garbage much less preside over life and death
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:21.880]  you understand yeah well this would be used for news broadcast when Bush or
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:25.280]  somebody else gets up there that's what I had in mind not necessarily you know a
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:28.960]  well I mean obviously there's something to it I mean disingenuous
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:34.760]  George Bush radiates disingenuousness but Bill Clinton radiated I did not have
[1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:38.840]  sex with that woman and it in and he put out everybody language and every fact
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:43.120]  that was true there are a lot of liars who know how to believe what they're
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:49.040]  saying and create false conviction they're called good actors okay and so the
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:53.840]  problem is none of this stuff's a hundred percent Boba yeah but you know
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:59.040]  it is somebody else might be further advanced and knowledge about this I
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:03.720]  just thought yeah but how does the mass trust them you see how do you trust the
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:08.120]  person who's invented the better mousetrap yeah I see some stuff look
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:12.200]  pretty good but another thing is yeah but that's that's military industrial
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:16.480]  complex companies with these different newscasts selling you on brain scanners
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:21.680]  and selling you on passive MRIs and selling you on passive biometrics and
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:25.920]  I'm telling you I can show you just as many studies Tampa had to pull face
[1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:30.000]  scanners out I pull it out they quit giving it to local police squad car
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.960]  access because they kept SWAT teaming innocent construction workers and
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:38.560]  people at outdoor cafes thinking they were bank robbers from the NCIC database
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:44.560]  because the machine wasn't working well I have another idea go ahead activists
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:51.520]  out there we recently had a August 11th street action where we're passing
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:56.200]  our DVDs up here in Chicago and we're in front of the ABC studios where they
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:01.360]  put him in a glass cage on street level and it was pretty interesting because
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:08.040]  it really pissed off the talking heads and it was quite effective in that they
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:13.760]  saw how readily the people were taking the DVDs so there's a lot of cities
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:20.440]  across the nation they got those window newscast setups New York City has a

[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:59.320]  calls from Illinois today Gary finish up yeah so if people go to YouTube and
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:03.800]  look under a swizzle Steve stuff they could note the reaction of the reporters
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:11.280]  they were perplexed and pretty mad about it especially the woman reporter now
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:14.840]  now tell folks how you got organized how you took action what you did where you
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:20.560]  went oh we're part of Lone Lantern with Gary Franchi out of Chicago sure and
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:25.760]  tell folks what you did yeah well we we go on a street on every 11th with a
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:31.800]  minimum of 500 DVDs also stuffed with deception dollars and rubber stamping on
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:36.920]  the back for more information and directing people at info wars by the
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:44.480]  way and we go out there and if we have literature made up we use that also so a
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:48.000]  couple guys got there early and they happened to be in suits one guy
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:53.160]  purposely went out that way another guy was working downtown and the reporters
[1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:57.000]  were sitting in the window looking at them and talking about them and you know
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:02.440]  some had kind of a smirk on our face according to the early guy well it's
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.600]  upsetting to see the slaves communicating with each other a hitting
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:12.440]  active that scares the criminals yeah so later on 13 more of us came down there
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:18.600]  and we broke out the DVDs some split out into other areas on the corners and that
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:25.200]  but we're mostly congregated in front of the windows and we had our signs a
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:30.480]  seven-year-old woman seventy-year-old woman came down there and she helped us
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:38.520]  out and we were talking amongst the pedestrians going by and some of them
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:42.920]  were pretty interested in what we had to say so all this took place in front of
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:48.360]  these people and between commercials and I had you know they're looking at us
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:52.080]  and seen what's going on where we had pretty good reception that day it's
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:56.800]  getting better all the time they were horrified to see fellow slaves talking
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:01.680]  with each other handing out material oh no they're getting wise to us what are
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:05.280]  we going to do and of course those and of course those local news people are
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:08.960]  nothing they all think they're part of the power structure you run into them
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:12.880]  and they're nothing you know they would be something if they were on the
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:16.640]  street with you standing against evil they think there's something joining with
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:20.720]  the power structure and that makes them less than nothing I appreciate your call
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:25.920]  good to hear from you Gary let's go to David in Missouri go ahead David
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:31.800]  hello Alex hi I'm a prison plan dot TV subscriber I just want to let you know
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.880]  fabled enemies is truly quite amazing I enjoyed watching that I know that you're
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:40.640]  good friends with George Norrie and I wanted to let you know that I heard the
[1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:45.040]  show two nights ago that they had about aspartame and Donald Rumsfeld
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:49.680]  involvement in and getting that push through and everything and I I'm just
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:54.320]  totally disgusted by the fact that you know he worked so hard to get that
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:58.840]  through use the good buddy thing and you cannot get away from that stuff it's
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:03.600]  eating holes in our brains it's causing cancer you know amongst every all the
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:07.200]  other things that it does and by the way listeners when he was the head of
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:11.680]  Searle Rumsfeld it's like he's a devil with that appears with a poop of
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:17.600]  smoke at every evil juncture giving weapons to Saddam it's Rumsfeld giving
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:21.760]  nuclear reactors for nuclear weapons production North Korea now the head of
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:26.080]  the company that did that Rumsfeld getting aspartame approved getting
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:31.840]  Terminator seeds approved Rumsfeld I mean Rumsfeld is truly evil I mean he is
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:36.480]  truly a gopher for the most evil elements of the New World Order and for
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:43.520]  those that don't know in 1981 Searle itself owned by Monsanto did a whole
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:48.920]  bunch of their own internal test and all the baby monkeys they would put the
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:52.680]  aspartame in the milk it would kill them first they'd have seizures and they
[1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:59.040]  died and they still got it approved and now it's in thousands of foods you
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:02.960]  cannot find folks stuff you think full sugar gum no it's even in that
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:10.360]  Wrigley's big red it's in foods it's in tens of thousands of products and it's
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:17.480]  an absolute fact and it's by design now now right when they put it on the
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:22.560]  market and approved it they announced that one little study when they fed
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:32.800]  500 times the mass to rats of the original sweetener when they fed 500
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:38.960]  times that to them not the aspartame you know not the equal as its name is but
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:44.520]  when they fed the pink packs of the older type system to them yes you got a
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:49.320]  few fatty non malignant tumors in the rats so so when you tell the public
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:54.920]  hey it's aspartame the blue packs what's bad they say no no no no the news
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:40:00.960]  says it's the pink pack so they make them put a warning on the pink pack right
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:07.160]  when the blue came out go ahead right and I was I was a vegan for over two and
[1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:10.680]  a half years I felt great I was eating you know vegetables and fruits and
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:16.280]  grains and stuff like that and I am absolutely not even able to afford to
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:21.120]  eat that way my wife and I went on that diet because she was a diabetic and she
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:26.000]  still is diabetic and she had to get off of her medicines from the doctor because
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.520]  they're making her sick she was staying up all night long with with diarrhea in
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:33.000]  most cases every time that she'd go in they'd want to change you know her
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:37.040]  medication and she would be sick for three or four days and finally we just you
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:40.280]  know decided no you're just getting worse with it let's do some do something
[1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:44.800]  different so we change her diet her blood sugar went down everything but it
[1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:50.880]  was a hundred dollars a piece per week for us both to eat organic fruits and
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:57.840]  vegetables and to get off of this stuff and the average person cannot live you
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:01.240]  know can't eat that way that's for two people that they hundred bucks a month
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:07.880]  just for food and it it just totally disgusts me that this guy pushed so hard
[1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:10.800]  to get this stuff through it's in our pockets and like you said in our chewing
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:15.640]  gum it makes it almost impossible for you to even go to the store and find
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:18.560]  something that you can afford that doesn't have this garbage and for those
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:24.880]  that don't know the the GMO and by the way that's how they produce aspartame
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:30.600]  produced organically it's really weird stuff and the world I love them I mean
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:35.280]  the whole GMO complex is part of the eugenics program they state it they are
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:38.640]  taking over the food they're patenting it they are shutting down the family
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:44.080]  farm and ranch go ahead and it's you'll also notice like say for instance it
[1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:48.880]  doesn't say aspartame directly on it it will say contains phenylatronics so if
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:52.800]  anybody is seeing that on their food get away from that stuff because it makes
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:57.680]  you sick I remember drinking at that diet soda one time just out of the blue
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:01.360]  because I was really craving it needed some caffeine or something and I was
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:06.800]  main angry as heck after I drank that stuff I mean it just well look look look
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:10.720]  look emotional system they knew when they introduced it in 82 with all the
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:15.160]  coca-cid ads with the showgirls out there you know dancing to it
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:22.040]  coca-cid coca-cid right they knew that it is a neurotoxin when a cobra bites you
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:29.120]  you get high as a kite when when you ingest poison you get high off most
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:34.120]  poisons arsenic will do that cyanide does that in small amounts you know a few
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:38.680]  grams of it you're dead they know what they're doing and it came out their own
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:45.560]  internal documents that this is addictive again these people are diabolical
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:48.920]  I'll actually whatever there's what it would be you know when they get on camera
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:53.040]  everything's great we're doing this and I remember a quote from Donald Rumsfeld
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:56.640]  one time whenever somebody asked him a question he said you know wise man said
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:42:59.360]  to me one time if you're not making anybody angry you're not getting
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:07.160]  anything accomplished and I'm like you're an idiot so anyway I'll let you
[1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:10.600]  go and I just want to let you know that you and George Norring my personal
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:17.600]  heroes take care thank you you know folks can criticize George Norring because
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:24.960]  he has you know two macabre a space alien stuff on the show but before he took
[1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:33.040]  over that's all that was on that show and now about 30% of the time he's
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:40.280]  talking about issues that we can document aspartame sodium fluoride
[1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:50.000]  mercury in the vaccines fema camps and he has done so much for alternative
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.960]  media movement the establishment thinks that well by mixing it in on that show
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:58.520]  that you know by letting George do that that you know somehow it just discredits
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:03.680]  everything it does the opposite people can differentiate and George Norring is
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:07.880]  a really nice guy and he's taking a lot of risk having me on he's gone through a
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:12.280]  lot of heat for having me on and he's taken that show in an entirely different
[1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:19.280]  direction and I'm not getting into a fight with art bell art bell doesn't
[1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:23.360]  particularly like me that's fine I've nothing against our bell I think he was
[1:44:23.360 --> 1:44:30.800]  very talented radio talk show host but I don't expect everything from people and
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:35.760]  I'm very thankful to coast to coast AM and everything they've done for my
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:41.320]  websites and in my films in this radio show I mean most talk show hosts won't
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:45.240]  in interview other talk show host and that's because they know that normally
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:49.960]  you get stabbed in the back or the person turns against you in fact that
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:56.760]  kind of the patriot movement kind of ruined art bell art bell was doing
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:00.480]  anti-neural order shows started to do them in about 98 99
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:05.360]  started interviewing the staples of the patriot movement and they did what
[1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:10.720]  they always did they made up a bunch of stuff about him he art had to sue him
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:17.440]  some of the affiliates got burned because of it who didn't deserve that and it
[1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:23.360]  almost shut down patriot talk radio and then our bell just said you know what I
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:27.440]  had these patriots on if you want to know the truth of what happened he's I
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:33.400]  had these patriots on and they absolutely stabbed me in the back and then I saw
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:40.600]  our totally flip-flop and go the other direction and you know what it makes you
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:47.520]  want to be nasty it makes you want to be isolated when group after group I mean
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:56.640]  when you're the big fish and you know my websites are both info wars.com and
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:01.560]  prisonplanet.com are both rated as big as coast to coast AM so together they're
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:06.600]  bigger they're double the size but as for radio audience I've got a few million
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:12.440]  in a week coast to coast got 16 million a night and that's rated that's on rated
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:18.600]  stations where it's on the arbitrant and I tell you it's a lot higher than that so
[1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:22.760]  there's nothing that big anywhere in the media other than Rush Limbaugh with 22
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:30.120]  million listeners and a lot of these crazy patriot people who aren't real
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:33.840]  patriots they're egomaniacs George Norris actually had them on a few times you'll
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:37.520]  have this host and then they always attack him in a month or two talk about
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:43.720]  killing the goose that lays the golden eggs you guys are so overconfident you'll
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:47.080]  have some little bitty radio show without even affiliates some internet
[1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:51.240]  thing and and George Norris will have them on for an hour and they'll turn
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:57.640]  around and so they tell the biggest lies about him and they never has them back
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:03.000]  on and then they bitch and say oh look he didn't have me back on after I said he
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:07.320]  was this and that well yeah it's like inviting somebody over for coffee and
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:11.360]  they they stand up in the chair and start urinating on the on in the sugar
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:17.560]  bowl I mean people are weird you don't think I don't want people to fill in on
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:21.720]  this show people to work with me people I want to build up rising tide raises all
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:27.360]  ships I believe in that but unfortunately the public is ruined now
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:32.240]  our listeners are the best the patriot movement the freedom lovers Ron Paul
[1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:38.440]  people the truth movement the Liberty movement people that the reality
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:44.360]  movement salt of the earth but so many opportunists so many people drift into
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:48.360]  this movement and then good people in the movement don't know what the beliefs
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:52.040]  we start fighting with each other and we get manipulated and set up against each
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:48:00.440]  other and this is not me talking about myself here because I don't care I mean
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:03.280]  I could walk out naked in front of a crowd of a million people with my pot
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:07.280]  belly hanging out it's not that I'm an exhibitionist it's actually the opposite
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:11.240]  but I don't care people think of me I really don't I really got to that point
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:22.760]  but I do care what distortions of who I am does to the movement and others who I
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:30.520]  mean literally we are the ocean this radio show my listeners are the ocean by
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:36.920]  every yardstick on which the growth and the explosion of the reality movement is
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:42.120]  based nine out of ten people will say they woke they woke up from my web
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:48.320]  sites of this show talk to them ask them I'm the most recognized name in this
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:53.080]  movement and the most serious name doesn't mean I'm perfect but we stayed
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:49:01.160]  away from things whether they're real or not that are discrediting and what is
[1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:08.560]  the things I get for that crazies completely obsessed with me 24-7 spewing
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:15.520]  every lie you can imagine every distortion every half truth but you
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:20.760]  it's not ever half it's more like what do you call a 10% truth you know there's
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:29.760]  always some node of truth some kernel of truth but then there's this whole lie
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:37.720]  built on to it and I see the attacks against myself both from governmental
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:43.320]  sectors co-intel pro sectors but it's not even that it's a ruined brainwashed
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:52.760]  brain damaged society who can wake up to a new world order but who are so
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:56.880]  morbidly obsessed that they can't get along with their neighbors their
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:02.120]  friends their family other people they just attack and I've watched this with
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:08.080]  George Norring he's had guest on after guests after guests and if after six
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:11.440]  months after George has them on they don't have them back on same thing with
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:17.080]  here they'll think you you don't like me you want to destroy me you didn't link
[1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:26.480]  to me I'm gonna get you and then it's a self-fulfilling process I mean every
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:29.440]  day I get these emails and calls you know you did this and you did that and
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:33.720]  respond to this or I'm gonna get you and I'll respond and say I don't even know
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:38.320]  what you're talking about and they'll say oh it's almost like a mass
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:43.800]  schizophrenia and I think this radio show attracts kind of people that are
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:48.240]  borderline because you're gonna have the dumbed-down mass who are in La La land
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:51.280]  their house could be on fire they wouldn't know it but then out of the awake
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:55.840]  spectrum you have that extreme of really what can only be described as
[1:50:55.840 --> 1:51:01.160]  egomaniacs schizophrenics borderline schizophrenics violence schizophrenics
[1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:06.440]  may I have everybody's attention please I've come with a message of information

[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:29.960]  way in case the listeners aren't aware of this I can officially tell you the
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:36.720]  radio show you said with affiliates internet listeners the films websites
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:43.120]  when it's one the everything we're doing is exploding thanks to you everything is
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:49.840]  exponentially growing just in our little corner of the info war I mean you know
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:54.160]  people can say motley crew evil devil music and I tend to agree with you I'm
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:57.920]  just using this as a as a gauge I've been sent a bunch of YouTube videos from
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:01.960]  their live concerts and we've confirmed they're playing long clips of terror
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:07.360]  storm long clips of truth rising and pointing at the big movie screens and
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:12.720]  saying check it out 9-11's an inside job and all these crew fans are calling us
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:17.080]  and I've got Henry Rollins on during the break I go hey I want to send you some
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:21.040]  of my films he's like well why do you need to do that I buy them Alex I love
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:29.080]  terror storm just got your second edition and again that's just a gauge of I had
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:33.520]  Ralph Nader's chief of staff telling me about in-game and you know how much he
[1:55:33.520 --> 1:55:38.360]  likes it and in like all of Ralph Nader's people were listeners these are
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:41.720]  supposed to be a socialist or whatever but they're waking up to the larger
[1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:47.520]  paradigm of the New World Order I mean someone call him that I mean we have to
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:53.120]  be prepared to win here we have to be prepared to actually wake people up and
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:57.360]  turn the tide but so much of our movement I guess kind of not the old line
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:03.000]  movement but earlier waves who haven't been as successful as this show are mad
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:10.360]  it's like no look at him get all that attention no no what are you worried
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:14.360]  about if all you're in it for is your ego and being a big shot as as my
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:19.480]  listeners wake more people up and make the Liberty movement bigger you get
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:23.240]  more people to listen to your little radio show or see your films and hell if
[1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:27.920]  you wouldn't act like demons you'd probably be on this show again I'm
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:32.240]  trying to spank some of our own movement out there into realizing you are
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:38.760]  screwing yourselves you've got to be nice behind the scenes you've got to be
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:47.000]  friendly you can't be a bunch of screwballs because every time I'm in the
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.360]  media every time some big event happens on the web then the attacks all
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:53.960]  intensify on a hundred fronts about other issues and it's purely pure
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:57:00.280]  jealousy we give all my enemies and attractors little news to all your
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:06.200]  attacks only make the radio show bigger all your attacks only empower me and
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:11.160]  then once they come to me then I give them real issues real information and
[1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:16.160]  so in a sick way you're actually helping things I believe it would be even
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:20.600]  bigger if you do people just stuck to issues and actually warn the public
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:26.560]  about vaccines and autism and diabetes or about sodium fluoride and cancer or
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:33.280]  about the larger eugenics program that's going on or if you gave people
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:38.240]  links to the different 9-11 films that are out there online for free or if you
[1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:42.480]  made copies of films like fabled enemies that just came out now shipping out on

[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:23.520]  from the advertising and there's a fell out there I can't remember whether it's
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:30.760]  survived martial law or whatever and his view is the question that she has for
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:36.120]  me and I can't answer it is will we all be killed if we have guns because what
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:40.440]  he seems to indicate is that unless you're militarily trained and you have
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:43.680]  an assault weapon and even if you do that you should bury it in the backyard
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:47.760]  you know until the first wave is over but for people with just regular weapons
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:51.840]  like you say you have and like some of the rest of us might have or not have
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:55.800]  you know I don't have a lot of weapons experience but that she's she's worried
[2:01:55.800 --> 2:02:01.040]  about that because apparently she wants to survive martial law you know so so
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:04.560]  she's she's quite nervous about weapons in general number one they're gonna stage
[2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:10.440]  more Katrina type events and then beta test how to give everybody bracelets how
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:13.980]  to put them in FEMA camps to get everybody used to seeing the cattle go
[2:02:13.980 --> 2:02:17.960]  into the chutes and come back out of the slaughterhouse kind of Judas go
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:22.880]  training and so don't look for big martial law to happen first look for it
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:28.480]  to a crisis to deepen and lead into it and then they just announced you've got
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:32.200]  to turn your guns in for food there's different schools of thought some say
[2:02:32.200 --> 2:02:36.200]  keep a few old guns so when they come to your house you give those away in
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:41.720]  Samamo then you've got two other waves of hidden firearms I tend to think that's
[2:02:41.720 --> 2:02:47.160]  a good plan but every case is different I've been told that prepare for martial
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:51.560]  law guy who I don't completely agree with this is the case says basically don't
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:56.440]  have guns or turn your guns in and then they'll move on and leave you alone the
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:02:59.640]  answer is of the military tries to go door-to-door confiscating American
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:05.440]  guns people have a constitutional right to to resist criminal activity and then
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:10.200]  if they're met as Alexander Sultanica said with resistance they'll back off
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:13.440]  real quick which they actually ran into in New Orleans and they did back off to
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.600]  a certain extent if they're met with people just handing them in then
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:22.000]  tyranny will win but here's the deal if one out of a hundred doesn't turn their
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:27.200]  guns in that's over a million combatants and so it doesn't matter I mean I guess
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:31.400]  the most chicken-necked thing to do in martial law would be to turn your guns
[2:03:31.400 --> 2:03:36.160]  in the problem is is that if they're doing martial law and they do have
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:41.760]  databases most people who are on it are people that own property that some of
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:45.920]  this has been declassified during martial law they probably pass me right up
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:49.040]  because they're just gonna shut down the media it won't matter they're gonna be
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:53.600]  grabbing mayors and bank owners and enemies from business it's about
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:58.240]  stealing assets okay and so all these people that have served the system
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:01.080]  they're the ones that are gonna be getting grabbed during a type you know
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:07.400]  red-blue list type situation and they do have that so my answer to you is if you
[2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:10.880]  see a truck forcibly grabbing people house-to-house and they come to your
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:14.280]  house you are going to a reeducation camp and they admit they've built them
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:18.080]  you've got to ask do you want foreign troops raping your wife and that's what
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:23.000]  they do foreign felons they've hired and you know I guess in land of the
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:26.520]  cowards on with the slaves some people are gonna want to go to a camp but
[2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:30.920]  letting them take you to a rape camp and that's what they are an Abu Ghraib
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:38.360]  will ensure their victory well thank you Alex I appreciate you giving us an
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:44.240]  answer on that and Marianne wants to say hi hi Alex thank you so much for
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:47.320]  answering our question you bet Marianne stay there stay there I'm gonna come

[2:04:57.680 --> 2:05:00.880]  make you work in the slave camp we'll be right back

[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:25.680]  Austin Texas Alex Jones Cameron in Australia were almost to you I had
[2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:30.000]  noticed in the call on it we had a foreign call but the old days I meant
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.640]  they were paying for it it's probably Skype or some internet phone but we're
[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:36.720]  gonna get to you Cameron finish it with Marianne and we're gonna talk to Mary
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:46.440]  Joe Cameron coyote Walker and others Marianne go ahead yeah you know I bought
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:51.200]  the guy's book how to survive martial law and I read it and it was quite
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:55.640]  frightening you know bury your food bury your guns and do all this and
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:09:00.280]  do all that and then every now and then I get an update from him and it's very
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:06.200]  very frightening and and we just wanted to know you know whether you know what
[2:09:06.200 --> 2:09:11.000]  to do about the guns and in the food and listen it's just very frightening let
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:17.520]  me be clear if there was a 10% chance that in the next five years you were
[2:09:17.520 --> 2:09:20.280]  gonna die in a car wreck you'd probably make preparations for that or try to stop
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:27.160]  it there is more than a 10% chance that martial law will be declared
[2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:31.440]  nationally North com to a certain extent has already declared it the shadow
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:35.960]  government is in control if we ever try to rebel physically to take over a
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:41.200]  capital instead of a revolution of ideas which they can't stop they can they
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:45.000]  can stop any any localized attempt to take over with neutron bombs they said
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:48.120]  that's what they're for the nuclear arsenals for the American people and
[2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:51.960]  really no one else other than third world countries they minister this is all
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:57.480]  stated but yes if we go into a heart martial law or some bio weapon release
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:00.800]  that they release are allowed to be released you're gonna need your guns
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:05.320]  to protect yourself from your neighbors rioters if you're not starving to death
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:09.800]  neighbors are gonna wonder why you're still there I'd say 90 plus percent of
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:13.120]  people don't have more than a week of food I mean after a week or two they
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:15.720]  just shut the food off shut the interstates office that which they've
[2:10:15.720 --> 2:10:18.840]  admitted they've geared up for and everybody will just show up at the
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:24.960]  local Superdome then they've only got a few thousand people per town or city
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:27.640]  let's say it's a town of a hundred thousand that you know you might have
[2:10:27.640 --> 2:10:31.640]  ten thousand holdouts then they'll send I mean look they're not hiring
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:36.960]  aggravated felons and foreigners for the military for nothing I mean then
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:40.080]  they're gonna send in some young guys with rocket launchers they'll burn down
[2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:43.640]  your block and you know if somebody's trying to burn your house down they are
[2:10:43.640 --> 2:10:47.960]  terrorist they're attacking you you have a right to duty to defend yourself
[2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:52.520]  because so to see that's all your personal decision people kind of not you
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:59.760]  but others seem to think that we somehow are on air telling you what to do or
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:03.560]  that somehow us covering this are you know that that that we're making the
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:09.600]  problem manifest no no the threat is there and so it's it's then up to you
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:12.160]  we don't know what's gonna happen in the future we don't know what the breaks
[2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:15.520]  are going to be we don't know how this is going to unfold we don't have crystal
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:19.440]  balls we just have history and we have the current elites own perspectives and
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:23.280]  their own battle plan and what they've said they're going to do and so they
[2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:26.120]  could really they could release a bio weapon they could stage a string of
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:30.640]  terror attacks they could crash the economy they could do anything and they
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:37.160]  certainly are organizing and moving us toward some flashpoint in the future and
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:40.640]  the elite is making every preparation for that so do we know what that's going
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:45.240]  to be no it could be one of those things I mentioned a cocktail of those it could
[2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:49.960]  be they could set off a super nuke it blows up three states and then say
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:54.320]  that an asteroid hit us and we've got to have emergency world reorganization
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:12:02.480]  because of it these are bold daring cunning evil people and so the sky's the
[2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:07.920]  limit with them only massive exposure of their criminality and fully discrediting
[2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:12.680]  them and exposing their larger eugenics agenda will be able to stop them now I'm
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:16.200]  not criticizing that sponsor it's a sponsor of the Genesis Network and I
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:21.600]  think they've had an add a while back on info wars.com you know I'm not saying
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:24.800]  that's a bad person but I didn't get calls about he says turn your guns in
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:29.800]  if that's the case I don't agree with it if he's saying bury your guns you know
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:33.800]  that's that that is smart I mean I've I've got very guns folks and they're not
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:38.280]  at my house I'll put it to you that way I got guns all over the place but I go
[2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:44.440]  ahead no that takes for clearing it up that that that's about all you know the
[2:12:44.440 --> 2:12:48.520]  guy is just the updates said you know in the next two weeks it was going to
[2:12:48.520 --> 2:12:54.360]  happen and and you know it just it makes this very parent makes me paranoid oh
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:59.840]  now he's saying it's going to happen in the next three weeks yeah or two weeks
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:04.480]  and then the next letter will say something else so you know it just
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:09.520]  we're just kind of paranoid no I hear I am again again I clarify the anything
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:15.800]  else I can answer for you that's it Alex thanks a lot we love your show and you
[2:13:15.800 --> 2:13:21.160]  know I hope your Supreme Court injury is better I hope your leg is better it's
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:27.160]  finally better the the the the weeping wound on my shin finally healed about a
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:33.880]  week ago thank you okay um since this got brought up I don't want to get in
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:43.160]  fights with sponsors here the problem is we refuse more than nine out of ten
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:49.000]  sponsors or we get one that sounds reasonable on some debt forgiveness
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:53.720]  thing the website looks legitimate it looks like real solutions and then we
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:59.320]  find out yeah but there's a second packet they send that's a scam I say nope
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:04.640]  not our sponsor and I say no to it and watch them go to somebody else and just
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:13.160]  shake my head or we find out you know that somebody's selling an herbal
[2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:16.480]  product for three four times what it really cost I will I will dump the
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:21.240]  sponsor or I will refuse a sponsor I mean we have some moral bearing most
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:28.480]  people have none they just hey if it's a sponsor I'll take it and this is a big
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:31.600]  issue for me because my employees will be paid a lot more I would have a lot
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:38.280]  more capital I wouldn't have had to do that money bomb if I took all the
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:44.080]  sponsors that came because there is a sucker born every minute and I've bad
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:48.640]  mouth sponsors here and you know even the network is taken the networks like
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:51.200]  well should we just close our doors and I'm like no just investigate
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:56.360]  that sponsor and they drop it and Ted's done that with a bunch I guess we need
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:00.680]  some type of code or something the problem is you know I'm working around
[2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:04.560]  the clock it's a small operation I'm trying to build up what we're doing and
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:11.480]  so everything takes investigation time but yes it is a mistake people get into
[2:15:11.480 --> 2:15:18.920]  saying martial law will happen next month we will attack Iran next month that's
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:26.240]  discrediting or we will have martial law in three weeks I was unaware of that
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:29.720]  amount saying that's the case and I'm not saying somebody's even disingenuous to
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:37.600]  be saying that I just think they're unwise if that indeed is the case if
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:45.360]  indeed they said that but hey it's a crazy world I mean who knows what's
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:51.120]  really true who knows what's really gonna happen I've gone on air twice and
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:54.000]  said there's about to be a big terror attack call the White House and stop it
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:16:03.160]  and I did it in the months before 9-11 and I did it in late 2006 Fox News
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:06.240]  covered it and others and then they didn't carry out the attack but I saw
[2:16:06.240 --> 2:16:09.960]  all the pre-programming all the preconditioning in the media for that to
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:18.400]  indeed happen and so I went on air and I put the warning out
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:26.040]  all right let's go to the calls here let's go to Joe and pencil value than
[2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:33.680]  Cameron Joe go ahead hey Alex how you doing good I had a question about there
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:42.960]  was a guy who did some a video about the way we we'd be England and you know the
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:47.360]  revolutionary war and they were mad about it and they want to pay back but
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:51.640]  anyway you remember a few years back when there was a shortage of vaccines and
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:56.120]  they said that we buy them from overseas over in England from because of the
[2:16:56.120 --> 2:17:01.680]  lawsuits yes what happened in the United States but I was just wondering
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:07.520]  do you do you think it's like they're putting those backs they're contaminating
[2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:12.360]  those vaccines because it's their way of getting back at us through that eugenics
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:19.560]  program well no they just don't a look you can forget some 230 year old war
[2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:24.320]  regardless well let me do you but you'll minute go ahead well it was a it was a
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:30.960]  one of your one of your guests was on there and I watched a video he did about
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:36.560]  it okay it was something that he did it I can't remember it all now but I was
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:40.960]  just wondering about the Britain's contaminating the vaccines because they're
[2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:44.880]  the ones that are really pulling the strings well I mean the British people
[2:17:44.880 --> 2:17:51.440]  are not pulling the strings the global elite the most powerful group and and
[2:17:51.440 --> 2:17:56.400]  the fathers of eugenics are based in London England and they had the largest
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:01.400]  world empire when it reportedly collapsed 80 years ago began collapsing 80
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:06.840]  years ago this and and so they they went underground they they learned how to
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:13.920]  create shadow governments and national security states full spectrum domination
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:20.880]  is what they call it and yes England is one of the biggest bases for vaccine
[2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:25.320]  manufacture in the world they also have big vaccine manufacturing facilities in
[2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:29.360]  Africa where they can control the media and keep things quiet and have a dumb
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:33.560]  down on an uneducated population they make a lot of vaccines in Mexico they
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:38.560]  make a lot of them in Canada they make a lot of them in Australia and instead of
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:42.080]  over analyzing it and saying well are the British trying to get us they give
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:45.800]  their own people the mercury shots they give their own people the cancer virus
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:49.480]  laden shots they give their own people the shots giving them diabetes and
[2:18:49.480 --> 2:18:57.240]  cancer okay and so it's it's an idea it's an elite that are doing it to
[2:18:57.240 --> 2:19:03.880]  everyone now they can get away with more hard kill not soft kill weapons against
[2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:07.800]  Latin Americans against Indians against Africans because they're so poor the
[2:19:07.800 --> 2:19:12.520]  media is so controlled that they give people you in funded shots that kill
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:16.760]  them on the spot in Africa and then that got a little too obvious people would
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:20.480]  flee into the jungle or flee into the fields when the U.M. would show up with
[2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:24.680]  the locals paid off to administer it and so they would give them more of a soft
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:29.320]  kill slow kill weapon but yes they're carrying out mass eugenics against all
[2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:35.280]  of us absolutely documented and admitted and that's the bottom line
[2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:39.160]  anything else sir yeah that woman that previously called I think there's a
[2:19:39.160 --> 2:19:43.720]  rumor going around that the economy is going to collapse September 30th yeah
[2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:48.640]  I've seen that and there's always a new one and it is historical that in
[2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:54.200]  September or October economies tend to have big collapses and I would say it's
[2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:58.040]  a probability I mean it's a good chance the way the economy is looking but it
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:02.720]  may not happen and so why hang our hat on it thank you lead from solder and
[2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:07.200]  copper pipes mercury from fish dental fillings vaccines arsenic in the water
[2:20:07.200 --> 2:20:11.880]  these heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid even trace
[2:20:11.880 --> 2:20:15.760]  amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health many health
[2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:19.040]  problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:22.920]  including memory loss high blood pressure depression mood swings speech
[2:20:22.920 --> 2:20:26.680]  disorders neuropathy autoimmune diseases chronic fatigue and more
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:30.600]  unfortunately traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these
[2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:34.840]  harmful and potentially deadly toxins that's why there's pure eclair from

[2:20:46.480 --> 2:20:50.600]  ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity so that
[2:20:50.600 --> 2:20:54.280]  heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body order

[2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:03.200]  three six three or go to ripple Creek dot com hello Ted Anderson listeners of
[2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:06.160]  the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the
[2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:10.240]  risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no
[2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:13.600]  surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[2:21:13.600 --> 2:21:17.160]  depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means
[2:21:17.160 --> 2:21:21.040]  only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:24.880]  deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to
[2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:29.000]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:32.560]  effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase
[2:21:32.560 --> 2:21:36.480]  liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal
[2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:40.480]  expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:44.440]  and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be
[2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:48.920]  calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:54.040]  been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:33.640]  engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have
[2:22:33.640 --> 2:22:38.360]  been detained and Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI

[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:37.040]  third-time caller yeah I think you have a plan about the whole unity thing and
[2:24:37.040 --> 2:24:41.400]  about getting over the whole petty petty childish games that people play
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:46.200]  because they want to be better than each other I might hold myself and a few
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:52.560]  others up as an example of unity worldwide I had a situation where I had a
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:56.320]  German friend and she wanted to have some end game and all of those things
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:01.880]  given to a father so I met a guy from Info Creek over the internet on Skype
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:08.400]  and and so what I thought I'd do today is try I've been working together with
[2:25:08.400 --> 2:25:13.080]  him he gave me a fast link to his thing I've since been sitting it on Bit
[2:25:13.080 --> 2:25:18.760]  Tyrant he has just released 9-11 chronicles part one truth rising
[2:25:18.760 --> 2:25:24.760]  German dub just just being released today so if you know anyone that's speaks
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:31.280]  German or you can now get it from Info Creek dot TV as and also Alex previously

[2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:53.800]  of radio broadcasts or podcasts of similar to an Alex Jones show but in
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:59.160]  German so if you could and this is a revolution that is that is taking place
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:04.000]  of people all over the world taking action getting involved and it's not
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:08.640]  going away and it really upsets the elite to have an intelligent movement
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:12.880]  against them instead of just some hired anarchist that's why they hire anarchist
[2:26:12.880 --> 2:26:16.560]  that doesn't mean all the anarchist but they do hire anarchist groups to go
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:20.680]  stir up trouble so they can then demonize real descent good to hear from you

[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:10.720]  okay quickly I was one of those I only woke up about two years ago
[2:38:10.720 --> 2:38:17.720]  and I was one of those who absolutely believed I was a news junkie I was listening to mainstream media
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:21.720]  I thought I knew everything I was the one that people at work would say
[2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:26.720]  what's going on and I tell them when I found out I got mad I got really angry
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:32.720]  and I did a ton of research which is why I had no problem believing you when I
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:39.720]  was sent your your radio station I listen online about six months ago by
[2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:45.720]  online buddy because I did so much research myself they came up with the
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:52.720]  same exact things that you talk about and over the wide spectrum of the New
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:59.720]  World Order criminal cabal that are trying to run us and so what I do is I
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:04.720]  listen carefully to the news and then I'm right in their face with with research
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:09.720]  that shows why they're wrong I want them to know that the American public is not
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:16.720]  dumbed down that we do know and Alex I so applaud you your group your wife she
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:21.720]  has got to be terrific to back you with all of this and your and your children
[2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:29.720]  I just I think what you do is awesome you keep me motivated your videos are just
[2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:34.720]  terrific I I've just finished watching truth rising again for the third time
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:42.720]  it's just it's awesome it is so good and it it gives me a whole different
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:49.720]  motivation of where to go from I'm to the point with a local station that they
[2:39:49.720 --> 2:39:53.720]  actually went out and looked when I told them they were we were being chemtrailed
[2:39:53.720 --> 2:40:00.720]  they finally believed me and I'm working with that right now hoping that that
[2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:07.720]  will lead into further seats I got a big kick out of your your teaching the new
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:14.720]  yesterday about vaccines I got a really big kick out of that he'll learn he'll
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:19.720]  do the research he'll learn he'll be around you and and just keep up the good
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:26.720]  work you're so you're so prayed for in this nation there's so many of us I do
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:31.720]  something every single day minimally not nearly what you guys are doing but I do
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:35.720]  something every single day and all I have to do is look at my grandson if I
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:40.720]  wonder why I should keep going well that's the answer you're awesome I
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:45.720]  appreciate your call Pat yeah one big problem is that people expect that
[2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:48.720]  they're going to save the world by themselves that they're going to fix
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:52.720]  everything by themselves and then well why should I get involved in because I
[2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:56.720]  can't save the whole world I can't get it all done myself I can't find that
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:00.720]  magic silver bullet underneath a toadstool you know that a leprechaun gave
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:04.720]  me I can't find that pot of gold that unicorn so I'm not going to get involved
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:12.720]  no it's everybody doing a little something now let's take a few more calls
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:15.720]  I want to get Aaron in here and go over just an overview of eugenics and just
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:20.720]  how serious the scientific dictatorship is and why it's in game is eugenics but
[2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:24.720]  right now let's go to Peggy in PA go ahead Peggy
[2:41:24.720 --> 2:41:32.720]  Hi Alex based on some research I've been doing I can see a pan national not pan
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:38.720]  national it goes across national lines a social movement of mostly younger
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:43.720]  people and maybe middle-aged people there are the people that show the what's
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:48.720]  called the devil sign you know with the two fingers pointed up you see it all you
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:53.720]  see politicians well with most people that means hey we're having a good time
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:58.720]  we're rebellious this is wild or it means you see longhorns but yes for those
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:04.720]  that know it means we're in league with Satan yeah well well since since
[2:42:04.720 --> 2:42:09.720]  Putin's advisor uses that I've seen a photo of him using it some country on
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:14.720]  western stars a few rock stars that kind of thing when they use it for that
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:18.720]  meaning you know people in other countries that wouldn't use the Texas
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:22.720]  well in Russia and Italy it means you're cursed by the devil well that's what
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:26.720]  it traditionally or or people if they think someone's cursing them they put
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:32.720]  that sign back up where that there seems to be a social movement with that as
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:37.720]  the record as the symbol of recognition not necessarily a secret society but
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:42.720]  they don't talk much about it what do they call themselves I can't do any
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:45.720]  further research on it I don't know about the social movement I mean there's
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:48.720]  there's there's there's rock and roll fans that do it and to them it's just
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:54.720]  cute and funny but it is about Satanism that's been admitted you've got
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:42:58.720]  other people that do it that just means they're having a good time well when
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:02.720]  it's used in Europe and so on and among some of them the higher elites it
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:06.720]  means that they're living for this world they don't believe in in God and but
[2:43:06.720 --> 2:43:10.720]  there only a certain kind of person because certain people wouldn't they
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:17.720]  don't do that and I I'm pretty aware of who you know who's interested in
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:21.720]  that sort of thing but they have to have a name they call themselves they
[2:43:21.720 --> 2:43:25.720]  always do I guess you could call it a secret society it's an unofficial
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:29.720]  secret society but you don't know the name of what they would call fellow
[2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:34.720]  travelers Luciferians Satanist what about the fellow travelers that's
[2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:40.720]  well I mean I don't know of a specific name to call people that are into
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:46.720]  rebellion for rebellion sake and into doing as they will but I mean I agree
[2:43:46.720 --> 2:43:50.720]  it's people saying we're worldly we're having a good time whether it's some
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:55.720]  satanic priest doing it believing he's doing an invocation for power or
[2:43:55.720 --> 2:43:59.720]  whether it's a topless chick at a rock concert on somebody's shoulders she's
[2:43:59.720 --> 2:44:03.720]  saying I'm rebellious I'm having a good time they it means the same thing
[2:44:03.720 --> 2:44:09.720]  the European elite including in Russian and other countries that use it I
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:13.720]  think they use it as a symbol that they are free now from religion they say
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:17.720]  okay well I think that I mean I agree with you and I appreciate your call
[2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:22.720]  I mean you're asking me questions it sounds like you know the answer but
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:27.720]  then there's also an obsession with this Ron Paul has really bad arthritis
[2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:31.720]  there's a couple shots of him waving at people where his middle fingers will
[2:44:31.720 --> 2:44:35.720]  kind of go down a bit people say oh my gosh that said he's doing the devil
[2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:42.720]  sign or I was in a music video with Joe Rogan my buddy Kevin Booth who I
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:47.720]  met Bill Hicks through before I was even on the air right before he died
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:52.720]  down at Access TV in 1994 right before he died people think I was friends with
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:57.720]  Bill Hicks I was not friends with Bill Hicks I met him a few times but he
[2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:02.720]  said hey I want you to dress up like George Bush and show how they're satanic
[2:45:02.720 --> 2:45:05.720]  so I dress up like George Bush and I sit there under the devil sign and people
[2:45:05.720 --> 2:45:11.720]  go we found a secret video of Alex doing devil worship no that DVD was sold
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:16.720]  in stores I put it on my websites where you found it I love how they we found
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:21.720]  something really secret here it's from his radio show we found something
[2:45:21.720 --> 2:45:28.720]  really secret here it's Alex Jones drawing 666 on his body no it's 666 on
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:36.720]  a mask of Bush saying that they're into the occult and bohemian grove but it
[2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:41.720]  doesn't matter again anything to go after us or anything to go after Ron Paul
[2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:46.720]  you judge a tree by its fruits ladies and gentlemen so if I'm wearing a
[2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:55.720]  George Bush senior devil mask doing the sign of Diablo that is to note that
[2:45:55.720 --> 2:46:02.720]  they are into that and do the sign of Diablo okay can also buy that comedy DVD
[2:46:02.720 --> 2:46:07.720]  that's still in stores it's called belly of the beast with Joe Rogan introduced
[2:46:07.720 --> 2:46:11.720]  by Alex Jones that's the secret video that people found somebody said to me
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:16.720]  the other day like answer for this secret satanic ritual in front of the
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:20.720]  capital me dressed up like George Bush so people also take it to a incredible
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:26.720]  extreme of ignorance but certainly there is a world satanic hierarchy in
[2:46:26.720 --> 2:46:30.720]  control that's why we expose it and again even if you're an atheist atheist
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:33.720]  say well why do you believe in God the point is the elite believe in it they
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:36.720]  believe in it whether you believe it or not we are you know from a view of
[2:46:36.720 --> 2:46:40.720]  anthropology are looking at this and saying why is the elite into the occult
[2:46:40.720 --> 2:46:50.720]  okay Randy and Michigan go ahead yeah I yeah I agree with you on the belly of
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:53.720]  the beast thing I actually saw that oh you saw the secret video I've been caught
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:56.720]  down belly of the beast belly of the beast belly of the beast belly of the
[2:46:56.720 --> 2:47:02.720]  beast belly of the beast yeah well that's like people editing me saying
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:07.720]  death death death death to America I was saying the mercenaries are dancing over
[2:47:07.720 --> 2:47:11.720]  our grave seeing the death of America well when they're done with it Alex Jones
[2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:16.720]  shocking behind the scenes chanting death to America go ahead those are people
[2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:21.720]  that jumped a conclusion they don't have a brain but um anyways I was not exactly
[2:47:21.720 --> 2:47:25.720]  we've had sent com people who we've tracked back who are admitted sent com
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:30.720]  put out videos where they say I'm a Muslim and people actually believe it
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:35.720]  and it looks ridiculous to you or I but it's designed for the dumb down right
[2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:39.720]  and exact and I was going to correct the listener that was on earlier he said
[2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:43.720]  it was the aspartame and that's it's called fennel alanine and fennel ketone
[2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:47.720]  urex and anyways that was just a something I noticed earlier but death death death
[2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:53.720]  death to America I'm sorry I was wondering about the videos that I saw on
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:56.720]  YouTube actually I think you were the first one to have it or they have your
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:01.720]  voice on it I'm not sure it's the one about the caskets and like 50,000 caskets
[2:48:01.720 --> 2:48:07.720]  you know on the camps and FEMA fenced an area that's more than 50,000 caskets
[2:48:07.720 --> 2:48:11.720]  it's hundreds of thousands yeah and FEMA admits they have crematoriums for
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:15.720]  mass disease outbreaks they have mass caskets it's it's all admitted
[2:48:15.720 --> 2:48:21.720]  everybody goes out to a site that's storing a bunch of them and freaks out
[2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:25.720]  and says are these caskets yeah they're plastic caskets
[2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:29.720]  man oh man and like yeah because I've seen a guy walking around there's one
[2:48:29.720 --> 2:48:33.720]  guy from Georgia and he's like you know this is FEMA or here's yeah people love
[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:37.720]  a mystery that gets millions of views and then mainline Rocky Mountain news
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:43.720]  about millions of plastic caskets and and and and mass incinerators for thousands
[2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:47.720]  of dead bodies a day in Denver it's kind of like oh it's no big deal
[2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:51.720]  that's what I was wondering are they willing to are they why would they put
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:54.720]  it in caskets if that's not efficient seems like they would do something like
[2:48:54.720 --> 2:49:00.720]  look man they those are officially called casket body bag holders
[2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:04.720]  okay so they put you in a body bag and they throw you in a plastic casket
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:08.720]  for transport burial or to burn you in the casket
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:12.720]  well that's frightening but thank you you your government loves you take
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:16.720]  vaccines drink plenty of city water with fluoride in it

[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:28.720]  what a hard subject we're on no I mean there's always all these mainstream articles
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:32.720]  and no one ever wants to talk about those it's always other things
[2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:36.720]  Mike and Jersey you're on the air
[2:49:36.720 --> 2:49:40.720]  hello hello sir are you there don't discount your
[2:49:40.720 --> 2:49:44.720]  distractors because it was a detractive that actually mentioned you to me and I
[2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:48.720]  just did a little investigating went on the internet saw the movies
[2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:52.720]  in my eyes and then I started buying the videos oh no no no in fact I almost don't want to
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:56.720]  let the secret out but but but morally I do the detractors think they're hurting us
[2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:00.720]  not actually it causes a little bit of an investigation there
[2:50:00.720 --> 2:50:04.720]  you know well stay there stay there I'm gonna come back after the break final segment with calls

[2:51:00.720 --> 2:51:04.720]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections

[2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:04.720]  where we talk about real issues of significance that actually affect you
[2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:08.720]  and your family sticks and stones actually only
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:12.720]  make my bones stronger
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:16.720]  that which does not kill you only makes you stronger as Nietzsche said
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:20.720]  I disagree with him on most things but I agree with him on that
[2:54:20.720 --> 2:54:24.720]  all right let's go back to
[2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:28.720]  Mike and Jersey Mike or I got into Josh I forget
[2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:32.720]  Mike go ahead
[2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:36.720]  I've basically been doing my own little one person crusade
[2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:40.720]  even though there's a lot of us writing my info wars dot com on the bill is one of the listeners
[2:54:40.720 --> 2:54:44.720]  it suggested passing out the videotapes up and down the neighborhood good
[2:54:44.720 --> 2:54:48.720]  watching that but one of the things that I'm really concerned about is with the eugenics
[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:52.720]  I remember many years ago when the AIDS crisis first hit
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:56.720]  I remember saying it was a government league induced thing and everybody oh you're crazy you're crazy
[2:54:56.720 --> 2:55:00.720]  crazy well I guess now with the Bayer and F-18 etc
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:04.720]  it's now proven that out back at the time though I did question
[2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:08.720]  how come there were so many couples one was positive one remained
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:12.720]  negative no one was ever able to answer that well that's because the virus is
[2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:16.720]  a cover for a whole class of eugenics race specific weapons and it's
[2:55:16.720 --> 2:55:20.720]  actually in the BBC and London Telegraph today that it's race specific
[2:55:20.720 --> 2:55:24.720]  we already knew this from studies but it's in the news that Nordics
[2:55:24.720 --> 2:55:28.720]  it's almost impossible for blonde-haired blue-eyed Nordics to get it
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:32.720]  I knew a lot of blonde-haired blue eyes that got it well I was about to add
[2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:36.720]  I was about to add but that they've looked at the blonde-haired blue eyes that can get it
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:40.720]  and they've always are part of an area and have Roman genetics
[2:55:40.720 --> 2:55:44.720]  and because even the smallest amount of African or Asian
[2:55:44.720 --> 2:55:48.720]  blood allows it allows the virus to then bind
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:52.720]  to the receptor site on the cell
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:56.720]  I mean I have the study right I mean it's just a new one but go ahead
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:00.720]  well the other thing too is like with eugenics and I tried sending you a message on MySpace
[2:56:00.720 --> 2:56:04.720]  the other thing that really concerns me is the whole idea of engaging
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:08.720]  I'm really fearful that down the road I know you're Christian and you know
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:12.720]  it's not part of your belief system and everything else to each his own that whole thing you know separation
[2:56:12.720 --> 2:56:16.720]  church well now the Pentagon did study a quote gay bomb
[2:56:16.720 --> 2:56:20.720]  to spray trips with chemicals to make them have uncontrolled gay sex
[2:56:20.720 --> 2:56:24.720]  yeah well I remember reading about that and I was like that's insane because now if they don't even want you in the military
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:28.720]  but what concerns me though is now if you've got eugenics you're going to utilize
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.720]  spear to get this into the mainstream by basically telling
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:36.720]  families well you know we could basically now go to the unborn fetus and make
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:40.720]  sure that we take out that you know that DNA gene so this way you know you don't
[2:56:40.720 --> 2:56:44.720]  have a gay child and most parents won't want a gay child let's face it
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:48.720]  no I agree and it's all made up they're already doing that what are you talking about
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:52.720]  they're already talking about going for intelligence and going for this and that but it's so complex
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:56.720]  you change one gene it changes the expression of thousands
[2:56:56.720 --> 2:57:00.720]  of other combinations in genes so in fact I was going to get
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:04.720]  to that later with the cloning of the beef we're eating the cloning of dogs that are
[2:57:04.720 --> 2:57:08.720]  now breeding and having puppies but here's the one in telegraph today
[2:57:08.720 --> 2:57:12.720]  Britain's may be more vulnerable to AIDS due to Roman invasion
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:16.720]  and then it goes into Romans who interbred with Africans
[2:57:16.720 --> 2:57:20.720]  and then if you read deeper into the studies which have been out for 20 years
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:24.720]  but this is a new one yet they have studies with blacks
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:28.720]  who are less promiscuous than whites in large study groups who get it so yes
[2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:32.720]  a northern European can get it but it's very very hard
[2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:36.720]  and the northern Europeans they're finding that do get it have
[2:57:36.720 --> 2:57:40.720]  African blood you understand about the Moors dominating Spain
[2:57:40.720 --> 2:57:44.720]  dominating parts of Sicily into southern
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:48.720]  Italy you're aware of that correct well listen anything else sir
[2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:52.720]  basically just keep on fighting it you've got my you've got your banners
[2:57:52.720 --> 2:57:56.720]  on the car and everything else so we're fighting the fight and slowly but surely the word is getting out there
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:00.720]  you're awesome god bless you appreciate the call and it goes into it researchers found that people
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:04.720]  who live in lands conquered by the Roman army have less protection against HIV than those
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:08.720]  in countries they never reached because they're not pure white

[2:59:42.720 --> 2:59:46.720]  for the rest of this fourth hour were going to be covering
[2:59:46.720 --> 2:59:50.720]  eugenics coming up in 30 minutes how the eugenicists are using the fake
[2:59:50.720 --> 2:59:54.720]  environmental movement to not deal with real environmental crises and problems that elite
[2:59:54.720 --> 2:59:59.880]  is actually generating, like out of control cross species, a genetic engineering, toxic
[2:59:59.880 --> 3:00:03.760]  waste dumping, things of that nature.
[3:00:03.760 --> 3:00:07.160]  But how they're bringing in this global carbon tax and how that fits in, so for about ten
[3:00:07.160 --> 3:00:12.280]  minutes, coming up in a half hour, Paul's going to pop in with some new developments
[3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:15.900]  on that front with record cold weather.
[3:00:15.900 --> 3:00:20.920]  But I wanted to, before we get into eugenics, at the start of this live hour of video at
[3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:27.760]  presidentplanet.tv, every day during the fourth hour we go live, I wanted to draw a
[3:00:27.760 --> 3:00:36.120]  picture for listeners out there, a very simple crude picture that describes effectively the
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:39.760]  false left-right paradigm.
[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:50.440]  Now, in an earlier hour, I was describing how the Republican Party props up the Democratic
[3:00:50.440 --> 3:00:55.120]  Party and the Democratic Party props up the Republican Party.
[3:00:55.120 --> 3:01:05.920]  If you had one of the political parties standing on its own, standing on its own, when the
[3:01:05.920 --> 3:01:08.400]  wind came along, it would just fall over.
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:13.400]  When pressure, revolutionary pressure from the population, not liking what's going on,
[3:01:13.400 --> 3:01:21.400]  or new groups wanting the power structure, which is the main source of revolution, most
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:27.120]  of it is driven by evil, just like the elite is driven by evil, very rare to have a altruistic
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:37.800]  revolution, by itself, a single party system will fall over, okay?
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:47.680]  If you take the two party systems and you lean them up against each other, this is basically
[3:01:47.680 --> 3:01:57.320]  the arch, their force going together, keeps them together and makes it become a very strong
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:07.280]  stable platform on which they can build their hierarchical new world order system, okay?
[3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:12.560]  So the current two party system has been dominated and bought up and controlled by the elite
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:14.960]  that sits atop it.
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:22.000]  Now the elite with the one party system would not be balanced on top of one party.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:33.400]  They would be subject to being toppled, being pushed over easily, but you put the two parties
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:41.080]  up against each other, they form a royal arch, and now it's very hard to separate those
[3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:46.560]  two because they're leaning up against each other.
[3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:47.560]  I'm running out of paper.
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:50.720]  Well, somebody bring me another piece of paper, and this is really simple, but I want to explain
[3:02:50.720 --> 3:02:51.720]  this to people.
[3:02:51.720 --> 3:02:55.920]  Here, I've got one right here, it's fine.
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:02:58.560]  Check it out, folks.
[3:02:58.560 --> 3:03:06.800]  Why do you see so many leftists like, who mean well, like Rage Against the Machine,
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:17.800]  Tomorello or the guy we had on yesterday, Henry Rollins, who are right on so many issues
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:19.600]  but then believe in leftist policies?
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:23.840]  We need a global carbon tax, but there's an elite funding that.
[3:03:23.840 --> 3:03:28.600]  No, no, no, the elite, the big corporations are against it because the media advertises
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:30.880]  that big corporations and oil companies are against it.
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:36.040]  Henry Rollins doesn't know, doesn't have the documents.
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:40.800]  It doesn't understand that actually that's part of a sophisticated game that, oh, the
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:45.520]  big corporations say publicly, we don't want this, it's bad while they actually fund it.
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:48.880]  They know that the public's awake to the fact that they're corrupt, so the public will
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:53.280]  be fooled and go and support the agenda.
[3:03:53.280 --> 3:04:01.200]  Just please don't throw me in the briar patch, it's the old briar rabbit situation.
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:03.840]  So that's basically what we're dealing with here.
[3:04:03.840 --> 3:04:10.480]  And so you've got both parties leaning into each other, supporting the other one.
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:14.560]  When we come back, I'll briefly finish this and I promise we're getting into eugenics.
[3:04:14.560 --> 3:04:18.960]  It's just that the Republicans' criticism of the Democrats props them up.
[3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:23.960]  The Democratic criticism of the Republicans props them up, it's a very simple equation.
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:30.440]  I'm going to skip this break for info wars listeners because, you know, I got Aaron
[3:04:30.440 --> 3:04:33.640]  and Aaron, he's been sitting there for 20 minutes while I took calls and went into other
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:34.640]  subjects.
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:38.800]  And yes, your calls are coming up too, but especially for the video viewers out there
[3:04:38.800 --> 3:04:42.440]  on PrisonPlanet.tv and all the members that ripped this and put it all over the web, we
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:45.040]  appreciate that.
[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:49.680]  Let's just get it live and in higher quality when we're very thankful to the PrisonPlanet.tv
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:50.680]  members.
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:55.040]  Let me go ahead and just explain this as simply as I can.
[3:04:55.040 --> 3:05:00.200]  Here's the political field and this is where the population resides.
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:10.680]  And then we supposedly, through the grassroots, come up into the political party, okay?
[3:05:10.680 --> 3:05:14.000]  And then they lean on each other as I was saying earlier and support each other.
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:19.040]  Whether they're standing alone, the pressure of revolution or of new power structures will
[3:05:19.040 --> 3:05:20.880]  easily topple it and blow it over.
[3:05:20.880 --> 3:05:26.080]  But leaning together, it's not going to fall down, okay?
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:31.120]  Now, I know that's simple, but let me give you an everyday example of this.
[3:05:31.120 --> 3:05:35.880]  As I said, the left sees all of these evil mainline Republicans who we know are liars
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:38.880]  and who the media even exposes as being liars.
[3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:40.480]  They see them lying about everything else.
[3:05:40.480 --> 3:05:45.400]  So if the Republicans come out and say, we're against a global carbon tax, well then by
[3:05:45.400 --> 3:05:48.160]  God I'm for a global carbon tax.
[3:05:48.160 --> 3:05:58.600]  And so that's how the two sides leaning up against each other give the other side support.
[3:05:58.600 --> 3:06:06.640]  And so Democrats over here, Republicans over here, Republicans attack Barack Obama.
[3:06:06.640 --> 3:06:10.120]  And then the Democrats attack John McCain.
[3:06:10.120 --> 3:06:13.640]  And then the population who's down here is trained to see John McCain as representing
[3:06:13.640 --> 3:06:18.560]  them personally as being their daddy of where their personal power comes from of their camp,
[3:06:18.560 --> 3:06:25.920]  their brand name, their brand of soda, their brand of automobile, Ford or Chevy.
[3:06:25.920 --> 3:06:29.400]  And so this is a controlled paradigm.
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:35.120]  And so we have Republicans attacking Democrats and that's the force against them.
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:38.160]  And you have Democrats attacking Republicans and that's the force against them.
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:46.000]  And really it's one unit supporting themselves and containing revolution so that the people
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:56.120]  who are down here never learn that there is a world outside of this controlled paradigm.
[3:06:56.120 --> 3:06:59.800]  We are locked within the left-right paradigm.
[3:06:59.800 --> 3:07:05.440]  And then it becomes this huge pageant, this huge distraction where we analyze every facet
[3:07:05.440 --> 3:07:11.000]  of the two political parties, never realizing they themselves are simply a front or puppets
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:13.200]  for a larger power structure.
[3:07:13.200 --> 3:07:16.680]  Now this is incredibly simple, but that's how this works.
[3:07:16.680 --> 3:07:22.640]  And then the two parties can limit the issues that are debated to this controlled paradigm.
[3:07:22.640 --> 3:07:30.560]  They can limit the scope of differences, which if you look at it, there's almost no difference
[3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:34.800]  between the two, instead of getting the people to look outside the box at the wider world.
[3:07:34.800 --> 3:07:36.040]  Okay, we're going back live.
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:37.040]  Here we go.
[3:07:37.040 --> 3:07:42.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:42.520 --> 3:07:47.160]  Okay, for the rest of the hour, Aaron Dykes is with us.
[3:07:47.160 --> 3:07:53.480]  We did a four-part series almost a year ago on Eugenics, the history of it, how it formed,
[3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:56.680]  how it started, up until the modern time.
[3:07:56.680 --> 3:08:01.400]  But I thought, why not drag Aaron back in today to just give a basic overview instead
[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:04.360]  of you meticulously going through all the facts, the diagrams, the documents.
[3:08:04.360 --> 3:08:05.480]  We'll cover some of those.
[3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:06.480]  They're covered in in-game.
[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:09.720]  There's a bibliography online for the film in-game.
[3:08:09.720 --> 3:08:13.040]  What is the in-game.com or in-game-the-movie.com?
[3:08:13.040 --> 3:08:17.960]  For folks out there, you can see a lot of this there on the side or get the DVD and see it.
[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:26.240]  But Aaron, I wanted to go over with you today, you know, just basically your view on Eugenics
[3:08:26.240 --> 3:08:30.800]  and the scientific dictatorship, because during a break, I was briefly talking about
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:32.920]  the scientific dictatorship in the first hour.
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:36.440]  I spent about 30 minutes on it, and you're like, I can't believe more hosts don't talk
[3:08:36.440 --> 3:08:37.600]  about the scientific dictatorship.
[3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:41.760]  I can't believe more people aren't aware of the scientific dictatorship, because it
[3:08:41.760 --> 3:08:44.480]  really is the key to everything understanding the elite.
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:49.000]  So, from now until the next segment, give people a basic historical rundown, what we're
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:53.720]  dealing with, the elitist mindset, how Eugenics tied in perfectly with the mindset that elites
[3:08:53.720 --> 3:08:59.880]  and royals already had of themselves being a different breed, like going back to Plato
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:06.320]  and David, engineering, breeding the population, break it down for us, just a basic overview
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:10.720]  today, because this really is what governs our entire planet, and it deserves more discussion.
[3:09:10.720 --> 3:09:16.680]  Well, Eugenics, by definition, was the whole movement to control human breeding, according
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:21.760]  to supposedly scientifically crafted elite minds, and it fits in perfectly well with
[3:09:21.760 --> 3:09:26.640]  the way world government and control of societies in the 20th century took place, too.
[3:09:26.640 --> 3:09:32.680]  It's all about engineered society, engineered populations, and the whole idea is that we,
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:37.600]  the general public, cannot see above the threshold to make proper decisions, so they have to
[3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:38.600]  be made for us.
[3:09:38.600 --> 3:09:42.040]  And again, we see that at every level of left, right, control paradigm.
[3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:46.640]  They're always trying to shorten the horizon, bring in the blinders, bring people into a
[3:09:46.640 --> 3:09:53.160]  very small, looking at the world through a straw, instead of, in a big panoramic view,
[3:09:53.160 --> 3:09:57.800]  bringing the data, limiting the terms, to where people stay in their parties, stay in
[3:09:57.800 --> 3:10:01.160]  their racial groups, stay in their regional groups, and then they can play us off against
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:03.160]  each other using basic psychology.
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:07.360]  Yeah, that's really interesting that you put it that way, actually, because from Edward
[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:12.960]  Bernays to Carol Quigley, all the way up to Ray Kurzweil on the modern day, and also
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:18.880]  Brzezinski in the 70s, they've all used the same basic metaphor of shrinking time and space
[3:10:18.880 --> 3:10:22.280]  throughout the 20th century, being the reason we have to have this world government.
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:23.280]  And that's what Orwell says.
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:27.160]  He says, we're going to destroy the language, shrink it down, limit its use to where you
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:30.000]  can't physically communicate with people.
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:34.960]  And due to planes, trains, automobiles, instant communication, we couldn't possibly escape,
[3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:36.560]  you know, world political control.
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:39.880]  We can't possibly escape total domination.
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:44.160]  And it's just disgusting, because everything they've engineered has turned out to be a
[3:10:44.160 --> 3:10:47.160]  fraud, a hoax, or just otherwise malignant.
[3:10:47.160 --> 3:10:52.240]  I mean, everything they've scientifically engineered has only brought us down, really.
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:57.520]  Well, maybe genius in a pure research sense, really hasn't helped human beings as a whole.
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:02.720]  Well, I mean, it's a religion of greediness and control and domination, taking control
[3:11:02.720 --> 3:11:04.160]  of the species.
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:09.440]  Which is fair enough to argue, maybe human nature, but let, you know, the whole eugenics
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:10.440]  is built on.
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:14.160]  Well, they also say it's human nature for us to be evil and greedy, so we're going
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:15.800]  to fully embrace it.
[3:11:15.800 --> 3:11:17.560]  And that's why we're so strong.
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:18.560]  You're weak.
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:19.560]  You have these moral conventions.
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:26.080]  But it's wrong for the basis, I mean, if that's human nature based on evolution, then human
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:29.480]  steering human evolution is never going to craft a better human.
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:33.000]  I mean, if they really wanted to improve the human race, it would be freedom.
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:34.600]  But that's not what they're doing.
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:38.480]  Because when you read into their deeper documents that they sell the lower eugenicists on making
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:42.040]  a better society, they really admit it's about dumbing down their competition.
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:44.320]  Yeah, certainly.
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:51.520]  And you could see that in the parable of Huxley's Brave New World, I mean, it's pretty straightforward.
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:52.520]  Continue.
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:59.400]  Yeah, I mean, going along with the engineered society, I think propaganda kind of parallels
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:02.440]  the eugenics thing as well.
[3:12:02.440 --> 3:12:07.160]  Edward Bernays talked about regimenting the public mind every bit as much as an army
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:08.920]  regiments their bodies.
[3:12:08.920 --> 3:12:10.160]  And that's the same thing they want to do.
[3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:13.280]  They want to regiment human breeding with eugenics.
[3:12:13.280 --> 3:12:14.720]  But it's all about society control.
[3:12:14.720 --> 3:12:19.560]  I mean, we had to look at this in the 20th century panorama overview.
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:21.000]  And that's why the elites are in control.
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:22.680]  They're into engineering things.
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:26.360]  They're into master planning and they're master planning your minds.
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:30.440]  And by you being taught to deny that, it's like a child, you know, denying that walking
[3:12:30.440 --> 3:12:32.180]  out in the street can get him killed.
[3:12:32.180 --> 3:12:37.000]  You deny your personal power and your destiny to be involved in the direction of the planetary
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  development.
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  Yeah, I agree.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:43.520]  Continue, you've got a lot of quotes and articles there.
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:48.160]  Well, one of the things I hadn't discovered at the time of the making of Endgame, which
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:51.920]  is when I got into reading all this stuff, I know a lot of our listeners have known about
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:58.200]  this for a long time, is what a great example, H. D. Wells is of both the quest for world
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:00.680]  government and eugenics.
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:05.120]  And he was, of course, a protege of the Darwin and Galton family.
[3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:11.040]  He was trained by them in England and then he went on to train several of their kids.
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:14.360]  And he was one of the most extreme eugenicists.
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:16.680]  Many people have said more so than Hitler.
[3:13:16.680 --> 3:13:19.960]  He wanted to wipe out all disease people.
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:25.280]  He was completely anti-Semitic in the sense that he wanted to wipe out the Jewish race.
[3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:27.680]  And I mean, the parallels go on from there.
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:34.360]  But he's just, in the name of crafting utopia, they, it's just detrimental to human needs.
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:35.360]  Let's be clear.
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:39.320]  The H. D. Wells is actually embraced by the Zionists and many others, because they admire
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:41.160]  the model of eugenics.
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:44.920]  They just think they are, all these groups think they are the God-man.
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:49.000]  They all think, you know, the black liberation folks think they're the God-man.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:50.560]  The Zionists think they're the God-man.
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:52.360]  The Nazis think they're the God-man.
[3:13:52.360 --> 3:13:53.360]  Continue.
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:58.880]  Yeah, but it's really this, it's just domination by elites at the end of the day.
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:03.120]  Just as in propaganda, we're controlled by an elite at the top.
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:08.920]  Now we're supposed to have science crafting us and steering human breeding.
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:10.680]  It's just disgusting.
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:13.120]  It's a separation of the species as they write about it.
[3:14:13.120 --> 3:14:17.120]  And they're also teaching us that we don't have free will, which we clearly do.
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:24.760]  And our, quote, higher mindset or spirit, whatever you want to call it, the higher attributes
[3:14:24.760 --> 3:14:27.920]  of man versus the more beastial and low.
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:33.240]  But they tell us every day and every, you know, everywhere, men's fidelity controlled by cheating
[3:14:33.240 --> 3:14:34.240]  genetics.
[3:14:34.240 --> 3:14:37.840]  Well, I mean, I mean, they claim gambling's genetic.
[3:14:37.840 --> 3:14:42.280]  No, it's somebody who gets into the risk-taking and who wasn't taught that was dangerous and
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:43.440]  who didn't stay away from it.
[3:14:43.440 --> 3:14:46.520]  So they tell parents, don't try to keep your kids away from gambling or don't tell them
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:49.400]  that cheating's wrong because it'll ruin your children's lives.
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:54.000]  No, just say it's okay and it's my genetics, so I'm going to do it.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:58.880]  Yeah, well, gambling, just like all the rest of this, is playing into a controlled paradigm,
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:03.000]  which is what I'm most offended by really, it's the manipulation, going into a situation
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:07.600]  thinking you have free will and equal shot when it's really rigged stakes.
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:08.600]  It's the odds are rigged.
[3:15:08.600 --> 3:15:14.000]  Oh, yeah, I'm going to get back to that, go ahead.
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:22.400]  Well, yeah, I think it's a controlled paradigm.
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:26.360]  We've got hundreds of articles there you printed off, I mean, just your overall view on this,
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:27.360]  what you've discovered.
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:31.760]  We were talking about scenes about how real this is, how this is, all the elite talks
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:32.760]  about continually.
[3:15:32.760 --> 3:15:36.040]  This is the real world and the general public isn't even aware of it.
[3:15:36.040 --> 3:15:41.640]  Well, I think in the larger scheme, eugenics came through Malthus and then later through
[3:15:41.640 --> 3:15:47.920]  the Darwin's and I think that was partially paralleled with the Industrial Revolution
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:54.880]  was placing the value of human labor, dehumanizing humans itself and I think the new revolutions
[3:15:54.880 --> 3:15:55.880]  are-
[3:15:55.880 --> 3:15:56.880]  And making humans a bad thing.
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:15:57.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:05.040]  I mean, debasing us down to just raw material so the elites morally could feel good about
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:06.040]  what they're doing.
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:07.040]  Yeah.
[3:16:07.040 --> 3:16:08.040]  I mean, these are competing ideologies.
[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:11.040]  Why did the Darwinists seek to discredit and destroy Christianity?
[3:16:11.040 --> 3:16:12.480]  I'm not weighing in on the debate.
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:16.960]  I'm saying why do they seek because they are overthrowing an existing religion.
[3:16:16.960 --> 3:16:20.840]  Why does Scientology seek to overthrow psychiatry?
[3:16:20.840 --> 3:16:25.320]  Because they are seeking to overthrow that religion and it is a religion, both of them
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:26.320]  are.
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:30.120]  So you always have the new in a revolutionary way trying to overthrow the old.
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:31.840]  Well, I think that's true.
[3:16:31.840 --> 3:16:36.920]  I think in terms of the human pyramid, just as the Industrial Revolution displaced human
[3:16:36.920 --> 3:16:41.480]  labor, Bertrand Russell talks about that and the impact of science on society.
[3:16:41.480 --> 3:16:45.480]  Today with the technological revolutions and the information revolutions, it's an even
[3:16:45.480 --> 3:16:47.560]  greater displacement of human value.
[3:16:47.560 --> 3:16:48.560]  And they say this over and over again.
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:53.560]  They say whereas before life was cheap and blood was cheap, now you're a liability.
[3:16:53.560 --> 3:16:54.720]  Now we want to get rid of you.
[3:16:54.720 --> 3:16:57.440]  They've been having this debate for 80 years.
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:02.480]  That's why the Kurzweil paradigm and his other contemporaries, it's this discussion
[3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:07.600]  of well, should we politely sort of maintain the human population or just wipe them out
[3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:08.600]  altogether?
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:11.800]  And by the way, these guys run the planet and then you try to tell the mind control
[3:17:11.800 --> 3:17:17.080]  public, they drool at you and laugh because that's scary, that there's this big technocratic
[3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:21.040]  technocracy putting cancer viruses in your vaccines and you're giggling and laughing
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:23.720]  as every cancer goes up thousands of percentage points.
[3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:26.360]  I mean, this isn't a game, folks, this isn't a joke.
[3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:27.960]  They're killing us right now.
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:31.600]  Well, they've invested in this program so there's no way they could pull out the elites
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:32.600]  themselves.
[3:17:32.600 --> 3:17:34.520]  The whole structure is built around it.
[3:17:34.520 --> 3:17:36.000]  Yeah, they're psychologically built.
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:39.600]  The British royalty got behind this 150 years ago and that's it.
[3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:46.120]  And they believe time and space are concentrating and that human genocide is basically inevitable.
[3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:47.120]  That's it.
[3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:49.320]  They believe everything's accelerating and if they don't cold bloodedly kill the majority
[3:17:49.320 --> 3:17:51.440]  of us, that we're going to destroy ourselves.
[3:17:51.440 --> 3:17:53.440]  Meanwhile, they hand out nukes to Pakistan.
[3:17:53.440 --> 3:17:57.520]  They hand out these, the mousepox design to kill every mammal on earth.
[3:17:57.520 --> 3:18:00.720]  They cross species, splice everything.
[3:18:00.720 --> 3:18:03.920]  They are, it's like they're devils.
[3:18:03.920 --> 3:18:07.680]  They're busy destroying everything and then they offer the solution as it's all being
[3:18:07.680 --> 3:18:08.680]  destroyed.
[3:18:08.680 --> 3:18:12.120]  Yeah, and in a geopolitical sense, it's a policy of tension.
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:13.120]  There's so many distractions.
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:14.120]  Well, they say that.
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:17.960]  They say somebody's going to destroy it, so we'll destroy things, so we're in control
[3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:18.960]  of the process.
[3:18:18.960 --> 3:18:19.960]  Go ahead.
[3:18:19.960 --> 3:18:22.960]  Yeah, it keeps us distracted from the real issues, too, because we think we're fighting
[3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:30.040]  AIDS, the isolated human epidemic, when it turns out that it's steered by science.
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:32.120]  All these, you know...
[3:18:32.120 --> 3:18:36.680]  And it's about institutionalizing AIDS and covering it up and beta testing a soft kill
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:39.120]  of AIDS when they're getting ready to release a much worse AIDS.
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:43.120]  I think it's also about how the system has to design new problems.
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:49.000]  Huxley talks about iatric diseases, diseases caused by doctors.
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:55.960]  We've cured, you know, a few diseases over the ages, but only by subjecting all of society
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:19:00.840]  to more diseases, and the more intervention they do, the more problems we have.
[3:19:00.840 --> 3:19:04.080]  And they're contagious, so they've got to build a social control grid in the name of
[3:19:04.080 --> 3:19:08.120]  stopping other communicable diseases from third-world populations, so then they can
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:13.960]  get us more hurted into compact systems, so they can release the more destructive, controlled
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:14.960]  weapons.
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:17.720]  Right, it's about being hurted into the compact system.
[3:19:17.720 --> 3:19:21.360]  Just like with politics, freedom is really a better solution, but they want to have us
[3:19:21.360 --> 3:19:22.360]  hurted together.
[3:19:22.360 --> 3:19:25.360]  All right, I'm going to skip this break for M4Wars.com audio stream listeners.
[3:19:25.360 --> 3:19:30.000]  They'll be the only ones that can hear it, but everybody else will be back in four minutes.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:36.120]  Yeah, I want to draw another picture of that for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, if you guys
[3:19:36.120 --> 3:19:41.960]  can punch that up for me.
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:45.800]  So there we go, okay, check this out.
[3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:52.000]  Now, earlier I explained how one political party is clearly the power structure, and
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:59.080]  the people can rebel against it and bring it down, destroy it, and replace it.
[3:19:59.080 --> 3:20:04.000]  Doesn't mean that necessarily what it's replaced with will be better, okay?
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:13.600]  But if they can control a nation, the true elite, by putting puppet governments or parliaments
[3:20:13.600 --> 3:20:18.480]  with different power structures in front where they've bought off and control the leaders
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:22.960]  of all the groups, or maybe three of the groups, then if this guy gets too powerful, they can
[3:20:22.960 --> 3:20:28.160]  have these groups gang up on this guy, okay, so that's another structure.
[3:20:28.160 --> 3:20:33.880]  I mean, I'm simplifying all of this, but earlier I was describing how a one-party system will
[3:20:33.880 --> 3:20:41.720]  fall over on its own, but if you have two parties leaning up against each other, the
[3:20:41.720 --> 3:20:48.760]  pressure of the two forces coming together will make it very, very sturdy and very, very
[3:20:48.760 --> 3:20:52.880]  strong and hard to bring down.
[3:20:52.880 --> 3:21:00.320]  So by controlling the two parties in the left-right system, then the people will put all of their
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:09.560]  energy into trying to affect the two columns that are joined and are operating under the
[3:21:09.560 --> 3:21:18.280]  control of the outside elite that is controlling the contained paradigm.
[3:21:18.280 --> 3:21:22.960]  All I'm saying is folks, you need to get out of this control paradigm, it doesn't mean
[3:21:22.960 --> 3:21:26.880]  listen to me, it doesn't mean believe me, it doesn't mean any of that, it means start
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:31.320]  looking outside the box, start pulling back, start connecting the dots, don't be too close
[3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:38.060]  to the problem, you're right here, you need to get over here, and you don't just need
[3:21:38.060 --> 3:21:42.320]  to be looking over here or looking over here or looking over here at what I said, look
[3:21:42.320 --> 3:21:48.240]  at whatever you want, look in all directions, walk off the page, you know, you can decide
[3:21:48.240 --> 3:22:01.400]  to be a little person, here I'll draw a little person, see, you can decide to be a little
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:11.400]  person and instead of, you know, being in this control paradigm, right here, you can
[3:22:11.400 --> 3:22:17.680]  just march off and you can go investigate or look at whatever you want, the point is
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:24.760]  there is no doubt and more and more Americans know with Congress with a 9% approval rating,
[3:22:24.760 --> 3:22:31.040]  that's 9%, people now know this is a fraud, they know it's bull, but you know, that's
[3:22:31.040 --> 3:22:34.160]  why the elite didn't care before, they give you two old white guys and act like they
[3:22:34.160 --> 3:22:38.960]  ran and let people fight over which old white guy was going to run things to make people
[3:22:38.960 --> 3:22:42.400]  think that, you know, the power ended with those presidents or prime ministers, well
[3:22:42.400 --> 3:22:45.080]  now they know that people are getting away from the process and they keep saying about
[3:22:45.080 --> 3:22:51.040]  Barack Obama and now about Sarah Palin, oh they're new, they're fresh, it's a woman,
[3:22:51.040 --> 3:22:55.680]  she's unexperienced, oh it's a black guy, he's unexperienced, but at least it's changed,
[3:22:55.680 --> 3:23:01.880]  you'll see what changed on the surface, they could be green skinned, purple skinned, they're
[3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:05.680]  puppets, they're not running anything so it doesn't matter and I know you know that,
[3:23:05.680 --> 3:23:12.480]  but the general public is not aware of this fully and all you see from the power structure
[3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:17.880]  is an attempt to suck people back into the false paradigm, back into the blinders, back
[3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:23.040]  into not looking outside the two parties where we can get real solutions, take over our local
[3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:27.520]  governments, have a revolution of understanding and stop trusting the corrupt people that
[3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:29.020]  are running our society.
[3:23:29.020 --> 3:23:31.520]  Let's go back to Eugenics, did you get any quotes, because I know you had a lot of quotes,
[3:23:31.520 --> 3:23:35.720]  I wanted to cover quotes, and I know I told you just a little bit before we went on air
[3:23:35.720 --> 3:23:36.720]  here.
[3:23:36.720 --> 3:23:38.440]  Yeah, I don't have a very good source of quotes in front of me.
[3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:42.320]  Well, people can refer back on the archives of the first four Eugenics pieces we did,
[3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:43.320]  here we go.
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:50.960]  You know, Aaron, I want to do a show in the next few weeks, I could pull these two, there's
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:55.600]  sides of thousands of them, but we sent off to the libraries into, where are all those
[3:23:55.600 --> 3:23:58.920]  big boxes of Eugenics books and documents we got?
[3:23:58.920 --> 3:23:59.920]  Most of it's in there.
[3:23:59.920 --> 3:24:00.920]  Why don't you go get that?
[3:24:00.920 --> 3:24:07.040]  I want to show people the research on TV, because, you know, we did off and on a year
[3:24:07.040 --> 3:24:10.960]  of research and we did all this other research before I had, but we went back and if we saw
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:14.480]  a Margaret Singer quote online about black people being weed, she wanted to kill all
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:20.840]  of them, you know, to the Colgate Foundation or whatever, we would go and send off to university
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:24.280]  and get Xerox copies of the official letter.
[3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:28.440]  And then we had so much evil that we didn't even put that in the film, in-game.
[3:24:28.440 --> 3:24:31.600]  I mean, you know, that's the level of this stuff.
[3:24:31.600 --> 3:24:38.040]  It's like yesterday I had one of my new IT guys in here, Paul Hartman, and he's like,
[3:24:38.040 --> 3:24:41.520]  yeah, my wife didn't believe me about the vaccines, and I said, well, you know, they're
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:48.600]  putting AIDS in over a million ampules of factor-rate blood product, and he just started
[3:24:48.600 --> 3:24:51.440]  shaking his head like, I said, oh, let's just go to, I just typed it in and pulled
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:53.400]  up in MSNBC and they admitted it.
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:24:56.320]  Here, let me see that, show Aaron right now, guys.
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:24:58.960]  Look at this, let me see that.
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:03.840]  Now this is just some of the research, ladies and gentlemen, look at this.
[3:25:03.840 --> 3:25:05.920]  This is just some of the Eugenics stuff.
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:08.480]  And this is letters about how they're going to kill us.
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:09.480]  Not that one.
[3:25:09.480 --> 3:25:12.280]  That's Final Cut Studio stuff, okay, all the others are.
[3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:18.640]  I mean, this is just, each one of these is completely population control, Eugenics,
[3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:20.640]  present, future.
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:23.240]  See that?
[3:25:23.240 --> 3:25:24.440]  And then it just goes through that.
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:25.440]  Well, this one maybe quotes.
[3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:26.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, quotes.
[3:25:26.440 --> 3:25:30.960]  Okay, you wanted Eugenics quotes?
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:34.680]  There is a giant folder on quotes.
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:36.600]  You want Margaret Sanger letters?
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:40.720]  Here, let's see what's in here.
[3:25:40.720 --> 3:25:46.160]  I mean, the amount of work that we went into on this film, how they're using the fake global
[3:25:46.160 --> 3:25:51.400]  warming movement Rothschild quotes about how they're going to control us.
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:55.320]  I mean, just, I mean, this type of research we do, and then you can't even, it's like
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:26:05.720]  you get the knowledge, and then you can't even cover it all, God, the amount of work
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:10.760]  we did on that film, it just blows me away, it's like 20 films.
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:14.800]  Transhumanism quotes about how they're going to kill all of us, and their own books, and
[3:26:14.800 --> 3:26:18.640]  how they only want us to have a one child policy, I mean, it's all right here.
[3:26:18.640 --> 3:26:22.000]  It just goes, Aaron, any comments on all this?
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  You know, we try to cover as much as we could, there's a lot of books and stuff you don't
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  see here, too, and even more stuff that we just read online and cross-referenced.
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  That's right, we had some ghostwriter author, and then he, we didn't finish the project,
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  he ran off with like 10 books, and we need to get him to give us our books back.
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  Yeah.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:41.280]  I don't know why he got paid for not doing the work, and then ran off with our books.
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:43.000]  This whole country's falling apart.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  Oh my God.
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  Anyways, keep going.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:53.960]  Well, I think it's key that Nazi Germany is the country that ran away with eugenics,
[3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:58.200]  and they're also the country that was most status, most centralized, and they're the
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:26:59.960]  ones who went too far with everything.
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:02.360]  Well, when the government gets it shot, what do they do?
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:07.680]  With foster children, 68% national average on more than one psychotropic drug.
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:10.760]  I mean, everywhere they have a controlled group, what do you get?
[3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:11.760]  You get hell on earth.
[3:27:11.760 --> 3:27:12.760]  Go ahead.
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:15.160]  Yeah, I mean, it's just eugenics is part of state control.
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:20.800]  I mean, the United States also centralized everything it did under FDR, and I've been
[3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:26.720]  perusing some various propaganda films, and just to reiterate the point, ad nauseam, you
[3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:32.000]  see how they controlled workers groups, how they controlled universities, how they controlled
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:37.360]  this particular sector of industry, this particular sector of industry, all behind the war effort,
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:45.000]  but it's still all, it's centralization and control, and it's Nazi Germany who instituted
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:48.880]  marriage licenses, an idea that came from the U.S. and England.
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:57.120]  It's Nazi Germany who wanted to approve breeding for the elite, and then liquidate the underclasses.
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:27:59.080]  You know what I just ran into here?
[3:27:59.080 --> 3:28:02.560]  And then the Nuremberg defense was they learned to solve from the U.S. and England.
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:05.880]  We just ran into the secret FEMA documents from the pastors, we never put that in the
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:10.880]  film, about the clergy response teams, just ran into that again.
[3:28:10.880 --> 3:28:11.880]  Go ahead.
[3:28:11.880 --> 3:28:13.960]  There's no way to cover it all.
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:14.960]  Keep going.
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:20.200]  Well, yeah, I mean, everything you saw in Nazi Germany, the concentration camps, concentration
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:24.960]  camps were invented by the British during the Boer War, which is just goes around.
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:25.960]  Well, that's a popular invention.
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:30.880]  They were actually used here in the war, you know, against the independent colonies.
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:32.040]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:33.040]  Andrew Jackson's family.
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:35.040]  Well, I guess nothing was invented really in history.
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:36.040]  Well, no, no, you're right.
[3:28:36.040 --> 3:28:40.080]  The official, when they were first called concentration camps was in the Boer War.
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:41.080]  Yeah.
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:46.440]  But yeah, I mean, overall, I think eugenics was a movement to steer the world into centralized
[3:28:46.440 --> 3:28:47.940]  control.
[3:28:47.940 --> 3:28:50.680]  And it's just concentration of breeding.
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:53.160]  I don't know what else to say about it.
[3:28:53.160 --> 3:28:56.600]  Stay with us when Paul Watson comes on up, because, you know, how are they going to
[3:28:56.600 --> 3:28:57.940]  sell us on eugenics?
[3:28:57.940 --> 3:28:59.040]  They can't call it eugenics.
[3:28:59.040 --> 3:29:00.760]  They can't call it Naziism.
[3:29:00.760 --> 3:29:02.160]  They can't call it communism.
[3:29:02.160 --> 3:29:06.840]  All their other isms that the bankers use to push this, this social engineering have
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:07.840]  been discredited.
[3:29:07.840 --> 3:29:14.720]  They have a new term, environmentalism, stay with us that we're going to skip this break.
[3:29:14.720 --> 3:29:18.920]  Aaron, keep, keep talking other points you want to cover while we get Paul Watson on.
[3:29:18.920 --> 3:29:22.700]  One point I wanted to cover on your drawing of the sea there, which is kind of a policy
[3:29:22.700 --> 3:29:23.700]  of tension.
[3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:28.400]  You have the pillar of the Republicans leaning against the pillar of dividing conquer.
[3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:33.360]  Yeah, basically just like a mirror, just bouncing back energy back and forth, dissipating energy
[3:29:33.360 --> 3:29:34.360]  from the masses.
[3:29:34.360 --> 3:29:36.120]  Well, it's kind of like, that's it.
[3:29:36.120 --> 3:29:37.120]  It's a curtain.
[3:29:37.120 --> 3:29:38.120]  It's them.
[3:29:38.120 --> 3:29:40.920]  You know, they have this little play going on, you know, where the two groups run out
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:42.720]  of the same people, dissipate all the energy.
[3:29:42.720 --> 3:29:43.720]  Yeah.
[3:29:43.720 --> 3:29:44.720]  Right, yeah.
[3:29:44.720 --> 3:29:48.400]  And it's a lot like what Huxley was talking about, about how you could control the masses
[3:29:48.400 --> 3:29:53.600]  militarily through terror and force, or you could control them with psychology.
[3:29:53.600 --> 3:29:59.720]  Well, this is just a simple ruse to eliminate, you know, 80, 90% of the energy from any debate
[3:29:59.720 --> 3:30:00.720]  about anything political.
[3:30:00.720 --> 3:30:05.080]  And speaking about energy, real physical energy, this is a way to restrict our energy, restrict
[3:30:05.080 --> 3:30:10.760]  our free market, let government bureaucrats take over every facet of society because energy,
[3:30:10.760 --> 3:30:13.600]  energy output is killing the earth.
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:14.600]  Humans are bad.
[3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:15.600]  Yep.
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:18.280]  That's an interesting parallel there.
[3:30:18.280 --> 3:30:22.920]  But before they put it into scientific nomenclature, it was the kings were descended from God, the
[3:30:22.920 --> 3:30:27.200]  peasants are short and dumb, not because they've been starving for 100 generations, but because
[3:30:27.200 --> 3:30:28.200]  they're scum.
[3:30:28.200 --> 3:30:29.200]  Yeah.
[3:30:29.200 --> 3:30:33.200]  And I think that's a part of the elite's drive is that they believe they're the ones
[3:30:33.200 --> 3:30:38.800]  with this knowledge, and just like the Prometheus myth where man takes fire from the gods, they're
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:43.720]  trying to replace the idea with gods with themselves, they're the new God.
[3:30:43.720 --> 3:30:47.000]  And they know there's a cycle, they say over and over again, they don't want us getting
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:48.000]  the fire.
[3:30:48.000 --> 3:30:50.600]  It's like they're the gods, they don't want us to get the fire of technology.
[3:30:50.600 --> 3:30:53.560]  So they're going to fluoride you, they're going to hit you with some mercury.
[3:30:53.560 --> 3:30:57.160]  Oh, you know, you stop taking the shots, we're going to put it in the air, we're going to
[3:30:57.160 --> 3:30:58.480]  put it in the food.
[3:30:58.480 --> 3:31:01.480]  Yeah, it's really frightening.
[3:31:01.480 --> 3:31:04.240]  And that's why they're in control, though, because they care about control, they care
[3:31:04.240 --> 3:31:05.240]  about domination.
[3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:08.680]  Well, that is why they have the curtains set up, the smoke and mirror system, because
[3:31:08.680 --> 3:31:13.000]  if we could just see their note of power back there, I mean, it's still tens of thousands,
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:15.240]  but it's nothing compared to the masses of humanity.
[3:31:15.240 --> 3:31:19.680]  I mean, we could definitely physically outmaneuver them, and we could outthink them.
[3:31:19.680 --> 3:31:21.960]  But they told us they don't exist.
[3:31:21.960 --> 3:31:25.200]  It's like they project a rock wall up and the people have been taught there was never
[3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:26.600]  an elite in history.
[3:31:26.600 --> 3:31:28.480]  There was never a corrupt force.
[3:31:28.480 --> 3:31:32.440]  We don't need to be involved in society, we don't need to stand up to poison in our food
[3:31:32.440 --> 3:31:36.560]  or bad stuff, everything's, but then we finally wake up to poison our food and they say, yeah,
[3:31:36.560 --> 3:31:39.640]  you're dying because of the environment, meanwhile, they're doing it by design.
[3:31:39.640 --> 3:31:42.080]  I mean, they are some slick bastards, man.
[3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:50.040]  Imagine having no morals, more no qualms, you know, totally ruthless and unlimited funds.
[3:31:50.040 --> 3:31:52.560]  But because it's so dastardly, we have a chance of beating them.
[3:31:52.560 --> 3:31:53.560]  What are you doing here?
[3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:55.560]  I wanted to get this folder on the very bottom.
[3:31:55.560 --> 3:32:00.680]  I'm going to bring Watson in, why don't you take these out and put them back on their
[3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:01.680]  nest or whatever that is.
[3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:06.480]  There's only a small amount of the stuff around here, ladies and gentlemen, documentation.
[3:32:06.480 --> 3:32:11.320]  But again, I mean, I've had liberals go, Margaret Sanger's bad, I thought she was loving, I've
[3:32:11.320 --> 3:32:17.080]  had black people, Margaret Sanger, I was taught she loved me.
[3:32:17.080 --> 3:32:24.920]  Oh, she wants you to have the right to quote, got any school you want, so you can get your
[3:32:24.920 --> 3:32:25.920]  deadly injections.
[3:32:25.920 --> 3:32:27.640]  And I'm not weighing in on segregation.
[3:32:27.640 --> 3:32:32.200]  The point is, these are some sick bastards, folks, and they believe in what they're doing.
[3:32:32.200 --> 3:32:33.200]  We have Paul Watson.
[3:32:33.200 --> 3:32:34.200]  He's all set and ready.
[3:32:34.200 --> 3:32:35.200]  Here we go.
[3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:44.720]  Okay, we're back live.
[3:32:44.720 --> 3:32:46.200]  Paul Watson joins us.
[3:32:46.200 --> 3:32:51.720]  He had a story today up on prisonplanet.com, global cooling, unprecedented ice storms
[3:32:51.720 --> 3:32:57.800]  in Kenyon, all the major governmental 10-year weather stations report record cold in the
[3:32:57.800 --> 3:33:02.320]  last 10 years, and if it continues, it's going to be one of the coldest decades coming up
[3:33:02.320 --> 3:33:03.320]  on record.
[3:33:03.320 --> 3:33:07.360]  The sun was the hottest it's ever been recorded in 200 plus years, with the most sunspots,
[3:33:07.360 --> 3:33:12.800]  and the spot's just an explosion on the sun shining out different types of radiation at
[3:33:12.800 --> 3:33:14.440]  the planet and out into space.
[3:33:14.440 --> 3:33:20.000]  Now there are no spots for the first time ever, no spots, meaning really cold weather
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:21.560]  is coming.
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:24.520]  And that will take a few years to get here, but boy, we're going to be freezing our butts
[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:25.520]  off.
[3:33:25.520 --> 3:33:26.520]  They've already shifted gears.
[3:33:26.520 --> 3:33:30.480]  The globalists, they're saying it's now global cooling, got a band carbon dioxide.
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:31.480]  That means tax you.
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:33.520]  We're not going to really ban it.
[3:33:33.520 --> 3:33:34.520]  License it.
[3:33:34.520 --> 3:33:38.840]  A license is an authorization to do something that would be illegal.
[3:33:38.840 --> 3:33:42.920]  And this is their eugenics control grid, and they state it's that, to keep your energy
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:48.080]  usage down, to control you, to regulate you, to make you a third world slave, so you have
[3:33:48.080 --> 3:33:51.960]  to be under government control and government healthcare for eugenics.
[3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:53.240]  You think it's free healthcare?
[3:33:53.240 --> 3:33:59.280]  No, it's a eugenics hospital complex that's going to have their way with you.
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:03.800]  They're also shutting down the farms and ranches under the animal ID, premises ID.
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:06.640]  They're going for broke, the social engineers, right now.
[3:34:06.640 --> 3:34:08.400]  Paul Watson, thanks for coming on with us.
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:10.440]  Good to be back, Kelly.
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:12.440]  Tell us what's going on with the weather.
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:19.440]  Well, what's going on with the weather is the fact that there has been no global warming
[3:34:19.440 --> 3:34:25.560]  since 1998, and now they admit that there will be no global warming over the next 10
[3:34:25.560 --> 3:34:26.560]  years.
[3:34:26.560 --> 3:34:33.920]  And the consequences and the rapid decrease of solar activity are beginning to be felt
[3:34:33.920 --> 3:34:35.560]  across the globe.
[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:41.680]  And again, we had the entire solar system for the last 25 years with probes and telescopes,
[3:34:41.680 --> 3:34:50.680]  liquid, hard frozen moons of Jupiter and Saturn are now liquid seas of methane and things
[3:34:50.680 --> 3:34:51.680]  like that.
[3:34:51.680 --> 3:34:52.680]  They're not H2O, unfortunately.
[3:34:52.680 --> 3:34:58.080]  But the point is, we have volcanoes going off on Mars, ice caps shrinking by a mile
[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:03.720]  a year on Mars, and what are the global warming people say?
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:07.360]  They just say, nope, Saturn and Jupiter are closer to the sun than Earth.
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:09.960]  They say, nope, there are no ice caps on Mars.
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:12.960]  Of course, there are, but they know the public are dumbed down.
[3:35:12.960 --> 3:35:19.920]  Well, the fact is, Alex, that according to all the polls, even though this global warming
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:28.000]  propaganda is going out at all levels on an infestant basis, people aren't buying it.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:34.640]  The polls show that people are at best apathetic to it all, and certainly in America, the majority
[3:35:34.640 --> 3:35:36.800]  just aren't buying it.
[3:35:36.800 --> 3:35:42.720]  So the global, the man-made global warming advocates are beginning to make more and more
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:49.560]  shrill and alarmist claims and then coming in with more wilder solutions.
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:52.560]  Now, no, no, no, let me explain how this works.
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:58.840]  I was explaining earlier how if you have one political party, it's easy to topple it.
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:00.280]  It can be pushed over.
[3:36:00.280 --> 3:36:06.400]  But if you have two big political parties or two supposedly different ideas leaned up
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:11.360]  against each other, that it gives the illusion of choice, they push together, and it makes
[3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:12.960]  them very hard to push over.
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:14.360]  Well, it's the same thing.
[3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:19.920]  You've got the European Union and you've got the U.S. in this false bipolar world.
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:22.520]  It's really controlled by the same banking elite.
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:25.080]  And they would say, look at the Americans, they're for torture.
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:27.320]  Look at the Americans, they're for secret arrest.
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:29.560]  Look at the Americans, they're for attacking innocent countries.
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:32.920]  They lie about WMDs and they're ignorant.
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:35.000]  They don't believe in global warming.
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:39.840]  And so because the Americans were wrong on all these other things by design, well, I'm
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:45.320]  not an ignorant American, I'll go ahead and support global warming, global tax.
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:48.120]  Those greedy Americans are too wasteful and pig-like.
[3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:49.120]  Well that is true.
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:50.960]  We're wasteful pig-like SUVs.
[3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:53.880]  Doesn't mean we aren't wasting and doing some things that are bad and consumerist.
[3:36:53.880 --> 3:36:57.960]  So there's that idea in Europe, they don't see that it's about attacks and control.
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:01.000]  And so because George Bush was against it, they got behind it.
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:04.320]  As soon as Europe got behind it, Bush came out for it.
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:09.000]  And then we saw Pat Robertson go out on TV and say it's of the Lord, global tax, Jesus
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:10.600]  says do it.
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:14.760]  So again, another example of how they play two sides off against each other that are
[3:37:14.760 --> 3:37:17.400]  really connected and run by the same group.
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:18.880]  Paul Watson, go ahead.
[3:37:18.880 --> 3:37:20.360]  Yeah, precisely.
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:26.080]  And then if you speak out against man-made global warming propaganda, then you call the
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:27.560]  tool of the oil companies.
[3:37:27.560 --> 3:37:32.560]  Well, go and take a look at who is actually promoting man-made global warming.
[3:37:32.560 --> 3:37:38.680]  And you will find that oil executives and people like British Petroleum's Peter Sutherland,
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:45.520]  the head there, are out meeting secretly and talking about pushing this false fear-mongering
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:46.520]  of global warming.
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:48.760]  And they're the ones doing it.
[3:37:48.760 --> 3:37:53.680]  And the end result is that the people on the left don't look into who's pushing it
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:38:00.600]  and they just think it's this neocon lie to say anything against it.
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:05.360]  But the dangerous thing now is that with the wilder claims, they're coming up with wilder
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:10.960]  solutions, which is what I wrote about on Monday, one of which is there was an article
[3:38:10.960 --> 3:38:18.040]  out of The Guardian called Geoengineering the Radical Ideas to Combat Climate Change.
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:22.080]  And now they're not just talking about this because they've been doing it and they've
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:23.080]  been doing it.
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:25.080]  They say, oh, we could spray the clouds.
[3:38:25.080 --> 3:38:28.480]  Turns out these little buggers have actually been trying to heat things up.
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:33.840]  Yeah, and they've been doing it at the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River National
[3:38:33.840 --> 3:38:40.680]  Laboratory in South Carolina, conducting tests of spraying sulfur dioxide into the upper
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:41.680]  atmosphere.
[3:38:41.680 --> 3:38:43.560]  We need a big report about, you know, chemtrails exposed.
[3:38:43.560 --> 3:38:45.320]  This has been out for six months.
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:46.760]  Paul still knows story.
[3:38:46.760 --> 3:38:50.280]  I wanted to tell story tomorrow if you can do it about how they are chemtrailing, how
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:53.480]  every major research institute in the world is involved.
[3:38:53.480 --> 3:38:59.360]  Yeah, and I mean, 20 years ago, we were all being told that the big environmental danger
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:06.600]  was something called acid rain, which was caused in part by factory and industrial emissions.
[3:39:06.600 --> 3:39:10.480]  And Alex, what's the main component of acid rain?
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:11.480]  Sulfur.
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:12.480]  Sulfur dioxide.
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:16.280]  And this is what they're saying they will go up and spray into the upper atmosphere.
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:20.960]  And aluminum oxide and barium, everything the chemtrail researchers told us, I'm not
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:28.320]  kidding, folks, thousands of U.S. universities, Canadian, British, every federal agency.
[3:39:28.320 --> 3:39:30.000]  And this is all declassified.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:33.280]  They call it high altitude aerial spraying, aerosol spraying.
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:34.960]  What's the name of the one program?
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:37.960]  You Google it and there's like millions of hits.
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:42.000]  And it's all, our planes will be up this weekend spraying, but that's secret.
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  Exactly.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:49.040]  And it's being pushed by people like Nobel Prize winner Paul Kruppsen, who proposed
[3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:55.400]  then bending jumbo jets up to dump huge quantities of sulfur particles into the far reaches of
[3:39:55.400 --> 3:39:57.840]  the stratosphere to cool down the atmosphere.
[3:39:57.840 --> 3:40:02.800]  And it turns out he did that in the late 80s, early 90s, and then he magically wins a Nobel
[3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:08.960]  Prize and then the spraying starts added to the fuel so the pilots don't know, all compartmentalized.
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:14.800]  And what are the health effects of exposure to sulfur dioxide?
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:21.720]  Fuel effects and behavioral changes, disturbance of blood circulation, heart damage, reproductive
[3:40:21.720 --> 3:40:26.800]  failure, damage to immune systems, and there's a list that goes on and on.
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:30.120]  All of their favorites, all of their faves.
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:31.120]  Very tasty.
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:35.920]  But it's for the earth, Paul.
[3:40:35.920 --> 3:40:36.920]  It's for the earth.
[3:40:36.920 --> 3:40:37.920]  It's saving us.
[3:40:37.920 --> 3:40:44.400]  It causes, quote, substantial damage to the natural environment according to the scientists.
[3:40:44.400 --> 3:40:49.280]  So they want to damage the environment to save the environment.
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:53.080]  And the new thing is cut down all the trees because they create CO2.
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:54.080]  Oh, yeah.
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:55.080]  Trees are evil.
[3:40:55.080 --> 3:41:03.960]  They want to cut down beautiful pristine old growth forest because as trees age, they
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:07.440]  start to take in less carbon dioxide and give it off.
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:13.280]  Now again, scientifically, they know from psychology, and they say this, they say outrageous
[3:41:13.280 --> 3:41:16.280]  things to just shock you into going fine.
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:20.480]  Yeah, I mean, that's why they come out with us and say, yes, we torture small children.
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:21.720]  It's the American way.
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:25.960]  That's meant to just shock the conscience till you finally just go, OK, fine.
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:34.920]  Right, which is now why the Prince Philip World Wildlife Fund is saying that CO2 not
[3:41:34.920 --> 3:41:42.400]  only causes global warming, but it also causes global cooling, which is why whatever happens
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:48.960]  with the weather and whether there's a earthquake or a hurricane or whatever what happens with
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:54.520]  the weather, it's all related to human caused emissions, so humans are the problem.
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:41:59.000]  And again, this goes back to 10,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago, which doctors saying
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:03.720]  give us control of society, give us the best huts, the best temples, the best food, the
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:07.680]  best women, or the goblin god will eat the sun.
[3:42:07.680 --> 3:42:11.080]  Well, the priests were just marking down when it was going to be an eclipse.
[3:42:11.080 --> 3:42:12.360]  They knew what it was.
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:13.800]  The general public didn't.
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:19.280]  And so now it's suddenly global cooling and they have at a bunch of stores in Austin.
[3:42:19.280 --> 3:42:24.640]  I was at a steakhouse in Denver and it's stunk because they have no flush toilets in the
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:25.640]  steakhouse.
[3:42:25.640 --> 3:42:30.560]  They had special parking spots for low emission cars.
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:35.640]  Again, Japan, England, the U.S. want to have stickers on the car that you have to have
[3:42:35.640 --> 3:42:38.840]  showing your carbon emission like yellow stars.
[3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:43.040]  I mean, this is social engineering, folks.
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:45.800]  Tell folks, in fact, I forgot to air it.
[3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:48.400]  Get that together about the Ben police.
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:51.560]  Mainstream news in England reporting it like it's good.
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:52.800]  Taddle on your neighbors.
[3:42:52.800 --> 3:42:53.800]  See what they're doing.
[3:42:53.800 --> 3:42:57.520]  But see, after they get you done spying over trash, then it's what is your neighbor's
[3:42:57.520 --> 3:42:58.520]  political views?
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:01.960]  They always start it with something innocuous on spying and then it moves on everything
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:02.960]  else.
[3:43:02.960 --> 3:43:05.120]  Do you have that clip from yesterday?
[3:43:05.120 --> 3:43:06.520]  John?
[3:43:06.520 --> 3:43:10.800]  John, are you there?
[3:43:10.800 --> 3:43:11.800]  John must.
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:12.800]  Okay.
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:13.800]  Do you have the clip from yesterday?
[3:43:13.800 --> 3:43:15.300]  I want to play the rainwater clip.
[3:43:15.300 --> 3:43:17.240]  I may go into overdrive today.
[3:43:17.240 --> 3:43:22.440]  Do you have the clip about the trash can secret police?
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:24.880]  Oh, the neighborhood watch.
[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:25.880]  Yeah.
[3:43:25.880 --> 3:43:26.880]  Pull it up.
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:27.880]  Tell me when you got it.
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:28.880]  Okay.
[3:43:28.880 --> 3:43:29.880]  Go ahead, Paul.
[3:43:29.880 --> 3:43:30.880]  Yeah.
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:36.520]  We were talking about geoengineering and these radical solutions to solve the problem which
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:38.640]  doesn't exist.
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:43.600]  Climate change has happened throughout the eons, whether it's heating or cooling, and
[3:43:43.600 --> 3:43:47.760]  humans have had very little to do with it in every case.
[3:43:47.760 --> 3:43:54.640]  But now, I wrote an article on Monday, which I had to read it very carefully to make sure
[3:43:54.640 --> 3:43:59.520]  that what I was reading was actually true and it was there in the article.
[3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:06.280]  But they're now proposing, and this is out of Stanford University, a guy called Professor
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:14.960]  Stephen Schneider at the cost of $100 billion a year to the taxpayer.
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:22.360]  They're proposing to send out a fleet of spaceships and literally park them between the earth
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:29.280]  and the sun to form a giant artificial cloud to block out the sun.
[3:44:29.280 --> 3:44:34.920]  And this is in the Guardian article that I referenced earlier, geoengineering the radical
[3:44:34.920 --> 3:44:40.760]  ideas to combat climate change, and the quote out of it is, scientists have suggested launching
[3:44:40.760 --> 3:44:45.000]  a constellation of free flying craft that would fit between the sun and the earth forming
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  a cylindrical cloud around half the earth diameter and 10 times longer.
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:56.960]  And this, they say, is to block out 2% of sunlight hitting the earth.
[3:44:56.960 --> 3:45:00.400]  But I thought they said the sun, Al Gore, said it had nothing to do with heating.
[3:45:00.400 --> 3:45:05.120]  Oh, yeah, yeah, they will say that the sun has little to do with climate change in the
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:06.840]  minute, but it's CO2 emissions.
[3:45:06.840 --> 3:45:12.520]  But all these programs of geoengineering are based around blocking out the sun.
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:14.480]  And it all goes back to them playing God.
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:15.480]  Go ahead.
[3:45:15.480 --> 3:45:19.920]  Yeah, so I guess that that giant blazing ball of light in the sky has got something to do
[3:45:19.920 --> 3:45:20.920]  with climate.
[3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:25.080]  Okay, let's play a few of these clips, I don't have time to play at all, but here's
[3:45:25.080 --> 3:45:27.200]  one clip about the tattletale squads.
[3:45:27.200 --> 3:45:28.960]  We now have these here in the US as well.
[3:45:28.960 --> 3:45:29.960]  Here it is.
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:30.960]  Are you naturally nosy?
[3:45:30.960 --> 3:45:35.340]  Do you consider yourself to be a snooper, someone who likes to know what's going on
[3:45:35.340 --> 3:45:36.840]  in their street?
[3:45:36.840 --> 3:45:40.000]  Then you're wanted, but not for a crime.
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:44.440]  To uncover those close by who are not as environmentally minded as authorities think
[3:45:44.440 --> 3:45:49.520]  they could be, adverts looking for so-called environment volunteers have been springing
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:51.120]  up around the country.
[3:45:51.120 --> 3:45:55.200]  The resident recruitment drive by councils is for those willing to report anyone who drops
[3:45:55.200 --> 3:46:00.400]  litter fails to recycle rubbish properly or allows their dogs to foul the streets.
[3:46:00.400 --> 3:46:04.920]  All right, and then you also have adverts in every major paper in England for kids to
[3:46:04.920 --> 3:46:08.280]  spy on their parents, fill out dossiers on them.
[3:46:08.280 --> 3:46:13.280]  You wear red and black uniforms, you're called climate cops, they're going to set that up
[3:46:13.280 --> 3:46:14.280]  here as well.
[3:46:14.280 --> 3:46:18.040]  They're building the whole Homeland Security apparatus, it's going to be shifted into every
[3:46:18.040 --> 3:46:21.240]  one of you will have a caseworker who visits you weekly.
[3:46:21.240 --> 3:46:22.240]  This has all been announced.
[3:46:22.240 --> 3:46:23.240]  This will happen.
[3:46:23.240 --> 3:46:26.760]  I mean, I'm sorry, you're not coming to my house, you dirty bastards.
[3:46:26.760 --> 3:46:27.760]  Stay out of my life.
[3:46:27.760 --> 3:46:31.840]  Every control freak, nobody who could ever do anything in their life could never make
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:32.840]  it.
[3:46:32.840 --> 3:46:36.520]  You know, controlling the arts and entertainment just like East Germany, I mean, it is just
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:37.520]  going to be hellish.
[3:46:37.520 --> 3:46:42.520]  Now, here's another clip out of Utah telling you you can't collect rainwater and then making
[3:46:42.520 --> 3:46:44.760]  it sound reasonable at the end of the newscast.
[3:46:44.760 --> 3:46:45.760]  Here it is.
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:48.160]  Who owns the rain?
[3:46:48.160 --> 3:46:49.640]  Turns out, not you.
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:51.320]  You're actually breaking the law.
[3:46:51.320 --> 3:46:55.280]  If you try to capture rain falling under your roof and poured on your flower bed.
[3:46:55.280 --> 3:46:59.360]  A prominent Utah car dealer found that out when he tried to do something good for the
[3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:00.360]  environment.
[3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:01.760]  Okay, stop right there.
[3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:05.080]  It's up on infallwars.com and presentpunna.com if you want to see it, but the bottom line
[3:47:05.080 --> 3:47:07.120]  is it's the same sales tactic.
[3:47:07.120 --> 3:47:09.120]  We're doing this for your own good.
[3:47:09.120 --> 3:47:10.640]  We're doing this for the earth.
[3:47:10.640 --> 3:47:15.720]  He was doing it for the environment, but it wasn't good enough and at the end he submitted
[3:47:15.720 --> 3:47:20.240]  to them and they just explained that the government owns you.
[3:47:20.240 --> 3:47:23.560]  That's why T-Boon Pickens is grabbing all those area for wind power.
[3:47:23.560 --> 3:47:28.140]  It's about the water under it and it's a big scam, but he tells you it's for the environment.
[3:47:28.140 --> 3:47:29.640]  You'll go for it.
[3:47:29.640 --> 3:47:30.640]  Paul Watson.
[3:47:30.640 --> 3:47:36.520]  Paul, yeah, now you've got a situation in Britain, which I talked about last time I
[3:47:36.520 --> 3:47:44.240]  was on about this where a guy allegedly, I'd stress allegedly because he claims he didn't
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:49.560]  but maybe he did, maybe he was, allegedly dropped an apple core when he was walking
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:57.400]  down the street and he was subsequently pursued by environmental snoops who then called the
[3:47:57.400 --> 3:47:58.400]  regular police.
[3:47:58.400 --> 3:48:02.760]  He was handcuffed, arrested and kept in a cell for about 12 hours.
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:06.520]  Yeah, this is total tyranny and if you say the word homosexual, you're arrested in England.
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:11.120]  BBC reported again, hardcore super tyranny in your face.
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:12.120]  Go ahead, Paul.
[3:48:12.120 --> 3:48:19.280]  And there was another case where a woman and a young child had bought a sausage roll from
[3:48:19.280 --> 3:48:26.360]  a food stand and the mother was feeding it to a daughter and a tiny piece of the pastry
[3:48:26.360 --> 3:48:31.080]  dropped on the floor and immediately pigeons swooped down and ate it up.
[3:48:31.080 --> 3:48:38.240]  But it was, this crime was spotted by an eagle-eyed environmental crimes unit official who came
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:45.440]  running across the street and demanded the authority to find this woman for dropping
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:47.880]  a tiny piece of pastry on the street.
[3:48:47.880 --> 3:48:48.880]  No, no, no.
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:52.720]  Yeah, they're creating a stausi force out of environmental wackos who don't care about
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:48:56.880]  cross-PCs, genetic engineering, GMO, you know, real crises.
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:00.000]  It's about maximum enforcement on the general public.
[3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:03.960]  You think it's bad with cops everywhere writing you tickets now, you know, 10 times what it
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:07.640]  was decades ago, it's going to get hundreds of times worse.
[3:49:07.640 --> 3:49:09.680]  Every control freak nobody in your face.
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:13.520]  We're going to talk behind the scenes in a minute, Paul, for the infowars.com audio streams
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:18.040]  before we end this segment and come back in a final segment with Aaron with some eugenics
[3:49:18.040 --> 3:49:20.320]  quotes that he didn't have in here earlier.
[3:49:20.320 --> 3:49:23.000]  I wanted to tell people about a coloblue.
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  They tell you you can't have the water.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:28.080]  They tell you that you can't collect rainwater.
[3:49:28.080 --> 3:49:33.400]  They tell you, you know what, it's totally legal and even if it was, then go to Hades
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:36.520]  to go to a coloblue.com, E-C-O-L-O blue.
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:40.800]  There's a big banner up on infowars.com, E-C-O-L-O blue.com, get seven and a half gallons a
[3:49:40.800 --> 3:49:45.560]  day out of the atmosphere, out of the air in your own home or out on your porch and it
[3:49:45.560 --> 3:49:50.400]  makes seven and a half gallons, no sodium fluoride, then forcefully medicating you with
[3:49:50.400 --> 3:49:52.960]  a chemical weapon, none of that.
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:50:05.080]  Give them a call, 866-585-4044-866-585-4044, E-C-O-L-O blue.com, 866-585-4044, E-C-O-L-O
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:06.200]  blue.
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:09.120]  You know what, I'll take rainwater out of the sky if I want.
[3:50:09.120 --> 3:50:12.320]  You know something, you better drill your wells now, even in Texas, they're trying to
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:17.240]  ban having your own well, it'll be grandfathered in, they're coming, the scum, there's no
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:21.840]  jobs left in America, there's only coppin' and forcer and bureaucratic jobs, they're
[3:50:21.840 --> 3:50:25.200]  going to go from three million cops to ten million, they've announced it, they're going
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:30.280]  to run your life, it's going to get bad folks, you think it's bad now, you ain't seen nothin'
[3:50:30.280 --> 3:50:31.280]  terrorist storm.
[3:50:31.280 --> 3:50:32.280]  Alright, let me go to Paul.
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:36.640]  Paul, you got three minutes, any other topics you want to cover?
[3:50:36.640 --> 3:50:43.920]  I was going to add to that the fact that if you get a cadre of people who pick on innocent
[3:50:43.920 --> 3:50:50.480]  people for supposed crimes and that only increases the real crime rate, there was a story today
[3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:57.640]  about a running street battle between Asian and black gangs in London and this wasn't
[3:50:57.640 --> 3:51:03.360]  some, you know, hellhole, it was a partial area of London and they had a running street
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:08.800]  battle for twenty minutes with no police showing up whatsoever, so you read stories
[3:51:08.800 --> 3:51:14.760]  about that and then you read stories about mothers getting harassed and fined for dropping
[3:51:14.760 --> 3:51:18.320]  a piece of pastry on the floor by these environmental crime squads.
[3:51:18.320 --> 3:51:23.960]  Well police files have been released one time with the Chicago police chief slipped up.
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:27.800]  When real stuff happens, the cops cower and protect themselves, but if it's beating up
[3:51:27.800 --> 3:51:31.000]  an old woman, they're going to be there on the spot because that's easy.
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:37.760]  See, the fat cattle, that's us, are to be bled and sucked off of, not, not the criminal
[3:51:37.760 --> 3:51:38.760]  element.
[3:51:38.760 --> 3:51:45.360]  That's right, and it's only going to increase when they, uh, devote more police time to
[3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:50.200]  more inane and stupid things that only target innocent people, such as, in this country
[3:51:50.200 --> 3:51:56.000]  at the moment, knife crime, there was a media scaremongering campaign about the increase
[3:51:56.000 --> 3:52:01.040]  in knife crime of people being stabbed, so what did the government do?
[3:52:01.040 --> 3:52:07.680]  They banned knives and now you get three years in jail simply for possessing a knife, you
[3:52:07.680 --> 3:52:09.880]  know, if you're not in your own house.
[3:52:09.880 --> 3:52:11.080]  What effect is that going to have?
[3:52:11.080 --> 3:52:15.600]  Well it means that anybody who wants to defend themselves against knife crime is not going
[3:52:15.600 --> 3:52:19.120]  to be able to carry a knife because criminals don't obey laws.
[3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:23.920]  And so your crime rate will totally explode and when they catch a citizen with a knife
[3:52:23.920 --> 3:52:27.240]  to defend themselves, they'll throw the book at you, but in England they've already been
[3:52:27.240 --> 3:52:31.760]  caught and secret numbers have come out on that, to leave illegal aliens alone, to let
[3:52:31.760 --> 3:52:36.240]  them break the law, when they stab somebody, they'll let them go in a few weeks because
[3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:41.240]  they're there to diminish you into submission, problem reaction solution.
[3:52:41.240 --> 3:52:43.600]  That's right.
[3:52:43.600 --> 3:52:46.200]  Paul, I want a big chem trail report.
[3:52:46.200 --> 3:52:50.280]  I mean we've got all this high altitude aerosol spraying, all these universities admit they're
[3:52:50.280 --> 3:52:54.120]  doing it, they admit they're manipulating it and it's exactly what all the chem trail researchers
[3:52:54.120 --> 3:52:59.040]  like Karnacom and others said, when they did test, it's not like we just guessed this
[3:52:59.040 --> 3:53:02.880]  and then it came true, we documented this.
[3:53:02.880 --> 3:53:06.760]  I think it'd be a big story, an important story with a headline like chem trail mystery
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:07.760]  solved.
[3:53:07.760 --> 3:53:11.640]  I think it'd be a supernova story, post a bunch of videos, I'd like to see that from
[3:53:11.640 --> 3:53:12.640]  you tomorrow Paul.
[3:53:12.640 --> 3:53:16.560]  Yeah, I actually did a similar one back in April.
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:20.440]  No, I know, I mean that's why I said do the story because you just mentioned it, but let's
[3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:22.080]  give it one where we really explain.
[3:53:22.080 --> 3:53:26.880]  You kind of, you know, just halfway covered it, I think another big report would be great.
[3:53:26.880 --> 3:53:28.680]  But Paul, thanks for spending time with us.
[3:53:28.680 --> 3:53:30.240]  All right, thanks Alex.
[3:53:30.240 --> 3:53:31.240]  You bet.
[3:53:31.240 --> 3:53:42.120]  Final segment, ladies and gentlemen, two sponsors I want to tell you about, one of them is info

[3:54:02.560 --> 3:54:06.400]  been buying food from for about seven, eight years, last more than 10 years in controlled

[3:54:23.840 --> 3:54:25.360]  I hope none of it happens.
[3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:29.400]  But if there's a 10% chance of it happening, which there definitely is, why not have high
[3:54:29.400 --> 3:54:33.760]  quality, storeable foods that are freeze dried and dehydrated, store in very small areas,
[3:54:33.760 --> 3:54:41.960]  1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com, giant banners at the top of infowars.com and prison
[3:54:41.960 --> 3:54:48.240]  planet.com, I really hope that you will take action on that.
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:55.160]  Also when you're on infowars.com, be sure and check out the banners to the great folks

[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:34.520]  Now, everything's overkill here and I told Aaron I wanted some of the quotes and so he
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:37.520]  went out and got them and now he has like 50 pages in his hands, we have about three
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:42.040]  minutes left here Aaron, so if you want to read a few globalist quotes about eugenics,
[3:55:42.040 --> 3:55:43.040]  go ahead.
[3:55:43.040 --> 3:55:48.320]  All right, I'll start with Margaret Sanger, the most merciful thing a family does to one
[3:55:48.320 --> 3:55:55.600]  of its infant members is to kill it, that is reprinted in Woman and the New Race, birth
[3:55:55.600 --> 3:56:01.560]  control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race, that's Margaret Sanger in Women, Morality
[3:56:01.560 --> 3:56:09.200]  and Birth Control, eugenics sterilization is an urgent need, we must prevent multiplication
[3:56:09.200 --> 3:56:16.200]  of this bad stock, Margaret Sanger, April 1933 birth control review, eugenics is the
[3:56:16.200 --> 3:56:21.640]  most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political and social problems,
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:27.040]  Margaret Sanger the eugenic value of birth control propaganda.
[3:56:27.040 --> 3:56:33.000]  The campaign for birth control is not merely a eugenic value, but is practically identical
[3:56:33.000 --> 3:56:37.760]  with the final aims of eugenics, Margaret Sanger the eugenic value of birth control
[3:56:37.760 --> 3:56:42.760]  propaganda.
[3:56:42.760 --> 3:56:47.440]  The marriage bet is the most degenerative influence in the social order, Margaret Sanger the
[3:56:47.440 --> 3:56:48.440]  woman rebel.
[3:56:48.440 --> 3:56:52.680]  Yeah, so you wonder why all these big Rockefeller funded people and she was, we're out, get
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:56:56.560]  rid of the family, get rid of this and that, it's not to empower women, it's to enslave
[3:56:56.560 --> 3:56:57.560]  you.
[3:56:57.560 --> 3:57:01.960]  And in all their internal documents which are now published, these are university documents,
[3:57:01.960 --> 3:57:04.320]  it's about getting us all to be slaves.
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:08.560]  This is so cold blooded, meanwhile you roll your sleeve up and trust what they shoot you
[3:57:08.560 --> 3:57:09.560]  full of?
[3:57:09.560 --> 3:57:10.560]  Go ahead.
[3:57:10.560 --> 3:57:15.440]  Give disjointed groups, people with bad genes in our population their choice of segregation
[3:57:15.440 --> 3:57:21.960]  or compulsory sterilization, April 1932 and here's a quote about Margaret Sanger as we
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:26.920]  celebrate the 100th birthday of Margaret Sanger, our outrageous and courageous leader will probably
[3:57:26.920 --> 3:57:31.480]  find a number of areas in which we may find more about Margaret Sanger than we thought
[3:57:31.480 --> 3:57:35.280]  we wanted to know, Fay Walton, past president of Planned Parenthood.
[3:57:35.280 --> 3:57:39.880]  Stop, stop, I know you've got hundreds of pages there, tomorrow, sometime, maybe at
[3:57:39.880 --> 3:57:43.920]  the first of the show, 20 minutes with you Aaron, to read more of these sickening eugenics
[3:57:43.920 --> 3:57:44.920]  quotes.
[3:57:44.920 --> 3:57:50.680]  Okay, again your liberal leaders want one thing, to kill you blacks and Hispanics.
[3:57:50.680 --> 3:57:55.240]  Your Republican leaders are there to neutralize whites, wake up to the new world order.
[3:57:55.240 --> 3:58:01.040]  I had a bunch of guests on, a ton of calls, I covered key info in the first hour, key
[3:58:01.040 --> 3:58:06.400]  information on the eugenics program in the first hour today, retransmission starts now,
[3:58:06.400 --> 3:58:21.200]  on place, infowars.com, audio streams, everybody else God bless you.
