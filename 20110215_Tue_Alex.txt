[00:40.440 --> 00:45.560]  and economist Webster Tarpley popped in to give us his take on the spreading
[00:45.560 --> 00:50.760]  unrest going on in the Middle East and North Africa via the globalist
[00:50.760 --> 00:56.840]  destabilization campaign and where this first scene in the first act of the
[00:56.840 --> 01:03.160]  globalist balkanization great game operation is going so he'll be popping
[01:03.160 --> 01:07.320]  in in the middle of the next hour we're also working on several other guests on
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.800]  this same subject because it is getting uglier and uglier by the minute now you
[01:12.800 --> 01:16.960]  notice that the federal government now admits that it basically did organize
[01:16.960 --> 01:23.600]  the protest throw out their ally their trustee servant their ancient minion 30
[01:23.600 --> 01:31.440]  year dictator 81 year old hazy mubarak but now he did flee to Israel and
[01:31.440 --> 01:39.040]  magically had the stroke he went to where he could be safe his friends Israel
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.240]  that was there criticizing the move to overthrow him meanwhile the Israeli
[01:44.240 --> 01:51.880]  lobbyists here in the US are literally in the cockpit running much of the
[01:51.880 --> 01:57.000]  Middle Eastern North African policy and running the Obama administration but
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  they were like Hosni come to us most sweetheart come home where you're safe
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.480]  come stay at the little resort here we have by the ocean where you like to come
[02:08.480 --> 02:13.480]  visit us we'll take good care of you oh and the British big supporters of him
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.680]  for all these decades they're looking at freezing his assets and the Swiss are
[02:17.680 --> 02:24.720]  moving to do it they report up to seven billion dollars and now mubarak tried to
[02:24.720 --> 02:28.960]  move it out of there into Saudi Arabia but he won't be doing much now that he's
[02:28.960 --> 02:36.280]  had that stroke it's it's it's all coincidental they're bringing freedom to
[02:36.280 --> 02:42.160]  Middle East right now oh yes just like the globalist put Saddam in put mubarak
[02:42.160 --> 02:50.520]  in and what four more dictators just in the region and now the globalist if they
[02:50.520 --> 02:55.000]  can't overthrow Iran which the evidence shows they don't control they're gonna
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  overthrow Saudi Arabia and Jordan and Yemen the list goes on and on and we're
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.440]  gonna be breaking all of that down after the break a protest spread to Saudi
[03:05.440 --> 03:12.480]  Arabia again and oh when they're done they're gonna put hardcore Muslim
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.520]  extremist in and then tell you you've got to give all your rights up to und
[03:17.520 --> 03:24.120]  homeland security or the scary Muslims are gonna get you I'm afraid the
[03:24.120 --> 03:30.560]  Republic must be gotten rid of because of the Muslim extremist and I'm afraid
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.280]  all of your property and pension funds will have to be taken or if they will
[03:35.280 --> 03:42.480]  get us so we're going to be going over all of that today but look at how the
[03:42.480 --> 03:48.520]  globalist treat their minions and that goes for the US military turns out 11
[03:48.520 --> 03:52.920]  years ago Bloomberg AP report they made a secret deal that at death you pay in
[03:52.920 --> 03:56.880]  when you're in the military to your death benefits and when you die your widow
[03:56.880 --> 04:02.600]  or widower they get zero the government made a deal to allow the insurance
[04:02.600 --> 04:08.160]  companies to keep your money and it's totally illegal but so what you're not
[04:08.160 --> 04:13.680]  with Al Qaeda are you if you protest the big banks that run the country might
[04:13.680 --> 04:19.840]  have to put the FBI on your tail I mean in America it's patriotic to go through
[04:19.840 --> 04:24.240]  the checkpoint to go in the naked body scanner to let the government tax you at
[04:24.240 --> 04:27.800]  a massive tax rate to have no bill of rights the Constitution and to have
[04:27.800 --> 04:32.280]  police with black uniforms and mask on everywhere and checkpoints and to take
[04:32.280 --> 04:38.400]  your force inoculations that's patriotism patriotism is the lack of
[04:38.400 --> 04:44.320]  freedom so all of you hail and salute and swear allegiance to tyranny and
[04:44.320 --> 04:53.560]  despotism and the end of America or you will be listed as Al Qaeda we're

[08:18.840 --> 08:25.320]  we're gonna be live here obviously or the next three hours and I am locked
[08:25.320 --> 08:32.240]  caught ready to go my friends we are gonna have some surprise guest here on
[08:32.240 --> 08:36.680]  the radio broadcast this week I'll just leave it at that that you will definitely
[08:36.680 --> 08:42.360]  see make the news around the country so keep us in your prayers to make sure
[08:42.360 --> 08:47.280]  that we don't overshoot our goals this week to really have a big effect in the
[08:47.280 --> 08:51.920]  fight against the New World Order I've got a lot of important little blurbs
[08:51.920 --> 08:58.520]  here in the news Paul Joseph Watson has got a report up at prisonplanet.com
[08:58.520 --> 09:05.240]  Mexican troops conduct vehicle search on US soil well years ago I had sheriff
[09:05.240 --> 09:09.320]  Sam or Mexican troops would come two miles three miles six miles over when
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.200]  they had caught say a dump truck full of drugs in one case and they would just
[09:13.200 --> 09:17.360]  set up a checkpoint stop the police take the drugs away and drive back over
[09:17.360 --> 09:21.760]  the border and the US military just sits there sucking their thumbs the US
[09:21.760 --> 09:25.080]  military is only allowed in drug interdiction to harass the American
[09:25.080 --> 09:29.520]  people deep inside the country in a violation of the Tenth Amendment not to
[09:29.520 --> 09:33.560]  control that border yet another military incursion by a foreign power as
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.320]  homeland security is concerned more about training Americans to spy on each
[09:37.320 --> 09:44.000]  other absolutely so we're going to be going over that also a very interesting
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.960]  report you can tell Ron Paul is gearing up to run the draft Ron Paul 2012
[09:49.960 --> 09:55.280]  campaigns that folks have launched are going very well Ron Paul quote I can
[09:55.280 --> 10:02.040]  beat warmongering Obama and obviously last week he won the coveted two years
[10:02.040 --> 10:07.520]  in a row CPAC straw poll that republicans in the past had always said was
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.560]  the most important straw poll and if you won that that put you in as the front
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.920]  runner like Ronald Reagan back in 1979 but now they say CPAC doesn't matter and
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.560]  Ron Paul is winning the majority of other Republican straw polls and in
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.960]  national scientific polls he's either number one or number two in all of them
[10:26.960 --> 10:34.960]  and a few polls Mitt Romney is ahead of him by a nose he's ahead of Palin he's
[10:34.960 --> 10:40.840]  ahead of Huckabee he is ahead of them all but the media is running this hoax of
[10:40.840 --> 10:45.600]  you can't vote for Ron Paul he can't win he can't you know you can't have
[10:45.600 --> 10:49.520]  liberty you can't have freedom it's impossible he cannot win he cannot win
[10:49.520 --> 10:55.280]  don't waste your vote and we've got Donald Trump running around saying that
[10:55.280 --> 11:00.360]  Ron Paul cannot win and sorry he cannot win they're really trying to play that
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.920]  Jedi mind trick on the public and basically say these aren't the droids
[11:04.920 --> 11:08.360]  you're looking for move along move along these aren't the droids we're
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.400]  looking for move along move along I mean this is literally a self-fulfilling
[11:13.400 --> 11:18.400]  prophecy of just telling you that Ron Paul can't win but it doesn't matter if
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.480]  he runs and they steal the election and engage in the normal chicanery it
[11:22.480 --> 11:26.960]  doesn't matter he will be in the debates he will be on television even more he
[11:26.960 --> 11:31.560]  will talk about the private fellow reserve the illegal wars CIA narcotics
[11:31.560 --> 11:34.720]  trafficking he talks about that routinely now has for decades but now on
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.920]  national TV he does he'll talk about the Patriot Act he'll talk about martial
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.080]  law you know I like Michelle Bachman on many fronts she fights the carbon taxes
[11:43.080 --> 11:50.720]  she's good pro-second amendment but she did vote for the Patriot Act and she is
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.560]  out there promoting it and it's just absolutely disgusting to see her do
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.800]  that that's another report up on info wars calm and prison planet calm now
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.840]  here's what I want to do I've been gone Sunday and obviously Monday working on a
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.560]  very important story and helping a friend out well until Sunday night when I got
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.000]  back actually got back in the early morning hours Monday evening I spent
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.280]  some time with my family yesterday but we we are back now and I want to just say
[12:20.280 --> 12:25.040]  great job to the crew while I was gone and I think that Paul Watson did a
[12:25.040 --> 12:29.600]  wonderful job sitting in for us from England and then Aaron did 30 minutes
[12:29.600 --> 12:37.320]  solo and I tuned in yesterday via my iPhone I was out at the Zilker Zephyr
[12:37.320 --> 12:43.760]  at Zilker Park we fed the ducks and played on the swings and you know walked
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.280]  around the riverbank and then rode the little train little kitty train out
[12:49.280 --> 12:55.200]  there and ran a lot of great patriots out there it's any bellwether of the
[12:55.200 --> 13:00.200]  effect we're having just how many people this show is reaching we pull up the
[13:00.200 --> 13:03.240]  trains already loading up with people that goes on the hour I said hey perfect
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.560]  timing let's ride the train first and as I went down the side of the train
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.840]  but after we bought our tickets to get on the back because it was almost full
[13:13.840 --> 13:19.200]  half the people shook my hand and wanted to take photos with me and talked
[13:19.200 --> 13:23.640]  about the New World Order and these were good-looking families with their
[13:23.640 --> 13:27.360]  children a lot of them look like professional people who you know took
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.560]  Valentine's Day off with their wives and children and I'd say half the people
[13:31.560 --> 13:35.600]  were stopping and shaking my hand that's the type of effect again it's not
[13:35.600 --> 13:41.120]  like oh look I'm a big radio star I'm a big internet star a lot of people know
[13:41.120 --> 13:46.440]  who I am I could care less about that except that it's a radar ping or it's a
[13:46.440 --> 13:51.960]  sonar ping of people know who I am they know what I look like and so if they
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.840]  agree with me they will reach out a lot of times and over the years it just gets
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.400]  more and more and more and more and more intense and I was out in California
[14:02.400 --> 14:09.520]  over the weekend and people on the street you name it you know again knew
[14:09.520 --> 14:14.960]  who I was it's just an example of the effect we're having because you aren't
[14:14.960 --> 14:18.240]  known some of you out there so when you're walking down a street in Dallas
[14:18.240 --> 14:24.840]  Texas or Los Angeles California or Toronto or London you think you're all
[14:24.840 --> 14:29.440]  alone knowing about the New World Order you think that that that those of us
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.240]  that know what's going on are the minority but you're not it's just that
[14:34.240 --> 14:37.720]  no one recognizes your face because you're a private person and so they're
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.400]  not reaching out to you because they don't know that's why I'm so into people
[14:42.400 --> 14:46.440]  who know about the New World Order who basically are saying don't tread on me
[14:46.440 --> 14:55.520]  I want liberty the answer to 1984 1776 that's why I'm so in to you wearing some
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.360]  type of Patriot t-shirt and the best is info wars calm and when you purchase the
[15:00.360 --> 15:03.920]  t-shirts it supports the broadcast and so symbiotic relationship but get a
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.120]  stencil get a white t-shirt spray paint info wars calm on the back of it or
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.000]  another way to meet light-minded people is wear a Ron Paul shirt I'm trying to
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.080]  think of the best most noticeable logos or signals it's your colors I mean it's
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.840]  like the military wears an American flag on the shoulder so people know they're
[15:21.840 --> 15:27.080]  with America or you know Ford has a Ford symbol on the front of the cars you
[15:27.080 --> 15:34.120]  know it's a Ford or Ferrari or Lamborghini you know that's so you
[15:34.120 --> 15:39.080]  understand what it is and if you start just maybe once a week when you're
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.680]  out in public wearing a Patriot type t-shirt you're gonna get compliments
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.400]  you're gonna have people reach out to you now they might not do it as much as
[15:47.400 --> 15:50.520]  they do because they feel like they know me they hear me on the radio they see
[15:50.520 --> 15:54.960]  me on the internet they see me on national television occasionally and so
[15:54.960 --> 15:58.720]  they feel comfortable reaching out to me because I'm a public figure they still
[15:58.720 --> 16:02.240]  may not reach out to you as much but I've talked to a lot of people when they
[16:02.240 --> 16:07.000]  wear a Patriot t-shirt that they just amazing things happen they get their
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.880]  lunchbox for them they meet their future wife or their future husband they you
[16:12.880 --> 16:16.720]  know we're jogging down the road and somebody stops us hey info wars dot com
[16:16.720 --> 16:20.760]  people have info wars dot com bumper stickers meet like minded people I don't
[16:20.760 --> 16:28.080]  care how you do it but letting people know where you stand also resonates and
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.120]  lets people not feel like they're alone and lets people get connected now I got
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.560]  a bunch of news to get to it's just that for me that is such a central issue
[16:38.560 --> 16:45.480]  that I can't go to Zilker Park without being mobbed by people it's just five
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.680]  years ago I went to Zilker Park there weren't many people there the train was
[16:49.680 --> 16:53.400]  full but the park was pretty much empty and I just had people constantly
[16:53.400 --> 17:00.400]  coming up to me and five years ago sure maybe one person might have come up to
[17:00.400 --> 17:11.440]  me I mean now it's just well it's very very very positive news very positive
[17:11.440 --> 17:19.440]  news very exciting news all right let me now just mention to you some of the
[17:19.440 --> 17:23.360]  news we're going to be covering and then I'm going to go ahead and open the
[17:23.360 --> 17:27.680]  phones up so that we do things a little bit different today I'll take calls in
[17:27.680 --> 17:31.480]  the next 40 minutes of this hour then starting in the next hour because I
[17:31.480 --> 17:34.920]  want to compose myself and really think about it and focus I'm going to break
[17:34.920 --> 17:38.520]  down the full spectrum of what's happening in the Middle East and now
[17:38.520 --> 17:43.240]  spreading even into central Asia we're going to get into the economy big
[17:43.240 --> 17:47.360]  developments there we're going to get into a lot of big political developments
[17:47.360 --> 17:52.640]  also the Mexican troops running checkpoints inside the United States
[17:52.640 --> 18:00.400]  again at prisonplanet.com they've also indicted Berlusoning which I'm not
[18:00.400 --> 18:04.280]  saying the guy's an angel looks like a mobster to me but Tarpley has said that
[18:04.280 --> 18:08.520]  he's actually kind of double crossing the globalist and has predicted a year
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.400]  ago before the 17 year old sex scandal even started raising it said with a
[18:13.400 --> 18:20.240]  17 year old model that they're going to try to destroy the 74 year old billionaire
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.640]  so you notice all the sudden things are happening fast you notice all the
[18:25.640 --> 18:31.960]  sudden oh Hossi Mubarak ran to Israel where where he'd be safe quote and oh
[18:31.960 --> 18:37.080]  you know they're saying he did have that stroke bye bye a day after he's
[18:37.080 --> 18:43.720]  deposed and gets to Israel where he's safe what a fool what a fool he should
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.920]  have hightailed it as fast as he could to Iran oh but see he was big enemies
[18:48.920 --> 18:54.320]  with Iran of course they probably wouldn't even attack him what an idiot
[18:54.320 --> 18:58.360]  what an absolute idiot and they're grabbing all those assets this is a
[18:58.360 --> 19:03.200]  guy who served them in pure evil for 30 years and you see how the globalist
[19:03.200 --> 19:09.360]  repay their dark servants this this ring-raith of Sauron Hossi Mubarak and
[19:09.360 --> 19:12.520]  they're now replacing him and admitting all the military still gonna run things
[19:12.520 --> 19:19.040]  this is your freedom because he was a rotten apple he he had he he'd been on
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.040]  the vine he'd been on the tree for 30 years got rotten and so they've now
[19:23.040 --> 19:27.360]  replaced him with a little green fresh apple and then go back to sleep now the
[19:27.360 --> 19:31.200]  torture will accelerate actually because he had bulked at attacking Iran being
[19:31.200 --> 19:36.520]  part of that coalition and so well he's now had a stroke and convenient and don't
[19:36.520 --> 19:40.040]  worry the good guys are in control they're taking your pension funds right

[23:58.480 --> 24:12.480]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
[24:12.480 --> 24:21.400]  sword and pistol by my side many a young maid lost her bobbles to my trade many
[24:21.400 --> 24:27.320]  a soldier many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
[24:27.320 --> 24:36.960]  okay let's go ahead let's talk to Michael in Florida then Ryan John Tim
[24:36.960 --> 24:44.760]  George and others Michael you're on the air hey Alex hey buddy I wanted to talk
[24:44.760 --> 24:49.600]  about accepting technology like we do in the society like the cell phones and
[24:49.600 --> 24:56.040]  stuff and how they had a trend like ten years ago a blaming movies video games
[24:56.040 --> 25:00.920]  and music for the violence in a society it's like they're always keep going in
[25:00.920 --> 25:07.120]  things but yet they okay television shows like that have like themes of
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.960]  racism and homosexuality like the Simpsons family guy at South Park well
[25:11.960 --> 25:16.240]  regardless of what you think of those issues you mentioned there's no doubt if
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.000]  you watch mainline TV it's anti-traditional family and it's there
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.120]  to basically train people who imitate what they see on television to follow
[25:25.120 --> 25:31.120]  things that will basically damage civilization and the globalists want
[25:31.120 --> 25:36.520]  people isolated and by themselves so that the state can basically use them
[25:36.520 --> 25:41.120]  and then absorb them so yes there's no doubt there's a destructive message on
[25:41.120 --> 25:47.000]  television I'd like to sue them for that because it seems like what they're
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.920]  doing is they don't want us to survive they don't want us to grow but it's very
[25:50.920 --> 25:55.920]  dangerous because if you start suing the globalist for messages in TV then they
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.320]  will allow that to happen but then set a precedent to ban all free speech the
[26:00.320 --> 26:06.480]  answer is don't watch it or analyze it and point it out to people and build our
[26:06.480 --> 26:10.040]  own alternative media that challenges their system and gives people an
[26:10.040 --> 26:13.240]  alternative and so that's happening so you got one group of people that are
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.240]  even more dumbed down more in the in the grip of the New World Order and then a
[26:17.240 --> 26:20.640]  huge group waking up getting more and more out of the grip of the New World
[26:20.640 --> 26:25.440]  Order right but it's important that we use things like music as an avenue
[26:25.440 --> 26:29.880]  because even for education of teaching children they teach them through music
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.080]  and everybody's wondering why is the music so brainwashing because it's
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.200]  stupid they use the kiss method keep it simple and stupid to you know make a
[26:40.200 --> 26:45.480]  bridge between ages of the young to the old to make these simple brainwashing
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.960]  messages easy to get listen I agree with you Michael and the media is getting
[26:50.960 --> 26:54.720]  more and more dumbed down and it's a feedback loop I appreciate your call
[26:54.720 --> 27:00.000]  it must have been six seven years ago I saw an excellent frontline piece on PBS
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.280]  about the feedback loop I forget the exact name of the show but it you know
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.440]  the argument by mainstream media has been we're dumbing it down because that's
[27:08.440 --> 27:13.480]  what people want but really it's what they feed in is then what they get back
[27:13.480 --> 27:17.800]  and then it does dumb people down and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and
[27:17.800 --> 27:23.320]  there is that agenda and people should be conscious and aware of that but with
[27:23.320 --> 27:29.920]  this radio show we can use pop examples or mainstream cultural examples and then
[27:29.920 --> 27:34.160]  bring that issue in so that when the general public's listening we can then
[27:34.160 --> 27:37.960]  illustrate things for them in a way that they understand you know it's a
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.720]  language they understand so we can talk about those dumbed down issues but then
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.840]  use it as a bridge into real issues Brian in Michigan you're on the air hi
[27:47.840 --> 27:53.360]  Alex the Donald Trump comment at CPAC really irritates me because you could
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.360]  also take it to mean another thing saying that they've already got the
[27:57.360 --> 28:02.000]  nomination fixed and they know it's not going to be Ron Paul and that's what
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  they mean by Ron Paul's got zero chance of winning well also Trump really may
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.080]  run now and he understands that he's going to try to take the place of Ron
[28:13.080 --> 28:17.400]  Paul as some outsider Maverick so he's really worried about Ron Paul the fact
[28:17.400 --> 28:21.720]  that he attacked Ron Paul and said he can't win shows that Ron Paul is now
[28:21.720 --> 28:26.360]  becoming the frontrunner he's he's neck to neck nose to nose you know coming
[28:26.360 --> 28:34.480]  around the final bend here going in you know to the election with his lined up
[28:34.480 --> 28:44.120]  right there with Mitt Romney okay but let's say I mean the the Republicans
[28:44.120 --> 28:49.280]  around Paul when straw poll after straw poll the last couple years or so so
[28:49.280 --> 28:56.040]  clearly a lot of Republican voters are supporting him if he doesn't if they
[28:56.040 --> 28:59.720]  if they steal it are the Republican voters still gonna vote for the
[28:59.720 --> 29:04.280]  Republican nominee because I don't subscribe to the lesser of two evils
[29:04.280 --> 29:14.040]  theory and just so they could you know defeat a very tutorial that's what I'm
[29:14.040 --> 29:16.960]  wondering so what are you saying are you saying you're not gonna vote for Ron
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.960]  Paul he runs as a Republican no what I'm saying is if Ron Paul doesn't win the
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.680]  nomination I'm gonna write his I'm gonna write a minute on the blank line as a
[29:26.680 --> 29:30.920]  right end well sure I mean look look if it's not Ron Paul every other major
[29:30.920 --> 29:36.040]  candidates a globalist that's the bottom line and so we you can just forget the
[29:36.040 --> 29:41.960]  presidential election if Ron Paul isn't involved in it but we win just by him
[29:41.960 --> 29:46.200]  being in those debates and putting real issues in look what happened three and a
[29:46.200 --> 29:53.200]  half years ago I mean how big that was we're on the March the empires on the
[29:53.200 --> 30:01.840]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[30:01.840 --> 30:05.840]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new

[30:22.240 --> 30:26.200]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[30:26.200 --> 30:30.600]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is

[33:47.440 --> 33:51.640]  mcbarack for that for a military who does don't seem like much of an improvement
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.560]  to me but do you think the military will give up control to a civilian
[33:55.560 --> 33:59.200]  leadership you think they'll crack down like it is a tenement square and sees
[33:59.200 --> 34:02.760]  control completely well the people that run our government when they have their
[34:02.760 --> 34:07.440]  druthers always put military hunters or dictatorships in and move are it just
[34:07.440 --> 34:11.280]  wasn't following orders he wasn't getting behind this is on record in the
[34:11.280 --> 34:17.880]  last year supporting an attack on Iran and so the globalist are getting their
[34:17.880 --> 34:23.120]  ducks in a row for that attack on Iran that's now back on the front burner and
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.840]  so of course I mean our so-called government run by the foreign banks
[34:27.840 --> 34:33.440]  basically trained the entire Egyptian military and so that's all that's
[34:33.440 --> 34:36.760]  happening here now is they've gotten rid of mubarak he went to Israel thinking he
[34:36.760 --> 34:41.960]  was safe he's magically had the stroke of course probably be dead soon and they're
[34:41.960 --> 34:44.960]  seizing his assets the globalists will just keep that for themselves and give a
[34:44.960 --> 34:49.440]  little bit back to the population or to the government of Egypt the money he
[34:49.440 --> 34:54.400]  stole from the people in those 30 years and it's just disgusting so it shows us
[34:54.400 --> 34:58.440]  what the globalists want they don't want freedom in that country I know they're
[34:58.440 --> 35:02.840]  like Friday night and Saturday I was watching the news and Anderson Cooper's
[35:02.840 --> 35:07.160]  like incredible democracy freedom this is what it looks like let's cut to Egypt
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.520]  and and now it's spreading around the rest of the Middle East and they don't
[35:12.520 --> 35:17.920]  want stable dictatorships that was the old phase now they want unstable
[35:17.920 --> 35:23.600]  situation so there's a pretext to not just continue but expand the military
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.760]  presence there that's bankrupting the American taxpayer you think but would you
[35:27.760 --> 35:30.680]  think that they will crack down that there's a chance to get cracked down
[35:30.680 --> 35:34.880]  like they did in China they've already been cracking down they're still
[35:34.880 --> 35:39.000]  cracking down they're still torturing they're still continuing everything I
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  mean it look the dictator got too big for his britches he did everything he was
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.040]  told but he said look I don't want to destabilize things no we don't need to
[35:47.040 --> 35:50.920]  attack Iran and they said okay well you're kicked out of the country run to
[35:50.920 --> 35:55.160]  Israel and he runs Israel has a stroke I mean it's just two plus two equals four
[35:55.160 --> 36:01.000]  and there it is what do you think John I don't know this I mean these
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.360]  revolutions are spreading but uh I mean they're going to lead to an attack on
[36:04.360 --> 36:08.600]  Iran and World War three or or it was going it was going here's the pot
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.040]  going to settle down in the and stay even I don't know well said we'll
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.520]  continue to break it down I've got all the details coming up next hour let's
[36:18.520 --> 36:23.280]  go ahead and talk to Tim in Michigan Tim you're on the air I'm in Washington
[36:23.280 --> 36:28.120]  actually okay yeah but um how was your week and Alex I appreciate your effort
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.040]  and I just had quick suggestion as far as like the V for victory campaign which
[36:32.040 --> 36:37.320]  I've attempted to do in Seattle maybe possibly a Bill of Rights Constitution
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.400]  or Declaration of Independence that we fill out and send into our congressmen
[36:41.400 --> 36:45.720]  our governors our mayors anything that voices the opinion of a population
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.680]  towards the people that we elect and employ not necessarily a hands-on like
[36:49.680 --> 36:54.120]  we vote every two years and that's it necessarily we give them an exact
[36:54.120 --> 36:57.840]  summary of why we think that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.320]  imperative for our existence as free humanity well I mean the globalists
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.160]  know why we have a Bill of Rights in Constitution and it's their enemy because
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.960]  it binds them from setting up the type of oppressive civilization they're
[37:10.960 --> 37:15.720]  designing but look the V campaign is whatever you want to make it and
[37:15.720 --> 37:19.800]  whatever ideas you've got turning loose the power of individual thought and
[37:19.800 --> 37:26.720]  action and separately we have the answer to 1984 is 1776 contest where people
[37:26.720 --> 37:34.400]  produce animations protest videos you the sky's the limit for whatever you can
[37:34.400 --> 37:37.880]  do and whatever we think is the most powerful I think the contest closes out
[37:37.880 --> 37:42.080]  in about a week or so then I'll go over all those videos and pick the first
[37:42.080 --> 37:47.840]  place second place and third place winner but we all win when we go out and
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.240]  hang up flyers when we go out and have demonstrations where it's not just it
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.880]  Washington DC and then the media ignores it but where you do it locally see
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.520]  instead of just focusing on the federal government we start focusing on our
[38:00.520 --> 38:05.680]  cities our counties our states and start building our Liberty muscles by going
[38:05.680 --> 38:10.520]  out and taking action and now we've had quite a few TV stations newspapers are
[38:10.520 --> 38:15.880]  starting to pick up on the V for victory campaign and then that creates kind of a
[38:15.880 --> 38:21.160]  amplifying effect and it really just illustrates the power of simple flyers
[38:21.160 --> 38:25.720]  being hung up so even if the globalist ever try to shut down the internet as we
[38:25.720 --> 38:30.440]  know it people now will understand they can post flyers in the dead of night with
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.040]  different messages and get a local buzz going because it's so uncommon to have
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.760]  people engaged in grassroots political operations outside of an election that
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.200]  it really grabs people's attention yes it does there are a few people as we're
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.320]  hanging them that we're interested but unfortunately the next day they were all
[38:49.320 --> 38:55.040]  down but what you do is maybe Liberty belongs to who wants it the worst Tim
[38:55.040 --> 39:01.560]  in Washington I believe you said and so what you do is you keep doing it you
[39:01.560 --> 39:06.080]  get more aggressive they're pulling them down if you if you put one up about a
[39:06.080 --> 39:11.840]  swap meet coming up or garage sale or a bake sale or a soccer game they'd be up
[39:11.840 --> 39:15.880]  there in a month it's because it is a message of Liberty somebody doesn't like
[39:15.880 --> 39:21.200]  it it shows you how effective you are I'm sorry go ahead well no I was just
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.280]  yeah just remarking that they would probably stand up or be on the board
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.960]  for for months or years depending on who's maintaining it yeah I was just
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.280]  thinking that maybe if we were able to summarize our thoughts and then mail it
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.880]  into the our elected leaders that it would have a more chilling effect to
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.280]  them to them to realize that there is a population out there that still wants to
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.200]  remain free does not want to become fascist and ultimately wants to live a
[39:47.200 --> 39:51.560]  life of freedom and I think that if we reminded the population if they had a
[39:51.560 --> 39:54.840]  chance to summarize their thoughts on the Constitution and what exactly it means
[39:54.840 --> 39:58.880]  that they would have a better understanding of what is in store for
[39:58.880 --> 40:04.000]  them if they don't well said again great points Tim let's talk to George in
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.040]  Connecticut George you're on the air hi Alex I was thinking that it might be
[40:10.040 --> 40:15.080]  another way of putting a goosing of these politicians that maybe have a
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.440]  survey on various issues especially for somebody like Michelle Bachman and
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.400]  something I'll list have all the people you know go on the internet and put in
[40:24.400 --> 40:29.880]  their top 10 or top 100 whatever they want to put in on why they shouldn't
[40:29.880 --> 40:35.160]  renew the Patriot Act why they shouldn't do various things that that are
[40:35.160 --> 40:42.640]  unconstitutional and so it should never be renewed again or possibly you know
[40:42.640 --> 40:48.200]  sending and then sending these surveys results to people like Michelle or Peter
[40:48.200 --> 40:54.320]  King the guy who wants to make it totally legal to think on your neighbor
[40:54.320 --> 41:02.240]  what do you think I don't know I mean elaborate on that well for example I
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.360]  mean if people call had a little survey on your on one of your web
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.200]  divisions and say look what are all the reasons why you wouldn't want want to
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.880]  have the Patriot Act renewed again for example hey you it makes it illegal to
[41:14.880 --> 41:22.160]  have gold and silver as as a currency if they take down the system that that it
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.840]  bridges every right that you have that you can be basically taken off the
[41:25.840 --> 41:34.200]  street and nobody could even ask I should enumerate the types of freedoms
[41:34.200 --> 41:39.560]  that it savagely attacks no no let us enumerate it for you and then you
[41:39.560 --> 41:43.680]  basically give whatever the survey was for example yeah you could enumerate it
[41:43.680 --> 41:47.240]  and give what do you think the top thing and then and have people add to it and
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.600]  then when it gets in faith five thousand people say that this is number one this
[41:51.600 --> 41:56.440]  is too much to why are we renewing the Patriot Act look look at how many look
[41:56.440 --> 42:01.680]  at the survey results you know it gives further power to whatever those
[42:01.680 --> 42:06.560]  particular reasons why why she would never want to renew this Patriot Act well
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.640]  we know the Patriot Act very unconstitutional and extremely unpopular
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.440]  good points thank you George let's talk to Adam in Tennessee Adam welcome hi
[42:16.440 --> 42:21.520]  Alex I just first off want to thank you a lot for sticking your neck out there
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.640]  every day and doing what you do and for backing everything up with verifiable
[42:27.640 --> 42:34.080]  stuff from the mainstream that really helps drive drive the point home and
[42:34.080 --> 42:40.280]  gets the people who would call you a kook or whatever looking at the new
[42:40.280 --> 42:44.920]  stations that they go home and turn on every night and look at anyway and and
[42:44.920 --> 42:49.240]  seeing that it's actually out there like that I just wanted to say a couple of
[42:49.240 --> 42:54.920]  things that the V for victory campaign it really should be stressed just like
[42:54.920 --> 43:00.520]  you said just a minute ago you hit the nail on the head that is so unusual for
[43:00.520 --> 43:08.360]  people to be involved at the grassroots level on just a day-to-day basis if
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.200]  there's not a campaign or something going on it really does get people's
[43:12.200 --> 43:17.920]  attention and I exactly people start thinking of political action is something
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.640]  that's only done seasonally and then it's only the candidates the media tells
[43:21.640 --> 43:26.560]  you about that you focus on political action is about being informed when
[43:26.560 --> 43:29.800]  you're on the jury the grand jury it's about being involved in the school board
[43:29.800 --> 43:33.440]  it's about being involved in the lawmaking at your city council it's
[43:33.440 --> 43:38.200]  about knowing your state legislators it's about talking to your neighbors it's
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.920]  about being on the soapbox I mean and you know when this country was free almost
[43:42.920 --> 43:45.720]  everybody went down to the county square if they had a problem and got on the
[43:45.720 --> 43:50.560]  soapbox and you know people went in and demanded their sheriff behave properly
[43:50.560 --> 43:54.400]  if he was violating rights and and and people were aggressive they
[43:54.400 --> 44:01.320]  jealously defended liberty knowing that it was the fount or the engine the
[44:01.320 --> 44:06.920]  progenitor of everything that was good and so it this is really a rediscovery
[44:06.920 --> 44:12.320]  of freedom as Thomas Jefferson said educate the people generally in the
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.320]  systems of liberty and freedom and tyranny will evaporate like phantoms
[44:18.320 --> 44:23.120]  at dawn and that's exactly what we're talking about like like mist on the
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.560]  ground you know out in the field the Sun comes up it burns off and we've got
[44:27.560 --> 44:32.480]  to put that light of sunshine of truth on things and it will dissipate Adam I
[44:32.480 --> 44:38.320]  I completely agree and I just have to say that it's really important you know
[44:38.320 --> 44:42.760]  don't people don't need to be chickens about it it's it's really important you
[44:42.760 --> 44:47.200]  call your senator you and your representative and whatnot and register
[44:47.200 --> 44:52.440]  your support or your disagreement with with a given thing tell them who you
[44:52.440 --> 44:56.080]  are tell them your name tell them you make sure they know your your their
[44:56.080 --> 44:59.360]  constituents you know don't be afraid to go out on the street and be seen
[44:59.360 --> 45:03.480]  hanging up the flyers I've had people say you know well police are gonna be
[45:03.480 --> 45:09.280]  after you over this well you know what that's the problem and that's that's
[45:09.280 --> 45:13.400]  the whole reason that I'm out there doing it you know not to get them after
[45:13.400 --> 45:18.280]  me but because they're after free speech and everything that we are supposed
[45:18.280 --> 45:22.920]  to stand for here well said appreciate the call a lot of great calls today
[45:22.920 --> 45:27.240]  Jesse in Pennsylvania you're on the air
[45:27.320 --> 45:32.720]  hello hey Jesse welcome how may I serve you welcome aboard oh hey Alex thanks
[45:32.720 --> 45:36.880]  for taking my call I just wanted to actually touch on the the propaganda
[45:36.880 --> 45:41.720]  issue that one of your previous callers I've seen commenting on I just want to
[45:41.720 --> 45:46.360]  say I see it every day in my everyday life I walk to the TV then I I can point
[45:46.360 --> 45:50.400]  it out as soon as I walk to the computer I mean a lot of people think that it's
[45:50.400 --> 45:55.640]  made to make you dumb down which it is very true but I think there's a lot
[45:55.640 --> 46:00.760]  more scientific agenda behind it from the people creating this you know the
[46:00.760 --> 46:04.680]  movies and such and I see it every day with people watching Jersey Shore I
[46:04.680 --> 46:07.600]  mean they don't understand what they're getting into just by watching it every
[46:07.600 --> 46:11.400]  day and getting obsessed with it and such and I just wanted to get your
[46:11.400 --> 46:16.840]  thoughts and comments on that and well I mean I mean people are sucked in to
[46:16.840 --> 46:22.960]  entertainment and hype and pablum and surface issues and that becomes what
[46:22.960 --> 46:28.880]  their experts on is Jersey Shore or the NFL and then they don't spend time with
[46:28.880 --> 46:31.880]  their children they're not informed about the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[46:31.880 --> 46:36.880]  they're not informed about history and so they don't recognize hardcore
[46:36.880 --> 46:42.000]  oppression and this iron curtain of tyranny that's descending on us but
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.960]  remember it's never a majority that defeats corruption it's always a highly
[46:46.960 --> 46:55.920]  informed highly motivated agitated minority and if it was 3% that started
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.440]  the Revolutionary War 5% roughly that won it against the greatest military in
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.760]  world history at that time who've never been defeated and who a few years later
[47:05.760 --> 47:11.480]  went on to defeat Napoleon of all people you know the British military then
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.160]  what can we what can we do now with the info war so we do get focused on trying
[47:17.160 --> 47:20.760]  to wake the zombies up and a lot of them are waking up or even if they wake up
[47:20.760 --> 47:24.520]  they're still so passive they're still just spectators they don't take action
[47:24.520 --> 47:29.640]  it it only takes a highly motivated minority to change history you know the
[47:29.640 --> 47:33.360]  globalist or a minority who were able to take over the banking system the
[47:33.360 --> 47:36.520]  issuance of currency and credit they believe they've got the power now to
[47:36.520 --> 47:39.920]  complete their world government and we're gonna see what happens but we're
[47:39.920 --> 47:43.840]  in a life-and-death situation I mean if the globalist win we have no future I
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.720]  appreciate your call let's talk to Chuck in Nevada Chuck you're on the year
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.960]  hello hey buddy go ahead hey Alex how are you good I am I wanted to comment on
[47:54.960 --> 48:02.520]  your earlier caller who was commenting on the idea of the far right and like a
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.120]  Donald Trump criticizing or coming out against or attacking Iran Paul I
[48:07.120 --> 48:12.280]  personally welcome it because for me I think enough people are awake now where
[48:12.280 --> 48:18.160]  that just energizes everybody when those people come out attacking them at this
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.960]  point well absolutely it shows that they're scared of him when they start
[48:23.960 --> 48:29.880]  saying he can't win he can't win I mean back in 2007 2008 in the election the
[48:29.880 --> 48:34.720]  media just said we're gonna ignore Ron Paul but he really stood out of the
[48:34.720 --> 48:37.960]  debates they tried to do these hoaxes where they would say oh he's been
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.320]  discredited and you know they'd freak out about the things he said but he kept
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.360]  winning all of the phone polls and other polls people kept saying they thought
[48:45.360 --> 48:51.360]  he was winning the debates he calls them on the fraud that the majority of
[48:51.360 --> 48:55.960]  conservatives want war and want tyranny why does he keep winning last year now
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.440]  this year in the coveted CPAC straw poll why is he now winning the scientific
[49:00.440 --> 49:05.480]  polls he didn't do that in 2007 2008 he won the just the general polls and so
[49:05.480 --> 49:09.880]  they're very scared of him I only wish he was you know 5-10 years younger but
[49:09.880 --> 49:14.600]  he's in good shape he's he's been a very pious person exercises every day
[49:14.600 --> 49:23.520]  hardly each he truly is dedicated he is founding father material and that's why
[49:23.520 --> 49:27.480]  people demonizing they demonizing from the mainstream media perspective they
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.000]  also have operatives and co-intel pro that demonizing from the grassroots
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.800]  level as Cass Sunstein the White House regulations are said the mainstream
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.800]  media is discredited so the establishment has to pose as alternative
[49:38.800 --> 49:43.240]  media to try to attack the rest of the alternative media to create dissension
[49:43.240 --> 49:48.760]  classic co-intel pro that's not working I'm gonna say it again Ron Paul only
[49:48.760 --> 49:55.480]  loses if he doesn't take the field you know I mean if he takes the field and
[49:55.480 --> 50:01.240]  is even defeated resistance is victory look how far he was able to lay all the
[50:01.240 --> 50:06.680]  real issues out three years ago in the campaign and then into the election but
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.360]  in the primaries he was able to lay out all the issues and then people kind of
[50:10.360 --> 50:13.400]  said what are these issues they never heard them before a lot of them we've
[50:13.400 --> 50:17.840]  gone from three or four years ago maybe five percent of the public knowing the
[50:17.840 --> 50:22.240]  Federal Reserve was private and that it's the real puppet you know master to
[50:22.240 --> 50:28.160]  now eighty eighty five percent or higher wanting to abolish it or audit it in
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.200]  Gallup polls that's why Brzezinski's freaked out and said for the first time
[50:32.200 --> 50:35.080]  the public actually know who the controllers are they're not just
[50:35.080 --> 50:39.680]  looking at the front man and so now he runs again he's gonna run I mean it's
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.280]  common sense he's smart I'll guarantee you Ron Paul is gonna run barring health
[50:43.280 --> 50:48.360]  problems and that is an issue they could do a hazy mubarak to it they could I
[50:48.360 --> 50:52.360]  don't want to get into different things they can do to him you can imagine and
[50:52.360 --> 50:56.080]  he said on this show he knows he's in danger so pray for Ron Paul a great
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.520]  point another great call more call straight ahead then I'm gonna break down

[54:19.000 --> 54:24.240]  situation of Middle East obviously protests spread to Saudi Arabia written
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.680]  looking into freezing assets of Haji Mubarak and associates former Egyptian
[54:28.680 --> 54:37.040]  leader as his residence in Israel falls into coma after final speech very very
[54:37.040 --> 54:40.560]  suspicious remember the our government said he's gonna step down today and he
[54:40.560 --> 54:44.760]  didn't step down and boom has a stroke three four days later it's just barely
[54:44.760 --> 54:52.440]  leaking out in the news that is all coming up and I really wasn't going to
[54:52.440 --> 55:00.480]  talk about it but Charlie Sheen did a radio interview obviously on the Dan
[55:00.480 --> 55:04.640]  Patrick show Monday I was actually with Charlie when he was talking on the phone
[55:04.640 --> 55:11.160]  to the producer of the show over the weekend I was going with Charlie to a
[55:11.160 --> 55:17.000]  gym to work out a private gym and you know when he set that interview up and
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.880]  he went ahead and did the interview and they asked who's at your house or who's
[55:20.880 --> 55:23.520]  been hanging out with you now that you're clean who's there helping you and
[55:23.520 --> 55:29.640]  he said oh Alex Jones enlisted a couple other people but Charlie is a good
[55:29.640 --> 55:33.080]  friend of mine and in the six years I've known him I've never seen him drink
[55:33.080 --> 55:37.400]  never seen him use drugs and he's a truthful guy he's honest about it he
[55:37.400 --> 55:42.440]  he's done none of them until about I don't know seven months ago got back into
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.920]  the wrong lifestyle started drinking and and doing other things and he's now
[55:47.920 --> 55:53.800]  completely clean and he is rehabbing I mean since he talked about it I'll
[55:53.800 --> 55:58.080]  just mention it that you know he it's also in the news that they're there
[55:58.080 --> 56:05.040]  doing urine test every day and he's completely clean and we need to pray
[56:05.040 --> 56:09.000]  for him that's why I said we need to pray for him because you know nobody's
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.240]  perfect everybody has problems and Charlie really is somebody that cares
[56:13.240 --> 56:18.960]  about liberty and freedom his dad does his brother does his brothers his mom and
[56:18.960 --> 56:24.360]  he's a good guy and I'm really pray that he could stay sober of course in his
[56:24.360 --> 56:28.320]  last interview with Patrick he joked around again I mean that's what Charlie's
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.600]  doing he's fighting this stuff with with humor and I've challenged Charlie
[56:33.600 --> 56:37.520]  because he's told me basically the whole story to set the record straight
[56:37.520 --> 56:43.640]  because I about 90% of what you hear is just completely made up just completely
[56:43.640 --> 56:53.840]  made up and I'm just gonna leave it at that until the future but we've got this
[56:53.840 --> 57:00.800]  clip of Dan Patrick show and it's made big national news obviously and the
[57:00.800 --> 57:03.800]  media if you listen to the interview you know clearly a lot of it Charlie's
[57:03.800 --> 57:07.640]  joking around he tries to have gallows humor about all that he's gone through
[57:07.640 --> 57:13.200]  but in the media spins that no matter what Charlie says or does the media
[57:13.200 --> 57:20.200]  tries to spin it but I don't judge people we were watching apocalypse now
[57:20.200 --> 57:26.000]  there in his home theater and we love that line in it where Marlon Brando
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  says to Charlie scenes dad he's playing the part of the special forces captain
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.480]  he says you have a right to kill me but you don't have a right to judge me and
[57:35.480 --> 57:39.920]  that's what it comes down to at the end of the day Charlie is such a big hearted
[57:39.920 --> 57:42.400]  guy everybody that knows him that he would give you the shirt off his back I
[57:42.400 --> 57:48.120]  mean you could say if you're his friend and he doesn't turn his back on his
[57:48.120 --> 57:52.520]  friends and so I'm not turning my back on Charlie but I appreciate all of you
[57:52.520 --> 57:58.200]  praying for him and he appreciates that as well you know he does know about your
[57:58.200 --> 58:06.360]  prayers and he's really fighting I mean he's really fighting and you know most
[58:06.360 --> 58:10.800]  people in his position would be in a bed and he's you know working out and
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.280]  lifting weights and swimming and and just trying to laugh and trying to huh
[58:15.280 --> 58:23.720]  fight through this two weeks two weeks no alcohol no drugs no nothing and he's
[58:23.720 --> 58:27.920]  getting food in him and gaining weight and it's exciting to see and we need to
[58:27.920 --> 58:31.160]  pray for him maybe he can get another eight nine years of being sober
[58:31.160 --> 58:35.880]  completely all right we'll be or as he says you don't like to work sober clean
[58:35.880 --> 58:40.200]  we'll be right back stay with us

[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.560]  what's on your mind thank you well I didn't want to change topic none sir that
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:13.520]  I'm a subscriber to the epoch times and I didn't notice there on the first page
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.080]  of yesterday I got something in front of me or reading again I wanted to bring
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:24.920]  up something that's quite interesting the apparently the US government is
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.520]  looking at a standard for what is being put up into space and to create a
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:36.800]  partnership with responsible nations you know back in 1958 Eisenhower signed the
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.600]  space act which according to them at that time they thought they were of
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:48.600]  course rushing to the moon was Russia but as epoch times goes on to tell us
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:54.400]  there's 22,000 man-made objects up there and 1100 of them are active
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:01.960]  satellites so now there's 60 nations up there that have a presence in space and
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.960]  this would be a monopoly for who could go off-world and I am familiar with those
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.600]  moves to try to restrict private corporations you name it from getting
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.840]  into space and kind of a world regulatory body to control that exactly
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:23.760]  exactly China I mean not to mention names there playing with anti satellite
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.160]  technologies with a military agenda using lenses the blind satellite well
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.840]  they've been they've been shooting their own satellites out of the air and
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.800]  turns out a few years ago the US threatened military action against
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:41.440]  when they continued it that's true that's just like that huge submarine thing
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.520]  that went down there that basically disabled the carnival cruise ship and
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.040]  they still haven't figured out what's wrong with that that's what our inside
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:56.920]  sources say EMP yes you know I worked for the power company for quite a while
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:02.600]  20 years and when I left due to bad surgeries that took place on my neck
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:09.680]  they were working on anti EMP devices for the power grid so there's quite a
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.560]  bit going on out there and I love your show Alex don't want to take up much
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:20.640]  time so I listen to you and enjoy your topics and all that is being done well
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:26.280]  sir I appreciate you I mean I think you just summed it up there we got subs
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:33.880]  launching Polaris knockoffs off our coast we've got all this open air
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:38.600]  genetic engineering going on that's very dangerous we've got all this jockeying
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.360]  towards war in the Middle East we've got the dollar globally being devalued the
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.920]  IMF and World Bank openly announcing they do want to move away from the dollar
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:56.640]  France came out yesterday and said that they want to move away from the dollar
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:04.600]  along with China and the general public wants to go on like business as usual
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:10.320]  people want to play along with the fact that the economy is okay but all the real
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.200]  economic indicator show it's going into the trash can and my wife talks about
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.200]  something she's never experienced the last year and I see it you'll be at
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.240]  Target or the grocery store you don't even have that much stuff and they'll
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.680]  comment on what you're buying and people online like who you're buying that
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.520]  who I mean you can really see people are running out of money and you when they

[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.160]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.920]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.880]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.240]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:22.680]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:27.440]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.040]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.600]  recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.120]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.520]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.240]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:07.560]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:26.480]  your mind let me just go over an important smattering of news got Webster
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.200]  CarPlay to break down the latest developments in the Middle East and the
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.120]  unrest spreading by design and what that portends for all of us but here's an
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:41.320]  article by Kurt Nemo G20 pushes global SDR and China's role on Monday
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:48.440]  French economic minister Christine Lagarde of pronouncing that right said
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.720]  her country will work to realize a planned transition to a global financial
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.080]  system based on several international currencies including the euro and the
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:05.920]  Chinese Yuan and the minister went on and said the G20 would want to undermine
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.840]  sovereignty of nations by moving away from national reserves into SDRs just
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.400]  totally made up fiat currency by the private banking houses or special
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.960]  drawing rights issued by the International Monetary Fund the G20's
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:24.320]  mid-February meeting in Paris will concentrate on quote reform of the
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.320]  international monetary system so they always built the Ponzi schemes and then
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.560]  pop them and then when things get depressed they come in with a new Ponzi
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.240]  scheme that they control and buy everything up with the new fiat system
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:44.240]  and she continues continuing demand for the US dollar as the world's de facto
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.200]  reserve currency consequently still widening trade imbalances and ongoing
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:56.800]  worry over how long the dollar can reign is excessively high value relative to
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.080]  other currencies are sowing the seeds of a renewed global financial
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.880]  instability warned Robert C. Hockett an expert on international finance and
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.240]  professor of law at Cornell University Hockett said the Chinese Yuan will
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.200]  likely be added to the dollar euro pound and yen is one of the principal
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.480]  currency components of the special drawing rights and when we ship packages
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.480]  internationally via the US Postal Service it's already denominated at the
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:31.120]  international level in SDRs on the package going back three years ago we
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.160]  had already received in the mail from the Texas Workforce Commission under the
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:40.760]  federal government's control monitoring our workers our crew that we were now to
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.320]  when we filled out the forms monthly on unemployment and things like that that
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.720]  we were to that it would now be filed at the same address but that it was now the
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:57.000]  North American Office of Labor part of the North American Union so so we're
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:05.360]  already we're already in this system so I'm glad that Kurt has done this
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:10.080]  important articles each 20 pushes globalist SDR as China's role we're
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.560]  already going on to this global currency and more and more it will set and
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:18.160]  dominate what the dollar what the yen what the yawn what the euro what
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.560]  different pesos what the ruble is worth and it's controlled by these private
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:29.040]  bankers the French Finance Minister in the G20 are currently debating the role
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.840]  of China she said France favors including the renambi or one of the
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:40.440]  divisions of the yawn in the currencies that make up SDRs even before the
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:47.080]  Chinese currency is fully convertible in 2009 China's central bank governor said
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.080]  he wants a new globalist reserve currency to be controlled by international
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.920]  monetary fund and a month ago what did who Gentiles say he said the dollar will
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:01.200]  be destroyed it will be phased out and a lot of financial researchers and
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:07.620]  experts believe 2011 may be the year and you think our economy's in the in the
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:14.080]  ditch right now can you imagine what's going to happen under this system and so
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:23.760]  they've gone from a creeping baby step to a walk now into a jog and they're
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:31.480]  now signaling a sprint phasing out the dollar it could happen with a bang it
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.360]  could happen with a whimper right now it's happening with a strategic
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.600]  coordinated devaluation on Monday Japan acknowledged that China's economy is
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.080]  now the second largest due to China's furious growth the countries expected
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.280]  to surpass the United States of the world's largest economy China outpace
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:52.720]  the United States in manufacturing this year in 2009 the US created 19.9% of
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.320]  world manufacturing output compared to 16.6% in China with the US staying ahead
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.360]  despite a steep fall in factory production due to global recession
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.480]  according to global inside a US based economics consultancy yeah here's the
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.000]  difference and I've had top economists on to break this down but I'll give you
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.800]  some layman boil down for more than 15 years the United States has completely
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:21.560]  cooked its manufacturing numbers and its employment numbers China has a very
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:27.200]  realistic really taken from the United States gauge of manufacturing it's got
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:33.960]  to be value-added if they dump say flour into a can and sell it they don't
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:39.360]  call that really you know that flower a manufactured good even though the
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:46.600]  United States would but it gets worse and and and I get these tax so-called
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:53.920]  breaks on manufacturing basically we got a manufacturing credit for sticking
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.280]  videotapes DVDs in a package and shipping it to you and McDonald's when
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:05.080]  they put a hamburger together you know they fry the hamburger on the grill or
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:10.000]  on the on the hot top and they put the cheese on it and they throw it in the
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.720]  microwave whatever they do and they throw it in the package and in the bag
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.800]  and give it to you out the window that is considered manufacturing in the
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:22.520]  United States so we've been surpassed by China a long time ago they count the
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:28.960]  service economy really as manufacturing if shoes get shipped in from China in
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:37.560]  bulk and then a regional subcontractor takes the shoes make sure the packaging
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.360]  isn't messed up puts them in a new box that's manufacturing of course that's
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.160]  not really manufacturing ladies and gentlemen but Curtin MO story continues
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.840]  with all these quotes of what they're doing the G20 is dedicated to
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.840]  transforming the IMF into a globalist version of the fellow reserve the
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.480]  authoritarian slave labor nation China plays an instrumental role in this
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.680]  proposed transformation during the recent G20 meetings China worked closely
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.120]  with the United Nations to replace the dollar as the World Reserve currency
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.960]  China's central bank insists that the dollar's global role allowed the US to
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.040]  borrow cheaply abroad fueling the credit boom that led to the financial crisis
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.360]  you know what's China complaining about they get to take all those dollars
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.680]  they've got that they got in exchange for cheap slave goods and come back and
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.080]  buy farmland coal bearing land oil bearing land natural gas bearing land
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:35.600]  factories media companies positions in stock markets owning the stock markets
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:42.800]  themselves it's just incredible you see all the global stock market mergers now
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.840]  happening driven by British interest US interest Chinese Japanese European Union
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.600]  interest Israeli interest the Arab interest are some of the biggest if you
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:58.160]  actually look at the consolidation of those stock markets in the last six
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:05.400]  seven years I've been taken out of context when I've obviously Hollywood is
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.840]  predominantly Jewish dominated no one denies that I was pointing out of the
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:14.200]  Fox News and AP article like three years ago that the biggest stock markets in
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:20.240]  the world were majority the stock markets themselves were majority owned by
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.560]  Jordanian and but not not even so much Jordanian that they were part of it in
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.040]  one article Saudi Arabian Yemen you know those oil rich countries and I was
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.000]  pointing out the globalist aren't gonna let the Arabs keep that they're gonna
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.600]  fund revolutions they're gonna overthrow them and just like you're doing with
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.000]  housing mubarak seizing his 7 billion he's poor compared to King Fod and the
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.560]  rest of them and that the globalists are gonna steal that money that's that's the
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.840]  point I was pointing out Fox was admitting in an article that not only
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.280]  were they buying up the stock markets but that Fox the biggest single owners
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.840]  in Fox we put them together or Saudi Arabians Rupert Murdoch has a deal
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:04.160]  where he can own a minority of Fox but in those deals he and his family still
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:10.400]  control Fox but of course the Cointel Pro spun that that I was saying that it's
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.480]  just ridiculous you know but I mean if that's what I meant and it's not what I
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.840]  meant it was taken out of context I was pointing out but but but side issue I
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.160]  just made me think about that because we covered what with Max Kaiser Thursday
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:28.120]  the consolidation of stock markets all over the world and that's why the
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.280]  globalist this is economic warfare that's why they want to overthrow Saudi
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.320]  Arabia that's why they want to overthrow Egypt that's why they want to
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.840]  overthrow even their client states because they have real wealth and real
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.760]  power and they and and the new world order would rather bring down the house
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.400]  of Saudi Arabia the House of Saud and the country's named after that royal
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.480]  family and steal their trillions of dollars we're not talking about seven
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.880]  billion dollars that hazy mubarak that they're now basically chasing his bank
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:05.200]  accounts in England and in Switzerland and he's now racing in a coma but but
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.640]  his handlers his family that that's in the news today are trying to get that
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:18.120]  money out of Europe's what message does this send what message does this
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:25.640]  telegraph what message does this put across to all of these dictators and
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:30.040]  these corrupt royal houses these dynasties that they have made these
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.840]  deals in the case of the Saudis it's a hundred-year-old plus deal now to set up
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:40.720]  their country to create its borders to militarily back it and then to
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:46.240]  invest their money from the oil in the big banks and now there's a move to
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.320]  double-cross them and basically steal that money the globalist cannot allow
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.640]  there to be any real wealth out there that they don't control and so it's
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.520]  almost like if you're playing risk you know the world domination board game
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.160]  we're getting down to the end game we're getting down you've been playing
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.280]  risk for 15 hours in college and there's only two of you left now
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:13.000]  basically on the board and all the stops are being pulled out there may have
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.960]  been alliances five six hours ago in the game but now we're entering the last
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:22.080]  hour of this current phase and the globalist aren't just fighting with
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.280]  each other and consolidating wealth they're also building the paramilitary
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.760]  domestic control grid forces because their main enemy it aren't just each
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.200]  other and regional geopolitical blocks their enemy is the individual sovereign
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.960]  person who is middle-class and not dependent on them the world is being
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.940]  transferred and turned into a prison planet and so you're gonna see the
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:49.320]  Arabs stabbed in the back by the globalist now you're going to see these
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:53.080]  nations overthrown one by one we're gonna get into that when Tarpoli joins us
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.400]  I want to shift gears though and get into Ron Paul saying he can beat the
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:02.640]  warmonger Obama and a lot more is it really possible to get out of debt
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.800]  without payment plans or attorneys 18 years ago we developed a program that
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:11.240]  has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days it's called zero debt in 90 days
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:15.400]  and it works for all credit card debt medical bills even collection lawsuits
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:20.360]  when I first joined I was being sued so I used the program methods and after

[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:01.760]  insider Wisconsin National Guard preps for worker unrest after governor unveils
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:08.080]  emergency budgets and it goes on under Walker's plan public employees would
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.320]  lose all of their collective bargaining rights except a limited
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.760]  negotiation on wages state workers will also have to contribute more to their
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:20.080]  pension and health care benefit plans so that can be stolen unions erupted in
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.320]  outrage as they learned about Walker's proposal the governor told Milwaukee
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.880]  public radio that he had briefed the Wisconsin National Guard to prepare them
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:35.600]  for any worker unrest that's on NPR now what have I told you this whole homeland
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.320]  security control grids for it in front fighting men in caves or the Saudi
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:46.840]  Arabian terrorists the globalist run it is for the American people and people
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.440]  say good cut those government people's benefits they're lazy well I'm all for
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:58.760]  making sensible cuts to government but if you give 28 trillion dollars in
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.840]  counting they haven't gotten new numbers in a year now it's completely secret the
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:08.240]  first year and a half of the banker bailout it was 28 trillion according to
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.360]  Bloomberg they won't tell Congress where the money went and now they're
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.240]  announcing they're taking private pension funds government pension funds
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.200]  moving towards all of this and I've had the economist on they broken down the
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.920]  common sense numbers you could get rid of all welfare all entitlements all your
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.080]  pension funds you could take your private pension funds you could give all
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.480]  the money in America to the bankers and it wouldn't get rid of a fraction of the
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:40.000]  1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trill and that's a year old number he just keeps getting
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.800]  bigger and bigger you heard them two weeks ago at Davos London telegraph
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:52.960]  headline Davos Sarkozy Baroso they want 100 trillion in additional money given
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.680]  to the IMF and World Bank of your taxpayer money which they then leverage
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:06.200]  out that they then use against us that they then loan people at 59.9% in some
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:09.800]  cases I couldn't believe that last week when I saw it CNN reported some credit
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:18.540]  card holders are now being charged 59.9% in the US annual rate 59.9 loan
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:24.120]  sharkings 25 30% and so they're like we're gonna slash the government workers
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:28.720]  we're gonna slash the police every man for himself but we're raising the taxes
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:33.360]  oh and you've got to put more of your paycheck into the pension funds which
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.440]  they take out the back door the globalist run America like the mafia
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.320]  runs a factory when they take it over or the mafia runs a bar when they take it
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:47.000]  over for fraud to completely loot it folks when the globalist 11 years ago
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.680]  got rid of glass steel or I guess 11 and a half almost 12 years ago now 99 it
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.120]  also came out again mainstream news much as I don't like Bloomberg the gun
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.720]  grabbing man I Bloomberg's actually hardcore but others also covered it when
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.240]  they reported secret deals with prudential and others keep going back
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.240]  to this just to people get their minds around what we're talking about it how
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.160]  serious these crux are that they went and signed a secret deal with veterans
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:18.280]  affairs to take the death benefits from World War two to current vets so if you
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.240]  get killed and you and you've you paid money into that insurance policy that
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.440]  you just don't get it I mean that's brazen that's hardcore that's that's
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.120]  incredible that's what we're dealing with here so of course the National Guard
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.080]  backed up by the threat fusion centers and Homeland Security of course they're
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:40.760]  there they're there when they take your pension funds they're there when they
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.400]  gonna take your farm or ranch they're there when they draft your kids during
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.600]  this World War 3 situation they're there when you protest they're there they're
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.360]  there it's criminal it's illegitimate just like in a third-world country if
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.480]  their government's gonna loot their population they put a police state grid
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:00.920]  in place to make sure they can secure the gains to make sure they can carry out
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.920]  the takeover carry out the fraud now while the military drills to lock down
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.320]  cities barricade cities arrest people in mass doing this live time drills check
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.040]  points in Tennessee pulling people out of cars you regular army Homeland
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.400]  Security governor says don't do it they say we don't care we're gonna go ahead
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.560]  and do it that was last year it's in police state for rise of FEMA while all
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:28.920]  of that is going on it's just footnote in Texas newspapers watching as a big
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.600]  article on it Mexican troops conduct vehicle searches on US soil our
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.600]  military's told not to fire back on them when they get shot at by the Mexican
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.840]  troops the Mexican troops are now coming in 80 miles into Arizona the feds have
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.280]  put up signs saying don't go down this highway and they're now just setting up
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:48.720]  checkpoints robbing American citizens because Mexico's a client of the

[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.280]  do here possible now shifting gears to Webster Griffin Tarpley again doctor of
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:11.080]  history also an accomplished economist and author he's written the unauthorized
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.600]  biography of Barack Hussein Obama and George Herbert Walker Bush both seen
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.800]  a seminal research tomes for the roadmaps to understand these important
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.960]  globalist frontmen here's just some of the headlines protest spread to Saudi
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:28.240]  Arabia military trying to not to open fire knowing that they could be
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.400]  overthrown at any time also Britain looks into freezing assets of Mubarak and
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.240]  his associates upwards of seven billion Swiss are talking about grabbing it
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:41.140]  conveniently we now learned that as Tarpley said there was a counter coup
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:45.720]  going on last Thursday Tarpley said who knows if he'll step down or was it
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:50.200]  Wednesday the CIA chief Padda had said he will step down the next two hours he
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.560]  didn't step down he came out to finally give a speech then magically we now learn
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:02.600]  that he reportedly was flown to Israel and had a stroke of some type and
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.120]  then we heard he had the stroke in Egypt was flown to Israel very very
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:11.440]  suspicious you know classic type attempted assassination or drugging we
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.800]  see this with Yasser Arafat we see this with Ariel Sharon we see this with
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.520]  Ronald Reagan after he was shot never really coming out of his days except when
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.800]  they drug him up and roll him out to read off cue cards and now they're trying
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.960]  to overthrow these other countries in the strategy of tension and what does
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.400]  this say to the Saudi Arabian despots the Royal House of Saud they've got
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.640]  trillions not seven billion the globalists want to overthrow that put
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.800]  extremists in steal that money and then use that destabilization as a pretext
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:47.200]  to expand the globalist presence in the Middle East now there's no doubt that
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:50.720]  Tarpley was right about all this going back a year ago he said look for
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.160]  Berlusone to be attacked with scandals there were no scandals at the time boom
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:00.800]  he's now been indicted in prostitution probe that's out of the associated
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.960]  press so the globalists are moving and he said look for him to move against
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.200]  Berlusone we're not saying Berlusone's good we're not saying Hazy Mubarak's
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:14.000]  good or King Fod is good the point is is that the globalists are now turning on
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.400]  their cohorts and this signals an unthawing of the geopolitical strategy
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.960]  and an acceleration of the Brzezinski kamikaze model do you concur with the
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:27.360]  breakdown of what I've put out Webster yes I think that's about right Alex
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:34.880]  what you're looking at now is a general assault on the modern nation state by
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:40.640]  the Empire and it's the goal of this is to simply wipe out entire nations
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:47.800]  reduce them to chaos reduce them to regional entities we've seen Sudan in
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:53.360]  the middle of all this Sudan carved into two parts by a process of succession
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:57.520]  which the British had been backing for decades really for the best part of a
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.760]  hundred years and I think you can expect that to come in in another place and
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.800]  we see the chain reaction of a breakdown the great game what we're talking
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:10.560]  about here oh we're in a depression and in the middle of this depression this
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:16.000]  the depression obviously poses a threat to to the city of London and Wall
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.600]  Street if the nation states declare Wall Street and the London banks bankrupt
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.720]  then we can get out of the depression but what we're now seeing is the city of
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.440]  London and Wall Street unleashing their intelligence agencies and all their
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:35.960]  countergangs and all their their spooks across the world to destroy the nation
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:41.240]  states to knock the nation states onto the onto the defensive so that Wall
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.600]  Street and the city of London can triumph over a ruined world and obviously
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.360]  they would like to take this all the way when you when you saw the Egypt go
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:56.520]  down you immediately heard these manic voices coming out of the the CIA
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:01.720]  measure saying in effect we can take this all the way to Iran we can take this
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.800]  all the way to Beijing we can take this all the way to Moscow and there's
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:11.280]  nothing to stop our world empire now obviously that's a lot of manic nonsense
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.920]  in there but it is a very very dangerous game let me just point on before you
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.600]  go point it out they they were able to now take down Egypt the question is how
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.160]  was that gonna end but I want you to get into this
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:29.360]  hazy mubarak reports in the Jerusalem Pulse Tourette's BBC that he said I'm
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.640]  not gonna step down and then magically gets ill has a stroke and you know I
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:38.760]  mean this is very very suspicious look I think these are cover stories the fact
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:44.520]  that the fact that we have is that by last Thursday evening the CIA coup d'etat
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:51.120]  in Egypt was dead in the water the push had stalled out it was going nowhere the
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:58.280]  generals loyal to the CIA this Tantawi and Anand had tried everything to get
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.680]  Mubarak out and he would not leave and of course this gaggle of rich elitists
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:09.640]  there in that square right the the Twitter and Facebook fans from from the
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.960]  wealthy neighborhoods of Cairo North these are a bad joke even when they're
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:19.200]  supplemented by a certain you know amount of mermidans from the from the
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.720]  Muslim Brotherhood and you've got the gaggles of Soros people you've got the
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:28.000]  Google man in there running the whole thing right so think of it now on the
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.480]  morning of the Friday the morning of the day that Mubarak finally was forced
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:37.920]  out there was a meeting of the Supreme Military Council and that came out with
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:42.760]  an endorsement of Mubarak take a look on the internet military council
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.720]  communicate number two I found this in the number of you know that the times of
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:52.680]  India the the Deccan times for various places around the world it's there it
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:59.320]  was that's probably a Reuters wire so in that morning Mubarak had the military in
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:04.880]  his pocket what is it to change that now the obvious question is what kinds of
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:11.480]  threats were delivered overnight you can imagine Obama watching that speech by
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:16.160]  Mubarak on Thursday afternoon where Mubarak was hanging tough and then
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:22.720]  Obama chewing the carpet going wild with rage similar scenes in Langley at the
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.360]  CIA similar scenes at Foggy Bottom at the State Department similar scenes in
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.920]  the National Security Council they then obviously mobilized everything they had
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:36.320]  because this is now a question of imperialism is there imperialism or not
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:41.360]  can you bring down Egypt or can you not and if you can't then and then the
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:46.040]  entire complexion of the Middle East changes now the obvious things they
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.480]  are for our threats right I don't know what threats but we can assume some
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:55.360]  pretty heavy-duty threats to Mubarak to his wife Suzanne to his son Kamal to his
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:00.760]  other son a lie I think his name is for a while and then he's got a granddaughter
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:05.840]  he's got he's got property the threat that I think makes the most sense is
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:10.920]  the threat to seize the Suez Canal and I would take this absolutely seriously
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:17.520]  just to take off the the the pieces that were on the board the US had a task
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.480]  force in the middle of the Suez Canal the Suez Canal is a sea level canal in
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.200]  the middle of it there's this thing called the Great Bitter Lake with the
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:30.960]  city of Ismailia on the Egyptian side sitting in the Great Bitter Lake is the
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:35.720]  USS Kiersarge with several thousand Marines and its main function is to
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.680]  deliver special forces commandos into situation now they said of course this
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.640]  is for the evacuation of US nationals in case the situation gets ugly but it
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:51.200]  could just as easily be the spearhead of something to take over the Suez Canal we
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:57.400]  also had on the 5th of February I believe a bomb exploded at the pipeline
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:03.080]  which takes natural gas from Egypt across the Sinai Peninsula into Egypt into
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:10.280]  Israel and then into into Jordan as well and the Israelis then began saying this
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.360]  is a definite threat to our national security because we get large proportion
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:20.680]  of our you know cooking gas and heating gas from this natural gas pipeline then
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:26.760]  you had a strike by the employees of the Suez Canal sit down strike they're not
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.760]  collecting the toll now they're also not maintaining the canal and the problem
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.040]  with the Suez Canal is the sides are always caving in so you've got to have
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:39.720]  a constant process of keeping it open remember that when the British and the
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:47.080]  French with Israeli help in 1956 tried to seize the Suez Canal back from Nasser
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:51.160]  of Egypt after he had nationalized it and and brought it back to Egyptian
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.320]  control one of their arguments was that the Egyptians are not capable of
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:59.960]  running the canal we enlightened educated Europeans are needed to do this so we've
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:02.960]  got to go back to imperialism or they're gonna they're gonna mess up the
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:09.000]  canal then you have these reports coming out of Israel from the various
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:17.240]  debka and winet and these kinds of sites that the Hamas fighters had
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.680]  successfully infiltrated themselves out of Gaza and into this large area of the
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:25.920]  Sinai Peninsula take a look on the map and you see how big it is but it's
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:31.560]  between the Suez Canal in the west and the Israeli border in the east and of
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:35.280]  course the Gaza Strip is there too and the Israeli accounts then say it's not
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:40.240]  just Hamas fighters you've got there but you've got Jaishi Islami and that
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:45.800]  means al-Qaeda al-Qaeda in effect is at the Suez Canal now imagine the headline
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:53.280]  Obama orders marines to seize Suez Canal to protect it from al-Qaeda terrorists
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:59.040]  right it would be easy one RPG fired at a tanker and you would have the pretext
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.320]  so at a certain point you could say Egypt is descending into chaos therefore
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.080]  the USS disease the Suez Canal to keep it open all right let me stop you for a
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:13.560]  moment and and bring this in then we're gonna look at the larger geopolitical
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:17.840]  ramifications and where the globalist with the great gamer going with this a
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:24.200]  week ago business insider and others reported from their sources that marines
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:32.680]  are standing by and are quietly being deployed I separately talked to a marine
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:39.240]  this weekend who's part of fast that's the US MCs fleet anti-terrorism
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:48.920]  security team fast company entry and they are preparing to be now sent to
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.560]  Egypt so what you just talked about with marines that's already in Congress
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.800]  that's already moving well this is now open ended because really now at any
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:07.720]  time the US could declare Egypt is in chaos the 10% of world trade 10% that
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:14.200]  goes through that one canal is in danger and therefore we've got to go in to
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:19.600]  maintain order now in 1956 it was the British in the French with commandos
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.200]  the Israelis attacking overland who knows what it would look like this time
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:29.480]  but the goal of getting the Suez Canal of course is once you've got it you
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:35.360]  find reasons why China can't be allowed to use it because they're a threat
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.520]  therefore the entire Chinese commerce between China and Europe a lot of that
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.800]  goes through the Suez Canal most of the high value stuff certainly does you find
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:50.960]  reasons why the Chinese the Iranians and the Russians have to be kept out of the
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:57.000]  Suez Canal but earlier you were pointing towards a globalist stage to fake al-Qaeda
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:04.200]  event on the Suez that is where the marines and others are massing for the
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:08.580]  staged event explain to people who would be behind that and then what that will
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:12.880]  trigger and now we see the globalist running the Muslim Brotherhood trying
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.880]  to overthrow Saudi Arabia I mean clearly this is one of the biggest moves
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.920]  we've seen pre-2003 yes it's essentially the idea that the imperialists have
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.060]  never given up on controlling the Suez Canal it's obvious these are the naval
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:32.600]  choke points of the world right the narrow seas and British geopolitical
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:39.600]  or maritime doctrine if you control the states of Hormuz you control 25 30% of
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.800]  the world's oil coming out of there if you control the Suez Canal you control
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:49.560]  8 to 10 percent of world trade that goes through the Suez Canal similarly if you
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.720]  control the states of Gibraltar and these other narrow seas right with it
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:58.160]  with the land masses come together if you control those then you're on your
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.640]  way to world supremacy and again the main issue today is how do you keep the
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.880]  Chinese out how do you keep the Russians out how do you keep the Iranians out but
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:13.360]  I think above all that the Chinese so it seems to me that that is one one of the
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  things that might have been told to Mubarak is if you don't decide to leave
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.280]  now there will be chaos and within five days and we can of course make the chaos
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.080]  more acute but we can come up with false flag events that will make it look
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.840]  really bad at that point the imperialists may want to take over the
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:37.080]  Suez Canal and they'll have reasons to do it and Israel's been saying for two
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.640]  weeks they are prepared to go into Egypt right now that that's openly on their
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.680]  news stations in their newspapers they're getting the Israeli population ready
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:48.840]  for it but they also say however that the Israelis one of their arguments is
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.320]  that their Sinai front has been neglected for the 30 years now that the
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:58.280]  Camp David treaty has been in effect what one of the effects of Camp David is
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:03.040]  that the Egyptian military presence in the Sinai Peninsula is radically reduced
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.080]  and that's of course another reason they say that's why Hamas and Al Qaeda can
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.400]  run wild in the Sinai and so if they've lost in Lebanon three years ago have a
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:20.560]  new front and basically turn west and so this allows that greater Israel it's
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.400]  certainly a possibility again I think the Suez Canal is the real prize but
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.200]  there may be people who want the Sinai Peninsula as well the things that I've
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:33.600]  seen the Israelis lamenting that they don't have their tank divisions ready
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.560]  for desert warfare of the type you'd have in the Sinai they have their
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:42.960]  divisions ready for mountain warfare on the Lebanese or Syrian fronts but not
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.360]  not for the other front so there are various stories floating around but the
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:52.160]  general quest is pretty clear I think there are designs on the Suez Canal
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:58.000]  let's talk about what this major chess move signifies and what the next moves
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.960]  are gonna be hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now

[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.560]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.640]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:14.920]  we're back live thank you for joining us webster with us five minutes into the
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:18.200]  next hour coming up at the bottom of the hour dr. Paul Craig Roberts has written
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:22.960]  article for info wars.com saying was this a real revolution in Egypt about
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:26.640]  how they're just put the military and just new thugs in power kind of like
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:31.600]  sharp teeth the old teeth a mubarak or a move new teeth roll forward dr. Paul
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.600]  Craig Roberts will be joining us we'll also ask him about these big
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.800]  announcements and moves towards getting rid of the dollars the world reserve
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:41.920]  currency now being called for by the G20 by France not just China in fact in the
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:45.560]  next segment I'm gonna ask Tarpley who's a accomplished economist and had
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:50.320]  amazing predictive powers on what's happening to give us his take on the
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:56.200]  world reserve currency status of the dollar but webster finishing up on the
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.240]  Middle Eastern North African situation I was watching Anderson Cooper this weekend
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:03.640]  they were saying this is what democracy looks like it's freedom I mean when you
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.760]  see these globalists pushing something it's so disgusting what they're doing
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:12.160]  and now it's spreading to Saudi Arabia everywhere else just just just putting
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.640]  bookends on it how's it going for the globalist where do you see it going
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:24.360]  what does this signify well it's in the event in Egypt are a victory for the
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.600]  globalists in the imperialist but at the same time at a certain cost because it
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:33.760]  was very obviously a CIA coup announced by Leon Panetta in Washington DC and
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.760]  obviously fermented by the US government with every tool that their
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.520]  disposal although they there are some accounts that try to try to minimize that
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.680]  what you now have is a military dictatorship it's a military junta
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:51.040]  the Constitution has been officially shredded you're under martial law it's
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:54.600]  a dictatorship for at least six months and then they promise singing
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:59.120]  tomorrows their main goal now is strike breaking they want to prevent people
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:03.440]  from getting wage increases which is the first thing that everybody wants now
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:07.560]  that that Mubarak is going under IMF World Bank austerity half the
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.640]  population on two dollars or less and so this is basically Mubarak wasn't going
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:16.000]  along with that he wasn't jumping high enough when they said jump and so they're
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.400]  showing all these other dictators you better do what we tell you or you'll go
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.560]  the way of Mubarak right now the big issue I think we've mentioned this
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.920]  before is this question of the the US nuclear umbrella and the the thing that
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.880]  Hillary Clinton had tried to do in the summer of 2009 is to assemble this front
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.200]  of Arab Sunni states Egypt Saudi Arabia the Gulf States the Gulf Cooperation
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:43.280]  Council and the Israelis locked into a single alliance now for an Arab leader
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.600]  this is simply untenable you may remember the first Gulf War how the
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:51.480]  Israelis had to stay out of it because if the Israelis had come into it all the
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.720]  Arabs would have left it through the other exit but this was a way to bootleg
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:02.760]  that alliance in under the cover of a US nuclear umbrella so the US
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:08.680]  would be protecting Israel Egypt Saudis and Gulf States obviously lining them up
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:15.000]  to play them against Iran Syria the Shiites the Hezbollah the Hamas the
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.720]  radical forces whatever they are and the big winner out of that would have
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:23.200]  been would have been the US and the fact is then that Mubarak said no I
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:27.920]  reject this I will not do it and his strong stand meant that the Saudis were
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.320]  also encouraged to say no so the main US diplomatic gambit in the Middle East
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:38.120]  of the whole of Obama administration so far was simply wrecked and ruined by
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:43.320]  Mubarak personally he has also rejected the plan for this United Nations
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:47.600]  kangaroo court on Lebanon which is supposed to indict Hezbollah and then
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:52.320]  lead to the destabilization and renewal of the civil war in Lebanon as a front
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:55.840]  where you could begin undermining Hezbollah and causing problems for
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.640]  Syria and for various people in in Lebanon Mubarak got records saying no
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:07.160]  I'm against this the Iranians can play a positive role so in many ways he was
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:12.720]  a force opposing the craziest schemes that the US was coming forward but
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:18.640]  remember also Mubarak did not join in the attack on Iraq in 2003 he refused to
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:23.720]  send troops the US had wanted troops for Afghanistan he refused to send those so
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:29.240]  this is somebody who was not a puppet in the way that many people might think he
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:32.800]  was saying no to the US on a lot of things that they really wanted watch
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:36.440]  this new hunter and see if they accept the nuclear umbrella absolutely
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:42.920]  untrees the political paradigm bring in chaos rearrange it thank you for
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:52.320]  listening to GCN visit GCN live com today this is Alex Jones with five good
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:56.320]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:00.120]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:04.200]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:08.440]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:12.720]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:16.680]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:21.080]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:24.800]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:28.960]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:32.760]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:36.240]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:41.400]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolar

[01:59:53.080 --> 02:00:00.800]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:20.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.600]  Alex Jones we know that no big political or military movement can be
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:29.360]  completely secret because the pieces have to be put in position beforehand
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:33.000]  and it's on record that the National Guard has been basically federalized
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.440]  they're training local police for martial law we've gotten countless internal
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:40.800]  documents made national news many times as listeners know that they are
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:44.960]  preparing for this martial law it has nothing to do with cave dwellers in
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:49.920]  Central Asia the police state grid is for the American people the governor of
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.080]  Wisconsin told Milwaukee Public Radio as a threat under austerity cutting the pay
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:58.960]  of state workers jacking up taxes and demanding they invest more in the pension
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:02.120]  funds they're looting he actually threatened them and said the National
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:07.120]  Guard is standing by so so very confident up there with the austerity
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:10.600]  they're selling the idea through the New Jersey governor and others that cut
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:15.520]  everything and that this will fix the budget deficit but there's no way to
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.400]  fix it if we sign on to the 1.5 quadrillion of the foreign bankers you
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:23.520]  as you know terribly could cut all the spending in the world it wouldn't even
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:28.560]  pay for a thimble of the fiat derivative debt and we've got the French and others
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.520]  the G20 joining China saying let's get rid of the dollar this is a big deal
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:37.040]  what do you think about the military buildup against the American people well
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:42.240]  the first thing is that the policy of cut and cut is guaranteed to fail you
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:46.000]  can see with this was tried by Schwarzenegger in California he would cut
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.680]  the budget one year and then he would come back the next year and the
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:53.680]  deficits would be bigger this is not the way to get out of a depression you've
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:57.680]  got to have a recovery program and this has been a there are so many
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:02.640]  historical examples it's just it's economic suicide national suicide to do
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:08.160]  these things in terms of these people who say that the reserve currency role of
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:13.680]  the US dollar is at an end here is the challenge if you want to be a reserve
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:18.960]  currency it means for example that that oil prices are generally quoted in
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:24.600]  dollars but the other thing it means is that central banks around the world are
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:28.360]  willing to keep their reserves in dollars that's why you say reserve
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:34.560]  currency so the the Bank of China the Central Bank of Japan Malaysia all
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.280]  kinds of people around the world instead of keeping it in some other currency
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:41.800]  they've generally tended to keep it in dollars now why is this what is the
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:48.800]  advantage well there is the United States Treasury bond market and the this is
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:54.760]  unique in the world it is the broadest deepest and most capable market that
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:00.120]  there is anywhere the general daily turnover is about one trillion US
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:05.880]  dollars and that's that's you know ten times twenty times more than the stock
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:10.880]  market or other other markets it's a huge part of the world financial
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.720]  turnover and this market is deep enough so that if you come forward if you say
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:21.040]  look I have three trillion dollars worth of US Treasury securities I'd like to
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.640]  turn that into cash today that can be done pretty much without batting an eye
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:30.400]  three trillion four trillion even maybe five trillion it can handle it because
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.480]  there's that much liquidity the market is that highly developed if you want to
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:39.560]  be a reserve currency you've got to have a market like that and right now
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:44.240]  nobody does this is a market that goes back to really to Lincoln during the
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.120]  during the civil war there's an attempt to hijack that market and roll it into
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.720]  the sdr's but it'll take time to do that right and there is no such equivalent
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.000]  for the sdr's there's no such equivalent for the euro or the yen it is a
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.720]  genuine resource of the United States and the world at least it it could be
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:07.040]  under under better management other than these these lunatics that we have today
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:11.760]  but it it's not possible they did have thought that it was enough to come with
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:16.120]  a little coin to one of these meetings right and show off the coin that will
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:21.760]  not work that that is not serious so therefore we have the situation where if
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:27.600]  the current mismanagement and this means Wall Street Democrats and reactionary
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:32.480]  Republicans if they continue their mismanagement you might get a situation
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:36.760]  where central banks around the world becomes so frightened that they pull out
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:42.040]  of the dollar the problem with that then is there's no substitute there's nobody
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:46.560]  nobody is able to replace the dollar so you would then go into international
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:52.360]  chaos which is what you had in September 1931 Webster Tarpley.net thank

[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:35.000]  interviews that chaney did do what he did and did get there when he said he
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:41.360]  entered the PEOC bunker Manetta later confirmed he suppressed 9-11 Commission
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:45.760]  testimony and refuted chaney's account of arriving later during a CPAC
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:50.200]  conference we are change.org confronted chaney about these questions which he
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.720]  refused to address so he got screamed off the stage there being called a warm

[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:40.040]  Wisconsin's and how do you say it and said we'll call the National Guard out on
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:43.520]  you as they slash their pay start grabbing their pension fines this is
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:48.080]  incredible we've got open calls to ditch the dollar even faster now from the G20
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:52.080]  headed up by France who's at the head of the G20 right now Ted Anderson you
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.520]  haven't been on with us for weeks what's your take on all this well I mean just
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:00.000]  worldwide right now Alex it's inflation everywhere China right now is looking at
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.320]  inflation Europe the United States I mean budgets aren't being met here in the
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:07.920]  United States so you see things going on like in Wisconsin and look at
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:13.760]  California just there's a depression converging not only here in the United
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:18.880]  States Europe and across China even China and they've been our biggest lender
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:23.400]  they've financed our economy for the last 20 years and they can't do it
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:27.480]  anymore inflation showing up they're running to commodities running the price
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:33.600]  of gold and silver up sober I mean my goodness silver won over $30 so at 3096
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:40.480]  today at a high gold at 1377 90 at a high today I mean it's been a hot day for
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:44.080]  gold and silver and that inflation and all this printing press action that's
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:49.320]  been coming out of Washington DC obviously has taken a great effect Ted
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:53.080]  Anderson again you haven't been on with us in about three weeks they've come out
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:56.280]  even in Congress they're having investigations about JP Morgan and
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:00.680]  others trying to suppress silver and gold gold and silver are surging right
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:04.800]  now obviously as commodities go up across the board you've been able in
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:08.080]  this recent pullback you look at an 11-year graph gold's only going straight
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:11.760]  up silver's only going straight up there's little corrections on the way as
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:14.960]  it kind of steps up you've been able to get a lot of gold and silver and
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:18.200]  incredibly low prices and then you can pass on the savings even though it's
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:21.800]  gone up you can sell it to folks for what you got it when it was lower so
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:25.200]  people get the best of both worlds people need to stop procrastinating
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:28.840]  Midas has the best deals out there these radio specials are the best deals
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:32.640]  these are lost leaders for you tell folks about today's gold and silver offer
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:36.240]  well yeah currently right now I mean first of all I'm still holding those
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:41.160]  silver dollars and your videos at $97 the follow the Republic in the endgame
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:45.040]  and the end Obama deception what a great way to get started in gold and silver

[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:53.760]  all 97 bucks you just can't beat that but you know like for instance the Frank
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:59.720]  right now is a 302 there are $320 here last time gold hit a peak so here you
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:04.880]  have a chance to get into those at a much lower price British sovereigns 379 if
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:08.920]  you do buy one of those Franks we send out a full-year subscription to the
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:12.960]  international forecaster to go with that I mean you can't I mean you know what's
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:17.320]  going on Alex right now there's a market is the the market is running and you
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:21.040]  know people need to be getting into gold and silver they need to take this
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.760]  seriously we've been printing way too much money and we cannot expect that
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:29.840]  the dollar is gonna hold value it takes time for those dollars to actually get
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:34.400]  into action get into the economy and actually trade that drives inflation up
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.960]  and now we're seeing that and you know now is the time to be getting in we do
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:43.400]  we have another run on gold and silver the market is saying hey this is gonna
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:47.840]  happen China you know once Chinese start buying gold and silver because they're

[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:35.520]  confirming that and at least I don't know four or five other interviews since
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.200]  then with we are changing others he said no no no what I said's right that's
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:45.040]  what happened Dick Cheney's mistaken but Cheney literally who doesn't have a
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:49.440]  pulse and has a bionic heart on the outside of his body a heart pump a
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:54.120]  ventricle a sister they're being confronted right after he'd been booed
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:59.120]  off the stage as being a warmonger by the Republicans at CPAC so a good send
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:04.920]  off for Cheney as he prepares as he gets a heart transplant to move on to Val
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:08.440]  Halla I hope he repents of what he's done I wish no ill will against Cheney
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:13.560]  because he's clearly got God to deal with but let's go ahead and play this
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.480]  amazing video audio clip here it is
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:25.520]  hey mr. Cheney mr. Cheney what you doing the underground bunker on that 11

[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:21.400]  Pentagon there was a young man who would come in and say to the vice president
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:28.600]  the plane is 50 miles out plane is 30 miles out and when it got down to plane
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:35.520]  is 10 miles out the young man also said to the vice president do the orders

[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.320]  course the orders still stand have you heard anything to the contrary moments
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:52.800]  contemplation reveals the magnitude of what we have just heard not only was
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:59.360]  Cheney in the Pioch before flight 77 hit he told an obviously nervous aid that
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:04.440]  the orders still stood and then listened as the plane approached and then hit the

[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:47.460]  you were to the stand-down order Norman Panetta is on record in testimony you've
[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:51.700]  been caught lying about that you're a terrorist you carried it out and boy he
[02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:57.300]  looks guilty of sin literally like Darth Vader with his heart assist pump on
[02:33:57.300 --> 02:34:01.420]  the outside of his body the New York Times reports dick chaining has no pulse
[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:07.300]  you've got this high-tech undead ghoul who's incredibly dangerous launched a
[02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:11.500]  war that killed over a million Iraqis conservatively and I'm kind of creeped
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:15.700]  out have an info wars calm tagged on the video which I'm glad they did it but I
[02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:19.460]  want listeners realize what we're doing you know when I call the White House and
[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:22.780]  tell them I know they stage 9-11 or I call Homeland Security on air to talk
[02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:27.860]  about Amaral a locky working for the Pentagon on record and reported the FBI
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:32.860]  I see videos that are made and get emails saying it's fake because people can't
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:39.180]  believe that we have the will to do this when I videotaped urban warfare drills
[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:44.300]  with the US Marines openly training to put Americans in camps people email us
[02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:47.740]  and say it's fake even though it's on the news that the Marines were there and
[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:51.500]  that we were there but I don't think I've ever done things like Luke
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:54.420]  Radowski's done I mean I've confronted Bush and was arrested for it and almost
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:59.060]  broke my shoulder and I've confronted Janet Reno and others but Luke's
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:03.140]  probably confronted David Rockefeller I mean the list goes on for hours I mean
[02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:10.060]  Luke Radowski has had death threats at his home he's confronted point-blank Larry
[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:15.820]  Silverstein about admittingly blowing up the towers and building 7 I mean I've
[02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:22.260]  got to say Luke Radowski's the man the man the man the man the true spirit of
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:27.820]  1776 a true man a true leader a person risking his life I hope you realize
[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:32.060]  folks we're all risking our lives here this is not a game and if we can do it
[02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:34.900]  you can do it I know a lot of you can't believe this stuff people are saying
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:39.060]  this Dick Cheney video is fake because you can't handle the fact that there are
[02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:45.420]  people of honor and will who are doing this for all of us I understand why
[02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:51.100]  some of you can't believe it because you can't believe in yourself but we are
[02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:55.220]  having an effect Ron Paul did one the CPAC poll which now two years in a row
[02:35:55.220 --> 02:35:59.620]  legendary people are waking up we can get the country back but if you want to do
[02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:03.460]  it you got a look in the mirror now I want to get into the Egypt situation with
[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:08.460]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts he's got a new article out today it's up on info wars
[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:14.380]  calm and all the other great news sites that carry his powerful material and the
[02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:17.380]  headline is has there been an Egyptian revolution we'll talk about that for the
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:21.980]  rest of the hour with him but first serve in PR radio has the governor of
[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:27.380]  Wisconsin threatening state workers as they cut their pay for austerity and
[02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:30.140]  say they're going to take more money for the pension funds are loading that if
[02:36:30.140 --> 02:36:34.420]  they don't like it the National Guard is standing by a homeland security now is
[02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:40.300]  admitting that they are preparing basically for clampdowns in the US and
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:47.220]  the G20 led by France is calling for an end of dollar hegemony since you were
[02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:50.780]  last on with us three weeks ago who Jen towel has called for the end of the
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:56.540]  dollar what is your take and your view just on the state of the police state in
[02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:01.180]  this country and what's your view on we are change confronting Dick Cheney it at
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:07.420]  point blank range well Alex the police state continues to grow and we can see
[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:12.060]  again the hypocrisy of the American government Hillary Clinton is giving a
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:18.420]  big speech about the need for internet freedom at the same time that the United
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:23.740]  States government is demanding all the records from Twitter so that they can
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:30.140]  frame up Julian Assange so I think police state will continue to grow but
[02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:39.900]  it it has a number of reasons it does that it does grow as as for the demand
[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:46.980]  for the end of the dollar you could see this as you probably do as part of the
[02:37:46.980 --> 02:37:53.540]  one-world conspiracy or you could see it simply as the rest of the world trying
[02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:59.380]  to get free of American financial hedge enemy it's the it's the dollars
[02:37:59.380 --> 02:38:03.540]  reserve currency that gives the United States financial hedge enemy over the
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:12.660]  rest of the world and so we control them and they probably probably tired of
[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:17.860]  that without the without the financial hedge enemy that hedge enemy that we
[02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:23.580]  have we wouldn't be able to force them to comply with our laws and allow our
[02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:28.540]  police and our FBI and everything else to run all over their own countries so
[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:34.020]  it's the threats that we can make to them of excluding them from the world
[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:41.100]  financial system and this is an important source of the the hedge enemy of the
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:45.660]  United States government over the rest of the world and I think that you could
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:52.980]  probably see the call for some alternative to the dollar as people
[02:38:52.980 --> 02:38:59.100]  trying to get free of American domination so that's my take on that
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:04.020]  looking at the Egypt situation you know we want to be against Hussein Mubarak we
[02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:08.220]  want to see it as the Arabs waking up and saying no to to foreign domination
[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:13.060]  but clearly the globalist the social engineers knew that revolution was
[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:17.460]  coming there because of IMF and World Bank programs and and food prices going
[02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:21.460]  up via commodity increases you're an economist top economist former should
[02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:25.060]  have introduced you father of Reaganomics former head of policy department
[02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:28.500]  of Treasury best-selling author former Wall Street Journal editor so I'd like
[02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:32.860]  you to speak specifically to commodities going up worldwide and what you think
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:37.340]  triggering this but no doubt the social engineers knew it was coming so that so
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:40.460]  the White House now admits that they triggered it they basically ordered
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:45.100]  Mubarak to stand down he said no then he magically had this stroke now he's gone
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:48.780]  supposedly in Israel now they're seizing his assets what does this say to other
[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:54.220]  Western propped up dictators where is the revolution you're saying well the
[02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:59.260]  revolution is just put in a new puppet because people were tired of Mubarak
[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:07.980]  well I'm I don't think we had much role in his departure but he had been a
[02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:15.180]  faithful American Israeli puppet for 30 years and and his predecessor proud to
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:21.540]  him had been a puppet and Egypt has been the main way that the United States
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:31.660]  has been able to seal off Gaza so that it stays on the Israel's thumb but the
[02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:39.300]  question I raised was is getting rid of Mubarak a revolution when left in place
[02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:46.020]  as the American Embassy the elite the police army the bureaucracy they're all
[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:52.740]  still there so unless the outpourings of all those Egyptians into the streets and
[02:40:52.740 --> 02:41:01.060]  their determination to stay there unless that has caused the elite in Egypt to
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:08.740]  have a change of mind nothing much will have changed and of course the dollar
[02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:13.660]  being reserve currency and that allows us to purchase the new government just as
[02:41:13.660 --> 02:41:20.700]  we purchase the old government so and I don't know if there's been a change of
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:26.740]  mind and went beyond the ordinary Egyptians into the elites that remains
[02:41:26.740 --> 02:41:32.260]  to be seen if it has not been then sooner or later the Egyptian people will
[02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:38.300]  catch on that nothing has really changed and they'll again be in the streets
[02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:46.540]  this time with leaders which they lacked in this last outpouring and and more
[02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:53.420]  focus and if that's put down then I think eventually you'll see civil war and
[02:41:53.420 --> 02:42:01.940]  I agree with Gerald Salenty that these regimes are everywhere unstable and not
[02:42:01.940 --> 02:42:07.100]  just in the Middle East but I think in England in the United States because of
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:13.220]  the immense concentration of income and wealth and power and fewer and fewer
[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:21.460]  hands at the expense of the ordinary people so I think there's no doubt that
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:29.460]  some big crisis is is brewing how long it takes to manifest itself I have no
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:34.060]  I have no real idea well you've been predicting for years and so is Gerald
[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:38.300]  that food prices would start increasing because of dollar devaluation
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:41.220]  being the world reserve currency and other commodities would go up here's
[02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:46.020]  the Associated Press today World Bank food prices at dangerous levels World Bank
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:50.060]  president Robert Zollick says global food prices have hit dangerous levels that
[02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:52.940]  could contribute to political instability push millions of people into
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:56.980]  poverty and raise the cost of groceries will no kidding and in the
[02:42:56.980 --> 02:43:01.940]  headline out today 4% increase in inflation just in the last month in the
[02:43:01.940 --> 02:43:07.620]  UK so this this inflationary spiral is starting to really rear its
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:12.380]  ugly head and you have the people that have basically created this economic
[02:43:12.380 --> 02:43:17.460]  client climate now posing as the saviors but in places like Egypt where
[02:43:17.460 --> 02:43:24.340]  you've got 2% 50% of people on $2 a day or less I mean hungry bellies when
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:30.900]  people are desperate they do desperate things right and not just in Egypt you
[02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:37.140]  see there there are multiple causes I think it's not only the printing of
[02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:42.420]  paper currencies that are driving up food prices it's also they've been
[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:49.300]  droughts have been floods that have reduced output and there's also the
[02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:56.340]  practice of the of the first world corporations and land speculators buying
[02:43:56.340 --> 02:44:04.380]  up so much land in the third world and forcing the native farmers off of it
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:10.580]  such that it's essentially taken out of food production and put into some kind
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:17.180]  of a global market commodity production so that and this is happening
[02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:23.700]  everywhere it's happening in India as well so when you see the the western
[02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:31.740]  countries using the powers of their currencies to dispossess other lands of
[02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:36.820]  the agricultural potential that's another reason for rising food prices so you
[02:44:36.820 --> 02:44:44.820]  have all of those things going on at once and and and so you have to if you
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:49.420]  wanted to do anything about it you'd have to address all three of those things
[02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:57.580]  of course you can't do anything about droughts and and floods and so probably
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:04.340]  if there was a policy of countries maintaining several stocks as the
[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:09.460]  United States used to do with the agricultural support program that would
[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:17.500]  be a good idea that was a sensible thing to have done well expanding on that I
[02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:21.740]  was listening to some farm commodity reports this morning on television and
[02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:28.380]  they were giving examples of in prime farmland in Kansas Missouri Indiana that
[02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:32.420]  just a few years ago they were giving averages it'd be a thousand four hundred
[02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:35.860]  dollars for an acre it'd be two thousand three hundred dollars for an acre here
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:40.460]  and it showed the same places now in Indiana seven eight nine ten thousand an
[02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:45.260]  acre Kansas six thousand plus on average so just in the end they admitted its
[02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:50.900]  foreign land speculators I guess a new bubble outside of real estate that was
[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:55.500]  the main driver and so but then it talked about regular farmers now are
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:46:01.500]  trying to buy land to farm or they're selling it and then stopping farming to
[02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:05.420]  the speculators and so that's another thing that's taking land out of
[02:46:05.420 --> 02:46:10.100]  production and basically making it artificially fallow that's right when
[02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:14.980]  when you print money you drive people into real things and it's not just foreign
[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:23.300]  speculators who are buying the land it's our own as well I suspect it'll all be
[02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:28.860]  organized into derivatives in the end yes and you're right to be correct the
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:34.220]  they just said internationally land speculation is up let's look at the US so
[02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:39.500]  obviously it's it's it's JP Morgan Chase it's everybody doing it that's right
[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:46.500]  it's it's everybody and it does take care it does dispossess the farmers who
[02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:52.540]  produce food and it doesn't mean the land goes out of cultivation but it may
[02:46:52.540 --> 02:47:02.700]  go into making a coin for ethanol or into some world commodity that doesn't
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:09.780]  relate to the food needs of the domestic economy so all of these all of these
[02:47:09.780 --> 02:47:17.500]  things are driven by profit and agreed and and very short-term thinking so if
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:21.500]  the inflation is just now starting to rear its head how bad is it going to get
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:27.020]  and what do you expect that dr. Roberts to do well you know like it's
[02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:33.540]  beginning to spike in England if it's 4% in one month and that's a very high
[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:40.700]  annual rate and and John Williams reported that we had a spike in January
[02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:48.220]  here which if you took it to an annual rate would give it 8% and as you already
[02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:53.100]  know the way is we've discussed before the way we measure inflation here
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:48:01.260]  actually understates the real measure so it's probably higher than 8% on on an
[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:05.860]  annual rate based on the January figures here but 4% in England in the
[02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:11.380]  month of January that's scary that's scary what you know if you annualize
[02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:21.140]  that you weigh up in the double digits and and so I think that when inflation
[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:32.060]  spikes we'll we'll see a collapse in the bond market and in the dollar and this
[02:48:32.060 --> 02:48:41.540]  will then intensify the calls for an alternative international monetary
[02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:47.780]  system I don't quite see how they can pull that off they're talking about
[02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:53.460]  making it SDRs but that still leaves the Americans the Europeans the Japanese
[02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:57.460]  Chinese in charge of everything I don't know how they can stick the Chinese
[02:48:57.460 --> 02:49:04.820]  currency in before the Chinese currency is is fully tradable you know they
[02:49:04.820 --> 02:49:14.740]  restrict the ability to to trade it's not it's sort of still controlled so how
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:18.460]  you stick that in the SDR I don't I don't know they're trying to roll it out
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:24.220]  now a little bit where you can you know dump dollars in and get some derivative
[02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:31.940]  of the yawn here in the US I know it's it's a derivative so I don't know what
[02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:40.260]  these outcomes will be I think they're worth watching and thinking about you
[02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:44.620]  have to keep in mind to the IMF has always been a tool of American policy
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:49.900]  and so the notion that the IMF is somehow going to become a tool against
[02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:59.780]  American interest how exactly does that does that happen and as I said earlier I
[02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:05.420]  think one way we can see all of this concern about the dollar is they people
[02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:13.460]  want to reduce our financial hedging and it doesn't mean that they're trying to
[02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:18.260]  explore it for well plus if the dollar is being devalued and that's making
[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:21.420]  everybody's prices go up they've got to get start getting rid of the dollar
[02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:26.300]  because it's going to be rack and ruin if this inflation continues I mean if a
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:29.300]  little bit of inflation did that in Egypt what's going to happen if we've
[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:33.980]  got 20% a year and this is going to be devastating that's right it's going to
[02:50:33.980 --> 02:50:40.460]  be devastating and and if you look at the fact that they're not dealing with
[02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:45.820]  budget deficits because they refuse to deal with the war doc stay there I want
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:49.240]  it I want to see where you think this is going talk about the wars Ron Paul

[02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:15.140]  dig chaining popping in in the next segment a little bit of overdrive there
[02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:19.380]  today look look in layman's terms dr. Roberts I mean where you see things
[02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:23.140]  going the people running our economic system have flooded the world with
[02:54:23.140 --> 02:54:25.860]  dollars you and every other major economist common sense that it's gonna
[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:29.940]  cause inflation how bad we don't know looks like it's gonna be pretty bad it's
[02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:34.460]  starting at just right on time as you predicted and others did and if
[02:54:34.460 --> 02:54:38.900]  inflation's causing all these problems now they lied to us and said it's not
[02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:42.020]  gonna cause a problem there's not gonna be inflation the people running things
[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:47.140]  aren't stupid they knew this was gonna happen what's their exit strategy well
[02:54:47.140 --> 02:54:52.620]  I don't I don't think they have one I don't I don't think there is an exit
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:57.700]  strategy just trying to pass it on to the next watch you know let the sinking
[02:54:57.700 --> 02:55:07.220]  ship pass on to the next watch I think that you had asked me about Ron Paul
[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:12.340]  and see back yes and I think what's happening is that the conservatives or
[02:55:12.340 --> 02:55:18.060]  at least some of them are not the neoconservatives but conservatives are
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:24.220]  realizing that all of this patriotic macho tough guy flag waving was playing
[02:55:24.220 --> 02:55:28.660]  into the hands of the police state and the warmonger state and that they're
[02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:35.620]  they're backing off of that and that the reason I think they like Ron Paul may
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:43.060]  have mainly to do with the fact that he's he's principled he's the guy who
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:49.020]  doesn't have his finger in the wind and people are starting to again show some
[02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:55.460]  respect for that kind of person I think that is more the reason than agreement
[02:55:55.460 --> 02:56:01.700]  with his policies I'm not sure how much some people who are turning in his
[02:56:01.700 --> 02:56:07.220]  direction are doing it because of his policies as opposed to the fact that he
[02:56:07.220 --> 02:56:16.580]  is a spokesman for people and not for the oligarchy ruling interest so I think
[02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:24.140]  that does put him in certain danger if we're to believe so many of the books
[02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:29.820]  that have been written about the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert
[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:38.460]  Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King there does seem to be an argument that
[02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:48.500]  can be made that elements in the United States government remove leaders that turn
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:56.300]  toward representing people as opposed to representing the oligarchic interests so
[02:56:56.300 --> 02:57:04.620]  that is seems to be something that a number of historians have developed
[02:57:04.620 --> 02:57:08.780]  Ron Paul as you know has been getting more bold he's now giving speeches
[02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:13.300]  about CIA narcotics trafficking we played here recently he's talked about
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:17.660]  you know governments using crises for control he said I can quote beat warm
[02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:22.260]  ongoing Obama I mean he's getting more and more bold and he is the real deal
[02:57:22.260 --> 02:57:26.340]  I mean he is somebody who has true bona fide integrity and I agree with that's
[02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:30.140]  what I said earlier before you were even on and Ron Paul's agreed here he knows
[02:57:30.140 --> 02:57:33.860]  he's in danger but he's a man of honor and destiny and we should all pray for
[02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:37.260]  him and supporting but it does show Republicans starting to take a proper
[02:57:37.260 --> 02:57:41.860]  turn towards reality that they voted him the last two years in a row as the
[02:57:41.860 --> 02:57:48.620]  winner of CPAC and Dick Cheney got booed and called a warmonger well that's
[02:57:48.620 --> 02:57:54.980]  hopeful and those are the kinds of developments that we can be hopeful for
[02:57:54.980 --> 02:58:00.100]  you know a number of commentators have made the point Alex that there's not
[02:58:00.100 --> 02:58:03.420]  really that much difference between the people in the United States and the ones
[02:58:03.420 --> 02:58:11.380]  in Egypt because just as that system is run for small elite so is ours and we
[02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:17.100]  see all kinds of foreclosures is all kinds of American jobs moved offshore
[02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:22.340]  everything in order to further enrich a very small part of the population which
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:27.180]  now has more income and wealth than it knows what to do with and the anger I
[02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:33.580]  think that we've seen abroad you'll see here in the United States. All right Dr.
[02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:36.980]  Paul Craig Roberts always appreciate you joining us folks can find out about your
[02:58:36.980 --> 02:58:45.140]  latest book at the bottom of the article you've written God bless you this is
[02:58:45.140 --> 02:58:54.100]  GCN the Genesis communications radio network. Hundreds of nations have fallen
[02:58:54.100 --> 02:58:58.940]  to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:03.180]  history. As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:07.700]  underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president
[02:59:07.700 --> 02:59:12.420]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[02:59:12.420 --> 02:59:17.700]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies
[02:59:17.700 --> 02:59:22.820]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[02:59:22.820 --> 02:59:26.820]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[02:59:26.820 --> 02:59:30.740]  Bernanke, their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[02:59:30.740 --> 02:59:34.740]  saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and
[02:59:34.740 --> 02:59:40.860]  right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of
[02:59:40.860 --> 02:59:46.300]  Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com we're watching online right now
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:54.700]  in super high quality at prismplanet.tv. Coast to coast direct from Austin
[02:59:54.700 --> 03:00:12.140]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:17.140 --> 03:00:24.300]  Well it's lonely at the top. Must be lonely for Luke. Such courage. Found it we are
[03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:28.700]  changed three years ago. Twenty-something years old. I'm really proud of Luke
[03:00:28.700 --> 03:00:33.500]  Radowski. He can proudly say he's a protege of my work. We are changed.org's been
[03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:37.580]  hacked and attacked. It's now been brought down right in Dick Chaney's face. We
[03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:41.260]  played it earlier in the hour. The video's up at infowars.com since we are
[03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:44.300]  changed.org's been hacked. Don't worry there's hundreds of other websites and
[03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:49.340]  chapters. You can't get us all. But Luke is risking his life confronting Dick
[03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:52.780]  Chaney point blank saying we know you did 9-11. The NORAD stand down you're a
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:56.060]  terrorist you're a murderer. Luke we only got four minutes I'm gonna try to get
[03:00:56.060 --> 03:00:59.660]  you back up tomorrow for a couple segments. But tell us what it was like
[03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:03.260]  not just on video but anything else that happened and and and how you've got
[03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:06.700]  this much courage and how others can emulate what you've done and use you as
[03:01:06.700 --> 03:01:11.500]  a model of true honor. I'm nobody special I'm just like everybody else. All it
[03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:15.020]  takes is just a commitment to truth and love and going out there and being able
[03:01:15.020 --> 03:01:19.420]  to speak what's in your heart and what's in your and what's in your mind. And me
[03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:23.420]  and James Lane teamed up from We Are Changed Oklahoma. We were scouting all of
[03:01:23.420 --> 03:01:28.540]  the CPAC all of the Hilton Hotel. He's another hero James Lane. James Lane of
[03:01:28.540 --> 03:01:32.460]  We Are Changed Oklahoma and me and him noticed the Secret Service Guard holding
[03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:36.140]  an elevator and just knowing that from my experiences confronting other
[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:40.300]  individuals I knew just to stick around there. Newt Gennrich came around I asked
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:44.780]  him about Bohemian Grove and then out of nowhere Dick Chaney just comes out of
[03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:49.820]  nowhere and and my heart just sank. My heart just like it just went nuts and I
[03:01:49.820 --> 03:01:53.500]  just knew I had to say something and I looked him right in the eyes and I
[03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:57.660]  told him you know what did you do on 9-11 in the presidential bunker and that
[03:01:57.660 --> 03:02:02.140]  feeling of just being able to walk up to him his face his reaction but you know
[03:02:02.140 --> 03:02:07.100]  the the pictures that came out of it are just incredible and anybody could do
[03:02:07.100 --> 03:02:10.780]  this and that's what I'm trying to show is that these people are just regular
[03:02:10.780 --> 03:02:15.180]  individuals. We have the power. We have the authority. We have everything we ever
[03:02:15.180 --> 03:02:19.180]  needed and wanted and we have the courage to go up there and talk to these
[03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:23.340]  individuals that's all it takes going up there with just love and
[03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:27.820]  compassion for truth being calm not you know not screaming when you're getting
[03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:31.980]  pushed or shoved and just being on your best behavior and just speaking truth
[03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:36.540]  and that feeling even after finishing that confrontation I remember just
[03:02:36.540 --> 03:02:41.260]  running out of there and just feeling so empowered feeling so great and I want
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:44.860]  to share that with everybody and I hope people who listen and I hope people who
[03:02:44.860 --> 03:02:49.020]  watch get encouraged get involved and whatever you call yourself if you call
[03:02:49.020 --> 03:02:53.900]  yourself an info warrior or a we are changer I don't even care it's what you
[03:02:53.900 --> 03:02:57.820]  do that matters it's the fruit of your labor. Well info warriors are we are
[03:02:57.820 --> 03:03:02.300]  changers and we are changers are info warriors it's the spirit of 1776 but for
[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:05.980]  prisonpana.tv viewers we're showing the video to people I mean you got within
[03:03:05.980 --> 03:03:09.580]  about three feet of chaining and when you you know said we know you ordered the
[03:03:09.580 --> 03:03:14.860]  standout on 9-11 though he looked at you with evil but also with defeat he
[03:03:14.860 --> 03:03:19.020]  realizes in the history books it's going to be known that he ran 9-11. He looked at
[03:03:19.020 --> 03:03:23.500]  me snarled a little bit and then he put his head down in shame he put his head
[03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:27.980]  down in shame and that feeling that look in his face and just being able to make
[03:03:27.980 --> 03:03:32.300]  eye contact with him was one of the most powerful feelings in the world and I'm
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:36.940]  going to be doing this full-time I just graduated college I just quit my job and
[03:03:36.940 --> 03:03:40.580]  I wanted to let everybody know this is only the beginning I'm just going to

[03:03:52.740 --> 03:03:56.300]  sorry because of what he did and what he has to live with for the rest of his
[03:03:56.300 --> 03:04:02.580]  eternity for what his soul and his spirit are decrepit and destroyed and if
[03:04:02.580 --> 03:04:07.660]  we just stay with compassion within our hearts we could do anything and that
[03:04:07.660 --> 03:04:11.900]  that search for truth for justice and freedom and liberty and exposing what
