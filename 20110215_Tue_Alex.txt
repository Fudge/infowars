[00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:09.666]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.246]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:12.787]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:16.988]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:21.050]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.062]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:34.104]  It is Tuesday, the 15th day of February, 2011.
[00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:38.686]  We're going to be live here for at least the next three hours.
[00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:46.268]  Several times last week, historian and economist Webster Tarpley popped in to give us his take on the spreading unrest.
[00:00:48.169 --> 00:01:02.403]  Going on in the Middle East and North Africa via the globalist destabilization campaign and where this first scene in the first act of the globalist balkanization great game operation is going.
[00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:05.486]  So he'll be popping in in the middle of the next hour.
[00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:11.592]  We're also working on several other guests on this same subject because it is getting uglier and uglier by the minute.
[00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:28.651]  Now you notice that the federal government now admits that it basically did organize the protest to throw out their ally, their trusty servant, their ancient minion, thirty-year dictator, eighty-one-year-old Hazi Mubarak.
[00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:34.917]  But now he did flee to Israel and magically had the stroke.
[00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:40.721]  He went to where he could be safe, his friends, Israel that was there criticizing
[00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:43.282]  The move to overthrow him.
[00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:46.184]  Meanwhile, the Israeli lobbyists here in the U.S.
[00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:56.870]  are literally in the cockpit running much of the Middle Eastern, North African policy and running the Obama administration.
[00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.833]  But they were like, Hosni, come to us, Moe, sweetheart.
[00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.234]  Come home where you're safe.
[00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:09.098]  Come stay at the little resort here we have by the ocean where you like to come visit us.
[00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:10.759]  We'll take good care of you.
[00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.627]  Oh, and the British, big supporters of him for all these decades, they're looking at freezing his assets and the Swiss are moving to do it.
[00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:22.950]  They report up to $7 billion.
[00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.096]  And now Mubarak tried to move it out of there into Saudi Arabia, but he won't be doing much now that he's had that stroke.
[00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:34.699]  It's all coincidental.
[00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.181]  They're bringing freedom to the Middle East right now.
[00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:51.670]  Oh yes, just like the globalists put Saddam in, put Mubarak in, and what, four more dictators just in the region, and now the globalists, if they can't overthrow Iran,
[00:02:53.144 --> 00:02:54.745]  Which the evidence shows they don't control.
[00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:59.207]  They're gonna overthrow Saudi Arabia and Jordan and Yemen.
[00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:03.589]  The list goes on and on and we're gonna be breaking all of that down after the break.
[00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.130]  A protest spread to Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:08.518]  Again.
[00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:22.749]  And, oh, when they're done, they're going to put hardcore Muslim extremists in, and then tell you you've got to give all your rights up to und homeland security, or the scary Muslims are going to get you.
[00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:29.815]  I'm afraid the republic must be gotten rid of because of the Muslim extremists.
[00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:35.900]  And I'm afraid all of your property and pension funds will have to be taken, or they will get us.
[00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:41.623]  So we're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:44.589]  But look at how the globalists treat their minions.
[00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:45.932]  And that goes for the U.S.
[00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:46.373]  military.
[00:03:47.863 --> 00:03:59.345]  Turns out 11 years ago, Bloomberg AP report, they made a secret deal that at death, you pay in when you're in the military to your death benefits, and when you die, your widow or widower, they get zero.
[00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:05.927]  The government made a deal to allow the insurance companies to keep your money.
[00:04:05.927 --> 00:04:07.847]  And it's totally illegal, but so what?
[00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.708]  You're not with Al Qaeda, are you?
[00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:15.649]  If you protest, the big banks that run the country might have to put the FBI on your tail.
[00:04:17.398 --> 00:04:33.661]  I mean, in America, it's patriotic to go through the checkpoint, to go in the naked body scanner, to let the government tax you at a massive tax rate, and to have no Bill of Rights or Constitution, and to have police with black uniforms and masks on everywhere, and checkpoints, and to take your forced inoculations.
[00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:36.824]  That's patriotism.
[00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:39.567]  Patriotism is the lack of freedom.
[00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:52.519]  So, all of you, hail and salute and swear allegiance to tyranny and despotism and the end of America, or you will be listed as Al Qaeda!
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.801]  We're coming back.
[00:04:54.801 --> 00:04:56.743]  I'm wound up.
[00:04:56.743 --> 00:04:58.144]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.144 --> 00:05:00.286]  It's February 15, 2011.
[00:05:00.286 --> 00:05:01.387]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:08.312]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:10.594]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:10.854 --> 00:05:16.236]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:19.277]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.598]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.598 --> 00:05:27.841]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:31.222]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:37.005]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:38.665]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:39.786]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:42.609]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:46.833]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:51.478]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.061]  That's End of America, the number three dot com.

[00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:04.069]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:10.493]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:17.877]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:22.739]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:24.881]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:27.682 --> 00:06:31.446]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.728]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:34.049]  Call us.
[00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:14.898]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.622]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:33.389]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:40.674]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.334 --> 00:07:51.721]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:55.644]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.644 --> 00:08:00.748]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:06.312]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:12.137]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:12.137 --> 00:08:17.480]  It is Tuesday, the 15th day of February 2011.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:24.145]  We're going to be live here, obviously, for the next three hours.
[00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:27.628]  And I am locked, cocked, ready to go, my friends.
[00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.193]  We are going to have some surprise guests here on the radio broadcast this week.
[00:08:34.193 --> 00:08:35.693]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:39.976]  That you will definitely see make the news around the country.
[00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:49.702]  So keep us in your prayers to make sure that we don't overshoot our goals this week to really have a big effect in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:53.124]  I've got a lot of important little blurbs here in the news.
[00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:59.167]  Paul Joseph Watson has got a report up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:02.708]  Mexican troops conduct vehicle search on U.S.
[00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.888]  soil.
[00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:12.771]  Well, years ago, I had sheriff's on where Mexican troops would come two miles, three miles, six miles over when they had caught, say, a dump truck full of drugs in one case.
[00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:17.733]  And they would just set up a checkpoint, stop the police, take the drugs away, and drive back over the border.
[00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:18.113]  And the U.S.
[00:09:18.113 --> 00:09:20.474]  military just sits there sucking their thumbs.
[00:09:21.547 --> 00:09:21.807]  The U.S.
[00:09:21.807 --> 00:09:31.170]  military is only allowed in drug interdiction to harass the American people deep inside the country in a violation of the 10th Amendment, not to control that border.
[00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:38.513]  Yet another military incursion by a foreign power as Homeland Security is concerned more about training Americans to spy on each other.
[00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:39.173]  Absolutely.
[00:09:39.173 --> 00:09:42.534]  So we're going to be going over that.
[00:09:42.534 --> 00:09:44.695]  Also, a very interesting report.
[00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:46.636]  You can tell Ron Paul is gearing up to run.
[00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:52.722]  The draft Ron Paul 2012 campaigns that folks have launched are going very well.
[00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:57.228]  Ron Paul, quote, I can beat warmongering Obama.
[00:09:58.294 --> 00:10:15.787]  And obviously, last week he won the coveted, two years in a row, CPAC straw poll that Republicans in the past had always said was the most important straw poll, and if you won that, that that put you in as the frontrunner like Ronald Reagan back in 1979.
[00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:17.689]  But now they say CPAC doesn't matter.
[00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:27.352]  And Ron Paul is winning the majority of other Republican straw polls, and in national scientific polls, he's either number one or number two in all of them.
[00:10:27.352 --> 00:10:33.554]  In a few polls, Mitt Romney is ahead of him by a nose.
[00:10:33.554 --> 00:10:39.076]  He's ahead of Palin, he's ahead of Huckabee, he is ahead of them all.
[00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:43.658]  But the media is running this hoax of, you can't vote for Ron Paul, he can't win.
[00:10:45.098 --> 00:10:45.979]  You can't have liberty.
[00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:46.819]  You can't have freedom.
[00:10:46.819 --> 00:10:47.779]  It's impossible.
[00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:48.739]  He cannot win.
[00:10:48.739 --> 00:10:49.940]  He cannot win.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.960]  Don't waste your vote.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:58.702]  And we've got Donald Trump running around saying that Ron Paul cannot win and sorry he cannot win.
[00:10:58.702 --> 00:11:06.525]  They're really trying to play that Jedi mind trick on the public and basically say these aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:07.145]  Move along.
[00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:07.645]  Move along.
[00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:08.986]  These aren't the droids we're looking for.
[00:11:08.986 --> 00:11:09.486]  Move along.
[00:11:09.486 --> 00:11:09.966]  Move along.
[00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:17.648]  I mean, this is literally a self-fulfilling prophecy of just telling you that Ron Paul can't win.
[00:11:17.648 --> 00:11:18.428]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:23.630]  If he runs and they steal the election and engage in the normal chicanery, it doesn't matter.
[00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.230]  He will be in the debates.
[00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.871]  He will be on television even more.
[00:11:26.871 --> 00:11:32.032]  He will talk about the private fellow reserve, the illegal wars, the CIA narcotics trafficking.
[00:11:32.032 --> 00:11:33.632]  He talks about that routinely now.
[00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:36.613]  Has for decades, but now on national TV he does.
[00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.094]  He'll talk about the Patriot Act.
[00:11:38.094 --> 00:11:39.154]  He'll talk about martial law.
[00:11:39.694 --> 00:11:41.756]  You know, I like Michelle Bachman on many fronts.
[00:11:41.756 --> 00:11:43.157]  She fights the carbon taxes.
[00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:48.221]  She's pro-Second Amendment, but she did vote for the Patriot Act.
[00:11:49.634 --> 00:11:55.877]  And she is out there promoting it, and it's just absolutely disgusting to see her do that.
[00:11:55.877 --> 00:12:00.719]  That's another report up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:01.799]  Now, here's what I want to do.
[00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:09.343]  I've been gone Sunday and obviously Monday, working on a very important story and helping a friend out.
[00:12:09.343 --> 00:12:10.863]  Well, until Sunday night when I got back.
[00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:12.044]  I actually got back in the
[00:12:12.384 --> 00:12:14.685]  Early morning hours, Monday evening.
[00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:19.466]  I spent some time with my family yesterday, but we are back now.
[00:12:19.466 --> 00:12:22.087]  And I want to just say great job to the crew while I was gone.
[00:12:22.087 --> 00:12:27.869]  And I think that Paul Watson did a wonderful job sitting in for us from England.
[00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:34.491]  And then Aaron did 30 minutes solo and I tuned in yesterday via my iPhone.
[00:12:35.435 --> 00:12:35.595]  I think?
[00:12:59.386 --> 00:12:59.566]  We're
[00:13:14.546 --> 00:13:20.250]  Half the people shook my hand and wanted to take photos with me and talked about the New World Order.
[00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.193]  And these were good-looking families with their children.
[00:13:24.193 --> 00:13:30.117]  A lot of them looked like professional people who took Valentine's Day off with their wives and children.
[00:13:30.117 --> 00:13:33.379]  And I'd say half the people were stopping and shaking my hand.
[00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:35.180]  That's the type of effect.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.463]  Again, it's not like, ooh, look, I'm a big radio star.
[00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:39.704]  I'm a big internet star.
[00:13:39.704 --> 00:13:41.785]  A lot of people know who I am.
[00:13:41.785 --> 00:13:42.906]  I could care less about that.
[00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:44.852]  We're good.
[00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:10.614]  People on the street, you name it, again, knew who I was.
[00:14:10.614 --> 00:14:16.516]  It's just an example of the effect we're having because you aren't known, some of you out there.
[00:14:16.516 --> 00:14:26.820]  So when you're walking down a street in Dallas, Texas or Los Angeles, California or Toronto or London, you think you're all alone knowing about the New World Order.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.542]  You think that those of us that know what's going on are the minority.
[00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:33.812]  But you're not.
[00:14:33.812 --> 00:14:40.814]  It's just that no one recognizes your face because you're a private person, and so they're not reaching out to you because they don't know.
[00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:47.716]  That's why I'm so into people who know about the New World Order, who basically are saying, don't tread on me, I want liberty.
[00:14:47.716 --> 00:14:50.457]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:56.719]  That's why I'm so into you wearing some type of Patriot t-shirt.
[00:14:57.853 --> 00:14:59.634]  And the best is Infowars.com.
[00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:02.195]  And when you purchase the t-shirts, it supports the broadcast.
[00:15:02.195 --> 00:15:03.335]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.556]  But get a stencil.
[00:15:04.556 --> 00:15:05.916]  Get a white t-shirt.
[00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:09.297]  Spray paint Infowars.com on the back of it.
[00:15:09.297 --> 00:15:12.139]  Or another way to meet like-minded people is wear a Ron Paul shirt.
[00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:17.101]  I'm just trying to think of the best, most noticeable logos or signets.
[00:15:17.101 --> 00:15:17.821]  It's your colors.
[00:15:17.821 --> 00:15:20.322]  I mean, it's like the military wears an American flag on their shoulder.
[00:15:21.002 --> 00:15:23.563]  So people know they're with America.
[00:15:23.563 --> 00:15:27.825]  Or Ford has a Ford symbol on the front of the car so you know it's a Ford.
[00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:33.208]  Or Ferrari or Lamborghini.
[00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:35.209]  That's so you understand what it is.
[00:15:37.213 --> 00:15:46.038]  If you start, just maybe once a week when you're out in public, wearing a Patriot-type t-shirt, you're going to get compliments, you're going to have people reach out to you.
[00:15:46.038 --> 00:15:58.326]  Now, they might not do it as much as they do because they feel like they know me, they hear me on the radio, they see me on the internet, they see me on national television occasionally, and so they feel comfortable reaching out to me because I'm a public figure.
[00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:03.829]  They still may not reach out to you as much, but I've talked to a lot of people when they wear a Patriot t-shirt that they
[00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:05.886]  I don't care!
[00:16:22.506 --> 00:16:32.518]  How you do it, but letting people know where you stand also resonates and lets people not feel like they're alone and lets people get connected.
[00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:34.200]  Now, I got a bunch of news to get to.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:42.570]  It's just that for me, that is such a central issue that I can't go to Zilker Park without being mobbed by people.
[00:16:44.957 --> 00:16:47.858]  Because just five years ago, I went to Zilker Park.
[00:16:47.858 --> 00:16:49.238]  There weren't many people there.
[00:16:49.238 --> 00:16:52.379]  The train was full, but the park was pretty much empty.
[00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:57.080]  And I just had people constantly coming up to me.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.480]  And five years ago, sure, maybe one person might have come up to me.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:10.582]  I mean, now it's just, well, it's very, very, very positive news.
[00:17:10.582 --> 00:17:12.043]  Very positive news.
[00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:13.343]  Very exciting news.
[00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:26.840]  All right, let me now just mention to you some of the news we're going to be covering, and then I'm going to go ahead and open the phones up so that we do things a little bit different today.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:40.445]  I'll take calls in the next 40 minutes of this hour, then starting in the next hour, because I want to compose myself and really think about it and focus, I'm going to break down the full spectrum of what's happening in the Middle East and now spreading even into Central Asia.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.044]  We're going to get into the economy, big developments there.
[00:17:44.044 --> 00:17:49.012]  We're going to get into a lot of big political developments, also the Mexican troops.
[00:17:50.134 --> 00:17:55.577]  Running checkpoints inside the United States again at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:55.577 --> 00:18:14.366]  They've also indicted Berlusconi, which I'm not saying the guy's an angel, looks like a mobster to me, but Tarpley has said that he's actually kind of double-crossing the globalist and has predicted a year ago, before the 17-year-old sex scandal even started raising its head with a 17-year-old model,
[00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:21.096]  That they're going to try to destroy the 74-year-old billionaire.
[00:18:21.096 --> 00:18:25.000]  So, you notice all of a sudden, things are happening fast.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.706]  You notice all of a sudden, oh, Hosni Mubarak ran to Israel where he'd be safe, quote.
[00:18:31.706 --> 00:18:34.529]  And oh, now they're saying he did have that stroke.
[00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:35.370]  Bye-bye!
[00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:40.414]  A day after he's deposed and gets to Israel where he's safe.
[00:18:41.448 --> 00:18:42.791]  What a fool.
[00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:43.393]  What a fool.
[00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:47.783]  He should have hightailed it as fast as he could to Iran.
[00:18:47.783 --> 00:18:49.246]  Oh, but see, he was big enemies with Iran.
[00:18:51.186 --> 00:18:53.587]  Of course, they probably wouldn't even have took him.
[00:18:53.587 --> 00:18:55.148]  Ah, what an idiot.
[00:18:55.148 --> 00:18:56.569]  What an absolute idiot.
[00:18:56.569 --> 00:18:58.050]  And they're grabbing all his assets.
[00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:05.635]  This is a guy who served them in pure evil for 30 years, and you see how the globalists repay their dark servants.
[00:19:05.635 --> 00:19:12.859]  This ringwraith of Sauron, Hazi Mubarak, and they're now replacing him and admitting, oh, the military's still gonna run things.
[00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:13.560]  This is your freedom.
[00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:18.692]  Because he was a rotten apple.
[00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:22.593]  He'd been on the vine, he'd been on the tree for 30 years, got rotten.
[00:19:22.593 --> 00:19:25.634]  And so they've now replaced him with a little green fresh apple.
[00:19:25.634 --> 00:19:28.855]  And go back to sleep now, the torture will accelerate actually.
[00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:32.416]  Because he had balked at attacking Iran, being part of that coalition.
[00:19:32.416 --> 00:19:38.297]  And so, well, he's now had a stroke, and convenient, and don't worry, the good guys are in control.
[00:19:38.297 --> 00:19:41.198]  They're taking your pension funds right now, but they're in control.
[00:19:42.654 --> 00:19:42.734]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:42.734 --> 00:19:42.794]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:42.794 --> 00:19:44.335]  Your calls on all these issues straight ahead.
[00:19:44.335 --> 00:19:44.596]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:44.596 --> 00:19:47.378]  We're engaged in an info war, awakening the planet, and we are winning!
[00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.998]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[00:20:03.998 --> 00:20:11.846]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:16.390]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.831]  It is glutathione.
[00:20:17.831 --> 00:20:21.915]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[00:20:21.915 --> 00:20:25.279]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:31.685]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[00:20:31.685 --> 00:20:38.933]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:38.933 --> 00:20:43.758]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.

[00:21:00.077 --> 00:21:08.246]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:10.808]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:21:10.808 --> 00:21:16.214]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:21:16.214 --> 00:21:19.157]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:21:19.157 --> 00:21:20.158]  The crazy part is,
[00:21:20.418 --> 00:21:21.478]  He's usually right.
[00:21:21.478 --> 00:21:27.760]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.161]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:21:31.161 --> 00:21:36.982]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:21:36.982 --> 00:21:38.623]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:21:38.623 --> 00:21:39.943]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:21:39.943 --> 00:21:42.604]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:21:42.604 --> 00:21:44.024]  He explains everything you need to know.

[00:23:08.646 --> 00:23:09.946]  My name is Crystal.
[00:23:09.946 --> 00:23:12.887]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:23:12.887 --> 00:23:16.849]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:23:16.849 --> 00:23:20.830]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.831]  What did Crystal do?
[00:23:21.831 --> 00:23:25.775]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:23:25.775 --> 00:23:32.203]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:35.767]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:24:05.706 --> 00:24:26.640]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
[00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:31.728]  Okay, let's go ahead and go straight to your phone calls.
[00:24:31.728 --> 00:24:37.812]  Let's talk to Michael in Florida, then Ryan, John, Tim, George, and others.
[00:24:37.812 --> 00:24:39.914]  Michael, you're on the air.
[00:24:39.914 --> 00:24:41.235]  Hey, Alex.
[00:24:41.235 --> 00:24:44.137]  Hey, buddy.
[00:24:44.137 --> 00:24:52.143]  I wanted to talk about accepting technology like we do in the society, like the cell phones and stuff, and how they had a trend
[00:24:52.842 --> 00:24:59.170]  Um, like 10 years ago of blaming movies, video games, and music for the violence in the society.
[00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:11.566]  It's like they're always scapegoating things, but yet they okay television shows like that have like themes of racism and homosexuality, like The Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park.
[00:25:11.826 --> 00:25:29.978]  Well, regardless of what you think of those issues you mentioned, there's no doubt if you watch mainline TV, it's anti-traditional family, and it's there to basically train people who imitate what they see on television to follow things that will basically damage civilization.
[00:25:29.978 --> 00:25:38.184]  And the globalists want people isolated and by themselves so that the state can basically use them and then absorb them.
[00:25:38.184 --> 00:25:41.766]  So yes, there's no doubt there's a destructive message on television.
[00:25:42.987 --> 00:25:49.510]  I'd like to sue them for that because it seems like what they're doing is they don't want us to survive.
[00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.511]  They don't want us to grow our own food.
[00:25:50.511 --> 00:26:00.256]  But it's very dangerous because if you start suing The Globalist for messages in TV then they will allow that to happen but then set a precedent to ban all free speech.
[00:26:00.256 --> 00:26:01.777]  The answer is don't watch it.
[00:26:02.777 --> 00:26:10.884]  Or analyze it and point it out to people and build our own alternative media that challenges their system and gives people an alternative.
[00:26:10.884 --> 00:26:12.065]  And so that's happening.
[00:26:12.065 --> 00:26:20.892]  So you got one group of people that are even more dumbed down, more in the grip of the New World Order, and then a huge group waking up getting more and more out of the grip of the New World Order.
[00:26:22.227 --> 00:26:22.547]  I think so.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:47.541]  Make a bridge between ages of the young to the old to make these simple brainwashing messages easy to get.
[00:26:47.541 --> 00:26:53.942]  Listen, I agree with you, Michael, and the media is getting more and more dumbed down, and it's a feedback loop.
[00:26:53.942 --> 00:26:55.603]  I appreciate your call.
[00:26:55.603 --> 00:27:01.924]  It must have been six, seven years ago I saw an excellent frontline piece on PBS about the feedback loop.
[00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:09.225]  I forget the exact name of the show, but it, you know, the argument by mainstream media has been, we're dumbing it down because that's what people want.
[00:27:10.117 --> 00:27:18.226]  But really it's what they feed in is then what they get back and then it does dumb people down and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:27:18.226 --> 00:27:21.270]  And there is that agenda and people should be conscious and aware of that.
[00:27:22.912 --> 00:27:37.243]  But with this radio show, we can use pop examples, or mainstream cultural examples, and then bring that issue in so that when the general public's listening, we can then illustrate things for them in a way that they understand.
[00:27:37.243 --> 00:27:39.124]  You know, it's a language they understand.
[00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:44.348]  So we can talk about those dumbed-down issues, but then use it as a bridge into real issues.
[00:27:44.348 --> 00:27:46.730]  Brian in Michigan, you're on the air.
[00:27:47.796 --> 00:28:05.972]  Hi Alex, the Donald Trump comment at CPAC really irritates me, because you could also take it to mean another thing, saying that they've already got the nomination fixed, and they know it's not going to be Ron Paul, and that's what they mean by Ron Paul's got zero chance of winning.
[00:28:06.192 --> 00:28:17.117]  Well, also, Trump really may run now, and he understands that he's going to try to take the place of Ron Paul as some outsider maverick, so he's really worried about Ron Paul.
[00:28:17.117 --> 00:28:23.400]  The fact that he attacked Ron Paul and said he can't win shows that Ron Paul is now becoming the frontrunner.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:31.704]  He's neck-to-neck, nose-to-nose, you know, coming around the final bend here going into the election with his...
[00:28:34.686 --> 00:28:54.741]  Okay, but let's say, I mean, the Republicans, Ron Paul won straw poll after straw poll the last couple years or so, so clearly a lot of Republican voters are supporting him.
[00:28:54.741 --> 00:29:00.926]  If he doesn't, if they steal it, are the Republican voters still going to vote for the Republican nominee?
[00:29:01.884 --> 00:29:05.785]  Uh, because I don't subscribe to the lesser of two evils theory.
[00:29:05.785 --> 00:29:11.867]  Um, and just so they could, you know, defeat, uh, Barry Satoro.
[00:29:11.867 --> 00:29:14.928]  Uh, that's what I'm wondering.
[00:29:14.928 --> 00:29:15.648]  So what are you saying?
[00:29:15.648 --> 00:29:18.289]  Are you saying you're not going to vote for Ron Paul if he runs as a Republican?
[00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:27.336]  No, what I'm saying is if Ron Paul doesn't win the nomination, I'm gonna write a minute on the blank line as a write-in.
[00:29:27.336 --> 00:29:28.997]  Well sure, I mean, look, look.
[00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:32.580]  If it's not Ron Paul, every other major candidate's a globalist.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.281]  That's the bottom line.
[00:29:34.281 --> 00:29:40.165]  And so you can just forget the presidential election if Ron Paul isn't involved in it.
[00:29:40.165 --> 00:29:44.988]  But we win just by him being in those debates and putting real issues in.
[00:29:44.988 --> 00:29:46.769]  Look what happened three and a half years ago.
[00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:48.110]  I mean, how big that was.
[00:29:50.697 --> 00:29:54.646]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:57.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:04.828]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.828 --> 00:30:05.748]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.748 --> 00:30:09.171]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.171 --> 00:30:10.031]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:14.914]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.914 --> 00:30:15.675]  It's true.
[00:30:15.675 --> 00:30:20.538]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.538 --> 00:30:21.358]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.358 --> 00:30:24.941]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:28.643]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.843 --> 00:30:29.644]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.644 --> 00:30:32.407]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.407 --> 00:30:36.091]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.091 --> 00:30:36.891]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.891 --> 00:30:41.036]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.036 --> 00:30:45.801]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:50.244]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:52.026]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.026 --> 00:30:54.288]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:31:00.053 --> 00:31:03.876]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[00:31:03.876 --> 00:31:08.159]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:12.863]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:31:12.863 --> 00:31:14.725]  I'm looking for a factory
[00:31:15.545 --> 00:31:16.986]  We're American and be proud.
[00:31:16.986 --> 00:31:20.749]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:49.847]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:32:00.143 --> 00:32:03.726]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.726 --> 00:32:05.027]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:05.027 --> 00:32:09.431]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:09.431 --> 00:32:15.377]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:15.377 --> 00:32:17.518]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:20.201]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:27.045]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:29.246]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:29.246 --> 00:32:34.589]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:34.589 --> 00:32:39.871]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:32:39.871 --> 00:32:45.254]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:32:45.254 --> 00:32:48.196]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[00:32:51.439 --> 00:32:52.439]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:33:19.822 --> 00:33:21.523]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:21.523 --> 00:33:22.163]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:22.163 --> 00:33:24.023]  Central, we are here live.
[00:33:24.023 --> 00:33:28.544]  I'm taking your phone calls for the rest of this hour, then I'm going to plunge into news in the next hour.
[00:33:28.544 --> 00:33:31.725]  Ann Webster-Tarpley is joining us on what's happening in the Middle East.
[00:33:31.725 --> 00:33:36.906]  This affects us all, obviously, because the globalists are destabilizing it.
[00:33:36.906 --> 00:33:38.806]  The question is why.
[00:33:38.806 --> 00:33:41.547]  But right now, let's go to John in Texas.
[00:33:41.547 --> 00:33:42.527]  John, you're on the air.
[00:33:42.527 --> 00:33:44.448]  Hi, Alex.
[00:33:44.448 --> 00:33:44.748]  Hey, buddy.
[00:33:46.994 --> 00:33:52.839]  Exchanging McBarrick for a military junta don't seem like much of an improvement to me.
[00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:56.062]  But do you think the military will give up control to a civilian leadership?
[00:33:56.062 --> 00:34:00.625]  Or do you think they'll crack down like they did at Tiananmen Square and seize control completely?
[00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:06.210]  Well, the people that run our government, when they have their druthers, always put military juntas or dictatorships in.
[00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.592]  And Mubarak just wasn't following orders.
[00:34:08.592 --> 00:34:09.693]  He wasn't getting behind.
[00:34:09.693 --> 00:34:10.774]  This is on record.
[00:34:10.774 --> 00:34:11.875]  In the last year,
[00:34:13.976 --> 00:34:23.301]  Supporting an attack on Iran and so the globalists are getting their ducks in a row for that attack on Iran That's now back on the front burner.
[00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:34.186]  And so of course, I mean our so-called government run by the foreign banks basically trained the entire Egyptian military and so That's all that's happening here.
[00:34:34.186 --> 00:34:35.707]  Now is they've gotten rid of Mubarak.
[00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:39.209]  He went to Israel thinking he was safe He's magically had the stroke, of course
[00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:40.371]  I think so.
[00:34:58.152 --> 00:35:07.715]  I know they're like, Friday night and Saturday I was watching the news, and Anderson Cooper's like, incredible democracy, freedom, this is what it looks like, let's cut to Egypt!
[00:35:07.715 --> 00:35:26.060]  And now it's spreading around the rest of the Middle East, and they don't want stable dictatorships, that was the old phase, now they want unstable situations, so there's a pretext to not just continue, but expand the military presence there that's bankrupting the American taxpayer.
[00:35:26.923 --> 00:35:31.539]  You think, would you think that they will crack down, that there's a chance to get cracked down like they did in China?
[00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:33.142]  I don't know.
[00:36:00.689 --> 00:36:10.894]  I mean, these revolutions are spreading, but are they going to lead to an attack on Iran in World War III, or is the pot going to settle down and stay even?
[00:36:10.894 --> 00:36:13.955]  I don't know.
[00:36:13.955 --> 00:36:14.956]  Well said.
[00:36:14.956 --> 00:36:15.996]  We'll continue to break it down.
[00:36:15.996 --> 00:36:18.397]  I've got all the details coming up next hour.
[00:36:18.397 --> 00:36:20.678]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Michigan.
[00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.559]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:36:22.559 --> 00:36:23.620]  I'm in Washington, actually.
[00:36:25.236 --> 00:36:27.000]  Yeah, but how was your weekend, Alex?
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.336]  I appreciate your effort, and I just had a quick suggestion as far as the V for Victory campaign, which I've attempted to do in Seattle.
[00:36:34.316 --> 00:36:43.439]  Um, maybe possibly a Bill of Rights, Constitution, or Declaration of Independence that we fill out and send in to our congressmen, our governors, our mayors.
[00:36:43.439 --> 00:36:48.460]  Anything that voices the opinion of a population towards the people that we elect and employ.
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.081]  Not necessarily a hands-on, like we vote every two years and that's it.
[00:36:52.081 --> 00:37:00.764]  Necessarily, we give them an exact summary of why we think the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is imperative for our existence as free humanity.
[00:37:01.311 --> 00:37:12.518]  Well, I mean, the globalists know why we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution, and it's their enemy, because it binds them from setting up the type of oppressive civilization they're designing.
[00:37:12.518 --> 00:37:20.964]  But look, the V campaign is whatever you want to make it, and whatever ideas you've got, turning loose the power of individual thought and action.
[00:37:20.964 --> 00:37:29.850]  And separately, we have the answer to 1984, the 1776 contest, where people produce animations, protest videos,
[00:37:31.912 --> 00:37:32.572]  We're good to go.
[00:37:47.062 --> 00:37:56.770]  When we go out and hang up flyers, when we go out and have demonstrations, where it's not just at Washington, D.C., and then the media ignores it, but where you do it locally.
[00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:07.498]  See, instead of just focusing on the federal government, we start focusing on our cities, our counties, our states, and start building our liberty muscles by going out and taking action.
[00:38:07.498 --> 00:38:11.861]  And now we've had quite a few TV stations, newspapers are starting to pick up on the
[00:38:12.862 --> 00:38:23.089]  V for Victory campaign and then that creates kind of an amplifying effect and it really just illustrates the power of simple flyers being hung up.
[00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:42.462]  So even if the globalists ever try to shut down the internet as we know it, people now will understand they can post flyers in the dead of night with different messages and get a local buzz going because it's so uncommon to have people engaged in grassroots political operations outside of an election that it really grabs people's attention.
[00:38:43.513 --> 00:38:49.997]  Yes, there are a few people as we're hanging them that were interested, but unfortunately, the next day they were all down.
[00:38:49.997 --> 00:39:01.483]  But what you do is, listen, liberty belongs to who wants it the worst, Tim, in Washington, I believe you said, and so what you do is you keep doing it.
[00:39:01.483 --> 00:39:03.084]  You get more aggressive.
[00:39:03.084 --> 00:39:04.865]  They're pulling them down.
[00:39:04.865 --> 00:39:12.490]  If you put one up about a swap meet coming up, or a garage sale, or a bake sale, or a soccer game, they'd be up there in a month.
[00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.951]  It's because it is a message of liberty.
[00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:16.372]  Somebody doesn't like it.
[00:39:16.372 --> 00:39:18.413]  It shows you how effective you are.
[00:39:18.413 --> 00:39:20.354]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:39:20.354 --> 00:39:29.199]  Well, no, I was just remarking that they would probably stand up or be on the board for months or years, depending on who's maintaining it.
[00:39:29.199 --> 00:39:36.703]  Yeah, I was just thinking that maybe if we were able to summarize our thoughts and then mail it in to our elected leaders that
[00:39:37.163 --> 00:39:48.547]  It would have a more chilling effect to them to realize that there is a population out there that still wants to remain free, does not want to become fascist, and ultimately wants to live a life of freedom.
[00:39:48.547 --> 00:39:59.430]  And I think that if we reminded the population, if they had a chance to summarize their thoughts on the Constitution and what exactly it means, that they would have a better understanding of what is in store for them if they don't.
[00:40:00.936 --> 00:40:01.897]  Well said again.
[00:40:01.897 --> 00:40:03.038]  Great points, Tim.
[00:40:03.038 --> 00:40:04.599]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:05.480]  George, you're on the air.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.202]  Hi, Alex.
[00:40:08.202 --> 00:40:20.352]  I was thinking that it might be another way of putting a goosing of these politicians is maybe have a survey on various issues, especially for somebody like Michelle Bachman and something.
[00:40:20.352 --> 00:40:28.199]  Have all the people go on the internet and put in their top 10 or top 100, whatever they want to put in.
[00:40:28.832 --> 00:40:40.357]  On why they should renew the Patriot Act, why they shouldn't do various things that are unconstitutional, and so it should never be renewed again.
[00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:56.405]  Or possibly, you know, sending these surveys results to people like Michelle or Peter King, the guy who wants to make it totally legal to think on your neighbors.
[00:40:56.405 --> 00:40:56.925]  What do you think?
[00:40:58.396 --> 00:40:58.736]  I don't know.
[00:40:58.736 --> 00:41:01.457]  I mean, elaborate on that.
[00:41:01.457 --> 00:41:11.962]  Well, for example, I mean, if people had a little survey on one of your web divisions and say, look, what are all the reasons why you wouldn't want to have the Patriot Act renewed again?
[00:41:11.962 --> 00:41:20.945]  For example, hey, it makes it illegal to have gold and silver as a currency if they take down the system.
[00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:23.906]  That it abridges every right that you have.
[00:41:23.906 --> 00:41:27.188]  You can be basically taken off the street and nobody
[00:41:28.381 --> 00:41:37.167]  Are you saying I should enumerate the types of freedoms that it savagely attacks?
[00:41:37.167 --> 00:41:37.507]  No, no, no.
[00:41:37.507 --> 00:41:42.650]  Let us enumerate it for you and then you basically give whatever the survey was, for example.
[00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:47.453]  Yeah, you could enumerate it and give what do you think the top thing and have people add to it.
[00:41:47.453 --> 00:41:55.458]  And then when it gets, say, 5,000 people say that this is number one, this is number two, why are we renewing the Patriot Act?
[00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:57.539]  Look at how many, look at the survey results.
[00:41:58.359 --> 00:42:02.561]  You know, it gives further power to whatever those particular reasons.
[00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:06.443]  Why would she would never want to renew this Patriot Act?
[00:42:06.443 --> 00:42:10.985]  Well, we know the Patriot Act is very unconstitutional and extremely unpopular.
[00:42:10.985 --> 00:42:11.545]  Good points.
[00:42:11.545 --> 00:42:12.706]  Thank you, George.
[00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:14.347]  Let's talk to Adam in Tennessee.
[00:42:14.347 --> 00:42:16.328]  Adam, welcome.
[00:42:16.328 --> 00:42:17.468]  Hi, Alex.
[00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:27.633]  I just, first off, want to thank you a lot for sticking your neck out there every day and doing what you do and for backing everything up with verifiable
[00:42:28.386 --> 00:42:47.114]  Uh, stuff from the mainstream that really, uh, helps drive the point home and, uh, gets the people who would call you a kook or whatever looking at the news stations that they go home and turn on every night and look at anyway and seeing that it's actually out there like that.
[00:42:47.114 --> 00:42:49.916]  Um, I just wanted to say a couple of things.
[00:42:49.916 --> 00:42:54.418]  Uh, the V for Victory campaign, it really should be stressed.
[00:42:54.418 --> 00:42:57.259]  Uh, just like you said just a minute ago, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:42:58.169 --> 00:43:08.339]  That it's so unusual for people to be involved at the grassroots level on just a day-to-day basis.
[00:43:08.339 --> 00:43:14.264]  If there's not a campaign or something going on, it really does get people's attention.
[00:43:14.264 --> 00:43:14.825]  Exactly.
[00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:23.372]  People start thinking of political action as something that's only done seasonally, and then it's only the candidates the media tells you about that you focus on.
[00:43:24.013 --> 00:43:28.234]  Political action is about being informed when you're on the jury, the grand jury.
[00:43:28.234 --> 00:43:30.294]  It's about being involved in the school board.
[00:43:30.294 --> 00:43:33.355]  It's about being involved in the lawmaking at your city council.
[00:43:33.355 --> 00:43:36.156]  It's about knowing your state legislators.
[00:43:36.156 --> 00:43:38.116]  It's about talking to your neighbors.
[00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:40.337]  It's about being on the soapbox.
[00:43:40.337 --> 00:43:46.218]  I mean, you know, when this country was free, almost everybody went down to the county square if they had a problem and got on the soapbox.
[00:43:46.898 --> 00:43:52.682]  And, you know, people went in and demanded their sheriff behave properly if he was violating rights.
[00:43:52.682 --> 00:43:54.284]  And people were aggressive.
[00:43:54.284 --> 00:44:04.271]  They jealously defended liberty, knowing that it was the fount or the engine, the progenitor of everything that was good.
[00:44:04.271 --> 00:44:08.034]  And so this is really a rediscovery of freedom.
[00:44:08.034 --> 00:44:15.479]  As Thomas Jefferson said, educate the people generally in the systems of liberty and freedom, and tyranny will
[00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:17.401]  I don't know.
[00:44:33.284 --> 00:44:41.891]  I completely agree and I just have to say that it's really important, you know, people don't need to be chickens about it.
[00:44:41.891 --> 00:44:42.691]  It's really important.
[00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:51.779]  You call your senator and your representative and whatnot and register your support or your disagreement with a given thing.
[00:44:51.779 --> 00:44:52.840]  Tell them who you are.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.321]  Tell them your name.
[00:44:54.321 --> 00:44:57.103]  Make sure they know you're their constituent.
[00:44:57.103 --> 00:45:00.506]  You know, don't be afraid to go out on the street and be seen hanging up the flyers.
[00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:05.043]  Um, I've had people say, you know, well, the police are going to be after you over this.
[00:45:05.043 --> 00:45:06.063]  Well, you know what?
[00:45:06.063 --> 00:45:07.705]  That's the problem.
[00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:19.995]  And, um, that's, that's the whole reason that I'm out there doing it, you know, not to get them after me, but because they're after free speech and everything that we are supposed to stand for here.
[00:45:19.995 --> 00:45:20.576]  Well said.
[00:45:20.576 --> 00:45:21.517]  Appreciate the call.
[00:45:21.517 --> 00:45:23.398]  A lot of great calls today.
[00:45:23.398 --> 00:45:25.160]  Jesse in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:45:28.502 --> 00:45:29.503]  Hey, Jesse, welcome.
[00:45:29.503 --> 00:45:30.303]  How may I serve you?
[00:45:30.303 --> 00:45:31.825]  Welcome aboard.
[00:45:31.825 --> 00:45:32.525]  Oh, hey, Alex.
[00:45:32.525 --> 00:45:33.566]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:45:33.566 --> 00:45:41.332]  I just wanted to actually touch on the propaganda issue that one of your previous callers was commenting on.
[00:45:41.332 --> 00:45:43.773]  I just want to say I see it every day in my everyday life.
[00:45:43.773 --> 00:45:49.077]  I walk to the TV and I can point it out as soon as I walk to the computer.
[00:45:49.077 --> 00:45:53.621]  I mean, a lot of people think that it's made to make you dumbed down, which it is very true.
[00:45:53.621 --> 00:45:56.623]  But I think there's a lot more scientific
[00:45:57.592 --> 00:45:58.032]  I don't know.
[00:46:13.956 --> 00:46:27.480]  Well, I mean, people are sucked in to entertainment and hype and pablum and surface issues, and that becomes what they're experts on is Jersey Shore or the NFL.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.460]  And then they don't spend time with their children.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.121]  They're not informed about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:46:32.121 --> 00:46:33.902]  They're not informed about history.
[00:46:33.902 --> 00:46:41.884]  And so they don't recognize hardcore oppression and this iron curtain of tyranny that's descending on us.
[00:46:41.884 --> 00:46:42.404]  But remember,
[00:46:43.419 --> 00:46:45.902]  It's never a majority that defeats corruption.
[00:46:45.902 --> 00:46:52.810]  It's always a highly informed, highly motivated, agitated minority.
[00:46:52.810 --> 00:47:02.401]  And if it was 3% that started the Revolutionary War, 5% roughly that won it, against the greatest military in world history at that time, who'd never been defeated,
[00:47:04.557 --> 00:47:08.978]  And who a few years later went on to defeat Napoleon, of all people.
[00:47:08.978 --> 00:47:11.319]  You know, the British military.
[00:47:11.319 --> 00:47:15.561]  Then what can we do now with the info war?
[00:47:15.561 --> 00:47:19.922]  So we do get focused on trying to wake the zombies up, and a lot of them are waking up.
[00:47:19.922 --> 00:47:22.043]  Or even if they wake up, they're still so passive.
[00:47:22.043 --> 00:47:23.543]  They're still just spectators.
[00:47:23.543 --> 00:47:25.504]  They don't take action.
[00:47:25.504 --> 00:47:28.385]  It only takes a highly motivated minority to change history.
[00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:29.926]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[00:47:29.926 --> 00:47:32.047]  I wanted to comment on your earlier caller who
[00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:07.895]  Was commenting on the idea of the far right and like Donald Trump criticizing or coming out against or attacking Ron Paul.
[00:48:07.895 --> 00:48:18.486]  I personally welcome it because for me, I think enough people are awake now where that just energizes everybody when those people come out attacking him at this point.
[00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:21.715]  Well, absolutely.
[00:48:21.715 --> 00:48:25.842]  It shows that they're scared of him when they start saying he can't win, he can't win.
[00:48:25.842 --> 00:48:28.527]  I mean, back in 2007, 2008 and in the election, the media just said...
[00:48:32.165 --> 00:48:35.688]  We're going to ignore Ron Paul, but he really stood out at the debates.
[00:48:35.688 --> 00:48:44.136]  They tried to do these hoaxes where they would say, oh, he's been discredited and, you know, they'd freak out about the things he said, but he kept winning all of the phone polls and other polls.
[00:48:44.136 --> 00:48:47.019]  People kept saying they thought he was winning the debates.
[00:48:47.019 --> 00:48:53.605]  He calls them on the fraud that the majority of conservatives want war and want tyranny.
[00:48:53.605 --> 00:48:54.566]  Why does he keep winning?
[00:48:55.367 --> 00:48:58.750]  Last year, now this year, the coveted CPAC straw poll.
[00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.111]  Why is he now winning the scientific polls?
[00:49:01.111 --> 00:49:03.493]  He didn't do that in 2007, 2008.
[00:49:03.493 --> 00:49:05.234]  He won just the general polls.
[00:49:05.234 --> 00:49:06.856]  And so they're very scared of him.
[00:49:06.856 --> 00:49:11.459]  I only wish he was, you know, 5, 10 years younger, but he's in good shape.
[00:49:11.459 --> 00:49:15.943]  He's been a very pious person, exercises every day, hardly eats.
[00:49:15.943 --> 00:49:17.324]  He truly is dedicated.
[00:49:18.364 --> 00:49:22.386]  I mean, he is founding father material.
[00:49:22.386 --> 00:49:25.287]  And that's why people demonize him.
[00:49:25.287 --> 00:49:27.408]  They demonize him from the mainstream media perspective.
[00:49:27.408 --> 00:49:31.689]  They also have operatives in COINTELPRO that demonize him from the grassroots level.
[00:49:31.689 --> 00:49:36.151]  As Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are said, the mainstream media is discredited.
[00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:44.814]  So the establishment has to pose as alternative media to try to attack the rest of the alternative media to create dissension, classic COINTELPRO.
[00:49:44.814 --> 00:49:45.615]  That's not working.
[00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:46.295]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:49:47.287 --> 00:49:52.853]  Ron Paul only loses if he doesn't take the field.
[00:49:52.853 --> 00:49:58.780]  I mean, if he takes the field and is even defeated, resistance is victory.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.366]  Look how far he was able to lay all the real issues out three years ago in the campaign.
[00:50:04.844 --> 00:50:11.669]  And then into the election, but in the primaries, he was able to lay out all the issues and then people kind of said, what are these issues?
[00:50:11.669 --> 00:50:13.290]  They never heard them before, a lot of them.
[00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:30.062]  We've gone from three or four years ago, maybe 5% of the public knowing the Federal Reserve was private and that it's the real puppet, you know, master, to now 80, 85% or higher wanting to abolish it or audit it in Gallup polls.
[00:50:30.062 --> 00:50:34.205]  That's why Brzezinski's freaked out and said for the first time the public actually know who the controllers are.
[00:50:34.645 --> 00:50:37.108]  They're not just looking at the frontman.
[00:50:37.108 --> 00:50:38.790]  And so now he runs again.
[00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:39.431]  He's gonna run.
[00:50:39.431 --> 00:50:40.332]  I mean, it's common sense.
[00:50:40.332 --> 00:50:41.373]  He's smart.
[00:50:41.373 --> 00:50:43.936]  I'll guarantee you Ron Paul's gonna run, barring health problems.
[00:50:43.936 --> 00:50:44.757]  And that is an issue.
[00:50:44.757 --> 00:50:47.440]  They could do a Hazi Mubarak to him.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:47.820]  They could...
[00:50:49.565 --> 00:50:52.307]  I don't want to get into different things they can do to him, you can imagine.
[00:50:52.307 --> 00:50:54.248]  And he said on this show he knows he's in danger.
[00:50:54.248 --> 00:50:55.949]  So pray for Ron Paul.
[00:50:55.949 --> 00:50:58.091]  Great points, another great call, more calls straight ahead.
[00:50:58.091 --> 00:51:00.672]  Then I'm going to break down a lot of other key news.
[00:51:00.672 --> 00:51:01.973]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.973 --> 00:51:07.557]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.557 --> 00:51:12.580]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.863]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:15.863 --> 00:51:17.604]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:18.144 --> 00:51:23.369]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:51:30.476 --> 00:51:31.597]  And here's the best part.

[00:51:44.828 --> 00:51:48.271]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:50.032]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.481]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:52:01.481 --> 00:52:08.469]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:08.469 --> 00:52:11.031]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:11.031 --> 00:52:16.217]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:16.417 --> 00:52:19.378]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:19.378 --> 00:52:21.699]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:21.699 --> 00:52:27.980]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.381]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:37.203]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:37.203 --> 00:52:38.843]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:38.843 --> 00:52:40.164]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:40.164 --> 00:52:42.845]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:42.845 --> 00:52:44.245]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:52:44.525 --> 00:52:47.069]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:52:47.069 --> 00:52:51.636]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:52:51.636 --> 00:52:54.239]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:53:58.698 --> 00:54:01.741]  Federal agents!
[00:54:01.741 --> 00:54:03.743]  We are armed!
[00:54:03.743 --> 00:54:08.067]  Okay, we've got a lot of really important news to cover.
[00:54:08.067 --> 00:54:11.150]  Dealing with the situation in the Middle East, obviously.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.004]  Protests spread to Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:24.004 --> 00:54:27.949]  Britain looking into freezing assets of Hazem Mubarak and associates.
[00:54:27.949 --> 00:54:34.917]  Former Egyptian leader, as his residence in Israel, falls into coma after final speech.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:36.940]  Very good.
[00:54:54.161 --> 00:55:02.330]  But Charlie Sheen did a radio interview obviously on the Dan Patrick Show Monday.
[00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:08.497]  I was actually with Charlie when he was talking on the phone to the producer of the show over the weekend.
[00:55:09.699 --> 00:55:09.959]  I don't
[00:55:28.729 --> 00:55:36.135]  Charlie is a good friend of mine, and in the six years I've known him, I've never seen him drink, never seen him use drugs, and he's a truthful guy.
[00:55:36.135 --> 00:55:37.797]  He's honest about it.
[00:55:37.797 --> 00:55:48.666]  He's done none of them until about, I don't know, seven months ago, got back into the wrong lifestyle, started drinking and doing other things, and he's now completely clean.
[00:55:50.567 --> 00:55:51.127]  I don't think so.
[00:56:02.478 --> 00:56:05.361]  He's completely clean, and we need to pray for him.
[00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:14.632]  That's why I said we need to pray for him, because nobody's perfect, everybody has problems, and Charlie really is somebody that cares about liberty and freedom.
[00:56:14.632 --> 00:56:22.240]  His dad does, his brother does, his brothers, his mom, and he's a good guy, and I really pray that he can stay sober.
[00:56:23.902 --> 00:56:26.363]  Of course, in his last interview with Patrick, he joked around.
[00:56:26.363 --> 00:56:28.624]  I mean, that's what Charlie's doing.
[00:56:28.624 --> 00:56:31.985]  He's fighting this stuff with humor.
[00:56:31.985 --> 00:56:37.647]  And I've challenged Charlie, because he's told me basically the whole story, to set the record straight.
[00:56:37.647 --> 00:56:42.868]  Because about 90% of what you hear is just completely made up.
[00:56:42.868 --> 00:56:45.769]  Just completely made up.
[00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.950]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:48.650]  Until the future.
[00:56:53.456 --> 00:57:00.597]  We've got this clip of Dan Patrick's show, and it's made big national news, obviously.
[00:57:00.597 --> 00:57:08.619]  And the media, if you listen to the interview, clearly a lot of it, Charlie's joking around, he tries to have gallows humor about all that he's gone through.
[00:57:08.619 --> 00:57:16.060]  But, and the media spins that, no matter what Charlie says or does, the media tries to spin it.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.560]  But I don't judge people.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.861]  We were watching Apocalypse Now, there in his home theater.
[00:57:23.286 --> 00:57:35.599]  We love that line in it where Marlon Brando says to Charlie Sheen's dad, he's playing the part of the special forces captain, he says, you have a right to kill me, but you don't have a right to judge me.
[00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:38.061]  And that's what it comes down to at the end of the day.
[00:57:38.061 --> 00:57:40.164]  Charlie is such a big hearted guy.
[00:57:40.164 --> 00:57:42.826]  Everybody that knows him, he would give you the shirt off his back.
[00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:45.089]  I mean, you could say if you're his friend,
[00:57:47.115 --> 00:57:49.016]  He doesn't turn his back on his friends.
[00:57:49.016 --> 00:57:51.237]  And so I'm not turning my back on Charlie.
[00:57:51.237 --> 00:57:55.099]  But I appreciate all of you praying for him.
[00:57:55.099 --> 00:57:57.500]  And he appreciates that as well.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.301]  He does know about your prayers.
[00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:02.182]  And he's really fighting.
[00:58:02.182 --> 00:58:05.384]  I mean, he's really fighting.
[00:58:05.384 --> 00:58:08.845]  And most people in his position would be in a bed.
[00:58:08.845 --> 00:58:10.186]  And he's working out.
[00:58:11.496 --> 00:58:16.639]  Lifting weights and swimming and just trying to laugh and trying to fight through this.
[00:58:16.639 --> 00:58:18.280]  Two weeks.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:23.083]  Two weeks, no alcohol, no drugs, no nothing.
[00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:28.926]  And he's getting food in him and gaining weight and it's exciting to see and we need to pray for him.
[00:58:28.926 --> 00:58:32.729]  Maybe he can get another eight, nine years of being sober completely.
[00:58:32.729 --> 00:58:36.671]  All right, we'll be, or as he says, he doesn't like the word sober, clean.
[00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:38.332]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:58:43.024 --> 00:58:46.451]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:54.611 --> 00:58:55.871]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.871 --> 00:58:59.753]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.753 --> 00:59:02.213]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.213 --> 00:59:07.915]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.915 --> 00:59:14.577]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.577 --> 00:59:20.559]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.559 --> 00:59:24.240]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:29.022]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.022 --> 00:59:34.966]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.966 --> 00:59:38.527]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.527 --> 00:59:40.489]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.489 --> 00:59:41.629]  It's here.

[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:11.625]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:13.186]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.186 --> 01:00:17.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.368 --> 01:00:21.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.512 --> 01:00:29.733]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:29.733 --> 01:00:33.754]  I'm going to get into the latest developments in the Middle East.
[01:00:33.754 --> 01:00:36.854]  The economy, also the terrorists who train London bombers, was working for U.S.
[01:00:36.854 --> 01:00:38.455]  government.
[01:00:38.455 --> 01:00:45.117]  Panel finds FBI overstated science behind anthrax probe.
[01:00:45.117 --> 01:00:48.537]  Italy's Berlusconi indicted in prostitution probe.
[01:00:48.537 --> 01:00:50.118]  That is all coming up.
[01:00:50.118 --> 01:00:52.478]  The globalists are moving against their enemies right now.
[01:00:52.478 --> 01:00:54.339]  Don in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:00:54.339 --> 01:00:54.919]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.052]  Oh, thanks, Alex.
[01:00:57.052 --> 01:01:00.053]  It's a privilege to have you accept my call.
[01:01:00.053 --> 01:01:00.833]  No, it's good to have you.
[01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:01.853]  It's a privilege to have you call.
[01:01:01.853 --> 01:01:03.453]  What's on your mind?
[01:01:03.453 --> 01:01:04.134]  Thank you.
[01:01:04.134 --> 01:01:16.516]  Well, I didn't want to change topic, no, sir, but I am a subscriber to the Epoch Times, and I noticed there on the first page of yesterday, I got something in front of me, a reading again.
[01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:19.076]  I wanted to bring up something that's quite interesting.
[01:01:22.415 --> 01:01:23.396]  Apparently the U.S.
[01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:34.505]  government is looking at a standard for what is being put up into space and to create a partnership with responsible nations.
[01:01:34.505 --> 01:01:44.914]  You know, back in 1958, Eisenhower signed the Space Act, which according to them at that time, they thought they were, of course, rushing to the moon was Russia.
[01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:56.494]  But as the Epoch Times goes on to tell us, there's 22,000 man-made objects up there, and 1,100 of them are active satellites.
[01:01:56.494 --> 01:02:01.896]  So now there's 60 nations up there that have a presence in space.
[01:02:01.896 --> 01:02:15.101]  And this would be a monopoly for who could go off-world, and I am familiar with those moves to try to restrict private corporations, you name it, from getting into space, and kind of a world regulatory body to control that.
[01:02:16.317 --> 01:02:18.860]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:29.372]  China, I mean not to mention names here, playing with anti-satellite technologies with a military agenda using lenses to blind satellites.
[01:02:29.372 --> 01:02:35.559]  Well they've been shooting their own satellites out of the air and it turns out a few years ago the US threatened military action against them if they continued it.
[01:02:38.291 --> 01:02:39.332]  That's true, that's true.
[01:02:39.332 --> 01:02:49.039]  It's just like that huge submarine thing that went down there that basically disabled the Carnival cruise ship and they still haven't figured out what's wrong with that.
[01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:53.202]  Yep, that's what our inside sources say, EMP.
[01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:53.943]  Yes.
[01:02:53.943 --> 01:02:57.205]  You know, I worked for the power company for quite a while, 20 years.
[01:02:59.161 --> 01:03:08.208]  When I left due to bad surgeries that took place on my neck, they were working on anti-EMP devices for the power grid.
[01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:12.672]  So, there's quite a bit going on out there and I love your show, Alex.
[01:03:12.672 --> 01:03:20.578]  Don't want to take up much time, so I listen to you and enjoy your topics and all that is being done.
[01:03:20.578 --> 01:03:21.999]  Well, sir, I appreciate you.
[01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:25.002]  I mean, I think you just summed it up there.
[01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:27.364]  We got subs, launching,
[01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:32.756]  Polaris knockoffs off our coast.
[01:03:32.756 --> 01:03:37.157]  We've got all this open-air genetic engineering going on that's very dangerous.
[01:03:37.157 --> 01:03:41.017]  We've got all this jockeying towards war in the Middle East.
[01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:43.298]  We've got the dollar globally being devalued.
[01:03:43.298 --> 01:03:47.419]  The IMF and World Bank openly announcing they do want to move away from the dollar.
[01:03:47.419 --> 01:03:57.501]  France came out yesterday and said that they want to move away from the dollar along with China.
[01:03:59.031 --> 01:04:05.359]  And the general public wants to go on like business as usual.
[01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:09.644]  People want to play along with the fact that the economy's okay.
[01:04:09.644 --> 01:04:14.149]  But all the real economic indicators show it's going into the trash can.
[01:04:15.322 --> 01:04:18.824]  And my wife talks about something she's never experienced in the last year, and I see it.
[01:04:18.824 --> 01:04:26.488]  You'll be at Target or the grocery store, and you don't even have that much stuff, and they'll comment on what you're buying, and people in line are like, ooh, you're buying that, ooh.
[01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:29.850]  I mean, you can really see people are running out of money.
[01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:36.214]  And when they have a special, you know, on Black Friday, people trample each other and go crazy to get that discount.
[01:04:36.214 --> 01:04:40.597]  There's this worship of consumerism on top of it, and it's all a very, very,
[01:04:41.737 --> 01:04:43.139]  Dangerous.
[01:04:43.139 --> 01:04:44.281]  Dangerous situation.
[01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:49.467]  We're going to be getting into the news on the other side, then continuing with your phone calls.
[01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:53.993]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[01:04:53.993 --> 01:04:56.997]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:05:24.571 --> 01:05:31.077]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:05:31.077 --> 01:05:32.598]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:04.708]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:05.629]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:09.052]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:09.912]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.912 --> 01:06:14.796]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:15.556]  It's true.
[01:06:15.556 --> 01:06:20.420]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.241]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.241 --> 01:06:24.823]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.823 --> 01:06:28.526]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.726 --> 01:06:29.527]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:32.290]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:35.974]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.974 --> 01:06:36.755]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.755 --> 01:06:40.900]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.685]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.945 --> 01:06:50.127]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.127 --> 01:06:51.907]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:54.168]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:54.168 --> 01:06:56.509]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:00.245 --> 01:07:03.828]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:07:03.828 --> 01:07:05.129]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:05.129 --> 01:07:09.513]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:07:09.513 --> 01:07:15.459]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:07:15.459 --> 01:07:17.620]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.303]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:07:20.643 --> 01:07:27.149]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:07:27.149 --> 01:07:29.351]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:07:29.351 --> 01:07:34.696]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:07:34.696 --> 01:07:39.980]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:45.145]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:07:45.325 --> 01:07:48.528]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[01:07:54.334 --> 01:07:58.338]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:58.338 --> 01:08:05.965]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.965 --> 01:08:08.267]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:25.454]  All right, let me just go over an important smattering of news.
[01:08:25.454 --> 01:08:33.762]  We've got Webster Tarpley to break down the latest developments in the Middle East and the unrest spreading by design and what that portends for all of us.
[01:08:33.762 --> 01:08:36.564]  But here's an article by Kurt Nemo.
[01:08:36.564 --> 01:08:40.908]  G20 pushes global SDR and China's role.
[01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:44.471]  On Monday, French economic minister Christine
[01:08:45.712 --> 01:08:59.959]  Lagarde, if I'm pronouncing that right, said her country will work to realize a planned transition to a global financial system based on several international currencies, including the Euro and the Chinese Yuan.
[01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:18.323]  And the minister went on and said the G20 would want to undermine sovereignty of nations by moving away from national reserves into SDRs, just totally made-up fiat currency by the private banking houses, or special drawing rights issued by the International Monetary Fund.
[01:09:18.323 --> 01:09:23.207]  The G20's mid-February meeting in Paris will concentrate on, quote, reform,
[01:09:24.128 --> 01:09:24.328]  I think?
[01:09:39.173 --> 01:09:40.214]  And she continues,
[01:09:54.662 --> 01:10:08.579]  Excessively high value relative to other currencies are sowing the seeds of a renewed global financial instability, warned Robert C. Hockett, an expert on international finance and professor of law at Cornell University.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:18.324]  Hockett said the Chinese Yuan will likely be added to the dollar, euro, pound, and yen as one of the principal currency components of the Special Drawing Rights.
[01:10:18.324 --> 01:10:21.825]  And when we ship packages internationally via the U.S.
[01:10:21.825 --> 01:10:28.348]  Postal Service, it's already denominated at the international level in SDRs on the package.
[01:10:28.348 --> 01:10:33.911]  Going back three years ago, we had already received in the mail from the Texas Workforce Commission
[01:10:34.818 --> 01:10:55.954]  Under the federal government's control, monitoring our workers, our crew, that we were now to, when we filled out the forms monthly on unemployment and things like that, that we were to, that it would now be filed at the same address, but that it was now the North American Office of Labor, part of the North American Union.
[01:10:55.954 --> 01:11:01.779]  So, so we're already, we're already in this system.
[01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:09.953]  So I'm glad that Kurt has done this important article, G20 Pushes Globalists' SDR as China's Role.
[01:11:09.953 --> 01:11:22.917]  We're already going on to this global currency, and more and more it will set and denominate what the dollar, what the yen, what the yuan, what the euro, what different pesos, what the ruble is worth, and it's controlled by these private bankers.
[01:11:25.326 --> 01:11:29.687]  The French Finance Minister and the G20 are currently debating the role of China.
[01:11:29.687 --> 01:11:43.412]  She said France favors including the Renminbi, or one of the divisions of the Yuan, in the currencies that make up SDRs, even before the Chinese currency is fully convertible.
[01:11:43.412 --> 01:11:51.974]  In 2009, China's central bank governor said he wants a new globalist reserve currency to be controlled by International Monetary Fund.
[01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.355]  And a month ago, what did Hu Jintao say?
[01:11:54.795 --> 01:11:56.936]  He said the dollar will be destroyed.
[01:11:56.936 --> 01:11:58.876]  It will be phased out.
[01:11:58.876 --> 01:12:05.318]  And a lot of financial researchers and experts believe 2011 may be the year.
[01:12:05.318 --> 01:12:08.680]  And you think our economy's in the ditch right now.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.581]  Can you imagine what's going to happen under this system?
[01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:28.090]  And so, they've gone from a creeping baby step to a walk, now into a jog, and they're now signaling a sprint, phasing out the dollar.
[01:12:30.342 --> 01:12:32.383]  It could happen with a bang, it could happen with a whimper.
[01:12:32.383 --> 01:12:37.485]  Right now it's happening with a strategic, coordinated devaluation.
[01:12:37.485 --> 01:12:42.387]  On Monday, Japan acknowledged that China's economy is now the second largest due to China's furious growth.
[01:12:42.387 --> 01:12:45.769]  The country is expected to surpass the United States as the world's largest economy.
[01:12:46.569 --> 01:12:50.092]  China outpaced the United States in manufacturing this year.
[01:12:50.092 --> 01:12:50.593]  In 2009, the U.S.
[01:12:50.593 --> 01:12:56.638]  created 19.9% of world manufacturing output compared to 16.6% in China, with the U.S.
[01:12:56.638 --> 01:13:05.505]  staying ahead despite a steep fall in factory production due to the global recession, according to Global Insight, a U.S.-based economics consultancy.
[01:13:05.505 --> 01:13:10.229]  Yeah, here's the difference, and I've had top economists on to break this down, but I'll give you some layman boil down.
[01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:19.174]  For more than 15 years, the United States has completely cooked its manufacturing numbers and its employment numbers.
[01:13:19.174 --> 01:13:26.917]  China has a very realistic, really taken from the United States, gauge of manufacturing.
[01:13:26.917 --> 01:13:28.098]  It's got to be value-added.
[01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:38.856]  If they dump, say, flour into a can and sell it, they don't call that really, you know, that flour a manufactured good.
[01:13:38.856 --> 01:13:40.638]  Even though the United States would.
[01:13:40.638 --> 01:13:43.980]  But it gets worse.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:49.744]  And I get these tax so-called breaks on manufacturing.
[01:13:49.744 --> 01:13:57.749]  Basically, we get a manufacturing credit for sticking videotapes, DVDs, in a package and shipping it to you.
[01:13:59.265 --> 01:14:02.607]  And McDonald's, when they put a hamburger together.
[01:14:02.607 --> 01:14:17.376]  They fry the hamburger on the grill or on the hot top, and they put the cheese on it, and they throw it in the microwave, whatever they do, and they throw it in the package, in the bag, and give it to you out the window, that is considered manufacturing in the United States.
[01:14:17.376 --> 01:14:22.038]  So we've been surpassed by China a long time ago.
[01:14:22.038 --> 01:14:26.001]  They count the service economy really as manufacturing.
[01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:40.986]  If shoes get shipped in from China in bulk and then a regional subcontractor takes the shoes, makes sure the packaging isn't messed up, puts them in a new box, that's manufacturing.
[01:14:40.986 --> 01:14:41.966]  Of course, that's not really
[01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:45.549]  Manufacturing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:45.549 --> 01:14:48.892]  But Curtin Emo's story continues with all these quotes of what they're doing.
[01:14:48.892 --> 01:14:54.777]  The G20 is dedicated to transforming the IMF into a globalist version of the Federal Reserve.
[01:14:54.777 --> 01:14:58.581]  The authoritarian slave labor nation China plays an instrumental role.
[01:14:59.281 --> 01:15:07.486]  In this proposed transformation, during the recent G20 meetings, China worked closely with the United Nations to replace the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[01:15:07.486 --> 01:15:12.909]  China's central bank insists that the dollar's global role allowed the U.S.
[01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:17.452]  to borrow cheaply abroad, fueling the credit boom that led to the financial crisis.
[01:15:17.452 --> 01:15:18.933]  What's China complaining about?
[01:15:18.933 --> 01:15:25.537]  They get to take all those dollars they've got that they got in exchange for cheap slave goods and come back and buy farmland,
[01:15:26.377 --> 01:15:38.506]  Coal-bearing land, oil-bearing land, natural gas-bearing land, factories, media companies, positions in stock markets, owning the stock markets themselves.
[01:15:38.506 --> 01:15:40.007]  It's just incredible.
[01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:45.631]  You see all the global stock market mergers now happening, driven by British interest, U.S.
[01:15:45.631 --> 01:15:50.094]  interest, Chinese, Japanese, European Union interest, Israeli interest.
[01:15:50.094 --> 01:15:53.957]  The Arab interests are some of the biggest if you actually look at the consolidation of those
[01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:00.951]  Stock markets in the last six, seven years.
[01:16:00.951 --> 01:16:07.333]  I've been taken out of context when obviously Hollywood is predominantly Jewish dominated.
[01:16:07.333 --> 01:16:08.953]  No one denies that.
[01:16:08.953 --> 01:16:17.075]  I was pointing out out of the Fox News and AP article like three years ago that the biggest stock markets in the world were majority, the stock markets themselves,
[01:16:17.555 --> 01:16:18.015]  We're good to
[01:16:41.549 --> 01:16:43.910]  uh... and that that the globalists are going to steal that money.
[01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:45.791]  That's the point I was pointing out.
[01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:55.354]  Fox was admitting in an article that not only were they buying up the stock markets but that Fox uh... the biggest single owners in Fox, if you put them together, are Saudi Arabians.
[01:16:55.354 --> 01:17:05.918]  Rupert Murdoch has a deal where he can own a minority of Fox but in those deals he and his family still control Fox.
[01:17:05.918 --> 01:17:09.299]  But of course the COINTELPRO spun that that I was saying that uh...
[01:17:10.305 --> 01:17:10.665]  We're good to go.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.863]  That's why the globalists, this is economic warfare.
[01:17:29.863 --> 01:17:32.165]  That's why they want to overthrow Saudi Arabia.
[01:17:32.165 --> 01:17:33.827]  That's why they want to overthrow Egypt.
[01:17:33.827 --> 01:17:39.034]  That's why they want to overthrow even their client states because they have real wealth and real power.
[01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:43.699]  And the New World Order would rather bring down the House of Saudi Arabia.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:49.882]  The House of Saad, you know the country's named after that royal family, and steal their trillions of dollars.
[01:17:49.882 --> 01:18:05.108]  We're not talking about seven billion dollars that Haji Mubarak, that they're now basically chasing his bank accounts in England and in Switzerland, and he's now racing in a coma.
[01:18:05.108 --> 01:18:10.010]  But his handlers, his family, that's in the news today, are trying to get that money
[01:18:12.145 --> 01:18:13.606]  out of Europe.
[01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:16.349]  What message does this send?
[01:18:16.349 --> 01:18:20.732]  What message does this telegraph?
[01:18:20.732 --> 01:18:30.841]  What message does this put across to all of these dictators and these corrupt royal houses, these dynasties, that they have made these deals?
[01:18:30.841 --> 01:18:37.287]  In the case of the Saudis, it's a hundred year old plus deal now, to set up their country, to create its borders,
[01:18:38.424 --> 01:18:43.654]  To militarily back it and then to invest their money from the oil in the big banks.
[01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:48.953]  And now there's a move to double cross them and basically steal that money.
[01:18:48.953 --> 01:18:54.658]  The globalists cannot allow there to be any real wealth out there that they don't control.
[01:18:54.658 --> 01:19:00.662]  And so it's almost like if you're playing Risk, you know, the world domination board game, we're getting down to the end game.
[01:19:00.662 --> 01:19:12.631]  We're getting down, you've been playing Risk for 15 hours in college, and there's only two of you left now, basically on the board, and all the stops are being pulled out.
[01:19:12.631 --> 01:19:14.072]  There may have been alliances,
[01:19:14.873 --> 01:19:20.715]  Five, six hours ago in the game, but now we're entering the last hour of this current phase.
[01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:38.142]  And the globalists aren't just fighting with each other in consolidating wealth, they're also building the paramilitary domestic control grid forces because their main enemy aren't just each other and regional geopolitical blocks, their enemy is the individual sovereign person who is middle class and not dependent on them.
[01:19:38.142 --> 01:19:42.984]  The world is being transferred and turned into a prison planet.
[01:19:44.068 --> 01:19:48.450]  And so you're going to see the Arabs stabbed in the back by the globalists.
[01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.291]  You're going to see these nations overthrown one by one.
[01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:53.632]  We're going to get into that when Tarpley joins us.
[01:19:53.632 --> 01:19:59.415]  I want to shift gears, though, and get into Ron Paul saying he can beat the warmonger Obama and a lot more.
[01:20:00.976 --> 01:20:05.080]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:09.584]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.584 --> 01:20:15.750]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:18.172]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.172 --> 01:20:24.138]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.258 --> 01:20:27.660]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:29.541]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:31.722]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.722 --> 01:20:36.604]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.604 --> 01:20:37.405]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:37.405 --> 01:20:41.447]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:41.707 --> 01:20:46.512]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:46.512 --> 01:20:47.693]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:47.693 --> 01:20:48.394]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:01.664 --> 01:21:05.685]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.685 --> 01:21:08.926]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:08.926 --> 01:21:13.727]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:13.727 --> 01:21:20.109]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:22.330]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:24.030]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.811]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:26.371]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:41.795 --> 01:21:44.036]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.036 --> 01:21:46.177]  Right now in Washington D.C.
[01:21:46.177 --> 01:21:49.058]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.058 --> 01:21:58.181]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:21:59.992 --> 01:22:02.755]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:22:02.755 --> 01:22:04.797]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:04.797 --> 01:22:05.698]  debt crises.
[01:22:05.698 --> 01:22:06.740]  You heard me right.
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:09.202]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[01:22:09.202 --> 01:22:12.866]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:12.866 --> 01:22:19.734]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:20.254 --> 01:22:21.496]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:21.496 --> 01:22:28.684]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:28.684 --> 01:22:36.533]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:22:36.533 --> 01:22:40.238]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:46.345]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:22:46.345 --> 01:22:52.652]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:22:52.652 --> 01:22:55.075]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:22:55.075 --> 01:22:55.375]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.325 --> 01:23:04.627]  Becoming a modern smoker is now easier and more cost-effective, thanks to Lecig.

[01:24:40.794 --> 01:24:48.642]  Okay, continuing here with the news, my friends.
[01:24:48.642 --> 01:24:50.163]  Look at this report.
[01:24:50.163 --> 01:24:56.009]  And it dovetails with another report I have out of the Business Insider.
[01:24:56.009 --> 01:25:03.776]  Wisconsin National Guard preps for worker unrest after governor unveils emergency budgets.
[01:25:04.858 --> 01:25:13.063]  And it goes on, under Walker's plan, public employees would lose all of their collective bargaining rights, except a limited negotiation on wages.
[01:25:13.063 --> 01:25:19.247]  State workers would also have to contribute more to their pension and health care benefit plans, so that can be stolen.
[01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:24.190]  Unions erupted in outrage as they learned about Walker's proposal.
[01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:31.495]  The governor told Milwaukee Public Radio that he had briefed the Wisconsin National Guard to prepare them for any worker unrest.
[01:25:31.495 --> 01:25:32.235]  That's on NPR.
[01:25:34.036 --> 01:25:37.317]  Now, what have I told you this whole Homeland Security control grid's for?
[01:25:37.317 --> 01:25:42.598]  It isn't fighting men in caves or the Saudi Arabian terrorists the globalists run.
[01:25:42.598 --> 01:25:46.079]  It is for the American people.
[01:25:46.079 --> 01:25:50.000]  And people say, good, cut those government people's benefits.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.121]  They're lazy.
[01:25:51.121 --> 01:25:55.442]  Well, I'm all for making sensible cuts to government.
[01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:57.823]  But if you give $28 trillion and counting,
[01:26:00.845 --> 01:26:02.347]  We haven't gotten new numbers in a year.
[01:26:02.347 --> 01:26:03.769]  Now it's completely secret.
[01:26:03.769 --> 01:26:09.638]  The first year and a half of the banker bailout, it was 28 trill according to Bloomberg.
[01:26:09.638 --> 01:26:11.361]  They won't tell Congress where the money went.
[01:26:12.672 --> 01:26:18.395]  And now they're announcing they're taking private pension funds, government pension funds, moving towards all of this.
[01:26:18.395 --> 01:26:19.496]  And I've had The Economist on.
[01:26:19.496 --> 01:26:21.276]  They've broken down the common sense numbers.
[01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:25.919]  You could get rid of all welfare, all entitlements, all your pension funds.
[01:26:25.919 --> 01:26:27.400]  You could take your private pension funds.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:34.943]  You could give all the money in America to the bankers, and it wouldn't get rid of a fraction of the 1.5 quadrillion.
[01:26:34.943 --> 01:26:35.163]  1,500 trill.
[01:26:38.365 --> 01:26:38.625]  And that's
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.781]  Use against us.
[01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:06.563]  But they then loan people at 59.9% in some cases.
[01:27:06.563 --> 01:27:08.244]  I couldn't believe that last week when I saw it.
[01:27:08.244 --> 01:27:13.967]  CNN reported some credit card holders are now being charged 59.9% in the U.S.
[01:27:13.967 --> 01:27:17.229]  annual rate.
[01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:18.390]  59.9!
[01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:21.452]  Loan sharking's 25-30%.
[01:27:21.452 --> 01:27:28.936]  And so, they're like, we're gonna slash the government workers, we're gonna slash the police, every man for himself, but we're raising the taxes.
[01:27:28.936 --> 01:27:29.917]  Oh, and you've gotta
[01:27:30.984 --> 01:27:35.008]  Put more of your paycheck into the pension funds, which they take out the back door.
[01:27:35.008 --> 01:27:41.975]  The globalists run America like the mafia runs a factory when they take it over, or the mafia runs a bar when they take it over.
[01:27:41.975 --> 01:27:45.358]  For fraud to completely loot it.
[01:27:45.358 --> 01:27:53.426]  Folks, when the globalists 11 years ago got rid of Glass-Steagall, or I guess 11 and a half, almost 12 years ago now, 99, it also came out again, mainstream news.
[01:27:55.421 --> 01:28:04.406]  Much as I don't like Bloomberg, the gun-grabbing man, Bloomberg's actually hardcore, but others also covered it when they reported secret deals with Prudential and others.
[01:28:04.406 --> 01:28:17.953]  I keep going back to this just to people get their minds around what we're talking about, how serious these crooks are, that they went and signed a secret deal with Veterans Affairs to take the death benefits from World War II to current vets.
[01:28:17.953 --> 01:28:23.216]  So if you get killed and you paid money into that insurance policy, you just don't get it.
[01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:26.054]  I mean, that's brazen.
[01:28:26.054 --> 01:28:27.335]  That's hardcore.
[01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:29.275]  That's incredible.
[01:28:29.275 --> 01:28:31.256]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[01:28:31.256 --> 01:28:37.518]  So of course the National Guard, backed up by the Threat Fusion Centers and Homeland Security, of course they're there.
[01:28:37.518 --> 01:28:40.058]  They're there when they take your pension funds.
[01:28:40.058 --> 01:28:42.519]  They're there when they're going to take your farm or ranch.
[01:28:42.519 --> 01:28:45.720]  They're there when they draft your kids during this World War III situation.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.662]  They're there when you protest.
[01:28:47.662 --> 01:28:48.423]  They're there.
[01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.284]  They're there.
[01:28:49.284 --> 01:28:50.005]  It's criminal.
[01:28:50.005 --> 01:28:50.967]  It's illegitimate.
[01:28:50.967 --> 01:28:59.679]  Just like in a third world country, if their government's going to loot their population, they put a police state grid in place to make sure they can secure the gains.
[01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:02.943]  To make sure they can carry out the takeover, carry out the fraud.
[01:29:04.312 --> 01:29:22.220]  While the military drills to lock down cities, barricade cities, arrest people en masse, doing this live time drills, checkpoints in Tennessee, pulling people out of cars, you regular army, homeland security, governor says don't do it, they say we don't care, we're gonna go ahead and do it, that was last year, it was in Police State 4, Rise of FEMA.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:31.844]  While all of that is going on, it's just footnote in Texas newspapers, Watson has a big article on it, Mexican troops conduct vehicle searches on US soil,
[01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:37.112]  Our military's told not to fire back on them when they get shot at by the Mexican troops.
[01:29:37.112 --> 01:29:40.393]  The Mexican troops are now coming in 80 miles into Arizona.
[01:29:40.393 --> 01:29:43.334]  The feds have put up signs saying don't go down this highway.
[01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:46.956]  And they're now just setting up checkpoints robbing American citizens.
[01:29:46.956 --> 01:29:49.357]  Because Mexico's a client of the globalists.
[01:29:49.357 --> 01:29:50.698]  They're gonna use them as muscle.
[01:29:50.698 --> 01:29:52.098]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.098 --> 01:29:54.619]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.619 --> 01:29:57.321]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.666 --> 01:30:01.826]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:01.826 --> 01:30:08.768]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.768 --> 01:30:11.329]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.329 --> 01:30:16.690]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.690 --> 01:30:19.730]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:21.791]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.051 --> 01:30:28.296]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.296 --> 01:30:31.678]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.678 --> 01:30:37.462]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.462 --> 01:30:39.103]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.103 --> 01:30:40.404]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.404 --> 01:30:42.926]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.086 --> 01:30:47.289]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.289 --> 01:30:51.913]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:54.515]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:31:02.213 --> 01:31:06.174]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.174 --> 01:31:15.037]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.037 --> 01:31:19.678]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.678 --> 01:31:30.501]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.121 --> 01:31:40.650]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:46.075]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:46.075 --> 01:31:53.561]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.561 --> 01:31:56.324]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:05.498]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.498 --> 01:32:08.741]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.741 --> 01:32:13.906]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.906 --> 01:32:19.931]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.931 --> 01:32:22.174]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.714 --> 01:32:23.014]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:23.014 --> 01:32:23.514]  Bernanke?
[01:32:23.514 --> 01:32:24.195]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:24.195 --> 01:32:25.475]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.475 --> 01:32:27.717]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.604 --> 01:32:48.890]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:57.997]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:09.841 --> 01:33:11.642]  We are on the march.
[01:33:11.642 --> 01:33:14.805]  The empire is on the run.
[01:33:14.805 --> 01:33:25.092]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.092 --> 01:33:31.497]  Well, Dr. Tarbley, doctor of history, he's also an economist, joins us for the next 30 minutes.
[01:33:31.497 --> 01:33:37.701]  Then I'm going to continue with important news in your phone calls, especially getting into the economy in the third hour today.
[01:33:39.019 --> 01:33:47.599]  We're going to go to Webster Tarpley here in a moment to talk about just how serious the situation is in the Middle East as the globalists spread destabilization.
[01:33:49.248 --> 01:33:51.570]  I cannot stress the incredible times we're going into.
[01:33:51.570 --> 01:33:55.912]  This signifies the preparations for the attack on Iran.
[01:33:55.912 --> 01:34:00.515]  Before we go any further, I want to tell you about End of America, the number three dot com.
[01:34:00.515 --> 01:34:09.260]  Stansbury & Associates Investment Research is an independent investment research fund founded in 99 with subscribers in more than 100 different countries.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:16.385]  They recently created an eye-opening video that you can see at End of America, the number three dot com for free, detailing their biggest and most important prediction yet.

[01:35:01.224 --> 01:35:05.106]  I know that makes the Globalist mad, but sorry, that's just the way it is.
[01:35:05.106 --> 01:35:14.090]  And in closing, on the plug front, we have an amazing online video slash Patriot Apparel store at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:36:01.343 --> 01:36:10.329]  Now, shifting gears to Webster Griffin Tarpley, again, doctor of history, also an accomplished economist and author.
[01:36:10.329 --> 01:36:20.555]  He's written the unauthorized biography of Barack Hussein Obama and George Herbert Walker Bush, both seen as seminal research tomes for the roadmaps to understand these important globalist frontmen.
[01:36:20.555 --> 01:36:21.896]  Here's just some of the headlines.
[01:36:21.896 --> 01:36:23.777]  Protest spread to Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:24.497 --> 01:36:24.998]  No, we're good.
[01:36:40.431 --> 01:36:42.413]  Uh, counter-coup going on last Thursday.
[01:36:42.413 --> 01:36:45.417]  Tarpley said, uh, who knows if he'll step down.
[01:36:45.417 --> 01:36:46.558]  Or was it Wednesday?
[01:36:46.558 --> 01:36:50.142]  The CIA chief, Podetta, had said he will step down in the next two hours.
[01:36:50.142 --> 01:36:50.862]  He didn't step down.
[01:36:50.862 --> 01:36:52.684]  He came out and defiantly gave a speech.
[01:36:52.684 --> 01:36:57.289]  Then magically we now learn that he reportedly was flown to Israel.
[01:36:58.474 --> 01:37:02.176]  And had a stroke of some type.
[01:37:02.176 --> 01:37:05.658]  And then we heard he had the stroke in Egypt and was flown to Israel.
[01:37:05.658 --> 01:37:07.419]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:37:07.419 --> 01:37:11.381]  Classic type attempted assassination or drugging.
[01:37:11.381 --> 01:37:13.482]  We see this with Yasser Arafat.
[01:37:13.482 --> 01:37:16.184]  We see this with Ariel Sharon.
[01:37:16.184 --> 01:37:18.285]  We see this with Ronald Reagan after he was shot.
[01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:25.248]  Never really coming out of his days, except when they drug him up and roll him out to read off cue cards.
[01:37:25.248 --> 01:37:28.610]  And now they're trying to overthrow these other countries in the strategy of tension.
[01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:33.072]  And what does this say to the Saudi Arabian despots, the Royal House of Saad?
[01:37:33.072 --> 01:37:34.973]  They've got trillions, not seven billion.
[01:37:34.973 --> 01:37:41.576]  The globalists want to overthrow that, put extremists in, steal that money, and then use that destabilization as a pretext
[01:37:42.816 --> 01:37:46.359]  to expand the globalist presence in the Middle East.
[01:37:46.359 --> 01:37:48.560]  There's no doubt that Tarpley was right about all this.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.783]  Going back a year ago, he said, look for Berlusconi to be attacked with scandals.
[01:37:53.783 --> 01:37:55.004]  There were no scandals at the time.
[01:37:55.004 --> 01:37:55.725]  Boom!
[01:37:55.725 --> 01:37:59.407]  He's now been indicted in prostitution probe.
[01:37:59.407 --> 01:38:01.148]  That's out of the Associated Press.
[01:38:01.148 --> 01:38:02.729]  So the globalists are moving.
[01:38:02.729 --> 01:38:04.810]  And he said, look for him to move against Berlusconi.
[01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:06.752]  We're not saying Berlusconi's good.
[01:38:06.752 --> 01:38:08.813]  We're not saying Hosni Mubarak's good.
[01:38:08.813 --> 01:38:10.154]  Or King Fahd is good.
[01:38:10.794 --> 01:38:22.939]  The point is, is that the globalists are now turning on their cohorts, and this signals an unthawing of the geopolitical strategy and an acceleration of the Brzezinski-Kamikaze model.
[01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:25.900]  Do you concur with the breakdown of what I've put out, Webster?
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.161]  Yes, I think that's about right, Alex.
[01:38:28.161 --> 01:38:35.784]  What you're looking at now is a general assault on the modern nation-state by the empire
[01:38:36.551 --> 01:38:45.837]  And it's, uh, the goal of this is to simply wipe out entire nations, reduce them to chaos, reduce them to regional entities.
[01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:48.799]  We've seen, uh, Sudan in the middle of all this.
[01:38:48.799 --> 01:38:58.786]  Sudan carved into two parts by a process of secession which the British had been backing for decades, really for the best part of a hundred years.
[01:38:58.786 --> 01:39:01.728]  And I think you can expect that to come in another place.
[01:39:01.728 --> 01:39:05.250]  And we see the chain reaction, a breakdown the great game.
[01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.151]  What we're talking about here?
[01:39:07.211 --> 01:39:16.876]  Well, we're in a depression, and in the middle of this depression, the depression obviously poses a threat to the city of London and Wall Street.
[01:39:16.876 --> 01:39:23.760]  If the nation states declare Wall Street and the London banks bankrupt, then we can get out of the depression.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.900]  But what we're now seeing is
[01:39:26.221 --> 01:39:43.875]  The City of London and Wall Street unleashing their intelligence agencies and all their counter gangs and all their spooks across the world to destroy the nation states, to knock the nation states onto the defensive so that Wall Street and the City of London can trial Boba Rudd.
[01:39:44.836 --> 01:39:45.336]  We're good.
[01:40:15.016 --> 01:40:16.897]  Well, hold on before you point it out.
[01:40:16.897 --> 01:40:18.999]  They were able to now take down Egypt.
[01:40:18.999 --> 01:40:20.880]  The question is how is that going to end?
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.381]  But I want you to get into this.
[01:40:22.381 --> 01:40:34.248]  Hazi Mubarak reports in the Jerusalem Post, Haaretz, BBC, that he said, I'm not going to step down and then magically gets ill, has a stroke.
[01:40:34.248 --> 01:40:36.169]  I mean, this is very, very suspicious.
[01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:38.070]  Look, I think these are cover stories.
[01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:42.473]  The fact that we have is that by last Thursday evening,
[01:40:42.933 --> 01:40:47.457]  The CIA coup d'etat in Egypt was dead in the water.
[01:40:47.457 --> 01:40:49.378]  The push had stalled out.
[01:40:49.378 --> 01:40:51.060]  It was going nowhere.
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:41:01.228]  The generals loyal to the CIA, this Tantawi and Annan, had tried everything to get Mubarak out, and he would not leave.
[01:41:01.228 --> 01:41:06.512]  And of course, this gaggle of rich elitists there in that square, right?
[01:41:06.512 --> 01:41:11.416]  The Twitter and Facebook fans from the wealthy neighborhoods of Cairo North,
[01:41:11.796 --> 01:41:20.161]  These are a bad joke, even when they're supplemented by a certain amount of myrmidons from the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:41:20.161 --> 01:41:25.344]  And you've got the gaggles of Soros people, you've got the Google man in there running the whole thing.
[01:41:25.344 --> 01:41:27.785]  Right, so think of it now.
[01:41:27.785 --> 01:41:32.808]  On the morning of the Friday, the morning of the day that Mubarak finally was forced out,
[01:41:33.428 --> 01:41:39.954]  There was a meeting of the Supreme Military Council, and that came out with an endorsement of Mubarak.
[01:41:39.954 --> 01:41:41.696]  Take a look on the internet.
[01:41:41.696 --> 01:41:44.298]  Military Council Communique No.
[01:41:44.298 --> 01:41:44.838]  2.
[01:41:44.838 --> 01:41:51.865]  I found this in a number of, you know, the Times of India, the Deccan Times, the various places around the world.
[01:41:51.865 --> 01:41:52.625]  It's there.
[01:41:52.625 --> 01:41:54.407]  It was probably a Reuters wire.
[01:41:55.109 --> 01:42:00.754]  So, in that morning, Mubarak had the military in his pocket.
[01:42:00.754 --> 01:42:02.055]  What is it that changed it?
[01:42:02.055 --> 01:42:07.179]  Now, the obvious question is, what kinds of threats were delivered overnight?
[01:42:07.179 --> 01:42:15.146]  You can imagine Obama watching that speech by Mubarak on Thursday afternoon, where Mubarak was hanging tough.
[01:42:15.866 --> 01:42:20.867]  And then Obama chewing the carpet, going wild with rage.
[01:42:20.867 --> 01:42:29.210]  Similar scenes in Langley at the CIA, similar scenes at Foggy Bottom at the State Department, similar scenes in the National Security Council.
[01:42:29.210 --> 01:42:34.771]  They then obviously mobilized everything they had, because this is now a question of imperialism.
[01:42:34.771 --> 01:42:36.752]  Is there imperialism or not?
[01:42:36.752 --> 01:42:39.072]  Can you bring down Egypt or can you not?
[01:42:39.072 --> 01:42:44.314]  And if you can't, then the entire complexion of the Middle East changes.
[01:42:45.134 --> 01:42:47.255]  The obvious things, therefore, are threats, right?
[01:42:47.255 --> 01:43:03.538]  I don't know what threats, but we can assume some pretty heavy-duty threats to Mubarak, to his wife, Suzanne, to his son, Gamal, to his other son, Allah, I think his name is, or Allah, and then he's got a granddaughter, he's got property.
[01:43:03.538 --> 01:43:09.780]  The threat that I think makes the most sense is the threat to seize the Suez Canal, and I would take this absolutely
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:16.067]  Seriously, just to tick off the pieces that were on the board, the U.S.
[01:43:16.067 --> 01:43:20.493]  had a task force in the middle of the Suez Canal.
[01:43:20.493 --> 01:43:22.435]  The Suez Canal is a sea-level canal.
[01:43:22.435 --> 01:43:28.443]  In the middle of it, there's this thing called the Great Bitter Lake with the city of Ismailia on the Egyptian side.
[01:43:29.142 --> 01:43:39.170]  Sitting in the Great Bitter Lake is the USS Kirosage with several thousand Marines and its main function is to deliver special forces commandos into situations.
[01:43:39.170 --> 01:43:43.253]  Now they said, of course, this is for the evacuation of U.S.
[01:43:43.253 --> 01:43:51.100]  nationals in case the situation gets ugly, but it could just as easily be the spearhead of something to take over the Suez Canal.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.381]  We also had on the
[01:43:53.021 --> 01:44:08.553]  On the 5th of February, I believe, a bomb exploded at the pipeline, which takes natural gas from Egypt, across the Sinai Peninsula, into Egypt, into Israel, and then into Jordan as well.
[01:44:08.553 --> 01:44:19.602]  And the Israelis then began saying, this is a definite threat to our national security, because we get a large proportion of our cooking gas and heating gas from this natural gas pipeline.
[01:44:21.994 --> 01:44:25.576]  A strike by the employees of the Suez Canal.
[01:44:25.576 --> 01:44:26.476]  Sit-down strike.
[01:44:26.476 --> 01:44:27.897]  They're not collecting the toll.
[01:44:27.897 --> 01:44:30.358]  Now, they're also not maintaining the canal.
[01:44:30.358 --> 01:44:37.060]  And the problem with the Suez Canal is the sides are always caving in, so you've got to have a constant process of keeping it open.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:41.622]  Remember that when the British and the French, with Israeli help in 1956,
[01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:52.068]  He tried to seize the Suez Canal back from Nasser of Egypt after he had nationalized it and brought it back to Egyptian control.
[01:44:52.068 --> 01:44:56.570]  One of their arguments was that the Egyptians are not capable of running the canal.
[01:44:56.570 --> 01:45:04.154]  We enlightened, educated Europeans are needed to do this, so we've got to go back to imperialism or they're going to mess up the canal.
[01:45:04.154 --> 01:45:12.498]  Then you have these reports coming out of Israel from the various Debka and Wynad and these kinds of sites.
[01:45:13.058 --> 01:45:23.727]  That the Hamas fighters had successfully infiltrated themselves out of Gaza and into this large area of the Sinai Peninsula.
[01:45:23.727 --> 01:45:25.709]  Take a look on the map and you'll see how big it is.
[01:45:25.709 --> 01:45:31.453]  But it's between the Suez Canal in the west and the Israeli border in the east.
[01:45:31.453 --> 01:45:33.515]  And, of course, the Gaza Strip is there, too.
[01:45:33.515 --> 01:45:41.482]  And the Israeli accounts then say it's not just Hamas fighters you've got there, but you've got Jaish-e-Islami, and that means al-Qaeda.
[01:45:42.022 --> 01:45:44.403]  Al-Qaeda in effect is at the Suez Canal.
[01:45:44.403 --> 01:45:53.925]  Now, imagine the headline, Obama orders Marines to seize Suez Canal to protect it from Al-Qaeda terrorists, right?
[01:45:53.925 --> 01:45:55.065]  It would be easy.
[01:45:55.065 --> 01:45:59.166]  One RPG fired at a tanker, and you would have the pretext.
[01:45:59.166 --> 01:46:04.367]  So, at a certain point you could say, Egypt is descending into chaos, therefore
[01:46:05.177 --> 01:46:05.598]  The U.S.
[01:46:05.598 --> 01:46:08.761]  has to seize the Suez Canal to keep it open.
[01:46:27.185 --> 01:46:29.307]  And are quietly being deployed.
[01:46:29.307 --> 01:46:36.131]  I separately talked to a Marine this weekend who's part of FAST.
[01:46:36.131 --> 01:46:41.755]  That's the USMC's Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team.
[01:46:41.755 --> 01:46:44.277]  FAST company entry.
[01:46:44.277 --> 01:46:50.261]  And they are preparing to be now sent to Egypt.
[01:46:50.261 --> 01:46:54.684]  So what you just talked about with Marines, that's already in Congress.
[01:46:54.684 --> 01:46:55.485]  That's already moving.
[01:46:56.826 --> 01:47:01.709]  Well, this is now open-ended because really now, at any time, the U.S.
[01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:04.051]  could declare, Egypt is in chaos.
[01:47:05.438 --> 01:47:15.901]  The, uh, 10% of world trade, 10% that goes through that one canal, uh, is in danger, and therefore we've got to go in to maintain order.
[01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:24.863]  Now, in 1956 it was the British and the French with commandos, the Israelis attacking overland, who knows what it would look like this time.
[01:47:24.863 --> 01:47:33.886]  But, uh, the goal of getting the Suez Canal, of course, is once you've got it, you find reasons why China can't be allowed to use it, because they're
[01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:35.955]  A threat.
[01:47:35.955 --> 01:47:42.678]  Therefore the entire Chinese commerce between China and Europe, a lot of that goes through the Suez Canal.
[01:47:42.678 --> 01:47:45.499]  Most of the high value stuff certainly does.
[01:47:45.499 --> 01:47:51.883]  You find reasons why the Chinese, the Iranians, and the Russians have to be kept out of the Suez Canal.
[01:47:51.883 --> 01:47:58.926]  But earlier you were pointing towards a globalist staged fake Al Qaeda event on the Suez.
[01:47:58.926 --> 01:48:00.127]  That is where the Marines
[01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:05.529]  And others are massing for the staged event.
[01:48:05.529 --> 01:48:09.612]  Explain to people who would be behind that and then what that will trigger.
[01:48:09.612 --> 01:48:14.674]  And now we see the globalists running the Muslim Brotherhood, trying to overthrow Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:14.674 --> 01:48:18.076]  I mean, clearly, this is one of the biggest moves we've seen pre-2003.
[01:48:19.932 --> 01:48:25.719]  Yes, it's essentially the idea that the imperialists have never given up on controlling the Suez Canal.
[01:48:25.719 --> 01:48:26.219]  It's obvious.
[01:48:26.219 --> 01:48:29.082]  These are the naval choke points of the world, right?
[01:48:29.082 --> 01:48:30.164]  The narrow seas.
[01:48:30.164 --> 01:48:36.971]  In British geopolitical or maritime doctrine, if you control the Straits of Hormuz, you control
[01:48:37.652 --> 01:48:41.595]  Twenty-five, thirty percent of the world's oil coming out of there.
[01:48:41.595 --> 01:48:48.639]  If you control the Suez Canal, you control eight to ten percent of world trade that goes through the Suez Canal.
[01:48:48.639 --> 01:48:59.646]  Similarly, if you control the Straits of Gibraltar and these other narrow seas, right, where the land masses come together, if you control those, then you're on your way to world supremacy.
[01:48:59.646 --> 01:49:01.948]  And again, the main issue today is how
[01:49:01.988 --> 01:49:03.750]  How do you keep the Chinese out?
[01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:05.372]  How do you keep the Russians out?
[01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.753]  How do you keep the Iranians out?
[01:49:06.753 --> 01:49:09.597]  But I think, above all, the Chinese.
[01:49:09.597 --> 01:49:16.565]  So it seems to me that that is one of the things that might have been told to Mubarak, is if you don't
[01:49:17.345 --> 01:49:21.386]  And Israel's been saying for two weeks they are prepared to go into Egypt right now.
[01:49:21.386 --> 01:49:24.667]  That's openly on their news stations, in their newspapers.
[01:49:24.667 --> 01:49:27.187]  They're getting the Israeli population ready for it.
[01:49:45.171 --> 01:49:56.798]  But they also say, however, that the Israelis, one of their arguments is that their Sinai front has been neglected for the 30 years now that the Camp David Treaty has been in effect.
[01:49:56.798 --> 01:50:03.122]  One of the effects of Camp David is that the Egyptian military presence in the Sinai Peninsula is radically reduced.
[01:50:03.722 --> 01:50:09.506]  And that's of course a reason they say that's why Hamas and Al-Qaeda can run wild in the Sinai.
[01:50:09.506 --> 01:50:19.313]  And so if they've lost in Lebanon three years ago, have a new front, and basically turn west, and so this allows that greater Israel.
[01:50:20.571 --> 01:50:21.772]  It's certainly a possibility.
[01:50:21.772 --> 01:50:27.635]  Again, I think the Suez Canal is the real prize, but there may be people who want the Sinai Peninsula as well.
[01:50:27.635 --> 01:50:37.001]  The things that I've seen, the Israelis are lamenting that they don't have their tank divisions ready for desert warfare of the type you'd have in the Sinai.
[01:50:37.001 --> 01:50:44.445]  They have their divisions ready for mountain warfare on the Lebanese or Syrian fronts, but not for the other fronts.
[01:50:44.445 --> 01:50:48.307]  So there are various stories floating around, but the general thrust is
[01:50:48.587 --> 01:50:49.987]  It's pretty clear, I think.
[01:50:49.987 --> 01:50:52.928]  There are designs on the Suez Canal.
[01:50:52.928 --> 01:51:00.990]  Let's talk about what this major chess move signifies and what the next moves are going to be.
[01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:02.290]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.290 --> 01:51:07.871]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.871 --> 01:51:12.892]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.892 --> 01:51:13.372]  It's true.
[01:51:13.372 --> 01:51:17.913]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.453 --> 01:51:23.678]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.678 --> 01:51:30.805]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.805 --> 01:51:31.926]  And here's the best part.

[01:54:09.955 --> 01:54:10.776]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:10.776 --> 01:54:13.257]  We're going to have Webster with us.
[01:54:13.257 --> 01:54:15.678]  Five minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:15.678 --> 01:54:22.841]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has written an article for Infowars.com saying, was this a real revolution in Egypt?
[01:54:22.841 --> 01:54:24.342]  About how they're just putting the military and
[01:54:24.702 --> 01:54:31.226]  Just new thugs in power, kind of like shark teeth, the old teeth of Mubarak are removed, new teeth roll forward.
[01:54:31.226 --> 01:54:33.168]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us.
[01:54:33.168 --> 01:54:41.533]  We'll also ask him about these big announcements and moves towards getting rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency, now being called for by the G20, by France, not just China.
[01:54:41.533 --> 01:54:53.280]  In fact, in the next segment, I'm going to ask Tarpley, who's an accomplished economist and had amazing predictive powers on what's happening, to give us his take on the world reserve currency status of the dollar.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:53.781]  But Webster,
[01:54:54.361 --> 01:54:58.623]  Finishing up on the Middle Eastern, North African situation.
[01:54:58.623 --> 01:55:00.183]  I was watching Anderson Cooper this weekend.
[01:55:00.183 --> 01:55:02.244]  They were saying, this is what democracy looks like.
[01:55:02.244 --> 01:55:03.205]  It's freedom.
[01:55:03.205 --> 01:55:07.747]  I mean, when you see these globalists pushing something, it's so disgusting what they're doing.
[01:55:07.747 --> 01:55:10.748]  And now it's spreading to Saudi Arabia, everywhere else.
[01:55:10.748 --> 01:55:14.709]  Just putting bookends on it.
[01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:16.730]  How's it going for the globalists?
[01:55:16.730 --> 01:55:17.671]  Where do you see it going?
[01:55:17.671 --> 01:55:18.491]  What does this signify?
[01:55:19.434 --> 01:55:35.677]  Well, the events in Egypt are a victory for the globalists and the imperialists, but at the same time at a certain cost, because it was very obviously a CIA coup announced by Leon Panetta in Washington, D.C., and obviously fomented by the U.S.
[01:55:35.677 --> 01:55:41.578]  government with every tool at their disposal, although there are some accounts that try to minimize that.
[01:55:41.578 --> 01:55:44.399]  What you now have is a military dictatorship.
[01:55:44.399 --> 01:55:45.659]  It's a military junta.
[01:55:46.765 --> 01:55:49.487]  The Constitution has been officially shredded.
[01:55:49.487 --> 01:55:50.968]  You're under martial law.
[01:55:50.968 --> 01:55:55.871]  It's a dictatorship for at least six months, and then they promise singing tomorrows.
[01:55:55.871 --> 01:55:57.912]  Their main goal now is strike-breaking.
[01:55:57.912 --> 01:56:05.096]  They want to prevent people from getting wage increases, which is the first thing that everybody wants now that Mubarak is gone.
[01:56:05.296 --> 01:56:05.416]  Right.
[01:56:05.416 --> 01:56:05.557]  Right.
[01:56:21.099 --> 01:56:25.082]  The big issue, I think we've mentioned this before, is this question of the U.S.
[01:56:25.082 --> 01:56:38.651]  nuclear umbrella and the thing that Hillary Clinton had tried to do in the summer of 2009 is to assemble this front of Arab Sunni states, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, the Gulf Cooperation Council,
[01:56:39.251 --> 01:56:41.912]  And the Israelis, locked into a single alliance.
[01:56:41.912 --> 01:56:45.154]  Now, for an Arab leader, this is simply untenable.
[01:56:45.154 --> 01:56:54.938]  You may remember the first Gulf War, how the Israelis had to stay out of it, because if the Israelis had come into it, all the Arabs would have left it through the other exit.
[01:56:54.938 --> 01:57:00.480]  But this was a way to bootleg that alliance in under the cover of a U.S.
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.841]  nuclear umbrella, so the U.S.
[01:57:02.841 --> 01:57:06.683]  would be protecting Israel, Egypt, Saudis, and Gulf states.
[01:57:07.243 --> 01:57:17.211]  Obviously lining them up to play them against Iran, Syria, the Shiites, the Hezbollah, the Hamas, the radical forces, whatever they are.
[01:57:17.211 --> 01:57:20.234]  And the big winner out of that would have been the U.S.
[01:57:20.234 --> 01:57:25.698]  And the fact is then that Mubarak said, no, I reject this, I will not do it.
[01:57:25.698 --> 01:57:28.901]  And his strong stand meant that the Saudis were also encouraged.
[01:57:29.201 --> 01:57:29.501]  I think so.
[01:57:46.622 --> 01:57:59.194]  Hezbollah and then lead to the destabilization and renewal of the civil war in Lebanon as a front where you could begin undermining Hezbollah and causing problems for Syria and for various people in Lebanon.
[01:57:59.194 --> 01:58:01.676]  Mubarak on record saying, no, I'm against this.
[01:58:01.676 --> 01:58:04.679]  The Iranians can play a positive role.
[01:58:04.679 --> 01:58:06.341]  So in many ways,
[01:58:06.861 --> 01:58:11.804]  He was a force opposing the crazy schemes that the U.S.
[01:58:11.804 --> 01:58:12.785]  was coming forward with.
[01:58:12.785 --> 01:58:18.028]  Remember also, Mubarak did not join in the attack on Iraq in 2003.
[01:58:18.028 --> 01:58:19.689]  He refused to send troops.
[01:58:19.689 --> 01:58:20.169]  The U.S.
[01:58:20.169 --> 01:58:21.870]  had wanted troops for Afghanistan.
[01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:23.631]  He refused to send those.
[01:58:23.631 --> 01:58:29.174]  So, this is somebody who was not a puppet in the way that many people might think.
[01:58:29.174 --> 01:58:30.655]  He was saying no to the U.S.
[01:58:30.655 --> 01:58:32.656]  on a lot of things that they really wanted.
[01:58:32.656 --> 01:58:35.818]  Watch this new junta and see if they accept the nuclear rumbella.
[01:58:35.998 --> 01:58:36.579]  Absolutely.
[01:58:36.579 --> 01:58:38.423]  Unfreeze the political paradigm.
[01:58:38.423 --> 01:58:39.385]  Bring in chaos.
[01:58:39.385 --> 01:58:42.350]  Rearrange it.
[01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:45.777]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.762 --> 01:58:55.305]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.305 --> 01:58:56.226]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.226 --> 01:58:59.648]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.648 --> 01:59:00.509]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.509 --> 01:59:05.392]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.392 --> 01:59:06.152]  It's true.
[01:59:06.152 --> 01:59:11.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.016 --> 01:59:11.836]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.836 --> 01:59:15.418]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.418 --> 01:59:19.121]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.321 --> 01:59:20.122]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.122 --> 01:59:22.885]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.885 --> 01:59:26.569]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.569 --> 01:59:27.349]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.349 --> 01:59:31.514]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.514 --> 01:59:36.279]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.559 --> 01:59:40.722]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.722 --> 01:59:42.503]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.503 --> 01:59:44.764]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:47.366 --> 01:59:48.747]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.747 --> 01:59:54.591]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.526 --> 02:00:06.827]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.827 --> 02:00:08.587]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.587 --> 02:00:10.348]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.348 --> 02:00:11.949]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.949 --> 02:00:13.489]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.489 --> 02:00:17.671]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.671 --> 02:00:21.753]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.313 --> 02:00:29.497]  We know that no big political or military movement can be completely secret because the pieces have to be put in position beforehand.
[02:00:29.497 --> 02:00:33.179]  And it's on record that the National Guard has been basically federalized.
[02:00:33.179 --> 02:00:35.581]  They're training local police for martial law.
[02:00:35.581 --> 02:00:37.962]  We've gotten countless internal documents.
[02:00:37.962 --> 02:00:42.305]  It's made national news many times, as listeners know, that they are preparing for this martial law.
[02:00:42.305 --> 02:00:45.787]  It has nothing to do with cave dwellers in Central Asia.
[02:00:46.667 --> 02:00:49.348]  The police state grid is for the American people.
[02:00:49.348 --> 02:01:00.110]  The governor of Wisconsin told Milwaukee Public Radio as a threat under austerity, cutting the pay of state workers, jacking up taxes, and demanding they invest more in the pension funds they're looting.
[02:01:00.110 --> 02:01:04.251]  He actually threatened them and said, the National Guard is standing by.
[02:01:04.251 --> 02:01:07.472]  So very confident up there with the austerity.
[02:01:07.472 --> 02:01:14.454]  They're selling the idea through the New Jersey governor and others that cut everything and that this will fix the budget deficit, but
[02:01:15.054 --> 02:01:20.762]  There's no way to fix it if we sign on to the 1.5 quadrillion of the foreign bankers.
[02:01:20.762 --> 02:01:23.065]  As you know, Tarbley, you could cut all the spending in the world.
[02:01:23.065 --> 02:01:26.990]  It wouldn't even pay for a thimble of the fiat derivative debt, and we've got the...
[02:01:27.941 --> 02:01:31.025]  Well, the first thing is that the policy of cut and gut is guaranteed to fail.
[02:01:31.025 --> 02:01:34.328]  You can see this was tried by Schwarzenegger in California.
[02:01:45.601 --> 02:01:51.185]  He would cut the budget one year, and then he would come back the next year, and the deficits would be bigger.
[02:01:51.185 --> 02:01:53.606]  This is not the way to get out of a depression.
[02:01:53.606 --> 02:01:56.288]  You've got to have a recovery program.
[02:01:56.288 --> 02:01:58.910]  There are so many historical examples.
[02:01:58.910 --> 02:02:03.193]  It's economic suicide, national suicide, to do these things.
[02:02:03.753 --> 02:02:08.635]  In terms of these people who say that the reserve currency role of the U.S.
[02:02:08.635 --> 02:02:12.416]  dollar is at an end, here is the challenge.
[02:02:12.416 --> 02:02:19.518]  If you want to be a reserve currency, it means, for example, that oil prices are generally quoted in dollars.
[02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:27.353]  But the other thing it means is that central banks around the world are willing to keep their reserves in dollars.
[02:02:27.353 --> 02:02:29.034]  That's why you say reserve currency.
[02:02:29.034 --> 02:02:40.259]  So the Bank of China, the Central Bank of Japan, Malaysia, all kinds of people around the world, instead of keeping it in some other currency, they've generally tended to keep it in dollars.
[02:02:40.259 --> 02:02:41.400]  Now why is this?
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.320]  What is the advantage?
[02:02:43.078 --> 02:02:50.184]  Well, there is the United States Treasury bond market, and this is unique in the world.
[02:02:50.184 --> 02:02:55.688]  It is the broadest, deepest, and most capable market that there is anywhere.
[02:02:55.688 --> 02:03:00.292]  The general daily turnover is about 1 trillion U.S.
[02:03:00.292 --> 02:03:08.298]  dollars, and that's, you know, 10 times, 20 times more than the stock market or other markets.
[02:03:08.298 --> 02:03:11.361]  It's a huge part of the world financial turnover.
[02:03:11.821 --> 02:03:18.907]  And this market is deep enough so that if you come forward, if you say, look, I have $3 trillion worth of U.S.
[02:03:18.907 --> 02:03:20.568]  Treasury securities.
[02:03:20.568 --> 02:03:23.331]  I'd like to turn that into cash today.
[02:03:23.331 --> 02:03:25.833]  That can be done pretty much without batting an eye.
[02:03:25.833 --> 02:03:29.336]  $3 trillion, $4 trillion, even maybe $5 trillion.
[02:03:29.336 --> 02:03:32.278]  It can handle it because there's that much liquidity.
[02:03:32.278 --> 02:03:33.159]  The market is that
[02:03:33.739 --> 02:03:38.121]  And there's an attempt to hijack that market and roll it into the SDRs, but it'll take time to do that.
[02:03:51.505 --> 02:03:57.710]  Right, and there is no such equivalent for the SDRs, there's no such equivalent for the Euro or the Yen.
[02:03:57.710 --> 02:04:07.578]  It is a genuine resource of the United States and the world, at least it could be under better management other than these lunatics that we have today.
[02:04:07.578 --> 02:04:09.500]  But it's not possible.
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:15.725]  Medvedev thought that it was enough to come with a little coin to one of these meetings, right, and show off the coin.
[02:04:15.725 --> 02:04:16.846]  That will not work.
[02:04:16.846 --> 02:04:19.067]  That is not serious.
[02:04:19.067 --> 02:04:20.869]  So therefore we have the situation where
[02:04:21.778 --> 02:04:37.772]  If the current mismanagement, and this means Wall Street Democrats and reactionary Republicans, if they continue their mismanagement, you might get a situation where central banks around the world become so frightened that they pull out of the dollar.
[02:04:37.772 --> 02:04:41.395]  The problem with that then is, there's no substitute.
[02:04:41.395 --> 02:04:49.021]  There's nobody, nobody's able to replace the dollar, so you would then go into international chaos, which is what you had in September 1931.
[02:04:50.502 --> 02:04:52.924]  Webster, tarpley.net, thank you so much.
[02:04:52.924 --> 02:04:56.628]  We're going to have you back in the near future to continue to break down what's happening with the economy.
[02:04:56.628 --> 02:04:59.270]  We have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us in about 30 minutes to break it down.
[02:04:59.270 --> 02:05:00.832]  Thank you, Webster.
[02:05:00.832 --> 02:05:02.013]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:02.013 --> 02:05:08.939]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:08.939 --> 02:05:11.481]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.481 --> 02:05:16.646]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:16.846 --> 02:05:19.887]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:19.887 --> 02:05:22.208]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.208 --> 02:05:28.470]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:31.851]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:31.851 --> 02:05:37.613]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:37.613 --> 02:05:39.253]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.253 --> 02:05:40.554]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:40.554 --> 02:05:43.234]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.234 --> 02:05:44.655]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:05:44.855 --> 02:05:45.275]  We're good to go.
[02:06:00.849 --> 02:06:04.431]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:04.431 --> 02:06:05.552]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:05.552 --> 02:06:10.115]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.115 --> 02:06:16.058]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.058 --> 02:06:18.219]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:18.219 --> 02:06:20.901]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:06:21.241 --> 02:06:27.745]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:06:27.745 --> 02:06:29.946]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:06:29.946 --> 02:06:35.289]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:06:35.289 --> 02:06:40.571]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:06:40.571 --> 02:06:45.954]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:06:45.954 --> 02:06:48.896]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:06:49.136 --> 02:06:52.139]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:52.139 --> 02:06:52.900]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:02.170 --> 02:07:04.371]  Subject to other police action.
[02:07:04.371 --> 02:07:05.632]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.632 --> 02:07:09.255]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.255 --> 02:07:11.816]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.816 --> 02:07:17.680]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:23.924]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.344 --> 02:07:30.289]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.289 --> 02:07:34.492]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.492 --> 02:07:38.795]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.795 --> 02:07:44.739]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.739 --> 02:07:48.302]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.302 --> 02:07:50.263]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.263 --> 02:07:50.704]  It's here.

[02:08:04.678 --> 02:08:07.421]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.176 --> 02:08:14.218]  Okay, we've got it completely jam-packed.
[02:08:14.218 --> 02:08:16.780]  Third hour, we're probably going to overdrive today.
[02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:23.786]  I have seen the most incredible video ever by We Are Change, Luke Rudowsky, founder in New York.
[02:08:23.786 --> 02:08:29.131]  I heard about this yesterday when Aaron was filling in on the show and I was here in Austin, listening to it.
[02:08:30.621 --> 02:08:34.443]  And I just saw the video during the last break.
[02:08:34.443 --> 02:08:38.084]  It was hiding in plain view on InfoWars.com.
[02:08:38.084 --> 02:08:40.565]  Dick Cheney confronted by We Are Change.
[02:08:40.565 --> 02:08:44.907]  And Luke, I mean, you can't look a gift horse in the mouth.
[02:08:44.907 --> 02:08:47.088]  I would just tell them they have dramatic music over it.
[02:08:47.088 --> 02:08:49.269]  I would tell Luke, I'm gonna try to call him right now.
[02:08:50.307 --> 02:08:52.188]  To upload a version without the music.
[02:08:52.188 --> 02:08:59.491]  I mean, it sounds great, looks great, I can only say wonderful job, but the national media won't pick it up with the classical music playing over the top of it.
[02:08:59.491 --> 02:09:00.412]  But, I mean, who can complain?
[02:09:00.412 --> 02:09:03.293]  These guys are incredible.
[02:09:03.293 --> 02:09:11.017]  If you go to InfoWars.com, it's We Are Change Confronts Dick Cheney on 9-11 Stand Down Order, Aaron Dyke's article.
[02:09:13.796 --> 02:09:15.137]  This is just amazing.
[02:09:15.137 --> 02:09:23.542]  In fact, I had a Google search term I wanted to do earlier in the show, and I've gotten so busy we hadn't done it, but now this is even more important.
[02:09:23.542 --> 02:09:26.364]  This is even more important.
[02:09:26.364 --> 02:09:28.946]  This is incredible.
[02:09:28.946 --> 02:09:32.188]  Let's do the search term so it leads them back to the article in the video.
[02:09:32.188 --> 02:09:35.230]  Cheney, stand down, order.
[02:09:35.230 --> 02:09:37.772]  Three words, put it in Google over and over again.
[02:09:37.772 --> 02:09:40.474]  Cheney, stand down, order.
[02:09:41.678 --> 02:09:47.824]  Cheney, C-H-E-N-E-Y, stand down, that's one word, so it's three words total.
[02:09:47.824 --> 02:09:50.005]  Cheney, stand down, order.
[02:09:50.005 --> 02:09:53.028]  Stand down, S-T-A-N-D-D-O-W-N.
[02:09:53.028 --> 02:09:58.553]  So Cheney, C-H-E-N-E-Y, stand down, order.
[02:09:58.553 --> 02:09:59.634]  Let's hammer it.
[02:09:59.634 --> 02:10:03.638]  In the next three hours, we'll go to number one on Google, Cheney, stand down, order.
[02:10:04.238 --> 02:10:05.859]  Cheney, stand down, order.
[02:10:05.859 --> 02:10:09.901]  Get our article posted on your website because Google blocks us on the top search term.
[02:10:09.901 --> 02:10:10.781]  You'll get the traffic.
[02:10:10.781 --> 02:10:11.682]  I don't care.
[02:10:11.682 --> 02:10:13.143]  I want to get the word out on this.
[02:10:13.143 --> 02:10:15.204]  Cheney, stand down, order.
[02:10:15.204 --> 02:10:17.325]  Put it on your website, your blog, your Twitter.
[02:10:17.325 --> 02:10:18.445]  Get our article.
[02:10:18.445 --> 02:10:20.807]  Send it out to everyone working as a team with We Are Change.
[02:10:20.807 --> 02:10:23.628]  I'm going to definitely get Luke on today or tomorrow.
[02:10:23.628 --> 02:10:24.468]  This is just incredible.
[02:10:24.468 --> 02:10:28.651]  I mean, he got up to Cheney up close.
[02:10:29.707 --> 02:10:31.329]  He got up to Cheney up close and brought it.
[02:10:31.329 --> 02:10:32.430]  We know about the stand down order.
[02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:33.291]  We know you carried out 9-11.
[02:10:33.291 --> 02:10:39.278]  I'm going to play that video probably coming up at the end of this segment or in the next segment.
[02:10:39.278 --> 02:10:43.443]  Totally amazing that this happened.
[02:10:43.443 --> 02:10:48.028]  This is powerful and the national media needs to pick up on this but we need to get a hold of Luke.
[02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:50.330]  He needs to upload it without the music.
[02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:56.113]  It's great to upload the one with the music, but the media won't be able to really use it with music playing over the top of it.
[02:10:56.113 --> 02:10:59.935]  I understand that's the WeAreChange style, and it's great, and it's had a huge effect.
[02:10:59.935 --> 02:11:01.936]  They just may have not thought that through.
[02:11:01.936 --> 02:11:05.117]  Again, WeAreChange confronts Dick Cheney on 9-11 stand-down order.
[02:11:05.117 --> 02:11:07.259]  The testimony of Norman Panetta is at the end of it.
[02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:08.259]  Great job.
[02:11:08.259 --> 02:11:10.160]  So it proves what Luke's saying.
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:15.843]  Before the 9-11 Commission leaves compelling questions about former Vice President Dick Cheney's action with 9-11.
[02:11:17.884 --> 02:11:26.312]  Transportation Secretary Mineta witnessed Cheney refuse to contradict an apparent standout order as an aide warned of something incoming at the Pentagon.
[02:11:26.312 --> 02:11:29.214]  Cheney has given conflicting reports about what happened.
[02:11:29.214 --> 02:11:33.878]  Mineta has confirmed in five separate interviews that Cheney did do what he did and did get there when he said.
[02:11:34.819 --> 02:11:37.602]  Uh, he entered the P.E.O.C.
[02:11:37.602 --> 02:11:38.042]  bunker.
[02:11:38.042 --> 02:11:45.049]  Mineta later confirmed he suppressed 9-11 commission testimony and refuted Cheney's account of arriving later.
[02:11:45.049 --> 02:11:51.116]  During a CPAC conference, WeAreChange.org confronted Cheney about these questions, which he refused to address.
[02:11:51.116 --> 02:11:55.700]  So he got screamed off the stage there, being called a warmonger, and then behind the scenes,
[02:11:56.704 --> 02:12:02.267]  This happened days ago, but Luke got back from New York, obviously, and got this uploaded.
[02:12:02.267 --> 02:12:05.850]  He goes on, Hey, Mr. Cheney, what did you do in the underground bunker on 9-11?
[02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:09.072]  Dick Cheney, we know what you did on 9-11 with the stand-down order.
[02:12:09.072 --> 02:12:12.013]  Norm Panetta testified against you on the 9-11 commission report.
[02:12:12.013 --> 02:12:12.494]  What happened on 9-11?
[02:12:12.494 --> 02:12:14.195]  I'm telling you, Luke Rudowsky's a hero.
[02:12:15.255 --> 02:12:21.358]  And it goes on, when he was being forced out, WeAreChange.org founder Luke Rodowski calmly asked security not to push him.
[02:12:21.358 --> 02:12:25.880]  Security backed off after asking him, are you being polite?
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:30.081]  Luke Rodowski and again, James Lane of WeAreChange confront Dick Cheney in Washington, D.C.
[02:12:30.081 --> 02:12:31.042]  at CPAC 210-011.
[02:12:31.042 --> 02:12:35.183]  So that happened five days ago, but they just got it uploaded.
[02:12:35.183 --> 02:12:37.564]  Incredible job!
[02:12:37.564 --> 02:12:39.505]  Incredible job!
[02:12:39.505 --> 02:12:42.426]  We salute WeAreChange and all of you out there.
[02:12:42.426 --> 02:12:43.687]  Unbelievable!
[02:12:44.794 --> 02:12:49.439]  And if we can get the media to pick up on this and reopen that can of worms about the standout order.
[02:12:49.439 --> 02:12:51.361]  This is so huge.
[02:12:51.361 --> 02:12:52.282]  That clip is coming up.
[02:12:52.282 --> 02:12:53.443]  Are we green-lighted on that clip yet?
[02:12:53.443 --> 02:12:54.484]  We are.
[02:12:54.484 --> 02:12:57.307]  We're going to play that after I get into the economy here for a moment.
[02:12:57.307 --> 02:12:59.670]  Now, this was going to be my other big search term today.
[02:12:59.670 --> 02:13:03.273]  This is huge as well.
[02:13:03.273 --> 02:13:07.738]  If the globalists can't get their TSA rollout nationwide, their federal takeover, they're checkmated.
[02:13:09.190 --> 02:13:12.374]  A huge article by Steve Watson, Paul Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:13:12.374 --> 02:13:16.097]  It's the top red link story at InfoWars.com.
[02:13:16.097 --> 02:13:20.863]  TSA worker admits to stealing huge amounts of cash from passengers.
[02:13:20.863 --> 02:13:25.147]  They've been caught being pedophiles, stealing from people, planting drugs on people.
[02:13:25.147 --> 02:13:27.790]  And it just shows how they knowingly hire criminals.
[02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:28.391]  This article
[02:13:29.465 --> 02:13:29.986]  This is so huge.
[02:13:29.986 --> 02:13:30.466]  This is so huge.
[02:13:30.466 --> 02:13:33.169]  What search term should we glean out of that headline?
[02:13:33.169 --> 02:13:36.533]  TSA workers admit to stealing huge amounts of cash from passengers.
[02:13:52.267 --> 02:13:54.329]  Let's do the second number one search term today.
[02:13:54.329 --> 02:13:56.250]  One will be number one, one will be number two.
[02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.552]  We can never tell what you're going to push to the top.
[02:13:58.552 --> 02:14:00.094]  Let's Google the term TSA
[02:14:03.024 --> 02:14:04.925]  Workers stealing.
[02:14:04.925 --> 02:14:06.786]  TSA workers stealing.
[02:14:06.786 --> 02:14:08.126]  Hey, we're fighting the globalist.
[02:14:08.126 --> 02:14:09.727]  Let's go 110%.
[02:14:09.727 --> 02:14:13.989]  TSA workers admit to stealing huge amounts of cash from passengers.
[02:14:13.989 --> 02:14:15.470]  Here's the key search term.
[02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:18.311]  Just the acronym or the three letters together.
[02:14:18.311 --> 02:14:20.432]  TSA workers stealing.
[02:14:20.432 --> 02:14:21.273]  Three words.
[02:14:21.273 --> 02:14:23.094]  TSA workers stealing.
[02:14:23.094 --> 02:14:24.674]  Hit them and hit them hard.
[02:14:24.674 --> 02:14:27.716]  And then we'll also do Cheney stand down order.
[02:14:27.716 --> 02:14:29.517]  Cheney stand down order.
[02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:35.424]  Or if you wanna do another one on top of it, we've had the number one, number two, number three, number four, number five search term before.
[02:14:35.424 --> 02:14:39.067]  We could do Cheney stand down nine slash one one.
[02:14:39.067 --> 02:14:43.751]  Cheney stand down nine slash one one.
[02:14:43.751 --> 02:14:48.955]  Cheney stand down nine slash one one one.
[02:14:48.955 --> 02:14:50.476]  Hit em, hit em hard folks.
[02:14:50.476 --> 02:14:52.478]  Let's take action in the info war.
[02:14:52.478 --> 02:14:54.239]  Again, Cheney stand down order.
[02:14:54.239 --> 02:14:55.400]  Boom!
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:55.721]  Hit em!
[02:14:56.857 --> 02:14:59.298]  Number two, TSA workers stealing.
[02:14:59.298 --> 02:14:59.819]  Boom!
[02:14:59.819 --> 02:15:03.080]  Those three words together in the Google box over and over again.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:05.441]  And Cheney's stand down 9-1-1, 9-1-1.
[02:15:05.441 --> 02:15:06.782]  Boom!
[02:15:06.782 --> 02:15:10.044]  Hit them and hit them hard.
[02:15:10.044 --> 02:15:12.685]  We're going in, we're going in hot.
[02:15:12.685 --> 02:15:15.606]  Standing up against these globalist savages that think we can't see what they're doing.
[02:15:15.606 --> 02:15:19.849]  Now I want to shift gears in the economy.
[02:15:19.849 --> 02:15:21.469]  Let me get back into the Cheney situation.
[02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:30.931]  Wisconsin National Guard preps for worker unrest after governor unveils emergency budget.
[02:15:30.931 --> 02:15:43.255]  The governor basically threatened Wisconsin's, Wisconsin's, however you say it, and said, we'll call the National Guard out on you as they slash their pay, start grabbing their pension funds.
[02:15:43.255 --> 02:15:44.695]  This is incredible.
[02:15:44.695 --> 02:15:51.457]  We've got open calls to ditch the dollar even faster now from the G20, headed up by France, who's at the head of the G20 right now.
[02:15:51.457 --> 02:15:53.278]  Ted Anderson, you haven't been on with us for weeks.
[02:15:53.278 --> 02:15:54.398]  What's your take on all this?
[02:15:54.878 --> 02:15:58.700]  Well, I mean, just worldwide right now, Alex, it's inflation everywhere.
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:00.841]  China right now is looking at inflation.
[02:16:00.841 --> 02:16:02.662]  Europe, the United States.
[02:16:02.662 --> 02:16:05.383]  I mean, budgets aren't being met here in the United States.
[02:16:05.383 --> 02:16:09.505]  So you see things going on like in Wisconsin and look at California.
[02:16:09.505 --> 02:16:17.369]  Just there's a depression converging not only here in the United States, Europe and across China, even China.
[02:16:17.369 --> 02:16:19.050]  And they've been our biggest lender.
[02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:19.250]  They've
[02:16:19.730 --> 02:16:24.213]  We've financed our economy for the last 20 years, and they can't do it anymore.
[02:16:24.213 --> 02:16:25.313]  Inflation's showing up.
[02:16:25.313 --> 02:16:28.955]  They're running to commodities, running the price of gold and silver up.
[02:16:28.955 --> 02:16:34.839]  Silver, I mean, my goodness, silver went over $30 at $30.96 today at a high.
[02:16:34.839 --> 02:16:39.161]  Gold at $13.77 at a high today.
[02:16:39.161 --> 02:16:46.265]  I mean, it's been a hot day for gold and silver, and that inflation and all this printing press action that's been coming out of Washington, D.C.
[02:16:46.265 --> 02:16:47.846]  obviously has taken a great effect.
[02:16:49.161 --> 02:16:49.962]  Ted Anderson.
[02:16:49.962 --> 02:16:51.664]  Again, you haven't been on with us in about three weeks.
[02:16:51.664 --> 02:16:54.288]  It's come out even in Congress.
[02:16:54.288 --> 02:16:59.114]  They're having investigations about JPMorgan and others trying to suppress silver and gold.
[02:16:59.114 --> 02:17:03.680]  Gold and silver are surging right now, obviously, as commodities go up across the board.
[02:17:04.181 --> 02:17:09.585]  You've been able in this recent pullback, you look at an 11-year graph, gold's only going straight up, silver's only going straight up.
[02:17:09.585 --> 02:17:13.408]  There's little corrections on the way as it kind of steps up.
[02:17:13.408 --> 02:17:19.033]  You've been able to get a lot of gold and silver at incredibly low prices, and then you can pass on the savings even though it's gone up.
[02:17:19.033 --> 02:17:23.657]  You can sell it to folks for what you got it when it was lower, so people get the best of both worlds.
[02:17:23.657 --> 02:17:25.718]  People need to stop procrastinating.
[02:17:25.718 --> 02:17:27.139]  Midas has the best deals out there.
[02:17:27.139 --> 02:17:29.381]  These radio specials are the best deals.
[02:17:29.381 --> 02:17:30.822]  These are lost leaders for you.
[02:17:30.822 --> 02:17:32.604]  Tell folks about today's gold and silver offer.
[02:17:33.376 --> 02:17:38.280]  Well, yeah, currently right now, I mean, first of all, I'm still holding those silver dollars and your videos at $97.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:43.045]  The fall of the republic in the endgame and Obama deception.
[02:17:43.045 --> 02:17:45.067]  What a great way to get started in gold and silver.
[02:17:45.067 --> 02:17:46.948]  You get three silver dollars with that.
[02:17:46.948 --> 02:17:49.470]  We deliver the whole package, shipping it all, $97.
[02:17:49.470 --> 02:17:51.953]  You just can't beat that.
[02:17:51.953 --> 02:17:54.455]  But, you know, like, for instance, the franc right now is at $302.
[02:17:54.455 --> 02:17:55.716]  They were $320 here last time gold hit a peak.
[02:17:59.299 --> 02:18:02.702]  So, here you have a chance to get into those at a much lower price.
[02:18:02.702 --> 02:18:04.844]  British Sovereigns, $3.79.
[02:18:04.844 --> 02:18:10.868]  If you do buy one of those Franks, we send out a full year subscription to the International Forecaster to go with that.
[02:18:10.868 --> 02:18:13.951]  I mean, you can't, I mean, you know, what's going on, Alex, right now?
[02:18:13.951 --> 02:18:20.356]  There's a market, the market is running and, you know, people need to be getting into gold and silver.
[02:18:20.356 --> 02:18:22.197]  They need to take this seriously.
[02:18:22.197 --> 02:18:27.161]  We've been printing way too much money and we cannot expect that the dollar is going to hold value.
[02:18:27.581 --> 02:18:33.204]  It takes time for those dollars to actually get into action, get into the economy, and actually trade.
[02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:36.026]  That drives inflation up, and now we're seeing that.
[02:18:36.026 --> 02:18:38.727]  And, you know, now is the time to be getting in.
[02:18:38.727 --> 02:18:41.348]  We have another run on gold and silver.
[02:18:41.348 --> 02:18:44.070]  The market is saying, hey, this is going to happen.
[02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:53.435]  China, you know, once Chinese start buying gold and silver because they're afraid of inflation in their own country, man, that's curtains for the dollar.
[02:18:53.695 --> 02:18:54.395]  Absolutely.
[02:18:54.395 --> 02:19:00.798]  If folks want to call, you already have very competitive great prices, but the radio specials, be sure folks ask for a list of those.
[02:19:00.798 --> 02:19:08.841]  Silver, half dollars, full silver dollars, different types of silver dollars, frank gold, British sovereigns, American eagles, you got any buffaloes, Deb?
[02:19:09.221 --> 02:19:10.342]  Yep, we do have buffaloes.
[02:19:10.342 --> 02:19:11.203]  They are available.
[02:19:11.203 --> 02:19:14.926]  I don't have the price just off the top of my head, but they're very competitive as well.
[02:19:14.926 --> 02:19:15.026]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:15.026 --> 02:19:15.207]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:15.207 --> 02:19:16.288]  Don't procrastinate, folks.
[02:19:16.288 --> 02:19:17.969]  Gold's up 400% in the last 11 years.
[02:19:17.969 --> 02:19:18.770]  Silver, same thing.
[02:19:18.770 --> 02:19:18.830]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:22.373]  Real fast, what are some of the other specials you got, Ted?
[02:19:33.123 --> 02:19:39.885]  Well, just like the Walking Liberty Habs are at 15, there's a whole long array of different things that you can get involved in at this point in time.
[02:19:39.885 --> 02:19:40.825]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:40.825 --> 02:19:46.026]  Make sure you tell them it's the Alex Jones Ted Anderson Radio Special.
[02:19:46.026 --> 02:19:46.766]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.766 --> 02:19:51.027]  Ted, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:19:51.027 --> 02:19:52.348]  Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[02:19:52.348 --> 02:19:56.489]  Alright folks, we'll be right back with the confrontation of Dick Cheney.
[02:19:56.489 --> 02:19:57.909]  This is unbelievable.
[02:19:57.909 --> 02:19:58.369]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.052 --> 02:20:05.596]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.596 --> 02:20:06.516]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.516 --> 02:20:09.939]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.939 --> 02:20:10.800]  Number 2.
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:15.683]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.683 --> 02:20:16.424]  It's true.
[02:20:16.424 --> 02:20:21.308]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.308 --> 02:20:22.128]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.128 --> 02:20:25.711]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.711 --> 02:20:29.414]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.614 --> 02:20:30.415]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.415 --> 02:20:33.177]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.177 --> 02:20:36.859]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.859 --> 02:20:37.640]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:41.783]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.783 --> 02:20:46.546]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.846 --> 02:20:51.011]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.011 --> 02:20:52.813]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.813 --> 02:20:55.056]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:20:55.056 --> 02:20:57.399]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:02.099 --> 02:21:06.122]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:06.122 --> 02:21:09.365]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.365 --> 02:21:14.169]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:21:14.169 --> 02:21:20.555]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.555 --> 02:21:22.797]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:21:23.317 --> 02:21:23.617]  Tim Geithner?
[02:21:23.617 --> 02:21:23.898]  Bernanke?
[02:21:23.898 --> 02:21:24.458]  They're arsonists!
[02:21:24.458 --> 02:21:25.459]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:25.459 --> 02:21:27.601]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.236 --> 02:21:44.357]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.357 --> 02:21:49.499]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:49.499 --> 02:21:58.622]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:00.390 --> 02:22:02.473]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.473 --> 02:22:09.562]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[02:22:09.562 --> 02:22:12.767]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[02:22:12.767 --> 02:22:16.672]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.

[02:22:21.594 --> 02:22:27.836]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[02:22:27.836 --> 02:22:29.537]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[02:22:29.537 --> 02:22:36.780]  Gold and silver will protect your assets and your purchasing power, physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.
[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:38.421]  Call me, Roger Rao, at 1-800-GOLD.

[02:22:47.210 --> 02:22:48.491]  Ready for a change?

[02:22:50.774 --> 02:22:51.895]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237 Extension 178.
[02:23:00.307 --> 02:23:02.729]  You really can lose weight while you're sleeping.

[02:23:42.867 --> 02:23:44.448]  Spelled A-F-F-I-N-I-D-E.
[02:23:45.309 --> 02:23:46.830]  We're good to go.
[02:24:12.719 --> 02:24:17.784]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a new article by Aaron Dykes.
[02:24:17.784 --> 02:24:21.747]  Dick Cheney confronted by We Are Change for ordering 9-11 stand down.
[02:24:21.747 --> 02:24:37.622]  We're going to play the clip of Cheney being confronted by We Are Change, then it cuts to Mr. Panetta, then Transportation Secretary in Congress, testifying to the 9-11 Commission, confirming that in at least, I don't know, four or five other interviews since then with We Are Change and others.
[02:24:37.622 --> 02:24:38.042]  He said no.
[02:24:39.223 --> 02:24:42.724]  No, what I said's right, that's what happened, Dick Cheney's mistaken.
[02:24:42.724 --> 02:24:58.289]  But Cheney, literally who doesn't have a pulse and has a bionic heart on the outside of his body, a heart pump, a ventricle assister, they're being confronted right after he'd been booed off the stage as being a warmonger by the Republicans at CPAC.
[02:24:58.289 --> 02:25:01.790]  So a good send-off for Cheney as he prepares
[02:25:02.810 --> 02:25:05.692]  Unless he gets a heart transplant to move on to Valhalla.
[02:25:05.692 --> 02:25:07.113]  I hope he repents of what he's done.
[02:25:07.113 --> 02:25:11.697]  I wish no ill will against Cheney because he's clearly got God to deal with.
[02:25:11.697 --> 02:25:15.360]  But let's go ahead and play this amazing video audio clip.
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.782]  Here it is.
[02:25:18.782 --> 02:25:20.884]  Hey Mr. Cheney.
[02:25:22.412 --> 02:25:25.834]  Mr. Chaney, what did you do in the underground bunker on 9-11?
[02:25:25.834 --> 02:25:28.075]  Let's go, let's go.
[02:25:28.075 --> 02:25:30.636]  Dick Chaney, we know what you did.
[02:25:30.636 --> 02:25:32.277]  Dick Chaney, don't put your hands on me.
[02:25:32.277 --> 02:25:33.158]  Get out of my way.
[02:25:33.158 --> 02:25:34.518]  Don't push me.
[02:25:34.518 --> 02:25:35.699]  I'll push you.
[02:25:35.699 --> 02:25:40.281]  Don't push me.
[02:25:40.281 --> 02:25:41.062]  Are you being polite?
[02:25:42.435 --> 02:25:44.956]  You know what you did on 9-11 when you did the stand-down order.
[02:25:44.956 --> 02:25:48.478]  Norman Bonetta testified against you on the 9-11 Commission Report.
[02:25:48.478 --> 02:25:51.180]  Mr. Cheney, you know what happened on 9-11.
[02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:52.621]  Everybody out, break out.
[02:25:56.906 --> 02:26:00.467]  Mr. Cheney, we know what you did on 9-11 with your stand-down orders.
[02:26:00.467 --> 02:26:01.768]  Don't get away with it!
[02:26:01.768 --> 02:26:03.109]  Thank you, Mr. Cheney!
[02:26:03.109 --> 02:26:04.929]  Thank you, Mr. Cheney!
[02:26:04.929 --> 02:26:09.891]  Thank you for all you've done for our country!
[02:26:09.891 --> 02:26:10.451]  Thank you!
[02:26:10.451 --> 02:26:11.712]  You're a terrorist!
[02:26:11.712 --> 02:26:12.412]  You're a terrorist!
[02:26:12.412 --> 02:26:12.912]  Thank you!
[02:26:12.912 --> 02:26:23.837]  During the time that the airplane coming in to the Pentagon, there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President, the plane is 50 miles out.
[02:26:23.837 --> 02:26:25.978]  The plane is 30 miles out.
[02:26:26.898 --> 02:26:37.808]  And when it got down to, the plane is 10 miles out, the young man also said to the Vice President, do the orders still stand?
[02:26:37.808 --> 02:26:45.114]  And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said, of course the orders still stand.
[02:26:45.114 --> 02:26:46.876]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[02:26:46.876 --> 02:26:51.259]  A moment's contemplation reveals the magnitude of what we have just heard.
[02:26:52.262 --> 02:27:08.022]  Not only was Cheney in the PEOC before Flight 77 hit, he told an obviously nervous aide that the orders still stood and then listened as the plane approached and then hit the Pentagon, the most heavily defended building in the world.
[02:27:12.315 --> 02:27:20.322]  Boy, and We Are Change at the end tag puts my John Hancock up there at the top, InfoWars.com.
[02:27:20.322 --> 02:27:21.303]  That gives me the willies.
[02:27:21.303 --> 02:27:23.404]  I mean, these are mobsters.
[02:27:23.404 --> 02:27:24.305]  These are gangsters.
[02:27:24.305 --> 02:27:26.347]  These are cold-blooded people.
[02:27:26.347 --> 02:27:30.210]  And all I can say is, We Are Change, Luke Radowsky, you blow me away.
[02:27:30.210 --> 02:27:34.954]  Luke's been fighting for 9-11 truth for six, seven years.
[02:27:34.954 --> 02:27:36.255]  What, he's 22 years old now, 23?
[02:27:37.948 --> 02:27:42.912]  And when Newark 9-11 Truth didn't want him getting hardcore, they threw him out of the group.
[02:27:42.912 --> 02:27:46.395]  And we supported him here, launched We Are Change, supported it.
[02:27:46.395 --> 02:27:49.457]  And now it's got, I don't know, over 100 chapters all over the world.
[02:27:49.457 --> 02:27:54.001]  And they're doing real journalism, real confrontations, real muckraking.
[02:27:54.001 --> 02:27:58.305]  Luke Rodowski, and to all We Are Change, I salute you.
[02:27:58.305 --> 02:28:00.366]  My listeners salute you.
[02:28:00.366 --> 02:28:01.867]  By the way, we found a clean video.
[02:28:02.708 --> 02:28:03.188]  We're good to go.
[02:28:17.879 --> 02:28:19.801]  As one of the top featured news stories.
[02:28:19.801 --> 02:28:23.905]  Right now we have TSA workers admit to stealing huge amounts of cash from passengers.
[02:28:23.905 --> 02:28:25.526]  That's in red.
[02:28:25.526 --> 02:28:29.410]  The next story, Mexican troops conduct vehicle search on US soil.
[02:28:29.410 --> 02:28:31.171]  Has there been an Egyptian revolution?
[02:28:31.171 --> 02:28:33.053]  That's the Paul Craig Roberts article.
[02:28:33.053 --> 02:28:35.956]  Tea Party caucus leader Bachman votes for Patriot Act.
[02:28:35.956 --> 02:28:38.978]  Ron Paul, I can beat warmongering Obama.
[02:28:38.978 --> 02:28:39.799]  We need to go ahead and
[02:28:41.001 --> 02:28:51.889]  Put another story on top of that, and that needs to be the Dick Cheney confronted on 9-11 stand-down above the TSA worker admits to stealing huge amounts of cash from passengers.
[02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:54.892]  We need to get that out to everybody.
[02:28:54.892 --> 02:28:56.473]  Start your engines.
[02:28:56.473 --> 02:28:59.695]  And we're doing Google search terms today.
[02:28:59.695 --> 02:29:02.898]  Cheney... What's the exact headline I was going with?
[02:29:02.898 --> 02:29:03.858]  Cheney stand-down order?
[02:29:03.858 --> 02:29:04.319]  Wasn't that it?
[02:29:06.095 --> 02:29:08.115]  I'm going from memory here of what I launched earlier.
[02:29:08.115 --> 02:29:22.078]  Cheney, yeah, Cheney Stand Down Order was, that's it, yeah, Cheney Stand Down Order, three words you put in Google over and over again to make sure millions more people read the article and see the video.
[02:29:22.078 --> 02:29:25.198]  Cheney Stand Down Order, put that in Google over and over again.
[02:29:25.198 --> 02:29:28.639]  Also, let's give another, you know, the number two right below it.
[02:29:28.639 --> 02:29:30.239]  Cheney Stand Down 9-1-1.
[02:29:30.239 --> 02:29:31.300]  Cheney 9-1-1 Stand Down.
[02:29:34.625 --> 02:29:36.006]  Cheney, stand down 9-1-1.
[02:29:36.006 --> 02:29:37.308]  Cheney, stand down 9-1-1.
[02:29:37.308 --> 02:29:38.509]  Let's do it together.
[02:29:38.509 --> 02:29:39.830]  Put it into Google over and over again.
[02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:43.233]  Cheney, stand down 9-slash-1-1.
[02:29:43.233 --> 02:29:45.335]  Let's go all the way.
[02:29:45.335 --> 02:29:46.956]  We're already fighting for our lives here.
[02:29:46.956 --> 02:29:48.418]  Might as well go all the way.
[02:29:48.418 --> 02:29:49.599]  Turn on the afterburners.
[02:29:49.599 --> 02:29:51.240]  Going to Mach 10.
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:52.642]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.642 --> 02:29:55.164]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.164 --> 02:29:57.867]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.919 --> 02:30:04.762]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:09.045]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:30:09.045 --> 02:30:13.948]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:30:13.948 --> 02:30:19.692]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:30:19.692 --> 02:30:23.315]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:30:23.315 --> 02:30:26.757]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:30:29.609 --> 02:30:36.635]  We're American and be proud.
[02:30:36.635 --> 02:30:39.358]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:30:55.953 --> 02:31:00.635]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:31:00.635 --> 02:31:05.177]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.177 --> 02:31:09.519]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.519 --> 02:31:14.922]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.282 --> 02:31:16.002]  It's true.
[02:31:16.002 --> 02:31:21.704]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.704 --> 02:31:25.305]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.305 --> 02:31:30.006]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:30.006 --> 02:31:32.767]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.767 --> 02:31:36.108]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:37.228 --> 02:31:41.392]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.392 --> 02:31:46.438]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:00.609 --> 02:32:02.251]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.251 --> 02:32:05.614]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:32:52.656 --> 02:32:53.156]  Thank you!
[02:33:32.003 --> 02:33:34.184]  Monday through Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:34.184 --> 02:33:34.524]  11 a.m.
[02:33:34.524 --> 02:33:35.084]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:35.084 --> 02:33:36.604]  We're going to overdrive some today.
[02:33:36.604 --> 02:33:40.325]  Luke Rudowsky's joining us, who just confronted Dick Cheney at CPAC.
[02:33:40.325 --> 02:33:42.085]  They got the video up today.
[02:33:42.085 --> 02:33:44.926]  Right in his face, calmly saying, you ordered the stand-down order.
[02:33:44.926 --> 02:33:47.347]  Norman Panetta's on record in testimony.
[02:33:47.347 --> 02:33:48.967]  You've been caught lying about that.
[02:33:48.967 --> 02:33:50.347]  You're a terrorist.
[02:33:50.347 --> 02:33:51.228]  You carried it out.
[02:33:51.228 --> 02:33:52.748]  And boy, he looks guilty as sin.
[02:33:54.301 --> 02:33:58.342]  Literally like Darth Vader with his heart assist pump on the outside of his body.
[02:33:58.342 --> 02:34:01.603]  The New York Times reports Dick Cheney has no pulse.
[02:34:01.603 --> 02:34:09.646]  You've got this high-tech undead ghoul who's incredibly dangerous, launched a war that killed over a million Iraqis conservatively.
[02:34:10.666 --> 02:34:18.170]  And I'm kind of creeped out having InfoWars.com tagged on the video, which I'm glad they did it, but I want listeners to realize what we're doing.
[02:34:18.170 --> 02:34:31.736]  You know, when I call the White House and tell them I know they staged 9-11, or I call Homeland Security on air to talk about Ammar al-Awlaki working for the Pentagon on record and reported to the FBI, I see videos that are made and get emails saying it's fake.
[02:34:31.736 --> 02:34:35.698]  Because people can't believe that we have the will to do this.
[02:34:37.196 --> 02:34:39.777]  When I videotaped urban warfare drills with the U.S.
[02:34:39.777 --> 02:34:48.482]  Marines openly training to put Americans in camps, people email us and say it's fake, even though it's on the news that the Marines were there and that we were there.
[02:34:50.003 --> 02:34:50.183]  I don't
[02:35:09.949 --> 02:35:13.951]  Larry Silverstein about admittingly blowing up the towers and building 7.
[02:35:13.951 --> 02:35:18.252]  I mean, I've got to say, Luke Rudowsky's the man.
[02:35:18.252 --> 02:35:19.332]  The man!
[02:35:19.332 --> 02:35:20.413]  The man!
[02:35:20.413 --> 02:35:21.573]  The man!
[02:35:21.573 --> 02:35:27.095]  The true spirit of 1776, a true man, a true leader, a person risking his life.
[02:35:27.095 --> 02:35:29.336]  I hope you realize, folks, we're all risking our lives here.
[02:35:29.336 --> 02:35:31.236]  This is not a game.
[02:35:31.236 --> 02:35:32.697]  And if we can do it, you can do it.
[02:35:32.697 --> 02:35:34.377]  I know a lot of you can't believe this stuff.
[02:35:34.377 --> 02:35:36.098]  People are saying this Dick Cheney video is fake.
[02:35:36.894 --> 02:35:44.759]  Because you can't handle the fact that there are people of honor and will who are doing this for all of us.
[02:35:44.759 --> 02:35:50.622]  I understand why some of you can't believe it, because you can't believe in yourself.
[02:35:50.622 --> 02:35:52.003]  But we are having an effect.
[02:35:52.003 --> 02:35:55.405]  Ron Paul did won the CPAC poll, which now two years in a row.
[02:35:55.405 --> 02:35:56.506]  Legendary.
[02:35:56.506 --> 02:35:57.666]  People are waking up.
[02:35:57.666 --> 02:35:58.967]  We can get the country back.
[02:35:58.967 --> 02:36:00.988]  But if you want to do it, you got to look in the mirror.
[02:36:00.988 --> 02:36:04.550]  Now, I want to get into the Egypt situation with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.950]  He's got a
[02:36:05.991 --> 02:36:07.132]  New article out today.
[02:36:07.132 --> 02:36:13.799]  It's up on Infowars.com and all the other great news sites that carry his powerful material.
[02:36:13.799 --> 02:36:16.522]  And the headline is, has there been an Egyptian revolution?
[02:36:16.522 --> 02:36:18.124]  We'll talk about that for the rest of the hour with him.
[02:36:18.124 --> 02:36:22.709]  But first, sir, NPR Radio has the governor of Wisconsin.
[02:36:24.304 --> 02:36:29.951]  Threatening state workers as they cut their pay for austerity and say they're going to take more money for the pension funds they're looting.
[02:36:29.951 --> 02:36:32.674]  That if they don't like it, the National Guard is standing by.
[02:36:32.674 --> 02:36:37.640]  Homeland Security now is admitting that they are preparing basically for clampdowns in the US.
[02:36:42.678 --> 02:36:46.863]  The G20 led by France is calling for an end of dollar hegemony.
[02:36:46.863 --> 02:36:52.389]  Since you were last on with us three weeks ago, Hu Jintao has called for the end of the dollar.
[02:36:52.389 --> 02:37:02.200]  What is your take and your view just on the state of the police state in this country and what's your view on We Are Change confronting Dick Cheney at point-blank range?
[02:37:03.991 --> 02:37:06.873]  Well Alex, the police state continues to grow.
[02:37:06.873 --> 02:37:10.936]  We can see again the hypocrisy of the American government.
[02:37:10.936 --> 02:37:26.287]  Hillary Clinton is giving a big speech about the need for internet freedom at the same time that the United States government is demanding all the records from Twitter so that they can frame up Julian Assange.
[02:37:26.287 --> 02:37:28.829]  So I think the police state will continue to grow.
[02:37:30.029 --> 02:37:36.910]  But it has a number of reasons that it does grow.
[02:37:36.910 --> 02:37:49.233]  As for the demand for the end of the dollar, you could see this, as you probably do, as part of the One World Conspiracy.
[02:37:49.233 --> 02:37:55.994]  Or you could see it simply as the rest of the world trying to get free of American financial hegemony.
[02:37:58.642 --> 02:38:05.665]  It's the dollar's reserve currency that gives the United States financial hegemony over the rest of the world.
[02:38:05.665 --> 02:38:09.167]  And so we control them.
[02:38:09.167 --> 02:38:17.291]  And they're probably tired of that without the financial hegemony that we have.
[02:38:19.056 --> 02:38:28.379]  We wouldn't be able to force them to comply with our laws and allow our police and our FBI and everything else to run all over their own countries.
[02:38:28.379 --> 02:38:34.982]  So it's the threats that we can make to them of excluding them from the world financial system.
[02:38:36.002 --> 02:38:43.364]  And this is an important source of the hegemony of the United States government over the rest of the world.
[02:38:43.364 --> 02:38:56.308]  And I think that you could probably see the call for some alternative to the dollar as people trying to get free of American domination.
[02:38:56.308 --> 02:38:57.569]  So that's my take on that.
[02:38:59.847 --> 02:39:15.752]  Looking at the Egypt situation, you know, we want to be against Hosni Mubarak, we want to see it as the Arabs waking up and saying no to foreign domination, but clearly the globalists, the social engineers knew that revolution was coming there because of IMF and World Bank programs and
[02:39:16.172 --> 02:39:16.252]  And
[02:39:36.873 --> 02:39:38.695]  Well, I don't think we had much role in his departure.
[02:40:07.042 --> 02:40:17.408]  But he had been a faithful American-Israeli puppet for 30 years, and his predecessor prior to him had been a puppet.
[02:40:17.408 --> 02:40:27.733]  And Egypt has been the main way that the United States has been able to seal off Gaza so that it stays under Israel's thumb.
[02:40:30.516 --> 02:40:44.556]  But the question I raised was, is getting rid of Mubarak a revolution when left in place is the American Embassy, the elite, the police, the army, the bureaucracy?
[02:40:45.689 --> 02:40:47.492]  They're all still there.
[02:40:47.492 --> 02:41:02.531]  So unless the outpourings of all those Egyptians into the streets and their determination to stay there, unless that has caused the elite in Egypt to have a change of mind,
[02:41:04.286 --> 02:41:06.988]  Nothing much will have changed.
[02:41:06.988 --> 02:41:16.895]  And of course, the dollar being the reserve currency, that allows us to purchase the new government just as we purchase the old government.
[02:41:16.895 --> 02:41:26.322]  So, I don't know if there's been a change of mind that went beyond the ordinary Egyptians into the elites.
[02:41:26.322 --> 02:41:27.383]  That remains to be seen.
[02:41:28.443 --> 02:41:36.209]  If it has not been, then sooner or later the Egyptian people will catch on that nothing has really changed.
[02:41:36.209 --> 02:41:48.097]  And they'll again be in the streets, this time with leaders, which they lacked in this last outpouring, and more focus.
[02:41:48.097 --> 02:41:53.400]  And if that's put down, then I think eventually you'll see civil war.
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:57.003]  And I agree with Gerald Salenti that
[02:41:58.158 --> 02:42:18.231]  These regimes are everywhere unstable, and not just in the Middle East, but I think in England and the United States, because of the immense concentration of income and wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands at the expense of the ordinary people.
[02:42:18.231 --> 02:42:24.715]  So I think there's no doubt that some big crisis is brewing.
[02:42:24.715 --> 02:42:25.136]  How long
[02:42:26.285 --> 02:42:29.017]  It takes to manifest itself.
[02:42:29.017 --> 02:42:30.804]  I have no, I have no real idea.
[02:42:31.411 --> 02:42:41.057]  Well, you've been predicting for years, and so has Gerald, that food prices would start increasing because of dollar devaluation, meaning the World Reserve currency and other commodities would go up.
[02:42:41.057 --> 02:42:42.739]  Here's the Associated Press today.
[02:42:42.739 --> 02:42:43.919]  World Bank.
[02:42:43.919 --> 02:42:45.661]  Food prices at dangerous levels.
[02:42:45.661 --> 02:42:55.827]  World Bank President Robert Zoellick says global food prices have hit dangerous levels that could contribute to political instability, push millions of people into poverty, and raise the cost of groceries.
[02:42:55.827 --> 02:42:56.648]  Well, no kidding.
[02:42:56.648 --> 02:43:00.971]  And the headline out today, 4% increase in inflation just in the last month.
[02:43:01.751 --> 02:43:08.415]  In the UK, so this inflationary spiral is starting to really rear its ugly head.
[02:43:08.415 --> 02:43:15.919]  And you have the people that have basically created this economic climate now posing as the saviors.
[02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:26.605]  But in places like Egypt, where you've got 50% of people on $2 a day or less, I mean, hungry bellies, when people are desperate, they do desperate things.
[02:43:27.813 --> 02:43:30.855]  Right, right, and not just in Egypt.
[02:43:30.855 --> 02:43:33.737]  You see, there are multiple causes, I think.
[02:43:33.737 --> 02:43:40.961]  It's not only the printing of paper currencies that are driving up food prices.
[02:43:40.961 --> 02:43:48.165]  It's also, there have been droughts, there have been floods that have reduced output.
[02:43:48.165 --> 02:43:56.210]  And there's also the practice of the first world corporations and land speculators buying up
[02:43:57.912 --> 02:44:04.405]  So much land in the third world and forcing the native farmers off of it.
[02:44:05.467 --> 02:44:16.257]  So it's essentially taken out of food production and put into some kind of a global market commodity production.
[02:44:16.257 --> 02:44:17.858]  And this is happening everywhere.
[02:44:17.858 --> 02:44:19.540]  It's happening in India as well.
[02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:27.407]  So when you see the Western countries using the powers of their currencies,
[02:44:28.688 --> 02:44:33.770]  To dispossess other lands of their agricultural potential.
[02:44:33.770 --> 02:44:36.611]  That's another reason for rising food prices.
[02:44:36.611 --> 02:44:40.893]  So you have all of those things going on at once.
[02:44:40.893 --> 02:44:49.536]  And so you have to, if you want to do anything about it, you'd have to address all three of those things.
[02:44:49.536 --> 02:44:54.258]  Of course, you can't do anything about droughts and floods.
[02:44:57.111 --> 02:45:10.676]  Probably, if there was a policy of countries maintaining surplus stocks, as the United States used to do with the Agricultural Support Program, that would be a good idea.
[02:45:10.676 --> 02:45:15.297]  That was a sensible thing to have done.
[02:45:15.297 --> 02:45:25.261]  Well, expanding on that, I was listening to some farm commodity reports this morning on television, and they were giving examples of prime farmland in Kansas.
[02:45:26.201 --> 02:45:31.204]  Missouri, Indiana, that just a few years ago, they were giving averages.
[02:45:31.204 --> 02:45:33.506]  It'd be $1,400 for an acre.
[02:45:33.506 --> 02:45:36.408]  It'd be $2,300 for an acre here.
[02:45:36.408 --> 02:45:41.011]  And it showed the same places now in Indiana, seven, eight, nine, 10,000 an acre.
[02:45:41.011 --> 02:45:44.153]  Kansas, 6,000 plus on average.
[02:45:44.153 --> 02:45:47.996]  And they admitted it's foreign land speculators.
[02:45:47.996 --> 02:45:53.279]  I guess a new bubble outside of real estate that was the main driver.
[02:45:53.279 --> 02:45:55.241]  But then it talked about regular farmers now.
[02:45:56.081 --> 02:45:56.781]  That's right.
[02:45:56.781 --> 02:46:00.982]  When you print money, you drive people into real things.
[02:46:00.982 --> 02:46:04.063]  And it's not just foreign speculators who are buying the land.
[02:46:04.063 --> 02:46:04.683]  It's our own as well.
[02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:27.392]  I suspect it'll all be organized into derivatives in the end.
[02:46:27.392 --> 02:46:29.452]  Yes, and you're right to be correct.
[02:46:29.452 --> 02:46:32.714]  They just said internationally land speculation is up.
[02:46:32.714 --> 02:46:34.114]  Let's look at the U.S.
[02:46:34.114 --> 02:46:39.036]  So obviously it's JPMorgan Chase, it's everybody doing it.
[02:46:39.036 --> 02:46:40.817]  That's right.
[02:46:40.817 --> 02:46:47.259]  It's everybody and it does take, it does dispossess the farmers who produce food.
[02:46:48.949 --> 02:46:49.630]  I don't know.
[02:47:07.834 --> 02:47:17.259]  All of these things are driven by profit and greed and very short-term thinking.
[02:47:17.259 --> 02:47:25.524]  So if the inflation is just now starting to rear its head, how bad is it going to get and what do you expect Dr. Roberts to do?
[02:47:25.524 --> 02:47:34.209]  Well, like it's beginning to spike in England, if it's 4% in one month, then that's a very high annual rate.
[02:47:35.982 --> 02:47:45.742]  And John Williams reported that we had a spike in January here, which if you took it to an annual rate would give it 8%.
[02:47:47.558 --> 02:47:56.620]  And as you already know, the way, as we've discussed before, the way we measure inflation here actually understates the real measure.
[02:47:56.620 --> 02:48:03.921]  So it's probably higher than 8% on an annual rate, based on the January figures here.
[02:48:03.921 --> 02:48:09.102]  But 4% in England in the month of January, that's scary.
[02:48:09.102 --> 02:48:10.422]  That's scary.
[02:48:10.422 --> 02:48:13.123]  You know, if you annualize that, you're way up in the double digits.
[02:48:15.088 --> 02:48:31.477]  And so I think that when inflation spikes, we'll see a collapse in the bond market and in the dollar.
[02:48:31.477 --> 02:48:42.004]  And this will then intensify the calls for an alternative international monetary system.
[02:48:44.286 --> 02:48:47.189]  I don't quite see how they can pull that off.
[02:48:47.189 --> 02:48:55.776]  They're talking about making it SDRs, but that still leaves the Americans, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Chinese in charge of everything.
[02:48:55.776 --> 02:49:04.484]  I don't know how they can stick the Chinese currency in before the Chinese currency is fully tradable.
[02:49:04.484 --> 02:49:06.906]  You know, they restrict the ability
[02:49:08.247 --> 02:49:10.149]  I know it's a derivative.
[02:49:31.129 --> 02:49:33.550]  So I don't know what these outcomes will be.
[02:49:33.550 --> 02:49:40.214]  I think they're worth watching and thinking about.
[02:49:40.214 --> 02:49:44.577]  You have to keep in mind, too, that the IMF has always been a tool of American policy.
[02:49:45.566 --> 02:49:52.327]  And so the notion that the IMF is somehow going to become a tool against American interest.
[02:49:52.327 --> 02:49:56.968]  How exactly does that, does that happen?
[02:49:56.968 --> 02:50:08.631]  And as I said earlier, I think one way we can see all of this concern about the dollar is that people want to reduce our financial hedge enemy.
[02:50:10.570 --> 02:50:14.455]  And it doesn't mean that they're trying to exploit us.
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:33.620]  That's right.
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:44.944]  It's going to be devastating and if you look at the fact that they're not dealing with budget deficits because they refuse to deal with the wars.
[02:50:44.944 --> 02:50:45.644]  Doc, stay there.
[02:50:45.644 --> 02:50:47.884]  I want to see where you think this is going.
[02:50:47.884 --> 02:50:48.845]  Talk about the wars.
[02:50:48.845 --> 02:50:50.105]  Ron Paul winning CFAC.
[02:50:50.105 --> 02:50:52.326]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest.
[02:50:52.326 --> 02:50:52.846]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.405 --> 02:51:05.486]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.486 --> 02:51:09.988]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:09.988 --> 02:51:16.150]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:18.571]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.571 --> 02:51:24.533]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.673 --> 02:51:28.074]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.074 --> 02:51:29.955]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:29.955 --> 02:51:32.135]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.135 --> 02:51:37.017]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:37.017 --> 02:51:37.817]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:37.817 --> 02:51:41.698]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:41.698 --> 02:51:42.619]  We're good to go.
[02:52:00.808 --> 02:52:03.129]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.129 --> 02:52:05.390]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.390 --> 02:52:08.711]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.711 --> 02:52:13.832]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.832 --> 02:52:18.014]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.334 --> 02:52:20.676]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.676 --> 02:52:23.219]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.219 --> 02:52:26.482]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.482 --> 02:52:34.089]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.423 --> 02:52:39.805]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.805 --> 02:52:42.125]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.125 --> 02:52:46.346]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.346 --> 02:52:47.427]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.427 --> 02:52:48.767]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.767 --> 02:52:50.248]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:15.538 --> 02:54:20.459]  In layman's terms, Dr. Roberts, I mean, where do you see things going?
[02:54:20.459 --> 02:54:23.639]  The people running our economic system have flooded the world with dollars.
[02:54:23.639 --> 02:54:27.020]  You and every other major economist, Common Sense, said it's going to cause inflation.
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:27.960]  How bad, we don't know.
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:29.340]  Looks like it's going to be pretty bad.
[02:54:29.340 --> 02:54:33.301]  It's starting, just right on time, as you predicted, and others did.
[02:54:33.301 --> 02:54:36.842]  And if inflation's causing all these problems now,
[02:54:37.402 --> 02:54:39.724]  They lied to us and said it's not gonna cause a problem.
[02:54:39.724 --> 02:54:44.128]  There's not gonna be inflation the people running things aren't stupid They knew this was gonna happen.
[02:54:44.128 --> 02:54:47.051]  What's their exit strategy?
[02:54:47.051 --> 02:54:53.196]  Well, I don't I don't think they have one I Don't I don't think there is an exit strategy.
[02:54:53.196 --> 02:55:03.245]  They're just Trying to pass it on to the next watch, you know, let the sinking ship pass on to the next watch I think that
[02:55:05.410 --> 02:55:08.054]  You would ask me about Ron Paul and CPAC.
[02:55:08.054 --> 02:55:09.016]  Yes.
[02:55:09.016 --> 02:55:13.803]  And I think what's happening is that the conservatives, or at least some of them,
[02:55:15.033 --> 02:55:35.945]  Not the neoconservatives, but conservatives are realizing that all of this patriotic, macho, tough guy flag waving was playing into the hands of the police state and the warmonger state and that they're backing off of that and that the reason I think they like Ron Paul may have
[02:55:36.990 --> 02:55:42.154]  Mainly to do with the fact that he's principled.
[02:55:42.154 --> 02:55:51.121]  He's the guy who doesn't have his finger in the wind and people are starting to again show some respect for that kind of person.
[02:55:51.121 --> 02:55:51.721]  I think that
[02:55:53.022 --> 02:55:56.383]  Is more of the reason than agreement with his policies.
[02:55:56.383 --> 02:56:15.468]  I'm not sure how much the people who are turning in his direction are doing it because of his policies as opposed to the fact that he is a spokesman for people and not for the oligarchic ruling interest.
[02:56:15.468 --> 02:56:19.529]  So I think that does put him in certain danger.
[02:56:21.993 --> 02:56:47.182]  If we were to believe so many of the books that have been written about the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, there does seem to be an argument that can be made that elements in the United States government remove leaders that
[02:56:48.331 --> 02:56:55.516]  Turned toward representing people as opposed to representing the oligarchic interests.
[02:56:55.516 --> 02:57:04.642]  So, um, that is, uh, seems to be, uh, something that a number of historians have developed.
[02:57:05.763 --> 02:57:08.046]  Ron Paul, as you know, has been getting more bold.
[02:57:08.046 --> 02:57:12.713]  He's now giving speeches about CIA narcotics trafficking we played here recently.
[02:57:12.713 --> 02:57:16.257]  He's talked about governments using crises for control.
[02:57:16.257 --> 02:57:18.701]  He said, I can quote, beat warmongering Obama.
[02:57:18.701 --> 02:57:20.663]  I mean, he's getting more and more bold.
[02:57:21.244 --> 02:57:22.444]  And he is the real deal.
[02:57:22.444 --> 02:57:25.626]  I mean, he is somebody who has true bona fide integrity.
[02:57:25.626 --> 02:57:26.206]  And I agree with you.
[02:57:26.206 --> 02:57:28.847]  That's what I said earlier before you were even on.
[02:57:28.847 --> 02:57:29.867]  And Ron Paul's agreed here.
[02:57:29.867 --> 02:57:35.169]  He knows he's in danger, but he's a man of honor and destiny, and we should all pray for him and support him.
[02:57:35.169 --> 02:57:46.213]  But it does show Republicans starting to take a proper turn towards reality that they voted him the last two years in a row as the winner of CPAC, and Dick Cheney got booed and called a warmonger.
[02:57:47.796 --> 02:57:49.397]  Well, that's hopeful.
[02:57:49.397 --> 02:57:55.059]  And those are the kinds of developments that we can be hopeful for.
[02:57:55.059 --> 02:58:04.903]  You know, a number of commentators have made the point, Alex, that there's not really that much difference between the people of the United States and the ones in Egypt.
[02:58:04.903 --> 02:58:10.165]  Because just as that system is run for small elites, so is ours.
[02:58:11.198 --> 02:58:26.467]  And we see all kinds of foreclosures, all kinds of American jobs moved offshore, everything in order to further enrich a very small part of the population, which now has more income and wealth than it knows what to do with.
[02:58:26.467 --> 02:58:32.910]  And the anger, I think, that we've seen abroad, we'll see here at the United States.
[02:58:32.910 --> 02:58:36.192]  Alright, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, always appreciate you joining us.
[02:58:36.192 --> 02:58:38.853]  Folks can find out about your latest book at the bottom of the article you've written.
[02:58:38.853 --> 02:58:39.394]  God bless you.

[02:58:52.482 --> 02:58:56.503]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.503 --> 02:58:59.744]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.744 --> 02:59:04.544]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.544 --> 02:59:10.906]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.906 --> 02:59:13.166]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.706 --> 02:59:14.006]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.006 --> 02:59:14.526]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.526 --> 02:59:15.187]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.187 --> 02:59:16.467]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.467 --> 02:59:18.728]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.614 --> 02:59:34.474]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.474 --> 02:59:39.876]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:39.876 --> 02:59:51.958]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:51.958 --> 02:59:55.559]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.559 --> 02:59:58.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:17.915 --> 03:00:20.376]  Well, it's lonely at the top.
[03:00:20.376 --> 03:00:21.957]  Must be lonely for Luke.
[03:00:21.957 --> 03:00:23.797]  Such courage.
[03:00:23.797 --> 03:00:25.618]  Founded WeAreChange three years ago.
[03:00:25.618 --> 03:00:27.619]  Twenty-something years old.
[03:00:27.619 --> 03:00:29.400]  I'm really proud of Luke Rudowsky.
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:32.381]  Can proudly say he's a protege of my work.
[03:00:32.381 --> 03:00:34.442]  WeAreChange.org's been hacked and attacked.
[03:00:34.442 --> 03:00:36.143]  It's now been brought down.
[03:00:36.143 --> 03:00:37.503]  Right in Dick Cheney's face.
[03:00:37.503 --> 03:00:38.604]  We played it earlier in the hour.
[03:00:38.604 --> 03:00:42.365]  The video's up at InfoWars.com since WeAreChange.org's been hacked.
[03:00:42.365 --> 03:00:43.025]  Don't worry.
[03:00:43.025 --> 03:00:45.066]  There's hundreds of other websites and chapters.
[03:00:45.066 --> 03:00:45.947]  You can't get us all.
[03:00:47.087 --> 03:01:07.880]  But Luke is risking his life confronting Dick Cheney point-blank saying we know you did 9-11 the NORAD stand down you're a terrorist you're a murderer Luke we only got four minutes I'm gonna try to get you back up tomorrow for a couple segments but tell us what it was like not just on video but anything else that happened and and and how you've got this much courage and how others can emulate what you've done and use you as a model of true honor
[03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:11.252]  I'm nobody special, I'm just like everybody else.
[03:01:11.252 --> 03:01:19.138]  All it takes is just a commitment to truth and love and going out there and being able to speak what's in your heart and what's in your mind.
[03:01:19.138 --> 03:01:22.220]  And me and James Lane teamed up from We Are Change Oklahoma.
[03:01:22.220 --> 03:01:25.302]  We were scouting all of the CPAC, all of the Hilton Hotels.
[03:01:25.302 --> 03:01:27.464]  That's right, he's another hero, James Lane.
[03:01:28.024 --> 03:01:38.692]  James Lane of We Are Change Oklahoma, and me and him noticed the Secret Service Guard holding an elevator, and just knowing that from my experiences confronting other individuals, I knew just to stick around there.
[03:01:38.692 --> 03:01:47.178]  Newt Gingrich came around, I asked him about Bohemian Grove, and then out of nowhere, Dick Cheney just comes out of nowhere, and my heart just sank.
[03:01:47.178 --> 03:01:48.079]  My heart just like...
[03:01:48.659 --> 03:01:51.621]  It just went nuts, and I just knew I had to say something.
[03:01:51.621 --> 03:01:57.466]  And I looked him right in the eyes, and I told him, you know, what did you do on 9-11 in the presidential bunker?
[03:01:57.466 --> 03:02:05.351]  And that feeling of just being able to walk up to him, his face, his reaction, you know, the pictures that came out of it are just incredible.
[03:02:06.372 --> 03:02:11.755]  Anybody could do this and that's what I'm trying to show is that these people are just regular individuals.
[03:02:11.755 --> 03:02:12.736]  We have the power.
[03:02:12.736 --> 03:02:13.976]  We have the authority.
[03:02:13.976 --> 03:02:19.839]  We have everything we ever needed and wanted and we have the courage to go up there and talk to these individuals.
[03:02:19.839 --> 03:02:21.160]  That's all it takes.
[03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:24.342]  Going up there with just love and compassion for truth.
[03:02:24.822 --> 03:02:32.164]  Being calm, not screaming when you're getting pushed or shoved, and just being on your best behavior and just speaking truth.
[03:02:32.164 --> 03:02:40.966]  And that feeling, even after finishing that confrontation, I remember just running out of there and just feeling so empowered, feeling so great.
[03:02:40.966 --> 03:02:42.607]  And I want to share that with everybody.
[03:02:42.607 --> 03:02:47.308]  And I hope people who listen and I hope people who watch get encouraged, get involved.
[03:02:47.308 --> 03:02:51.509]  And whatever you call yourself, if you call yourself an Info Warrior or a We Are Changer,
[03:02:51.969 --> 03:02:53.030]  I don't even care.
[03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:54.971]  It's what you do that matters.
[03:02:54.971 --> 03:02:56.191]  It's the fruit of your labor.
[03:02:56.191 --> 03:03:00.113]  Well, Infowarriors are We Are Changers, and We Are Changers are Infowarriors.
[03:03:00.113 --> 03:03:05.256]  It's the spirit of 1776, but for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're showing the video to people.
[03:03:05.256 --> 03:03:14.760]  I mean, you got within about three feet of Chaney, and when you, you know, said, we know you ordered the standout on 9-11, though he looked at you with evil, but also with defeat.
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:17.602]  He realizes in the history books it's going to be known that he ran 9-11.
[03:03:18.522 --> 03:03:22.344]  He looked at me, he snarled a little bit, and then he put his head down in shame.
[03:03:22.344 --> 03:03:24.765]  He put his head down in shame.
[03:03:24.765 --> 03:03:32.128]  And that feeling, that look in his face, and just being able to make eye contact with him was one of the most powerful feelings in the world.
[03:03:32.128 --> 03:03:33.769]  And I'm going to be doing this full-time.
[03:03:33.769 --> 03:03:35.510]  I just graduated college.
[03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:36.891]  I just quit my job.
[03:03:36.891 --> 03:03:39.932]  And I want to let everybody know this is only the beginning.
[03:03:39.932 --> 03:03:41.993]  I'm just going to start doing this full-time.
[03:03:41.993 --> 03:03:48.056]  I hope he will support me because that's all I want to do in my life right now is go out there and confront these evil people
[03:03:48.556 --> 03:03:49.657]  With, you know, compassion.
[03:03:49.657 --> 03:03:51.698]  I feel sorry for Dick Cheney, honestly.
[03:03:51.698 --> 03:04:02.264]  You know, I honestly feel sorry because of what he did and what he has to live with for the rest of his eternity with his soul and his spirit are decrepit and destroyed.
[03:04:02.264 --> 03:04:07.408]  And if we just stay with compassion within our hearts, we could do anything.
[03:04:07.408 --> 03:04:15.252]  And that search for truth, for justice and freedom and liberty and exposing what happened, the horrible crimes on 9-11, that's what life's about.
[03:04:15.252 --> 03:04:17.554]  Well, Luke, how are you tomorrow at 1 so we can
[03:04:18.632 --> 03:04:19.733]  Yeah, I'll be good for 2 Eastern.
[03:04:19.733 --> 03:04:19.793]  Yep.
[03:04:45.493 --> 03:04:57.913]  Exposing these criminals for their real crimes and watch your six everybody pray for Luke that God send angels to protect him And I need some of those prayers too because my name's on that video as well Luke I salute you you are something special I'll say bye to you during the break
