[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  I'm David Knight. I'm joined here with Jacari Jackson
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  and Alex is going to be with us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  We've got some big breaking news coming up.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  People are waking up
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  and things that have been hidden for decades are coming out
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  and we've also got the fight accelerating.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  What do you think about this, Jacari?
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  Yeah, the fight is definitely accelerating.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  Like I said, Alex will be with us at the bottom of the hour
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  to talk about how the mainstream keeps attacking Alex.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  Not just people like Alex, but your ordinary citizens.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  People who are interested in learning this information.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  We heard Matt Al talk about how
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  people on our site, it's not a dating site,
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  a dating site is something like match.com.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  Our site is a public commons where people can share ideas
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  and dating is just a very small section of Planet InfoWars.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  But Alex will talk about all that.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  Well, ridicule is a very effective weapon
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  and they're using it.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  The problem is that we're kind of gone past that stage right now.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  Rachel and Matt Al didn't get the memo soon enough.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  Right, it's the thing like they ignore you, then they fight you,
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  then you win and all that.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  So that's what we're going through right now.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  It's growing pains, but I think it's definitely
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  a growing patriot movement and I think it's a good deal.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  And speaking of ignoring, we got some sad news.
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  Jim Tucker, who was someone who really kind of
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  stayed on the trail of the Bilderberg Conference for decades
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  by himself pretty much at the beginning.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.000]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  And was totally ridiculed throughout for decades.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  And now it's come out in the light
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  and people are seeing what's happening with this.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  It's being exposed and people are fighting it.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  And so you've got mainstream newspaper people covering it.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  But as he said at the very beginning,
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  he has a famous quote that he said,
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  if 100 of the world's biggest sports figures
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  or film stars are gathered in some exclusive resort
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  behind closed doors for a private meeting,
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  the entirety of the mass media would be on hand
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  clamoring for admittance and demanding to know
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  what was going on.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  But when the world's richest bankers, media barons,
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  industrialists, members of royalty, and political leaders
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  are secretly meeting and discussing public policy matters
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  that impacted the course of the world's affairs,
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  the establishment press never said a word.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  And that's exactly true.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  We saw that this past weekend,
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  just using that comparison to athletes with the NFL draft.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  I mean, these guys, some people may know them,
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  they may be future superstars,
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  but these guys who are mostly unknown,
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  went to the draft, got drafted into the NFL
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  and it's this big media blitz.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  It's all over news networks.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  Look at how much attention the Press Credentials Party had
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  and all the celebrities that were there
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  with Obama's press conference party
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  that they had this last week.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  I mean, whenever you get politicians
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  and you get celebrities together,
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  the media goes into a feeding frenzy.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  Except that at the Bilderberg Conference,
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  they don't want anybody to know about it.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  They keep it quiet, and until just the last couple of years,
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  nobody in the mainstream press showed up at all.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  Now you're starting to get a little bit of coverage about it,
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  but nobody ever heard,
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  if you even mentioned the word Bilderberg,
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  you were laughed at as a conspiracy theorist.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  Yeah, and it's very true.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  And then they got to the point, the mainstream media,
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  they said, we'll cover it,
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  but we won't tell people what it's about.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  You know, Bill Gates and Oprah showed up
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  and they're the super friends
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  and you get that kind of spin on it.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  Well, it actually raises ethical and even legal questions
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  when you've got political leaders meeting secretly
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  with people who are from other countries,
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  other political leaders, as well as corporations.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  You have restrictions on that for ethical reasons,
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  for legal reasons.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  And so that's another reason, I think,
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  that you have these politicians slipping in and out.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  But you've got a lot of seated politicians,
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  some people who are chancellors of the Exchequer in England,
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  and it's all different countries
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  meeting with these bankers.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  And that's what Jim Tucker was talking about.
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  And unfortunately, he's now, he passed away on April 26th.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  But you know, a day before he passed away,
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  Rolling Stones came up with an article,
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  and listen to the title of this article.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  Everything is rigged, the biggest price fixing scandal ever.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  And here's the subtitle.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  The Illuminati were amateurs.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  The second huge scandal of the year
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  reveals a real international conspiracy
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  that there's no price big banks can't fix.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  And we'll talk about that a little bit more
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  right after the break.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  David Knight here with Jakari Jackson
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  and Alex has joined us at the bottom of the hour.
[04:46.000 --> 05:01.000]  A little over a year ago,
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  I began to do a lot of research into why,
[05:04.000 --> 05:05.000]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal,
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  that I was still starving.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  And my research led me to a well-known fact
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  are almost completely depleted
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  and mineral company out there
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  and discovered Younggeviti.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  The Younggeviti products are designed
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  to give you the real nutrition you need.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  And once you've got that,
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months,
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Check it out for yourself.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  It's incredible.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Go to InfowarsTeam.com today
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  and order your first canister
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  of Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  complete multivitamin mineral complex dietary supplement.
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:06.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[06:06.000 --> 06:11.000]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:11.000 --> 06:18.000]  This is David Knight here with Jakari Jackson.
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show,
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  and Alex is going to be joining us in a half hour.
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.000]  And we're just talking about some of the events
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  that have happened in the last couple of days,
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  particularly the passing of Jim Tucker.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  We're sorry to see that happen,
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  and our condolences go out to his family.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  He's survived by two sons.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  But in 2005, they released his book,
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  The Bilderberg Diary,
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  and it was subtitled
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  One Reporter's 25-Year Battle to Shine Light
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  on the World's Shadow Government.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  That pretty much sums up his work, doesn't it?
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  Oh, yeah.
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  He's been a very influential person
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.000]  at exposing Bilderberg.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  He's in some of our videos.
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  I believe he's in Endgame as well as others.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  And he was the spearhead.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  You know, we always talk about Alex being the spearhead,
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  Ron Paul being spearhead of various movements
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  and organizations,
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  but Jim was the guy spearheading exposing Bilderberg.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.000]  That's right.
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  Nobody wanted to admit it existed,
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  and when they did, admit that it existed.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  Well, it's not a big deal.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  They just get together,
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  and I'm not sure what the excuse is going to be this year,
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  but the guys just get there and they hang out
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.000]  according to the mainstream.
[07:18.000 --> 07:19.000]  Absolutely.
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.000]  Yeah, not a big deal,
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  except that when we found out in 2009,
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  we saw a leaked 1955 Bilderberg document
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  that outlined plans for a single European currency,
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  the euro.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.000]  Right.
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  And it's interesting, I think,
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.000]  that we look at the euro
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  and we see some of the same hallmarks
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  that we saw with the creation of the Federal Reserve
[07:41.000 --> 07:42.000]  here in the United States.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Many people have made a case
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  that JP Morgan actually instigated the crash of 1907,
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.000]  the panic and crash,
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  and then presented himself as a rescuer
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  and came in to mop things up and to give it a new structure,
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  which turned out to be the Federal Reserve.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  We see the same sort of thing happening now in Europe
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  with the Goldman Sachs.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  Essentially, you're seeing a liquidity crisis
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  that's going on there.
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  And listen to this,
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  because we talked about this just briefly.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  The day before Jim Tucker died,
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  after working decades in the wilderness,
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  Rolling Stones comes out and they have an article,
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.000]  everything is rigged,
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  the biggest price-fixing scandal ever.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  They said that there's no price that the big banks can't fix.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Here's the opening paragraph here.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  Conspiracy theorists of the world,
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  believers in the hidden hands of Ross Childs
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  and the Masons and the Illuminati,
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  we skeptics owe you an apology.
[08:32.000 --> 08:33.000]  You were right.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  The players may be a little different,
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  but your basic premise is correct.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  The world is a rigged game.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  And they talk about the LIBOR scandal.
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  They said three, perhaps as many as 16 banks,
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.000]  according to this article,
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  and we know this is true,
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  of the too-big-to-fail banks
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  basically manipulated global interest rates.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  When you get a variable rate loan,
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  LIBOR is what they key it to, right?
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  And that's supposed to be an honest,
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  market-based interest rate.
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  But when you've got these banks have so much power,
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  and there's so few of the large banks now,
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  it's consolidated into so few hands,
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  it's very easy for them to manipulate it.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  You don't really have a free market.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  It's not a failure of the free market.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  What we're seeing here is crony capitalism.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  We're seeing a system that is even beyond crony capitalism.
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  It's not like these guys are buying favors
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  from the government.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  They are the government, okay?
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  They're so big.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  They don't want to acknowledge that.
[09:28.000 --> 09:29.000]  That's right.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  I was about to say they don't want to admit that.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  I mean, they understand that something's going on,
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  but they don't want to think that it's that bad.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  And the magnitude of it is just astonishing.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  Far, far bigger than what happened
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  with the bank bailouts here.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  This is, just the LIBOR scandal,
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  is 500 trillion, with a T.
[09:48.000 --> 09:49.000]  500 trillion.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  So we were talking about something
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  that was about 14 trillion with TARP and that sort of thing.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  But now this is 500 trillion, and that's not it.
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.000]  It's not stopping there.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  Now there's another one that is essentially the same way
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  that has to do with a London-based firm, ICAP,
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  the world's largest broker of interest rate swaps,
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  is being investigated by American authorities
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  for behavior that sounds eerily reminiscent of a LIBOR mess.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  That's what Rolling Stone says.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  ICAP may have worked with, again,
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  up to 15 of the world's largest banks
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  to manipulate ISDA fix, a benchmark number
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  used around the world to calculate
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  the prices of interest rate swaps.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  Okay, so again, we see the same sort of thing.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  They create a liquidity crisis, just like they did with TARP.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  They use that as a way to consolidate
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  both their wealth and their power
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  and to fundamentally alter our financial system,
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  our political system.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  And you see this is going on throughout Europe,
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Cyprus.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  Exactly.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  As Nigel Farage said to the European technocrats,
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  he said, who are you?
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  You're unelected bureaucrats coming in here.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  They call these bankers technocrats
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  to give them some panache or whatever,
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  but they're basically just bankers coming in
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  and taking over and throwing out politicians
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  who have been elected.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  And I just don't get why people can't understand
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  that this is going on.
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.000]  When you see situations like Cyprus,
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  will they just take money out of your account
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  MF Global here, Gerald Cilente,
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  has been on the show several times
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  talking about his quarrels with them,
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  but people just don't want to acknowledge it.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  Even the thing recently with Chase Bank,
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  I believe it was right after Cyprus
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  and everybody had a zero balance
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  with their account for a little bit.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  Some people noticed, some people didn't,
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  and then they got their money back,
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  I guess you would say.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  And it's stuff like that.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  And think about if that happened nationwide.
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  We don't even have to go worldwide.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  If that went nationwide with Chase Bank America
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.000]  or whoever else,
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  and then people were like,
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  oh, I have no money in my account.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  What am I going to do?
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  It's truly amazing that they can get away with this.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  And it's truly amazing the magnitude of the fraud
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  that you see happening here.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  And the only country that has really
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  not fallen for this was Iceland.
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  And quite frankly,
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  I think if Iceland was a more significant
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  part of the overall economy,
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  if it had a larger impact,
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  I think you'd be seeing several politicians
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  dead by now.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  Accidentally, of course.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  Oh, yeah.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  But I think you would have had
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  something of a coup happen there,
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  as we've seen before in our country,
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  when people stand up to the Federal Reserve
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  or the bankers.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  You see that type of thing happening.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  But Iceland is the only one that said,
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  basically, we're not going to make the bankers whole.
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  We're going to let them suffer the risk that they took.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  You know, they like to privatize the profits
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  but socialize the losses.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  And they weren't going to let them do that
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  and didn't let them do that in Iceland so far.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000]  Right.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  Now, another way that things have,
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  we've seen another vindication.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  And actually, at the end of the week last week,
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  we had Politico talking about how
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  the New York Times had vindicated Breitbart.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  Here's another situation.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  And that was a story that came out,
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  it kind of became a personal thing for Andrew Breitbart.
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  Here's a quote from Politico.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  It says,
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  it shows how political appointees
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  in the Obama administration's Justice
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  and Agriculture Departments
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  turned a potential government court victory
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  into a $1.3 billion settlement
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  for Hispanic and female farmers,
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  some of whom never even claimed discrimination in court.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  And it says that this lawsuit,
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  Pigford versus Glickman,
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  was a personal cause for Breitbart
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  before he died.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  And he was basically castigated by the left
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  for his being involved in that
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  because at the time,
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  just as we see so many people on the left,
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  MSNBC, they like to portray themselves
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  as being civil libertarians,
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  as being against unnecessary wars and everything.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  That's why they like to portray themselves.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  Until their guy gets in.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  Then they'll defend it to the hilt.
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  But of course,
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  MSNBC is owned by one of the largest members
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  of the military industrial complex,
[13:53.000 --> 13:54.000]  General Electric.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  Right.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  So that's where they go.
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  And you can't have guys like Breitbart
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  who threatened to blow the whistle
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  on guys like Obama.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Right.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  You can't have him out there
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  pushing the information.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  And listen to the absurdity of this.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  This is a program that was supposed to help
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  poor rural farmers, right?
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  And in Maple Hill,
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  now this is from the New York Times article,
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  it says a struggling town in southeastern North Carolina,
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  the number of people paid was nearly four times
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  the total number of farms in the area.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  Wow.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  Okay.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  More than one in nine African American adults
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  there received checks.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  And in Little Rock, Arkansas,
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  a confidential list of payments shows
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  that 10 members of one extended family
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  collected a total of a half million dollars
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  and dozens of other successful claimants
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  shared addresses, phone numbers,
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  or close family connections.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  Again, we see not only the corruption
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  but just the basic incompetence of the government
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  in terms of doing this.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  I mean, at some of these levels,
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  this is not something that is necessarily,
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  as far as we can tell at this point,
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  something going to bankers,
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  but this is something that is just massive incompetence
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  and then just kind of doubling down on their program
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  and not being open to restoring something.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  Exactly.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  But setting up entitlement programs
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  to just get ripped off
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  and then not wanting to be embarrassed
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  and shut those things down.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  And we see that people get embarrassed
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  with their entitlement programs.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  Like you said, we saw Project Veritas.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  They go to Acorn and, hey, I'm a pimp
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  and I need a house for my hookers
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  and Project Acorn is selling them.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  Yeah, we can do all that.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  And then they get embarrassed by the videos
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  and they shut the stuff down.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  And I definitely recognize there are people
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  who need various assistance,
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  but you don't want them to become dependent,
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  lifelong recipients of this.
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  Absolutely.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  We're going to be talking a little bit more
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  about how things are changing
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  and one of the ways that they're accelerating
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  right after this break.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  I'm David Knight with Jakari Jackson.
[15:45.000 --> 16:10.000]  Alex will be joining us at the bottom
[16:10.000 --> 16:25.000]  of the show.
[16:25.000 --> 16:53.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[16:53.000 --> 17:03.000]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  runs from bad to worse.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  and starve patriots out
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  and important preparedness items
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  at InfowarsShop.com.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  These are items that I did research on
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  that I personally use.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  You've got the LifeStraw
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  so you can turn fetid water into safe water
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.000]  anywhere you go.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  The Ktor Handcrank Generator
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  to charge up key equipment
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  during power outages or out in the field.

[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  Handcrank shortwave AM-FM radios.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  Everything that we've researched

[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  This is an amazing deal.

[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  But if you don't have a home security system,
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  then you're missing a critical weapon
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  in your arsenal for home protection.

[20:17.000 --> 20:23.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  in the heart of the resistance,
[20:26.000 --> 20:32.000]  rallying patriots worldwide.
[20:32.000 --> 20:39.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  Ja'kari Jackson and David Nye filling in for Alex,
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  but he will be joining us, I believe, in the next segment,
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  so stay tuned for that.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  Now, David, I want to dovetail on something we spoke about
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  in the last second.
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  Let's talk about the assistance programs
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  that often make people dependent.
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.000]  Mike Adams has this article,
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  Obama administration openly pushing food stamps to illegals.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  Now, why would you say Obama would do this?
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  Let's take a look at what Mike has to say.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  Documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  reveal that the Obama administration
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  is actively marketing the federal food stamp program
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  to illegal immigrants.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  A Spanish-speaking flyer obtained by Judicial Watch says,
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  quote, you need not divulge information
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  regarding your immigration status
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  in seeking this benefit for your children, end quote.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  So, David, we see-
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  They said that they're marketing it.
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  Yeah, they're marketing it.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  This isn't just something that's, you know,
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  you can learn in whispers and, hey, some guy told me this,
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  you can see a actual flyer.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  You can, you know, go to the local grocery store
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  or wherever else they have this flyer
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  and see this and say,
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  we don't need to know your immigration status.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  And we saw a similar thing with the free driver's licenses
[21:43.000 --> 21:44.000]  in various states.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  We don't need to know where you're from.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  You don't have to give us any thumbprints or fingerprints.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  And, you know, I'm not for biometrics,
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  but here in Texas, to get my Texas license,
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  I had to get my biometrics.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  I'm from Oklahoma.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  So people can come from another country,
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  go to a state that doesn't require such requirements
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  and get their driver's licenses.
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  Well, you know, what you're seeing here
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  is the same sort of thing that you're-
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  They're trying to grow their bureaucracy
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  in the same way that Homeland Security
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  tries to grow their bureaucracy through fear.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Okay, these people try to grow their bureaucracy
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  just by getting more people on the rolls.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  You know, and you've got two things here
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  that one is a pet project of the left.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  The other is a pet project of the right.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  And this false dichotomy that we've got here.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  One, the right wants to spend unlimited amounts of money
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  on the military industrial complex.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  And the left wants to spend unlimited amounts of money
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  on a welfare state.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  And the simple fact of the matter is,
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  is that you have people that need to be helped in a society.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  The worst way to do it is the most centralized way
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  to take everything up to Washington to get it done.
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  Okay, because these people are just interested in building empires.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  They're not really interested in helping people.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  And they want to get dependence on the state.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  They want people who are dependent on the state.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  Where they can get you there by financial dependence
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  or they can get you there because they've got you scared to death
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  and clamoring to be kept safe.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  They want you to be dependent on the state.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  And when you criticize these programs,
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  you're called racist and you hate this group
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.000]  or you hate that group.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  I mean, Alex brings up the point all the time.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  I can't go down to Mexico and, you know,
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  have a child born for free.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  I can't get free health care in Mexico.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  I get stopped at the Mexico board if I want to go to Mexico.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  But it's somehow racist if we have a border
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  that checks people from the other side, you know,
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  from Mexico coming in, that's racist.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  But I get stopped when I go to the Mexico border.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  Right, and the easiest way to stop these abuses
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  is to make them happen at the lowest possible level,
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  the most personal level.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  That's why personal charity and churches helping people,
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  that was the ideal way to do it.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  That's the way it was in America when de Tocqueville came.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  It was done on a personal level
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  and people could see who really needed it.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  They could see if somebody was getting assistance
[23:51.000 --> 23:52.000]  and they were just kind of,
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  okay, I'm just going to slack off, you know.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  And at that point, you kind of pull back and say,
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  now you need to start working, you know,
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  because you need to get back on your feet.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  But if you have a large and personal bureaucracy,
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  they not only don't help the people very well
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  who really do need it,
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  but they give help to people who don't need it.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  And it's just because of that
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  impersonal centralized failure, really.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  But it's not really a failure
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  because it was designed to create dependence.
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  That's the key thing.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  Just like we talk about these security issues,
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  just as Sebelle Edmonds said,
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  the real drill wasn't the bomb drill
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  that was happening simultaneously.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  The real drill was to see how people reacted to it.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  Well, you say something when somebody demands
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  that you come out of your own house at gunpoint.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  That's a good point.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  That's the real point of that.
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  That was a real test.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  You know, what are Americans going to do,
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  especially Americans, let's say, in the Northeast?
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  It might be a little bit different down here.
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.000]  In Texas, maybe it's not.
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.000]  I mean, we've gone around,
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  there's a lot of people that have that same mindset.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  Right.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  Guys, this is a little off topic.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Can you go and look and see
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  what the murder rate was this weekend in Chicago?
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  If you guys just look that up,
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  because we brought up a point last week
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  when 10 people get killed in Chicago over the weekend,
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  they don't lock down a city.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  That's right.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  Most of them don't lock down a city block
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  trying to catch these guys.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Well, just look at the difference
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  in the way you have the crimes
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  that the abortion doctor in Philadelphia committed, right?
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  The media is not really initially interested in doing that.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  And not until their non-coverage became a story
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  did they start to run,
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  did the big papers start to run stories on that.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Breitbart's organization showed pictures
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  of empty benches there.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  And so they started running some stories
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  at that point in time,
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  but their excuse was,
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  this is just a local crime story.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  Well, Sandy Hook was a local crime story
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  from that same benchmark,
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  and yet they are still talking about that months later,
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  continually showing people who were victims of that.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  Right.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  And you could also say
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  that the Boston bombing was a local story,
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  but they're picking that up
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  because it's something that feeds their agenda.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  Their narrative.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  Exactly.
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  And it's something that they're using it to change,
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  to fundamentally change things here domestically.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  And as C. Bell Edmonds talked about,
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  it looks like they're using it
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  to justify some more of these foreign interventions.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  So they've got both a domestic
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  and an international agenda
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  that they feed with this.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  And exactly.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  We heard the,
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  I believe it's the police commissioner of Boston
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  saying he wants drones
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  at the next Boston marathon
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  and all kinds of craziness
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  and Bloomberg saying that we were next
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  of referring to New York
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  and maybe they were,
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.000]  I don't know.
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  Maybe they were.
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  I want to see some evidence
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.000]  other than just Bloomberg's word.
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  Yeah, that's why I say
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  I want to know more about this,
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  just like I still want to see
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  photos or images of these guys
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  placing these bombs down.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  Exactly.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  And we still have it.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  All we have is even the governor,
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  Deval Patrick,
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  said that it had been described to him,
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  but the FBI didn't show him
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  the pictures of the bombs,
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  of the backpacks being set down.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  And so even from that standpoint,
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  there's an international agenda going on
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  that they're supporting with this,
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  a domestic agenda of a police state
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  that's going on with this.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  But even the people who are getting angry at us,
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  like Dan Badandi was talking about
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  his lin laws were just furious with him
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  because he was trying to get to the truth
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  and asked him about a bomb drill
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  and various other things
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  that other media wasn't asking.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  There is also an issue of justice being done.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  When we have a case like this
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  where it's a high-profile case,
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  we have children killed,
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  you have people maimed for life,
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  or you have a policeman killed,
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  there's always a rush to try to find somebody
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  that they can pin this on,
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  whether it's the right person or not.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  We see that over and over again,
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  a beautiful example of that
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  if you haven't seen it
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  is the Thin Blue Line,
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  that documentary where they did that,
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  a guy was on death row
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  accused of killing a policeman.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  They had rushed him into that,
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  and decades later,
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  they were still absolutely certain
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  they had the right guy.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  But the guy who did that documentary
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  had the murderer actually confess.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  He actually did the investigation.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  So you want to make sure
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  that the right people are punished for this.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  When you punish an innocent person,
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  that's bad.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  Not only that,
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  the real perpetrator is still out there.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  Exactly.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  When you punish an innocent person,
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  that's bad,
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  but you're also letting the guilty
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  go free when you do that.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  So we want to ask these questions
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  because we know how this is being used
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  to feed an agenda,
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  international and domestic,
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  and we also want to see justice done.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  And people who just want to say,
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  well, we're finished,
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  they caught somebody,
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  that's not really respecting
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  the victims at all.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  No.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  And the victims,
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  they're very emotional
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  and they want somebody to blame,
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  which I can understand that,
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  but you definitely want to look
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  at all the angles.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  We've not seen one image
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  of the Boston Bombers allegedly,
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  the suspects placing a bomb.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  We have not seen any other type of evidence.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  It's just the FBI's word for it.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Take our word for it.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  Don't look at any other images.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  Look at these two guys.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  This is all you need to see right here.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  And we've seen that happen before.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  We're going to be joined right after the break
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  with Alex Jones,
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  so stick around.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  He's going to have some more analysis
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  of what's going on.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  Be right back.
[28:52.000 --> 29:02.000]  In the last two years alone,
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  the U.S. has seen huge losses
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  to our food supply.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  In 2011, storms and floods
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  raged across the U.S.,
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  in the country in more than 50 years.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  You may think out of sight, out of mind,
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  and so you don't think you will be affected.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  The fact is, you are.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  We all are.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature,
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  but you can control your food prices
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  by freezing the cost and availability
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  of your food supply
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  with eFoods Direct.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  Be prepared before you need it

[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  you can store for up to 25 years.
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  You can hope for the best,
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  but hope won't feed you.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  Do what I've done
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  and get your own supply

[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  and now the new bird flu
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  recently discovered in China,
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  there has never been a more crucial time

[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  to help protect you and your family.

[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  You're next.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  Hitler took the guns.
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  Stalin took the guns.
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  Mao took the guns.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  1776 will commence again
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  if you try to take our firearms.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  The Republic will rise again
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  when you attempt to take our guns.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  internal hostility
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  against every form of tyranny
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  over the mind of man.
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  Jecari Jackson and David Knight.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  We are now joined by Alex
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  who's joined us video Skype.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  Can you hear us, Alex?
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  I can, gentlemen.
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.000]  Thank you so much for having me
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  on the broadcast today.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  A lot to talk about.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  I know that you were getting into the fact
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  that we're winning.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  It's not that the mainstream corporate media
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  is validating us.
[34:39.000 --> 34:40.000]  We don't need their validation.
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  It's that they're panicking.
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  They're freaking out.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  Their share of the listener
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  and viewership and readership
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  is imploding.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  This is a major sign worldwide
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  that they're having to admit
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  in the Rolling Stone
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  and New York Times
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  and so many other places
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  that the American people
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  and the people of the world
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  are awakening to private, corporate,
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  basically mafia organizations.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  You know, J. Edgar Hoover,
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  famously back in the early 1950s
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  before Congress,
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.000]  I talk about this a lot
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  because it's so important.
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.000]  He said, look,
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  La Cosa Nostra, organized crime,
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  is a conspiracy theory.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  He said it doesn't exist.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  And we know that's because
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  the police in this country,
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  across the board,
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  were being paid off,
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  especially at the federal level,
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  by organized crime.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  Every American listening to me right now,
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  every European,
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  every Japanese person,
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  every Latin American,
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  we're all laughing going,
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  you mean people in the 40s and 50s
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  didn't believe organized crime existed.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  That's true.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  People knew that gangsters existed
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  that would shoot each other up
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  but not organized,
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  big corporate operations.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  The truth is the Federal Reserve
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  is organized crime.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  And now you've got
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  all these news articles admitting,
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  wow, the interest rates are fixed
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  by big insiders.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  Wow, the stock market is fixed.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  They'll burn a Martha Stewart
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  for doing nothing wrong
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  and then let foreign banks
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  steal billions a day.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  It's estimated just some of the
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  flash trading is 2 or 3 billion a day,
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  stealing that from regular people
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  in the stock market,
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  stealing that from pension funds,
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  stealing that from investments,
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  stealing that from portfolios.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  And now the Rolling Stone comes out
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  and lists an entire raft of fraud.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  Listen, they have been taking,
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.000]  for 20 years in this country,
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  houses that are 100% paid off.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  I don't mean you're behind
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  on your mortgage
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  and they cheat you in the contract
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  and take it before they're allowed to.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  I mean they take houses.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  Famously, you can look at
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  Bank of America
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  has bank accounts seized
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  out of Florida
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  where a judge did the right thing
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  where they'd taken a million dollar house
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  that had been paid for for a decade.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  They never had a note.
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  They never owned a note.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  The house had been paid for in cash.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  They just took a 1.2 million dollar house
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  because they felt like it.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  If they can get away with this,
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  they can get away with anything.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  And now enter Jim Tucker.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  You're a radio listener
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  and you're saying,
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  who is Jim Tucker?
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  Well, I think it was West Book Pegler
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  back in the 40s and 50s a few times
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  had run into Bilderberg Group meetings
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  in Jekyll Island, Georgia
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  and also in New York
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  and he'd written about it.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  What are world leaders and royalty,
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  150 or so,
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  meeting in secret doing under high security?
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  Why won't the press report on it?
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  Well, it was Tucker, a sports writer,
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  who was very successful
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  and also a news editor
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  at major East Coast newspapers.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  I mean, he ran the Washington newspapers,
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  New York newspapers, you name it.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  He then discovered all of this
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  off of Pegler's writings
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  and began to cover it in the 70s
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  and until about eight years ago,
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  mainstream corporate press in the US said
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Bilderberg Group does not exist
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  and you are basically an extremist
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  if you say it does.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  It's code for racism.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  It's code for this and that.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  There's no shadowy mega corporations
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  buying and selling your politicians,
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  which of course,
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  the minutes of Bilderberg have been leaked.
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  They've been stolen.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  We now know that's the case.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  They just released WikiLeaks minutes,
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  you know, with top Bilderberg Group member
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  Henry Kissinger saying,
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  we do illegal immediately.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  Constitutional takes a little more time.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  The Italian Supreme Court just went public.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  With working with the US government
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  and NATO in the 80s,
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  staging terror attacks to blame it
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  on political left and right.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  Whoever was getting popular,
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  but what was truly populist,
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  they would just blow something up
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  and blame it on them.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  I think we've heard of that before
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  using their intelligence assets
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  and patsies as part of the NATO option.
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  So the fact that he since the 1974
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  is when he started out.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  That's the year I was born.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  So let's be technical.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  38 years ago,
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  it took him about five years
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  to figure out the name of it.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  Imagine one guy off of one other
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  famous political reporter
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  who'd just done a few stories on it
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  and, you know, wondered what it was.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  Then being able today,
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  Bilderberg is now admitted to be real.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  People admit there's a global corporate elite
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  that doesn't want free market,
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  that wants monopolies.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  It's just like the bullets for the first year.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  We're now about two years into this.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  We're almost, I don't know, 17, 18 months,
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  a little more than a year and a half.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  They would say there are no bullets.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  When it was a half a million bullets,
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  or excuse me, half a billion bullets,
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  and then a billion bullets,
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  and then two billion bullets,
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  and then 2.2 billion bullets
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  the last 18, 19 months,
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  whatever it is, a little over a year and a half.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  Now they're having congressional hearings
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  and the White House-run MSNBC
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  with its pathetic audience,
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  a half a million people at one time,
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  are begging, saying,
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  don't look at this.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  Don't listen to Alex Jones' conspiracy theories.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  The evil Alex Jones did these articles.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  The evil Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com posted them.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  I mean, we're going to play a clip next hour.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  The point here is,
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  is that they're saying none of this exists.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  Meanwhile, they say it doesn't exist,
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  but then in the article say,
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  well, we did buy over two billion bullets,
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  but we got delivery of a billion
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  and a billion more coming,
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  but it's not to kill you.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  It's not for domestic use,
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  even though Homeland Security is domestic
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  and they're trying to take on Tea Party gun owners,
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  returning veterans,
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  that's in their own memos.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  They've got paper targets of little kids
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  and pregnant women saying all of this.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  This is all absolutely,
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  totally and completely over the top,
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  off the charts, insane,
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  that they're now saying,
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  okay, we did buy the bullets,
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  but you're discredited.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  They're not for you,
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  when all their memos,
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  all their documentation show that.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  The system is counting on people being ignorant,
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  but as soon as the public learns
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  that the system is moving towards a cold blooded aim,
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  as soon as they realize it's offshore mega banks
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  that want to make you poor,
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  want to destroy sovereignty,
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  wanted to ship the jobs overseas,
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  wanted to shut down the power plants
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  because they've already invested in China,
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  India, Mexico,
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  and 160 other third world countries.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  As soon as all that is clear
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  that the globalists have moved out of America,
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  instead of a military attack,
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  they caused an infiltration attack of government
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  to set up a police state
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  while economically moving all of our industry offshore
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  to areas they control.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  So they become incredibly profitable.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  They become the only central controllers
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  of industrial and technological development,
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  even off-sourcing our military might,
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  and then they've basically economically
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  brought us under their control
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  so they can now economically bankrupt us
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  and take us through a process of domestication
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  and forcing everyone either into government contracts,
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  government jobs, or welfare,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  or the criminal justice system,
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  or the psychological warfare system
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  that they call the psychological system.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  And this is all stated by them.
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  They think you're so dumb,
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  and this is where they've miscalculated,
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  they think you're so dumb
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  that they've written textbooks and documents
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  and papers admitting all this,
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  and now they have a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  People like Rachel Maddow freaking out online,
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  absolutely pulling their hair out,
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  just going crazy right now.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  We're going to play some clips of this in the next hour,
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  saying how dare Ron Paul,
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  how dare Alex Jones,
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  how dare Drudge Report,
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  how dare, how dare anyone be able to challenge us
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  when they're discredited.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  You can only get your info from us.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  We sit up here and we lecture you
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  and talk to you like you're five years old
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  and tell you that liberty is dead.
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  And by the way, Americans need to roll over
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  and die and pay for foreigners to have their babies here
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  and pay for all their welfare.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  That's a form of, you know,
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  a form of hospitality is for liberty lovers
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  to roll over and die politically.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  Well, we're not going to roll over and die,
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  and tyranny will go down.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  Liberty will defeat tyranny.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  We'll come right back after this quick break.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  I'm Alex Jones, Jacari Jackson and David Knight.
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.000]  Stay with us.

[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  In the last two years alone,
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S.,
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.000]  in more than 50 years.
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  You may think out of sight, out of mind,
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  and so you don't think you will be affected.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  The fact is you are. We all are.
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633

[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  Now that we have moved into the winter season,
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  Our most popular silver-based products
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions,
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal applicators,
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.000]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.000]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  while delivering the silver more effectively.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  Visit www.silverlungs.com
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  and click on our store page
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  to find what silver-based products are best for you.
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[47:02.000 --> 47:05.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:05.000 --> 47:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  Big Brother.
[47:19.000 --> 47:22.000]  Mainstream media.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  Government cover-ups.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  You want answers?
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  Well, so does he.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  Yes, my friends, and I am Alex Jones,
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  here with you on the road, as I will be tomorrow
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  and the next day, and then back in Austin, Texas.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  The Health Ranger's going to be sitting in some as well.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  Mike Adams.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.000]  for everybody out there.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  And I'll let Jacari, Jackson, and David Knight
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  give you that Sunday number.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  Don't forget, we're here every Sunday,
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  with a syndicated Sunday broadcast.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  I want to thank all the M&FM affiliates out there
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  who carried the broadcast, who are helping defend the republic
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  from enemies foreign and domestic.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  We also have the weekday show, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern,
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  also carried on XM 166.
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  And again, what I'm getting at here is
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  we're in a culture war.
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.000]  And what the so-called liberals do,
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  who are really authoritarians,
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  what they do is they sit up there
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  and just laugh and mock at everyone.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  And they sit there with a moral high ground
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  talking about how smart their constituents are.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  When I've gone out in California and Texas
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  and so have our crews in places like Austin,
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  where, quote, trendies are at,
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  and they call for banning water,
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  they call for confiscating all guns,
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  they call.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  I had John Baum with Mark Dice out in California last week
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  with ThisIsOnInfoWars.com.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  They signed people that spoke English
[48:47.000 --> 48:53.000]  petitions to bring a Nazi rule to end American freedom.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  And as long as you said it's for Obama,
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  they would sign it.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  Because, they're on the winning team.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  Why think? Why know anything?
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  Why not know that Obama's run by foreign banks,
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  set to shut down all our power plants?
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  I mean, a foreign enemy couldn't do this.
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  It's already happening.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  I mean, who's to know they want to break us
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  and domesticate us?
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  But I get back to Jim Tucker
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  of American Free Press,
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  whose family was visiting him yesterday
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  and he fell down the steps and went to the hospital and died.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  I've known Jim for about 16 years.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  I've known him personally
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  for about a decade or so.
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  You know, at Bilderberg events and other things with him.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  And he was just an old-fashioned gumshoe reporter
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  with a straw hat the whole nine yards.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  He was a news reporter, sports reporter,
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  editor of major newspapers.
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  He didn't believe any of this.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  And he set out to disprove
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  basically Westbrook Pegler.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  And to find out that, you know,
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  what had been reported in the 50s wasn't true.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  There's no shadowy group.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  There's not 150 royalty and bankers
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  meeting in secret with politicians.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  I would know about it.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  And I'm repeating what Jim said in my film
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement 2007,
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  where he laid all that out.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  And then, of course, he discovered it was all real.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  So they tell you there's no New World Order.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  There's no global government.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  There's no insider trading by big banks.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  There's no price fixing.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  There's no stock market fixing.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  There's no fixing of any of this going on,
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  the interest rates.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  And then it all comes out.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  So now we're to the point where
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  liberal magazines that are real liberal writers,
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  I guess Matt Taibbi, you could say,
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  or anybody that has any conscience,
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  conservatives, libertarians,
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  have to come together and say,
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  look, we're just Americans and freedom lovers
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  who don't want to be run by foreign banks.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  I mean, when you read the Financial Times of London
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  and the minutes of the Davos Switzerland meetings
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  and the leaks of the Bilderberg meeting,
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  they say we're going to bankrupt all nations
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  until everybody is totally under government control
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  for social engineering,
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  and we're going to shut off the power
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  and make everybody incredibly poor,
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  except for us, the elite,
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  because we don't like you using our globalist resources.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  And then after we get you all poor and dumbed down,
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  then we're going to start one-child policies
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.000]  and reducing your numbers.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Everything China, with the CIA
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  putting Mao Zedong in power in 49,
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  all declassified,
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  China was the model.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  You want to know what America's going to be like?
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  China.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Suicide nets, mass executions,
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  one-child policies, hell on earth.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  That's what they want.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  And so, again, they try to sit there and say,
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  there are no bullets being bought.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  There are no armored vehicles being bought.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  There are no cameras watching you.
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  We're not listening to you without warrants.
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  Now they go, you know what?
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  We are watching you.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  We are buying bullets, but it's for your safety.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  We are buying armored vehicles,
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  but it's for your safety.
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  And the people that talk about it,
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  they're extremists and they're bad.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  I mean, anybody can type in
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  Congress investigates DHS bullet purchases,
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  and you will see hundreds of articles,
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  AP, Reuters, White House-run media matters,
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  you name it,
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  sitting there going, ah,
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  Jones and Ron Paul and others
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  are discredited for the bullets.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  Yes, we bought 2 billion, 200 million.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  Yes, but they're not for you.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  And then, again, the army manuals
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  that we can put on screen for TV viewers,
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  you can type in army manual for reeducation camp,
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  army manual to shoot gun owners.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  And you type that in, it'll be at army.mil
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  with those exact words.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  I mean, it's not me saying reeducation camp
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  and extrapolating these political dissident
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  camps they're building.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  It's their term, reeducation camp.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  In fact, if they pull that up,
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  the crew can read you that FM number
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  from army.mil.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  So I'm not trying to scare you.
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.000]  People say, oh, he's trying to scare us.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  No, no, if this is going on,
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  it's unconstitutional, it's illegal.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  You get back to American values
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  of small government,
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  a constitutional republic,
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  restoring the Bill of Rights due process.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  They're trying to go in the opposite direction.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  And you notice as they get rid of
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  all the prosperity disappears.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  So the good news is
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  the American instinct,
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  government has all this security,
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  is dug in, arming to the teeth,
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  surveilling us,
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  but says don't be paranoid.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  You need to just let us spy on you
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  and be the only ones with the guns.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  Common sense is coming back
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  because the prosperity is leaving.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  And everyone saw that martial law
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  drill in Boston with everyone
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  in half the city having to put their
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  hands up and come out with their hands up
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  as if they were all guilty.
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  And then the lockdown caused them
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  not to catch the patsy,
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  who it turns out they were CIA.
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  That's mainstream news.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  Look it up on infowars.com.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  They were being set up.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  They were being used to undermine Russia.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  They were set up as patsies,
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  probably part of a drill.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  Everything we talked about
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  now being confirmed.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  So I want to get Ja'Kari Jackson
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  and David Knight's take on this
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  as we go out to break.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  And then we're going to come back
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  and analyze a plethora of news articles
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  and the media making fun of
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  planetinfowars.com,
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  which is planetinfowars.com's
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  dating service.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  Now, folks, we have a social network.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  I never even really promoted it,
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  even though it's got over a million people on it.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  And that's wrong I don't promote it.
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  I set it up.
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  People wanted it.
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  You got it.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  And people created a dating thing,
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  just like they have camping and shooting
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  and art stuff and just,
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  I mean, thousands of different things on there.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  There's the Ask Alex area is popular,
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  the Ron Paul area,
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  the Nightly News area,
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  the Ja'Kari Jackson area.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  Anybody can go create it there.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  And they made fun of it.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  Rachel Maddow said,
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  you got to make money off of it.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  She's a woman that gets taxpayer money
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  on record in the stimulus and bailout
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  to fund MSNBC,
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  who on record is tax-free.
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  See, the big mega banks,
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  and by the way, GE is a bank,
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  they're tax-exempt.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  Google is basically tax-exempt.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  All these big billionaires are offshore.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  They go, oh, raise my taxes.
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  I don't pay enough.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  They mean they're domestic tax.
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  They have loopholes on
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  because they want more tax on the middle class
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  to politically destroy you.
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  It's not even about money they want.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  They have unlimited fiat.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  It's about social control.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  They want to be the only ones
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  with the money.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  They don't like a free market.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  They don't like prosperity.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  Communism and socialism
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  doesn't create prosperity,
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  but it's always run by mega rich
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  who are offshore above it.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  It's nothing but slavery,
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  but they sell it in every globalist-funded
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  university and TV show as freedom.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  Che Guevara, bull crap.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  Our government put Lenin in.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  Our filthy New World Order
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  banker-controlled government,
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  occupational government put Mao in.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  Look it up, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  Look it all up.
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  But they want communist states
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  that will work with them.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  When they turn against them occasionally,
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  it's because they're not working with them
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  like Hugo Chavez,
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  not saying he's a good guy,
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  saying he's somebody who they didn't control.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  So what I'm getting at here is
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  they're panicking right now
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  because if you wake up to what they've done,
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  they all go to jail
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  like Bernie Madoff and Ken Lay.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  And 2014 is so key.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  I'm not a Republican or a Democrat,
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  but it's the Democrats that are
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  the hardcore globalists in our face.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  And that's why we've got to get
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  a three-party libertarian constitutionalist
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  in Congress.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  And you're seeing them
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  have the hearings on the bullets.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  They're my listeners.
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.000]  You're seeing it in the news.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  Look at this Congress person
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  quoting Alex Jones and tweeting him.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  What are we going to do?
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Rachel Maddow says they're taking over.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  What are we going to do?
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  It's the Republican Party
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  is the avenue for us.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  Run everybody for county, city,
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  state, federal.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  Run like your life depends on it.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  As libertarians, as Republicans,
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  like Ron Paul did back in the 90s,
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  get in and sabotage them.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  If they take something like
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  30-something seats,
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  it's over, folks.
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000]  They're going to have the House,
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  the Senate, and everything.
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  You want a separation of powers.
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  You want a separation
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  in the Constitution.
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  You don't want one group in power.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  That's called Nazi Germany
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  or Soviet Russia.
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  Gentlemen, take us out to break.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  Tell me what else you've got.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  I know you've got a big stack of news,
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  both of you,
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  David Knight and Jacari Jackson,
[56:30.000 --> 56:31.000]  coming up after I leave
[56:31.000 --> 56:32.000]  in about 30 minutes.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  I'll be 30 minutes into the next hour.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  Right.
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  Coming up after Alex leaves us,
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  we're going to have the bullet story.
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  We're also going to talk
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  about some drills,
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  and that's where we're going
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  to open the phones up.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  I definitely want to talk
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  to the people who saw the drills
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  in St. Louis.
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.000]  If you were in Oakland
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  when the FBI came
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  to take your guns.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  Also, if you're outside Chicago,
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  I believe it's Tinley Park,
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  we want to talk to you.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  What else do you have, David?
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  Well, you know,
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  I just see this
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  as how it's accelerating.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  You know, it took 25 years
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  by himself or Jim Tucker,
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  and now it was like one year
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  and the bullets become an issue
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  in just a matter of days,
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  and this false flag thing
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  becomes an issue.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  So it's getting faster and faster.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  Yeah, because we talk
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  about things accelerating,
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  but they're also accelerating
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  on the cause of liberty.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  That's right.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  You know, people waking up,
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  you know, we've got
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  faster information.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  So it's not just...
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  Oh yeah, you watch that video,
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  just to throw this in,
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  you watch that video,
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  she's scared.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  I mean, I know body language.
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  They're trying to act confident.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  They can feel it.
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  But here's the thing,
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  they don't have an audience anymore.
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  They literally don't have
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.000]  an audience, they're a joke.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  But they've still got
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  the government and the power.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  They are deadly, dangerous.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  They are mortal enemies
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.000]  of this country.
[57:34.000 --> 57:35.000]  Second hour with Sha'Carri Jackson,
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  myself, Alex Jones,
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  and David Knight,
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  and your calls straight ahead.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  We are the republic.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  We are the resistance.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.000]  We are America.
[57:43.000 --> 58:01.000]  USA, USA, USA for liberty.
[58:13.000 --> 58:36.000]  USA, USA, USA for liberty.
[58:36.000 --> 58:51.000]  USA, USA for liberty.
[58:51.000 --> 59:02.000]  USA, USA for liberty.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  USA, USA for liberty.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  USA, USA for liberty.
[59:08.000 --> 59:17.000]  USA, USA for liberty.
[59:17.000 --> 59:24.000]  USA, USA for liberty.
[59:24.000 --> 59:31.000]  USA, USA for liberty.
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  USA, USA for liberty.

[59:52.400 --> 01:00:02.840]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:09.400]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:21.320]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.520]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Jakari Jackson, David Knight, and Alex Jones, he's
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.480]  joining us via Skype, he's on the road.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.960]  But first, before we get to some more serious topics, I just want to go over a few things
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.160]  that we haven't had a chance to cover that much in these last couple of weeks.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:40.440]  We have this article here from Fox News, reps challenge DHS ammo buy, say agency using 1,000
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.520]  more rounds per person than the army.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.360]  Yeah, and you know what's amazing about that is, I think even more significant is that
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.600]  that's four times the amount of ammunition that a soldier uses, right?
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.620]  I mean, when you look at numbers like that, it's kind of like, well, I don't know how
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.040]  many they use, but soldiers are using about 350.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.000]  They're using on average about 1,450.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.960]  And remember, this is after Obama says he wants a domestic security force that's just
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.800]  as competent and just as capable and just as well funded as the United States military.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.360]  So we see this with DHS, where they have 1,000 rounds more per person, and I'll read this
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.360]  quickly.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.620]  Jason Chafte has said on Thursday that the Department of Homeland Security is using roughly
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:30.440]  1,000 rounds more ammunition than the US Army as he and other lawmakers sharply question
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.000]  DHS officials on their massive ammo buy.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Well, look at the way-
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.560]  And again, they're panicking because it's infowars.com that broke this, it's drudgereport.com
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.860]  that rammed it out into the mainstream news.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:47.240]  And they hate it because, again, when they had 1.6 billion, it was enough for what, 27
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.660]  years of an Iraq war.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:54.840]  Now it's something like for a 35-year war, and they're saying the number is 70,000 feds.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.100]  There's not 70,000 armed feds, it's more like 20,000.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.140]  So the number is like three times that.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.820]  This is big, this is the proof.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.320]  And look, if you're going to sneak attack somebody, you don't want them knowing you're
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.620]  about to sneak attack.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.720]  You don't buy decades worth of something in order to save money, and you don't buy hollow
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.120]  points to save money.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.940]  And their excuse is, well, we don't have it all right now, they're still shipping it over
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.700]  to us, and well, you still bought it.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.200]  Well, and if you look at the narrative, this Nick Nayak, the chief procurement officer
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.640]  for Homeland Security, says, the number's really 750.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.300]  That's not true, they're RFPs.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:33.720]  First they had one for 250 million, then they had a 450 million, then they had a 750 million,
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.640]  then they had another 250.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.640]  Those are all separate.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.640]  Hold on, I think you should say all that.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.240]  I think you should say that when we come back in the next segment.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.160]  Save that, cuz some stations don't carry this five minutes.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160]  I think it's important.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.720]  Cuz David, you've really ferreted into the numbers, and done a bunch of reports from
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720]  Four's Nightly News.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.200]  But just to go from my background research, basically 2.2 billion bullets have been ordered.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.560]  Around a billion in the last year and a half have been delivered, and then they said the
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.280]  rest is over the next few years.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.240]  But then that's not true, cuz they keep ordering more every month.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.880]  Basically it's whatever the manufacturers can produce, they'll accept to dry up the
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880]  supply.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]  That's what's really going on.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.240]  I mean, this isn't even for a war with us, even though that's part of it.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.440]  This is about drying it up.
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.600]  I've talked to FBI agents off record, federal marshals, and police, and they all concur.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.680]  They're told this is to dry up civilian ammo.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.360]  Absolutely, because the military has their own manufacturing capacity that they run by
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.360]  themselves.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.360]  That's right.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.340]  Homeland security is going into the commercial market.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:35.920]  And there's an article on infowars.com today that US companies have purchased 900 million
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.480]  rounds of ammo from Russia.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.320]  Now that's another part where this UN arms trade treaty is coming in, because that's
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  where they wanna try to control that.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.360]  You can't get your arms from overseas, you get your ammunition from overseas.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360]  That's right.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.760]  And by the way, the same denial, we posted NRA articles last week.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.480]  We posted the links to the senators' websites.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.920]  We posted links to Obama's announcements.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:03.640]  And there were bots on infowars.com and YouTube saying, this is a lie, it's not happening.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.560]  And again, folks, it's a standard military op.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.440]  We had links to the bullet purchases on the federal sites.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.840]  We had links to the congressional announcements, the presidential announcements.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.440]  And they still just say, you're a liar.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.440]  You're discredited.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.200]  And it's a mind game counting on the general public they know doesn't go look it up.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.640]  The problem is once the public goes and looks it up once and finds out they're being lied
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.640]  to, they lose all credibility.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.680]  When we make mistakes on action and we come back and tell you about it, because we want
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.880]  you to know it was a mistake.
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.080]  We want you to trust us, but to trust us to go look it up.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:42.360]  Never believe what we say, because I want you to go verify it to know how real we are.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360]  Absolutely.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360]  Exactly.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]  They don't put links in their stories.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.240]  We are the only ones, you know, MSNBC doesn't link it.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.760]  Oh yeah, you read CNN, you read Fox, you read mainly US Today, there's no links.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760]  Exactly.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]  That's right.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.720]  Yeah, we neurotically link and photograph and video everything, Jacari Jackson, David
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.720]  Knight.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.640]  In the last few years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011, storms
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.480]  and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone in 2012.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.800]  We saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years, you may think out of
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.880]  sight out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.440]  The fact is you are we all are food shortages drive prices up for everyone, you might not
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.840]  be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the

[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:17.160]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show jakari Jackson David Knight and Alex Jones
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.560]  he is on the road but he is still with us.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.520]  So we have a video listen Alex I'm sure you want to talk about this before we aired the
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.720]  Rachel Maddow clip.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.440]  Sure and this is only part of it all week long she was attacking us most of the nights
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:36.720]  I've just seen the clips on YouTube and Kurt Nemo has written about it but this latest
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:42.120]  article was titled Rachel Maddow's jihad against Alex Jones and again this is a woman on her
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:49.160]  top nights has 600,000 viewers total in North America ladies and gentlemen this radio show
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:54.120]  the Sunday show is not as big as the weekday show conservatively 2 million live a couple
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.240]  hundred thousand more on YouTube later subscribers to prison planet TV a few hundred thousand
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.640]  watch it so let's say 2.4 million but we don't sit up here on a big power trip I mean I'm
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.160]  in a hotel room in Arkansas with my family you know visiting folks and I'm just here
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.280]  we're not like I'm on a big fancy studio and I'm God though we're building those studios
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.280]  because if that's what wakes the sheeple up we'll do it but the point is is that she's
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.360]  panicking and we're gonna play the whole clip now the whole clips up on info wars.com but
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.960]  you know she goes for like four minutes making fun of our social network planet info wars.com
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:31.920]  which is listener driven the listeners created the dating area the listeners created the
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:39.040]  gun areas in the art areas in the horticulture areas in the farming areas in the the astronomy
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.240]  areas mean there's just thousands and thousands of groups at planet info wars.com and so they
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:51.160]  no exaggeration let's be conservative 20 publications and newspapers that I saw on the Google search
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.320]  starting Thursday and Friday making fun of it and then creating fake fake users and saying
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.760]  you know I want to shoot you on the grassy knoll and stuff like that just just really
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:06.000]  crazy and she says Alex Jones is getting rich off his dating service he's making a lot of
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.480]  money by the way I don't really promote planet info wars.com it takes a ton of bandwidth
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.000]  I lose money on it okay I did it I haven't promoted I got too many projects going but
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.160]  it's okay for us to make money I mean we're not getting like taxpayer money like Matt
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:23.040]  Al in stimulus money so she goes completely up about that the first four minutes then
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.520]  in the next four minutes we're gonna play a clip of that she goes they're discredited
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:32.520]  Alex Jones developed this drugs report pushed it Ron Paul pushes it the demon and like she's
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.320]  tattling on us like like like you know why I caught them Ron Paul was on Alex's show
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.200]  today she says Friday and he was pushing homeschooling oh to make money oh it's so horrible that
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.200]  he would develop a curricula and sell it that's how free market works and you vote with your
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.760]  dollars and if it gets popular we get bigger we have to see they want to take your tax
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.380]  money this is key use it then against you to enslave you we sit here and go here's a
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.880]  free social network a little bit of advertising on it if you want to you know go over there
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.320]  that's fine we haven't even really sold advertising on it we kind of launched it forgot it and
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.840]  it just sits there growing on its own like a monster that you know Mr. Matt Al hates
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.720]  or Ms. Matt Al, Ms. Matt Al, Ms. Matt Al excuse me I thought it was Janet Reno's brother but
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:20.120]  the point is is that all of this is going on and all I'm trying to do is warn America
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.600]  rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution folks if you're a new listener what you hear
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.580]  here is Thomas Jefferson I've read his books his writings I was reading a book today about
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:32.120]  George Washington again the Bill of Rights Constitution I'm obsessed with America okay
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.120]  I really love the real America USA USA for the real America not for the police state
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.960]  I chant USA for free market families wealth success that's what made us great and she
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.400]  goes into a conniption fit we may get to it in the next segment because I want David Knight
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.600]  to intro first before we go to break here in about five minutes when they come back
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.680]  with the Matt Al clip David Knight because you've done the big reports on this you've
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.200]  got the numbers in front of you they tell people about the hearings this week they're
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:05.120]  panicking she says Alex Jones has now gotten the Drudge Report and Ron Paul and now Congress
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.680]  to actually cover this and it's not real and it's a conspiracy and then they go oh no we've
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:16.200]  got billions of bullets but they're they're not for you America of the Homeland Security
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.840]  memos say it's for the American people the Tea Party gun owners veterans everybody knows
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.120]  that's been in the news it's not al-qaeda now it's the domestic group they tried to
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:29.840]  blame us for the stuff in Boston so everybody who's thinking knows this is a fraud has you
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:35.200]  can go to the federal website and you know fed.biz and see the purchase orders over the
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.240]  last 18 months or so it's a little over 18 months maybe 20 months almost two years they've
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.840]  bought 2.2 billion bullets a billion have been delivered but he gets up there and says
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.720]  we only bought 700 million or 70 million or whatever break it down for him because she
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:53.240]  thinks you're stupid and again people say I was talking to a big media guy this Friday
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.240]  he said why are you even giving them attention man they do not have an audience and I said
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:01.800]  doesn't matter they've got the government they don't care about an audience anymore
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.920]  they've got the government so yes they are a shadow of themselves but they're still in
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:12.080]  control we've got a fully politically expose their acts which destroy them we don't destroy
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.160]  them they destroy themselves so we're going to break in about four minutes David Knight
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:19.240]  lay out the background of this and the names of the different reports you've done so you've
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.920]  broken this down so people can see for themselves trust but verify the fraud when they say there's
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.240]  no big deal with these bullets which are now like 15 times any previous purchase enough
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:34.000]  for a 35 year Iraq war well when this first year when this first broke and Watson did
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.160]  the research and he linked to the RFPs on their sites and the first one was 250 million
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.120]  bullets and people were saying why do they need that much 250 million and in a short
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.000]  period of time they went to 450 million we covered that then they did another one just
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.180]  about a month or so after that for another 750 million then they did another one for
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:57.340]  another 250 million those are the big ones and they were coming up and that was happening
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:02.000]  about a year from about a year ago to I think it was July or whatever and then a half a
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.120]  million here a million there just constant then they were getting smaller ones you know
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:11.520]  like you had the Social Security Administration getting like 175,000 not million but thousand
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.320]  all of them and so they focused on that which was at that time 0.1% of the overall total
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.640]  so they ignored the 99 yeah that's how the lie works I'm glad you raised that they'll
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.760]  go they'll go Alex says it's 1.6 billion when I'm when I'm reading the federal number it's
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.400]  only a million I mean what right the guy's a liar guys and what they do exactly what
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.800]  they do is they take they selectively take one of these things and talk about it usually
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.160]  the very smallest one like I said the 0.1% of it and talk about it but now what you got
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.720]  is Nick Nyack chief procurement officer for the Department of Homeland Security here and
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.800]  this congressional testimony says well it wasn't 1.6 billion it was 750 million that's
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:54.600]  not true that was only one of them and we've linked to every one of these RFPs and our
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.240]  articles because we have to do that it's too strange people don't believe it if we don't
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.740]  link to these things and then he's also lying about the fact that it's there to save money
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.720]  you don't buy hollow point bullets to save money because they're way more expensive than
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.080]  the other one Homeland Security's procurement their procurements have more than tripled
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.960]  the price you can look this up at the average ammo they're buying it for three times what
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:19.040]  they bought it two years ago plus the Defense Department has giant hordes of nine millimeter
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:26.200]  40 cal 308 223 hordes unknown they have their separate manufacturing systems that's absolutely
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.240]  ridiculous for them to say they're buying this kind of quantity to save money because
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.980]  the people pointed out it's more than it when it was a lower number it was 24 times what
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.640]  they had used at the in the Iraq war at its peak you don't go to Costco or some other
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:45.480]  warehouse club and buy 30 years worth of toilet paper in order to save money that's just absurd
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.200]  and they're not they're not doing that here so it's not they're not buying hollow points
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.120]  to save money and they're not buying hollow points to use against somebody else who is
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:58.260]  an amazing headline that's right bottom line they're buying them to dry up the market those
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:04.640]  are the key rounds that you cannot now get in almost every store 308 223 9 millimeter
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:11.080]  40 caliber cannot get them there's a headline from US News and World Report DHS Department
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.640]  of Homeland Security denies ammo purchases aimed at civilians well who are they aimed
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.640]  at are they aimed at the now remember but now remember just six months ago there weren't
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.600]  on ammo purchases it was all an evil yeah Alex Jones Matt Drudge foaming at the mouth
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:31.520]  evil lie and what you see is like I said before when Tucker was covering the Bilderberg conference
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.880]  that happened that open for 25 years everybody was pretending that it didn't exist and you
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.480]  get that cycle where you ignore something or pretend it doesn't exist then you ridicule
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:46.160]  it as a conspiracy then you fight it 25 years to break its back and now it takes a year
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.080]  to break allies back exactly that's right and they're using an old playbook which doesn't
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.520]  work anymore and in the case of the Boston bombing we broke the back of that in just
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:59.880]  a couple of days when Dan went to that press conference and asked them about the drill
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.600]  and they wouldn't give us a definitive answer they wouldn't say yes they wouldn't all the
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.280]  CIA operatives like Anderson Cooper and others they are wringing their hands because folks
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.880]  no one trusts you anymore and we know your tricks you know what's incredible jakari and
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.100]  David they keep running the same trick over and over again like we're stupid well the

[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.640]  of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.600]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.760]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:22.440]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to

[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:09.760]  and crony insider behavior and we're very aggressive when it comes to defense of our
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.300]  liberty we're free men and women so I salute all of you and I salute Jim Tucker I shot
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.380]  a video today in the woods on a hike talking about Jim who I really respected and who was
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:24.420]  a true gumshoe reporter and that's also up on info wars.com and on the YouTube channel
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:28.880]  rest in peace Jim Tucker again the example of the one man standing against the tyranny
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.480]  now we talked about the bullets and the fact that they're liars but don't believe us in
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.500]  fact I'm on the road but if the crew or if David wants to tell the crew and talk back
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.980]  there what articles to pull up I mean we've we've pulled I mean we've written probably
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:47.920]  let's not exaggerate a hundred articles the last year and a half with with links to the
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:53.800]  federal sites where they bought 2.2 billion bullets and just go look at that but but you
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:58.000]  remember them six months ago saying there are no bullets now they're like the 2 billion
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.040]  bullets aren't for you well you know Homeland Security's for the American people and they're
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:07.920]  training for the American people so here's Rachel Maddow literally freaking out that
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:13.280]  are top audiences 600,000 literal I mean they used to have like 3 million CNN used to have
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.080]  like 10 million their top audiences maybe a million they are a joke they are a paper
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.600]  tiger so you say why do we show them here why do we play them here to analyze them to
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.120]  critique them and but to explain to you they're owned by General Electric a mega bank offshore
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.940]  sworn to destroy this country shutting down coal-powered plants that supply more than
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:35.720]  half our power so their plants make bigger profits I mean it's important to call these
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:40.480]  people out because the special interest can come in and buy your city off and triple charge
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.840]  you for water that's not that's not privatization that's fascism that's collectivism for the
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:50.800]  corporatist so again they've confused all the terms so let's go ahead and go to the
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:56.680]  establishment in full bore panic mode right now that what we've been covering for over
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:02.920]  a year is now in Congress and the lie has unraveled for them so they're basically burning
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:07.580]  down because if we realize that a government's gotten too big and it's arming against us
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:13.240]  and hey it's creepy which is completely obvious then they can't play the part of our savior
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.280]  then they're the alien occupying globalist force we know they are then we can win the
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:24.220]  Republic if you wake up to the takeover it's game over here's that clip last week for Republican
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:28.740]  members of Congress sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security demanding that the Department
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:33.800]  of Homeland Security respond to the latest Glenn Beck Alex Jones conspiracy theory which
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.280]  is that the real Boston Marathon bomber was being protected by the White House by Michelle
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:46.240]  Obama the Republican chairman of the hit pause and back it up they conflate and mix that
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:52.400]  Michelle Obama is protecting the real bomber all we pointed out is he's on a no-fly list
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.640]  he's connected to the Saudi Royals he was there when it happened the White House visiting
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.160]  the Saudi foreign minister was there over this there's a major cover-up going you know
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:08.040]  big sis a week and a half ago said in Congress the drugs reports not credible Lincoln info
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:13.180]  wars.com with an article about this guy on a no-fly list turns out it was true no the
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:18.120]  truth is we are credible that's why they're attacking us they would be ignoring us and
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:22.680]  we weren't critical so she mixes this in with bullets to try to you know claim that oh that's
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:28.540]  outrageous so this is outrageous again realize the tactics they're using I use truth to savage
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:33.060]  the enemy they use lies once you're aware of them they bounce off of you let's go back
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:38.000]  to the disdainful anti-American which is that the real Boston Marathon bomber was being
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.120]  protected by the White House by Michelle Obama the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.880]  Committee in the house signed on to that letter they moved on from that last week to now this
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.140]  week the Republicans convened a whole congressional hearing a House Committee on government oversight
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:58.880]  hearing on the right-wing conspiracy theory that the government is stockpiling ammunition
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.920]  to kill us all or something or to at least buy all the bullets so that you can't get
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.840]  me so that you can't stop them from killing us all this is a longtime favorite cause of
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.440]  the info wars world and now it's playing in Congress the congressman you see on your screen
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:18.520]  right now is Republican Kerry Bentavolio of Michigan you'll remember him as a reindeer
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.600]  herder last seen on this show shirtless and kissing a stuffed reindeer you may also remember
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:29.520]  his role playing a doctor they scour the web to find you on Twitter or Facebook with your
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:35.320]  family at Christmas putting a Santa hat on a reindeer which everybody does I mean everybody
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:40.920]  screws around everybody has and then and then you're discredited no you're discredited now
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:48.480]  let's continue his role playing a doctor in a movie about how 9-11 was an inside job now
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.160]  that same Kerry Bentavolio plays a Republican congressman in real life
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:59.120]  I have a lot of people calling me up and saying that there's all these conspiracies and so
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:04.120]  forth and so forth you probably heard them doomsday events civil unrest you're preparing
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.160]  for that do you have any operational plans in the event there's a major or a civil unrest
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.000]  that you're going to arrest innocent civilians and put them in FEMA camps do you have any
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.440]  plans like that no plans the good answer is clear you have no plans whatsoever not right

[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:58.000]  that no plans at all congressman Bentavolio got the guy from Homeland Security on the
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.080]  record admitting no plans to enslave the people of America they pause I mean we're not being

[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:11.720]  though the company apologized and said homeland security paid for these i get the fact it's
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:17.320]  hard to believe it's so over the top but you've got to go look it up for yourself so we're
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.740]  going to bring these guys down together if you just promote the truth let's finish up
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:27.680]  with uh... miss maddow answers clear you have no plans whatsoever not right about anything
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:33.680]  else like that no plans at all congressman bent avolio got the guy from homeland security
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.960]  on the record admitting no plans to enslave the people of america yet really i thought
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:44.640]  i was getting this letter not try because today oklahoma senator james inhofe introduced
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.920]  a bill to block government agencies from buying ammunition all right stop right there oklahoma
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:55.440]  congressman frank lute back it up ten seconds see they're panicking now the senate is moving
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.500]  to go all right you got two billion rounds up to fight a war uh... for uh... thirty five
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:04.840]  years it was for twenty something and uh... that's all you get for now now in thirty
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.680]  five years you can have some more you know you can only have thousands of rounds per
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.560]  agent that's it
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.080]  because you're drying up the whole market and now they're freaking see it's over we
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.740]  don't listen to you anymore pinhead we're only talking about you so everyone knows you're
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.560]  a lying globalist collaborator let's finish up with her
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:28.040]  congressman bent avolio got the guy from homeland security on the record admitting no plans
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:32.480]  to enslave the people of america thought so for that
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.440]  but they better not attack
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:41.120]  has had any evidence in hof introduced a bill to block government agencies from buying ammunition
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.280]  along with oklahoma congressman frank lucas because you know
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.640]  i live in fema region nine or whatever i want to meet my kitty
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.740]  conspiracy theories are not new they're not even the exclusive providence of the american
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:57.460]  right to their left wing conspiracy theories to about right now anti-government conspiracy
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:02.920]  theories are inside the obama government and that appears to be too convenient and too
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:08.640]  appealing for the supposedly mainstream right to leave on harvested and so the friends has
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:12.840]  become the center and so the republican chairman of homeland security is writing conspiracy
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:18.120]  theory letters about the real bomber and they're convening conspiracy theory hearings and republican
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:22.480]  senators are introducing conspiracy theory legislation that actually posits that the
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:26.900]  government is stockpiling bullets so it can kill us all and they're doing it upon the
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:31.040]  advice from the folks who say that the newtown shooting was a hoax it didn't really happen
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.840]  and michelle obama is shielding the real bomber of the boston marathon because it was an
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:40.920]  inside job just like 9 11 i get that the guys who sell this stuff for a living have a reason
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:45.000]  to sell this stuff there's always going to be a very very very exciting market for these
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.040]  things but when a political party sees profit in it when a political party decides to see
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:54.340]  political advantage by trafficking in this stuff and courting it and popularizing it
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:58.920]  that is a different thing and i'm not sure we know how that ends that does it for us
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.680]  tonight we'll see you again monday night now it's time for the premiere all right that's
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:07.280]  it shut her off shut it off shut pat off the point here ladies and gentlemen i'm gonna
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:13.320]  throw it to you and take a little bit of calls here the point to all of this is what they
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:19.000]  attack is what they fear and what happens with hitler and stalin and mal and other tyrannies
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.440]  people don't recognize it because it's so over the top it's like women that got in the
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.640]  car with you know serial killers like ted bundy they he was a handsome guy in a suit
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.880]  driving a yellow volkswagen you know he couldn't be a killer he's non-threatening they act
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.920]  liberal these are authoritarians look at what they're doing look at how they're butchering
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:40.280]  the country look at seven czars quoting mal look at how they do whatever they want fast
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.920]  and furious to blame the second amendment all these other events they're counting on
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:54.400]  you to be naive about what's going on they are they are they are counting on you to be
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.480]  mindless and do not realize it and they're scared of this because why are you buying
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:06.320]  enough bullets for 35 years why are you buying giant armored vehicles why are you engaged
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.760]  in all of this and that's really the big question because government is out of control and that's
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.360]  common sense and that's history and that's what normally ends up happening and she just
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.520]  wants to sit up there and say they want to kill us all no they want to be able to kill
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.640]  anybody that doesn't let them take their private bank accounts and bankrupt this country because
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.660]  we're being conquered by greedy offshore banks that have done it to a hundred plus other
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:33.520]  nations and they think america can be taken down as well they think we're done they think
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:37.720]  we're a joke gentlemen i'm done for tonight you take it out and come back and take some
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:42.240]  calls but what's your take on what you heard her saying it was just blatant lie after blatant
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:47.140]  lie she said that we were alluding to infowars.com and yourself alex jones that we said sandy
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:51.580]  hook never happened we never said that we just had a few questions such as where's the
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:56.240]  surveillance video why are they fighting guns and cars why did this guy get into a building
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.680]  that had a locked door stuff like that and then she mentioned michelle obama talking
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.460]  about uh i don't remember exactly what she said i'm not saying she's protecting whoever
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:08.920]  we're just curious as to why she was there well look at the way she just flat out lied
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.240]  i mean you could call this yellow journalism you could call it straw man arguments but
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.880]  when she says that congress has put a bill up to block the government and buy ammo that's
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.840]  not true they're putting a bill up to stop the government from stockpiling excessive
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:28.020]  amounts of ammo they're not cornering the market exactly exactly and so she slants and
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:32.160]  lies when she says that sort of thing you know the problem with rachel maddow is that
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.340]  her criticisms are too little too late she's still back at the part where she's trying
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:42.200]  to uh ridicule or ignore what we're saying right and it's already out it's already gone
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:46.720]  beyond that you've got forbes magazine saying that we need to have a national discussion
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.700]  about this because forbes looked at our articles they looked at they followed the links they
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:55.820]  saw that there were rfps from the government on the fed biz op and they said what's frightening
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:01.760]  is the media is denying it when it's real the the cover-up is the proof of the darkness
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:07.480]  the proof of the criminality the proof of the evil aims absolutely that's why they're
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:11.480]  they've lost their credibility and the only thing they can think of to do is to lie and
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:16.280]  slant the headlines just like you talked about how she ridiculed the congressman showing
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:20.800]  a picture of him horsing around at at in at christmas time with a reindeer then they they
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.400]  say that they're going to try to stop the government from buying ammunition that's not
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.160]  at all true and then just just throwing this label of conspiracy around you know we're
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.480]  talking about conspiracy and this well-written article from rolling stone is talking about
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:39.520]  this giant banking conspiracy is going on as uh matt uh taibi ti ai bbi this guy really
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.760]  nails it he said uh he quoted someone who is uh michael greenberger former director
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.620]  of the commodities future trading commission who said it's a double conspiracy it's the
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:54.340]  height of criminality financial markets interest rates and interest rate swaps are being manipulated
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:59.440]  both at the same time often by what about the top reagan official that just came out
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.880]  two weeks ago and said it is a criminal organized crime takeover hey talk about stockman or
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:11.280]  yeah exactly yeah yeah and and this is a gigantic amount of money here too to put it in perspective
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.440]  and this are again from this article of rolling stones because he really nails it it's about
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:20.200]  a 15-page article if you print it out he says it's about 379 trillion dollar market meaning
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:26.400]  that any manipulation would affect a pile of assets about 100 times the size of the
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.680]  u.s federal government that's right here's the deal these bankers like madoff but he
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:36.820]  only stole 100 billion they've stole trillions they have they've taken over in fraud now
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:40.240]  they want to take our guns and make us slaves because they're scared of us because they're
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:45.380]  all going to go to jail i mean i mean that's it folks it is so gargantuan the fraud guys

[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.360]  you know in the the last clip we were talking about but we're seeing this all over seeing
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:07.560]  it in salon we're seeing it uh many places our viewers don't normally go uh but it's
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.520]  out there and people hate the fact that people are getting the the real information and asking
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:16.220]  questions and how dare you ask a question and speaking of questions i do believe have
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:24.640]  some callers on the call line let's go ahead and talk to julio in illinois hello oh hey
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:30.640]  yes god uh good evening guys uh first off uh my condolences to my condolences to the
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.920]  tucker family jim tucker true legend i got to meet him last year at build a burger i
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:39.920]  even bought him a drink and true legend great stories and he inspired me as an investigative
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:46.480]  journalist and uh and you know seeing uh reporters like jim tucker and then seeing corporate
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:52.960]  media just reading off a teleprompter it's just so frustrating you just talked about
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:58.720]  uh being in being in press conferences asking tough questions and uh i usually i go to press
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.480]  conferences tomorrow i'm going to release a whole bunch of footage at press conferences
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:09.000]  over the last few months from the usda secretary from the head of national weather service
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.180]  and when you ask them tough questions they fidget around they they get nervous they lie
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:19.880]  i had the national weather service director admit to me to my face that weather modification
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:25.280]  doesn't take place anymore when that's a flat out lie and when you get these people in tough
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:31.760]  situations just asking them a simple tough question uh you'd be amazed at uh at what
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:35.900]  happened oh yeah we saw dan bonanti shut down several press conferences i mean they were
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:41.280]  lined up they had carmen artis who was a prosecutor or federal prosecutor there they were gonna
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:44.420]  have a lot of people get up on the stage and give their presentation they just shut it
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:48.140]  down because they couldn't shut they wouldn't answer his questions and they couldn't shut
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:54.340]  him up it was uh well thanks for doing that now you're with we are change aren't you julio
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:59.120]  oh yeah i contribute work with them i i'm just a roving independent journalist so i
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:04.920]  do i contribute wherever i can and uh it's just it's just it's just so great to see so
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:09.200]  many great young journalists out there people just you know doing what you guys are doing
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.360]  just asking tough questions looking into the hard evidence david you know it's a lot more
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.160]  interesting you know as i say truth is more interesting than fiction and uh that's that
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:23.880]  holds true for the news as well doesn't it absolutely i mean i had tom vilsack tell me
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:29.520]  to my face in the press conference that i ask too much questions you can't have you
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.200]  asking those real questions supposed to be a pr opportunity for them not a not an information
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:39.520]  opportunity well thanks for calling i appreciate that let's go to kurt in alabama kurt evening
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:45.520]  gentlemen how y'all making out this evening how are you i uh i'm not doing so well he's
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.520]  the age of everything that's going on but you know i just it kills me because i got
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:56.520]  questions that i ask in my own mind and it's general stuff that normal public should be
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:02.360]  interested in or you know curious about and they're just like push it by the way and don't
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.680]  even worry about it and it's i mean going on since 9 11 i just have question after question
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:13.360]  after question and everybody gets on the second amendment and it's a big problem and believe
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:18.360]  me i'm i'm pro-gun all the way um i live in a part of the country we got wild animals
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:23.840]  roaming about all kinds of stuff and uh my main concern that scares me the most is they've
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:30.560]  been chipping away the fourth amendment for the longest time oh yeah and all of the elements
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.920]  every single one of them and i mean they make anything up oh i i thought i saw this or i
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:39.840]  thought i smelled alcohol or something on some of these breaths and now i got probable
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:45.140]  cause to go and just interfere and ransack people's lives oh yeah and we we have this
[01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:49.160]  article i just want to throw this out there to uh to make your point fbi conducts conducts
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:53.720]  warrant sweeps in oakland this is actually gun sweeps and what they did they blocked
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:58.540]  off a section of oakland wouldn't let anybody in and out and just went house to house confiscating
[01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:02.720]  guns and that's exactly what he's talking about yeah you know absolutely and you know
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:09.000]  i mean the first part they started with was they started chiseling away back in the eighties
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:14.360]  mid-eighties late eighties chiseling away at the sacrament of family and family staying
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.720]  together if you rip the families apart it's age old divide and conquer oh absolutely families
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:22.680]  apart and you can do whatever you want to anybody because you got them divided now so
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:27.480]  and like we were talking about you know uh ron paul has focused on uh the federal reserve
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:32.340]  he's now focusing on homeschooling those are some real foundational issues but in terms
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:37.020]  of the police state i mean if you go back and look at uh i think it was uh was his name
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:41.480]  darryl gates anyway he was a police chief in la he was the one who invented swat teaming
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:47.000]  oh yeah okay now that's become you know nobody thinks about no knock rage and think about
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.140]  how many times whether it's for drugs or whether it's for something else that uh the police
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:56.680]  come in all dressed in black kicked down a door and then people think they're being you
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:00.400]  know there's some kind of intrusion yeah they think that you know it's a gang coming in
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:04.640]  so they they come down with a gun and then they get shot and killed i mean that is not
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:09.600]  they shoot one the officers absolutely that is not the way law enforcement should be doing
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:14.120]  things but we see something like they do in new york in nazi new york city they they go
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:19.240]  and they just shoot first ask questions later and oh we we saw a gun or we saw a weapon
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:23.960]  or we saw something we thought was so now we're justified in doing whatever we've done
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.960]  absolutely what we need to start doing is we need to start demanding from our state
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:33.280]  and local representatives that they reverse this swat stuff but what we're seeing now
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:38.240]  is instead of that happening just as the swat became the swat teams in la became a template
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:41.920]  for the rest of the country we're now seeing this drill that happened in boston we're now
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:46.200]  seeing that being used as a template for the rest of the country just like cebel edmund
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.680]  said on our show on friday she said the real drill was the drill to see how people would
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:54.980]  react when we went door to door and basically created martial law and they didn't handle
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:01.440]  it too well well thank you thanks we're going to go to mitchell and wyoming mitchell are
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:08.060]  you there can you hear me now yes go ahead okay yeah i just wanted to affirm the point
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:13.020]  you guys and alex have said a lot that people need to get involved and do their own research
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:17.000]  to read voting records to track the people they've they've voted for and they're going
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.900]  to elect because i want to point out ran paul's statement clarifying his stance on drone use
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:29.280]  um it's on its website the thing that struck me is the last paragraph it says fighting
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:34.580]  terrorism and capturing terrorists must be done while preserving our constitutional protections
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:39.920]  this was demonstrated last week in boston now to me that's a huge red red flag for somebody
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.320]  to call the events in boston last week constitutional yeah that is i hadn't seen that that is an
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:51.000]  amazing red so that's on his own website yeah yeah it's in his press release if you just
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:59.320]  google paul's statement on domestic drone use it'll be in the google results for www.paul.senate.gov
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:04.600]  yeah we i'm very concerned about you know what he said in terms of uh he doesn't really
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:08.680]  care if it's a cop or a drone shooting somebody who's fleeing with a gun well i do i think
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:14.280]  we need to i think we need to instead of making things easier for people to get shot immediately
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:17.960]  on site i think we need to be putting some restrictions on the police in terms of how
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:22.420]  they use lethal force and even how they use non-lethal force we're seeing tasers being
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:27.140]  used like whips uh nowadays and you know that's my concern because people say well the cops
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:30.860]  use guns they have tasers like i don't i'm not necessarily saying they should be using
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:35.340]  these things as as cavalierly as they do just yeah things such as pepper spray if you have
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:38.840]  somebody who's asthmatic they have breathing problems and now you have this pepper spray
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.060]  clogging them up and also people who have uh very negative reactions to being tased
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:47.080]  yeah oh absolutely it's very dangerous and they're tasing pregnant women or whatever
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.780]  i mean it's chasing guys who have seizures yeah yeah absolutely there needs to be something
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:57.020]  what's missing in all of this is accountability for police when they do things inappropriately
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:56:00.980]  but over and over and over again you see it just as we saw here in our own city here in
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:05.500]  austin right you see the police closing ranks behind themselves rather than saying we had
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:10.280]  somebody who stepped over the line he needs to be disciplined or let go instead they insist
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:14.660]  that nothing happens to him right and all that does is foster this kind of criminal
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:18.980]  attitude of the fact they can do to people whatever they want to it just turns them into
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:23.900]  bullies essentially lethal bullies so that's that's something that we should all be concerned
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:30.100]  about you know it further is like people not that need to not just you know read the news
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:34.260]  or just listen to info wars and then kind of extrapolate their political decisions from
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:38.460]  there they need to actually read these things and track the people that you know are representing
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:41.860]  their state and things like that and just like with this this paul statement it's like
[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:45.580]  ran paul i appreciate his filibuster and there's a lot of things he's backed that i've been
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:49.340]  a favorite of things but that doesn't make him you know all knowing and i know nobody's
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:53.100]  perfect but at the same time it's like we need to admit that you know some of the people
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:57.620]  were backing are also doing things that are very huge mistakes to call to call the events
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:01.780]  in boston constitutional just off the chart i think oh yeah that's always a concern nobody's
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:05.880]  perfect you know just like you said you may support ran paul on guns you may support ted
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:10.020]  cruz on guns but you may disagree with him on other topics and that's a very relevant
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:14.180]  subject you brought up yeah we don't want to give anybody we don't want to ever get
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:19.200]  to the situation where you see people like rachel maddow being with obama where you get
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.540]  yourself so tied into the person that you give them a pass to do any and everything
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:30.420]  right that that's a recipe for not only disaster but fascist dictatorship you know we're not
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:35.140]  about a person we're about principles we'll be right back i'm david knight here with jakari
