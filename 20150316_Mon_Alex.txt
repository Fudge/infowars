[00:43.360 --> 00:49.440]  lock-up today and I've seen the political authoritarians that masquerade as
[00:49.440 --> 00:57.720]  the left in this country celebrating the fact that he's in prison for having a
[00:57.720 --> 01:05.760]  tax-exempt creation-based museum I interviewed this guy probably 15 years
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.160]  ago he's very nice he had best-selling DVDs and VHS tapes for that wrote
[01:11.160 --> 01:16.280]  books he's just a very nice friendly person and then when you watch the news
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.040]  they go it's incredible the judge says he's worse than a rapist he dared to be
[01:22.040 --> 01:27.360]  tax-exempt and run this scam operation claiming that dinosaurs were on the
[01:27.360 --> 01:31.880]  earth 6,000 years ago well whether you believe that or not dinosaurs are here

[01:34.760 --> 01:41.400]  alligators and Komodo dragons but but separately I don't agree that Tyrannosaurus
[01:41.400 --> 01:45.360]  Rex is on the planet 6,000 years ago I don't totally agree with his worldview I
[01:45.360 --> 01:51.160]  don't agree with mainline Darwinism either that's really just eugenics and
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.960]  the religion of the globalist but here's the deal you got a First Amendment I can
[01:54.960 --> 02:01.560]  go get a 501c3 and start a flying saucer cult like Ray Al if I want to or I can

[02:07.720 --> 02:13.480]  lay preacher into it when you know the law and you follow this trial then it
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.520]  takes you down the rabbit hole of the tens of thousands of churches and 501c3's
[02:17.520 --> 02:21.480]  and Patriot groups and conservative groups and veterans groups and gun groups
[02:21.480 --> 02:27.600]  that have been harassed indicted investigated by the Obama White House

[03:03.440 --> 03:07.680]  if you ever bounce to check that that's wire fraud and put you in prison that's

[03:22.760 --> 03:26.840]  that was in the Washington Post before they set him up for wire fraud because
[03:26.840 --> 03:31.540]  they had some charge backs on credit cards for their magazines anybody that
[03:31.540 --> 03:35.280]  runs an online or mail order business at the time has those I mean I'm just

[08:21.200 --> 08:25.840]  disinformation I'm your host Alex Jones and here we are lining up another
[08:25.840 --> 08:34.440]  broadcast week dead ahead Monday the 16th day of March 2015 I'm your host Alex

[08:40.800 --> 08:47.080]  March to our ultimate destiny and that destiny is for us to decide not the
[08:47.080 --> 08:52.600]  globalist not the social engineers that would arrest our development keep us in
[08:52.600 --> 08:57.840]  a childlike perpetual state of mindlessness where we sleep and they
[08:57.840 --> 09:05.240]  live the news is getting again just off the chart by the day I remember telling
[09:05.240 --> 09:14.000]  people this last year and I was actually reporting on Russian state-run reports
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.920]  and this also happened back in 2008 when NATO launched an attack on Russian
[09:20.920 --> 09:27.280]  enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and then claimed that Russia had invaded
[09:27.280 --> 09:32.880]  Georgia never been to Russia don't have any Slavic blood that I know of I'm not
[09:32.880 --> 09:38.080]  picking sides don't have a dog in the fight Russia didn't start any of this
[09:38.080 --> 09:45.160]  that's a fact am I saying that Russia is as wide as the driven snow politically
[09:45.160 --> 09:49.800]  absolutely not but they're not in an offensive mode the globalist running
[09:49.800 --> 09:53.240]  Europe in the United States are the most virulent tyranny on the planet allied
[09:53.240 --> 09:59.720]  with the viciously evil communist Chinese basically the soulless communist
[09:59.720 --> 10:06.600]  Chinese Vladimir Putin says Russia was preparing to use nuclear weapons if
[10:06.600 --> 10:12.320]  necessary and blames us for Ukraine crisis this isn't a one independent
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.240]  associated press Reuters it's finally all over the news I know for our listeners
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.080]  are like tell us something we don't know mr. Jones we know all about that well
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.600]  we've been criticized in the news you can look it up nationally for claiming that
[10:24.600 --> 10:28.240]  Russia was threatening to use nuclear weapons they had the chairman of their
[10:28.240 --> 10:33.480]  joint chiefs in 2008 and then again last year say we've moved medium-range
[10:33.480 --> 10:39.000]  missiles in and if you move in any heavy armor against our forces and Putin
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.040]  went ahead and met it yes Russian forces basically have been in Ukraine we told
[10:46.040 --> 10:49.080]  he was lying about that last year he told state-run media yeah we've got
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.480]  forces there to defend Russian lives and it basically is Russia you could say
[10:53.480 --> 10:57.080]  the eastern part of Ukraine is 75% Russian but you get right up against the
[10:57.080 --> 11:02.120]  border it's Russians it's always been Russian it's like New York's always been
[11:02.120 --> 11:06.680]  America since you know George Washington it's I mean that's where Russia was
[11:06.680 --> 11:12.200]  founded was in Crimea not in Moscow I mean it's just it's the motherland it's
[11:12.200 --> 11:17.400]  like Boston or something to the U.S. or New York City and it just it's
[11:17.400 --> 11:24.720]  Americana well it's Russian would the word be Rusky Kana I don't know and so it
[11:24.720 --> 11:29.040]  is a very dangerous escalation when you've got NATO current NATO generals
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.480]  last year on video saying we're prepared for war with Russia and giggling
[11:33.480 --> 11:37.640]  about it even when psychopaths like Curtis LeMay one of the first strike
[11:37.640 --> 11:43.000]  nuke Russia in the early 60s and Kennedy said no and Eisenhower said no
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.760]  previously he didn't get up on TV and laugh about it like he was talking about
[11:47.760 --> 11:54.720]  yeah I'll kick your butt in a boxing match we're talking about nuclear war so
[11:54.720 --> 11:59.160]  it's in mainstream news now in the West so now it exists so now I could talk
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.880]  about it we've been talking about it for almost a year that the Russians have
[12:02.880 --> 12:07.040]  said if you start moving armor in and if you engage us we're going to nuke you
[12:07.040 --> 12:13.080]  and we have the clip coming up ex-U.S. general defense his sanctions his
[12:13.080 --> 12:16.880]  sanctions don't work start killing Russians comment we're gonna play that
[12:16.880 --> 12:23.320]  clip in a moment but the magnitude of this this is not the Iraqis that we can
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.920]  bully for 20 years after installing stop Hussein having him follow orders and
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.320]  then setting him up just the fact just to turn the country over to al-Qaeda
[12:33.320 --> 12:38.920]  basically in the West in the East Iran I mean that's a really bad deal much
[12:38.920 --> 12:42.480]  worse than it was but that's what the globalist wanted they wanted to
[12:42.480 --> 12:45.840]  destabilize the Middle East well now they want to destabilize Russia and
[12:45.840 --> 12:53.200]  they've got jihadi brigades all through the caucuses right through into Georgia
[12:53.200 --> 12:59.960]  and throughout other areas of Eastern Europe that are shooting Russian police
[12:59.960 --> 13:07.400]  blowing up military bases blowing up train stations and the West admits the
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.480]  council on farm relations last week had a publication out bragging about our
[13:11.480 --> 13:15.800]  jihad forces attacking the Russians so you want real jihad attacking you that's
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.200]  what's going on and Putin has even given speeches saying we don't need this
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.160]  outside threat to unify Russians we already know we're under attack but he
[13:25.160 --> 13:29.200]  goes on to admit another speech I saw this morning the TV interview he did a
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.880]  few weeks ago that Iran is being anti-Israel so that it gets domestic
[13:34.880 --> 13:40.680]  support internally with an outside enemy and then Iran needs to shut up but see
[13:40.680 --> 13:44.520]  our politicians won't get up there it's not that Putin's even a good guy but
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.320]  it's refreshing that he tells the truth almost all the time just from his
[13:48.320 --> 13:53.360]  perspective he said Iran's a great culture invented a lot of mathematics and
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.160]  science we're building their reactors they are peaceful he basically implied
[13:57.160 --> 14:00.040]  they already have nukes everybody knows that that that they want to become a
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.560]  first-world nation but that they are for domestic purposes attacking Israel and
[14:04.560 --> 14:08.320]  it needs to stop and that Hezbollah forces need to stop messing with Israel I
[14:08.320 --> 14:12.520]  mean it's really unprecedented that Russia is trying to make the peace with
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.440]  everybody legitimately and so that's why George Soros and others when they're
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.000]  not funding you know protests that turn into cop shooting events and when
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.440]  they're not funding anti-gun events or open border events or every other form
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.400]  of tyranny they're trying to start war with Russia I mean where does where
[14:27.400 --> 14:33.360]  does George Soros think he's gonna go there's a nuclear war so let's play
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.440]  that clip of former US Army General Robert Scales explaining to Fox News
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.400]  that Ukraine is lost and acknowledged that an ongoing deployment of American
[14:44.400 --> 14:47.960]  troops in Eastern Europe is unlikely to change the situation and the only way
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.360]  the US can turn the tide of start killing Russians killing so many Russians
[14:51.360 --> 14:55.560]  even Putin's media can't hide the fact that Russians are returning to their
[14:55.560 --> 15:00.400]  motherland in body bags they're already returning in body bags by the some
[15:00.400 --> 15:05.640]  numbers are in the thousands it's a major proxy war with US mercenaries and
[15:05.640 --> 15:10.680]  European mercenaries and others engaging the Russians right now in a bunch of
[15:10.680 --> 15:15.760]  battles so let's go ahead and play that clip yeah three thousand US troops
[15:15.760 --> 15:23.400]  deploying to Eastern Europe some armor will be going with apparently to what
[15:23.400 --> 15:29.080]  effect and what do you expect I think to no effect blue it's game set and match
[15:29.080 --> 15:33.840]  in the Ukraine the only way the United States can have any effect in this region
[15:33.840 --> 15:39.040]  and turn the tide is to start killing Russians killing Russians by killing so
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.240]  many Russians that even Putin's media can't hide the fact that Russians are
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.640]  returning to the motherland in body bags but given the amount of support we've
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.400]  given the Ukrainians given the ability of the Ukrainians themselves to counter
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.360]  attack against these what 12,000 Russians camped in their country sadly
[15:56.360 --> 16:01.800]  that's not likely to happen with general bombs kill Napoleon right up to the
[16:01.800 --> 16:05.560]  and Adolf Hitler many others do the same thing with Russia every time and Russia
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.840]  just sits there unless people attack them and then the real war starts these
[16:09.840 --> 16:13.400]  guys sit there in their Fox News studios and I'm I know Lou Dobbs he's been on the
[16:13.400 --> 16:16.840]  show he's a listener I don't blame him having this guy on it's an interesting
[16:16.840 --> 16:20.000]  interview I would have the general I've got to get skills on here I know he's a
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.280]  Fox News analyst those who probably won't come on but they just sit there
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.440]  calmly going let's start killing so many Russians Putin can't hide it
[16:26.440 --> 16:32.400]  Putin's not hiding it he's gone up in the polls since all this started if we
[16:32.400 --> 16:37.640]  had a foreign government up on the Texas border killing US soldiers that would
[16:37.640 --> 16:45.400]  make Obama popular even the unpopular Obama so this is really dangerous folks
[16:45.400 --> 16:50.840]  I know it's not as important as South by Southwest or American Idol or you know
[16:50.840 --> 16:56.920]  dancing with the stars but it's just crazy to see this general and he's not
[16:56.920 --> 17:00.160]  the only one current NATO general saying let's just go ahead and have a war with
[17:00.160 --> 17:05.720]  the Russians I mean even if they have super advanced weapons they're not
[17:05.720 --> 17:12.320]  going to stop all the Russian ICBMs and cruise missiles and sapper teams that
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.960]  basically black off ghost teams sleeper cells in the United States I mean we
[17:17.960 --> 17:22.160]  know they've got components smuggled in I mean and maybe that's what the globalist
[17:22.160 --> 17:25.800]  want is a reset with the global financial crisis looming and they know
[17:25.800 --> 17:30.680]  they're going to get blamed for what they've authored and they have war game
[17:30.680 --> 17:33.920]  the whole scenario and might want the Russians have set off a nuke they
[17:33.920 --> 17:39.200]  smuggled in or nukes they smuggled in a long time ago and in vaporized Congress
[17:39.200 --> 17:42.680]  and then the shadow government takes out the Russians goes in their bunkers and
[17:42.680 --> 17:47.240]  then reemerges I mean it's global domination Hitler was ready to lose
[17:47.240 --> 17:53.920]  the entire German population for global domination and when 20 million Germans
[17:53.920 --> 17:58.640]  had already died the last week a million were lost in and around Berlin alone
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.880]  they flooded the subways to stop the Russian advance and they said they said
[18:03.880 --> 18:07.560]  half million women and children are in those subways and Hitler's quotes are
[18:07.560 --> 18:12.240]  on record put out by the SS before he died that the German people deserve it
[18:12.240 --> 18:18.200]  then because they didn't win so it's the same mindset ladies and gentlemen where
[18:18.200 --> 18:22.000]  we just might have a nuclear war so we got our global government and reemerge
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.480]  after it that's the view of the globalist you go back to Dr. Strange Love
[18:25.480 --> 18:31.040]  1964 with the grand corporation plan that's what the whole thing's based on
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.800]  they say bland corporation the movie but it's an allegory it's pretty much like
[18:34.800 --> 18:38.560]  the godfather which Puzo admitted was true story the names were changed that
[18:38.560 --> 18:43.240]  stuff really went on minus the doomsday machine and and and minus the first
[18:43.240 --> 18:48.080]  strike General LeMay L. L. Lemmonster and others wanted to have a nuclear war
[18:48.080 --> 18:53.960]  with Russia and had plans written up for the elite to go underground in these
[18:53.960 --> 18:59.320]  bases then reemerge after a decade with global military supremacy this is
[18:59.320 --> 19:05.440]  crazy it was Bertrand Russell said we might have a nuclear war to bring in
[19:05.440 --> 19:10.000]  peace after it and to reduce world population these people are sick they
[19:10.000 --> 19:18.360]  are sick crazy people this general scales is a maniac nut on TV saying let's
[19:18.360 --> 19:22.000]  start killing Russians in massive numbers so Putin can't hide it
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.640]  Putin has now gone public and said yeah we got nukes we're getting ready to use

[24:07.480 --> 24:11.320]  This out just minutes ago on the heels of what I was just breaking down Latimer
[24:11.320 --> 24:15.320]  Putin says Russia was preparing to use nuclear weapons if necessary and blames
[24:15.320 --> 24:21.520]  US for Ukraine crisis here's AP Russia launches massive Arctic military drills
[24:21.520 --> 24:24.980]  the Russian military today launched sweeping military maneuvers in the
[24:24.980 --> 24:29.640]  Arctic and other areas a show of force ordered by President Vladimir Putin
[24:29.640 --> 24:36.160]  aimed amid spiraling tensions with the West over Ukraine the five-day Arctic
[24:36.160 --> 24:40.800]  drills involving 38,000 servicemen that's just north of Canada and more
[24:40.800 --> 24:45.880]  than 50 surface ships and submarines and 110 aircraft are intended to check the
[24:45.880 --> 24:49.080]  readiness of Russian Northern Fleet and the military's ability to deploy
[24:49.080 --> 24:57.120]  additional forces from central Russia. I want to explain something we just played
[24:57.120 --> 25:00.440]  a former US general saying let's start killing more Russians they're sending
[25:00.440 --> 25:06.160]  tank brigades in from NATO admittedly to start engaging Russian forces they just
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.080]  released a documentary shot about a month ago because Putin's been missing
[25:10.080 --> 25:16.400]  for weeks with Putin saying that they're preparing for nuclear war and that the
[25:16.400 --> 25:19.760]  West are basically terrorists and they're trying to destabilize the planet
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.280]  and trying to set up a world government and just all this over-the-top truth
[25:24.280 --> 25:29.680]  again I'm out lionizing Putin and is he underground because I think a war is
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.740]  about to start well Joe Biggs has some sources in Russia through army
[25:33.740 --> 25:38.960]  connections that have in the past been accurate and he's gonna talk about why
[25:38.960 --> 25:42.600]  Putin may be missing this is pure speculation obviously it's been a lot
[25:42.600 --> 25:46.680]  of speculation of why is he missing is he dead they've now released this interview
[25:46.680 --> 25:49.880]  he supposedly did a month ago on state-run television and then another
[25:49.880 --> 25:56.280]  taped interview Joe Biggs former Staff Sergeant US Army combat vet you've got
[25:56.280 --> 26:02.680]  some sources what are they saying yeah so the word is I've got some friends my
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.760]  cousin he's also engaged right now to this Russian girl and her mother still
[26:07.760 --> 26:11.480]  lives over in there and so I sent him texts from time to time and I've given
[26:11.480 --> 26:15.520]  you good stuff before yeah yeah I mean they've talked about the the Russian
[26:15.520 --> 26:20.240]  military you know lining up outside of Crimea right before all that happened so
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.280]  I mean they've been pretty spot-on with everything so far but he can't text me
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.240]  back last night and says her mom said that Putin has stage 4 cancer and like
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.280]  we said this is we don't know this for sure but this is what we were told from
[26:32.280 --> 26:36.000]  that says that put in a stage 4 cancer and he is trying to earn a place in the
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.440]  history books before he has gone at least that's the story in Ukraine so you
[26:41.440 --> 26:44.240]  know he's been gone for a while now no one knows where he is maybe he's getting
[26:44.240 --> 26:47.320]  some kind of medical treatment and like you said I mean if he knows that he
[26:47.320 --> 26:51.000]  doesn't have that much time left he could be willing to to do something like
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.760]  you said make a name well we know that's what the West is doing is trying to
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.480]  act like hot shots like Napoleon and Hitler what is your view on this whole
[26:57.480 --> 27:04.480]  Russia situation Joe I kind of believe that I think that that's more of a he's
[27:04.480 --> 27:09.280]  someone who's got a he's very prideful and I think that's something that he
[27:09.280 --> 27:12.640]  would do if he knew he didn't have much time left he'd be willing to go out and
[27:12.640 --> 27:18.200]  do as much harm and as possible possibly just to make a name for himself so
[27:18.200 --> 27:23.080]  people could remember him as you know like this great warrior I would think
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.160]  I don't know there's a former KGB guy and he's got the hard-liner Russians
[27:27.160 --> 27:30.920]  behind him and the Russians feel like they're being ganged up on historically
[27:30.920 --> 27:34.240]  they have that psychology they lost 20 million people in World War 2 just like
[27:34.240 --> 27:39.360]  Germany that was the big toe-to-toe battle and they have a psychology of
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.720]  being attacked because they have been invaded over and over again and it just
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.920]  seemed like a very dangerous time right now yeah indeed I mean like I said
[27:47.920 --> 27:51.480]  whenever someone like that that high profile has gone for a while it kind of
[27:51.480 --> 27:54.360]  makes you worry what's going on what is he planning as he like you said is he
[27:54.360 --> 27:57.680]  possibly in some underground bunker getting ready for something I mean that
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.200]  well he was already missing a few weeks ago late last year and it turned out he
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.680]  was in a monastery reportedly for two weeks to quote deciding what to do
[28:06.680 --> 28:10.480]  that's what's scary about the fact when you have one guy running something they
[28:10.480 --> 28:13.760]  could really start World War 3 but here's the problem it's the West messing
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.720]  with him yeah exactly I mean it's just crazy it'd be like going in a bar and
[28:18.720 --> 28:21.600]  picking the biggest meanest-looking guy and going up punch them in the nose I
[28:21.600 --> 28:26.280]  mean you know it's just it's just crazy this is not Iraq Joe it poking the bear
[28:26.280 --> 28:29.520]  big time they're definitely trying to pick a fight what do you think the point
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.960]  of that is the more wars we have the more money they make with these
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.120]  contract but we can't have one with China or Russia they have thousands of
[28:38.120 --> 28:44.040]  nuclear weapons and their spies are all over the place yeah I think they like to
[28:44.040 --> 28:47.920]  keep people in fear of the fact that it could happen what do you think is going
[28:47.920 --> 28:50.720]  to happen at the end of the day well fear controls everything you know that's
[28:50.720 --> 28:54.240]  what they use they use that fear to control the American public it's a whole
[28:54.240 --> 28:57.160]  it's just a big propaganda tool the way they're going to control the media to
[28:57.160 --> 29:00.080]  make people feel like they're constantly under attack I agree they're trying to
[29:00.080 --> 29:04.720]  create fear saying ISIS in the Caribbean and all this stuff but Joe what I'm
[29:04.720 --> 29:08.760]  getting at here is they really are proxy troops are engaging Russians in
[29:08.760 --> 29:13.680]  Ukraine yeah there's a real war going mm-hmm it just seems incredible
[29:13.680 --> 29:20.400]  Hutzpah just major bravada yeah exactly well hopefully nothing happens you know
[29:20.400 --> 29:25.840]  this is one war that we don't want to get into well you're not patriotic Joe
[29:25.840 --> 29:28.320]  because you don't want to have thermal nuclear war on destroy the planet how
[29:28.320 --> 29:32.480]  dare you yeah I guess that makes me a racist as well absolutely you're now
[29:32.480 --> 29:36.120]  anti-American which is racist because you don't have a nuclear war for a bunch
[29:36.120 --> 29:39.760]  of foreign bankers who are buying armored underground shelters in New Zealand as
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.760]  fast as they can yeah I think I'm gonna go buy really tight jeans now become a
[29:43.760 --> 29:47.520]  trendy I'm sorry that that would be nothing that would be trendy that would

[34:15.800 --> 34:20.120]  do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation if you
[34:20.120 --> 34:26.080]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we're in russia is
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.240]  still denying everything sir we have a soviet submarine watch detection I wish
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.240]  I didn't know about any of this I wish I was like everybody else
[34:34.240 --> 34:41.920]  the only winning move is not to play
[34:41.920 --> 34:49.240]  the globalist divide and conquer operation you know I've studied the new world order
[34:49.240 --> 34:57.720]  in their tactics for really 25 years of a politically active for 23 on air for 20
[34:57.720 --> 35:02.840]  and the only way this makes sense from a cold-blooded sociopathic or psychopathic
[35:02.840 --> 35:08.760]  perspective is if space aliens were running the globalist and that they wanted to get
[35:08.760 --> 35:15.320]  humans to kill each other and destroy civilization and build an artificial
[35:15.320 --> 35:23.640]  technocracy on our ashes that we're almost like a shaken bake biological
[35:23.640 --> 35:33.320]  terraforming system that builds a cybertron for robot aliens now I'm not
[35:33.320 --> 35:38.280]  saying it's robot aliens that are doing this but if you look at it from a logical
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.920]  view the technocracy the globalist are building how they're dividing men from
[35:42.920 --> 35:47.000]  women how they're attacking the family how they're changing our DNA how they're
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.280]  building a world that's unsustainable and then you read every globalist
[35:50.280 --> 35:55.040]  publication I mean used to it was like once a month I'd see something like this
[35:55.040 --> 36:02.720]  20 years ago now it's 10 15 times a day I have stacks of articles here at South
[36:02.720 --> 36:13.280]  by Southwest with top CEO CEOs of tech companies saying humanity as we know it
[36:13.280 --> 36:18.280]  is basically over we're gonna merge with machines evolution is going to
[36:18.280 --> 36:23.840]  accelerate I mean it's just all the standard stuff and Hertz has got to put
[36:23.840 --> 36:27.600]  cameras and all their rent cars to watch you and I mean that's just the last few
[36:27.600 --> 36:36.240]  days look at this headline this is out of the Austin American statesmen serious
[36:36.240 --> 36:42.080]  founder envisions world of cyber clones tech med where again you basically live
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.080]  in a tank like the matrix and your cyber clone goes out and does all the work
[36:46.080 --> 36:52.000]  for you and also bosses you around this is just them selling the trend these
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.120]  unlimited understanding of what's coming so they accept it and think it's cool
[36:56.120 --> 37:03.920]  it's all about shaping reality us today also has the report from here in Austin
[37:03.920 --> 37:07.400]  Texas South by Southwest 2015 we've got a reporters on the ground a bunch of
[37:07.400 --> 37:13.360]  reports coming up our report on big demonstrations against the rise of
[37:13.360 --> 37:18.520]  artificial intelligence made drudge report comm and a lot of other big sites
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.920]  yesterday with Leigh Ann McAdoo and Buckley Hammond reporting and it's not
[37:22.920 --> 37:26.520]  that I'm against technology it's that I'm against the direction of its
[37:26.520 --> 37:32.360]  architecture and that's being designed to suppress humanity not to empower
[37:32.360 --> 37:39.240]  humanity the decision has been made to build a future without humans whether
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.720]  you watch Discovery Channel or read articles by Bill Joy or listen to Ray
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.160]  Kurzweil and I talked to a lot of famous people on the record and off the
[37:47.160 --> 37:55.440]  record and they just say you're not gonna stop it Alex join with it and you
[37:55.440 --> 38:01.080]  can have the life extension and Google admits when they were founded 16 years
[38:01.080 --> 38:06.400]  ago that their mission is to become a global AI that controls everything and
[38:06.400 --> 38:11.240]  creates a planetary monopoly but on the surface it's throngs and armies and
[38:11.240 --> 38:16.280]  legions of little trendy unpaid interns running around handing out freebies and
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.120]  as as as Google is given government authorization globally to take everything
[38:21.120 --> 38:23.400]  over
[38:30.720 --> 38:36.000]  this is all about social engineering there's an article out from the Guardian
[38:36.000 --> 38:44.200]  today a stunt at South by Southwest as users falling for a robot on Tinder app
[38:44.200 --> 38:47.840]  uses up a solid films festival in Austin have been unwittingly mimicking the
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.600]  plot of Alex Garland's new film by finding themselves quizzed by a gorgeous
[38:52.600 --> 38:58.360]  robot in disguise it's all about manipulation it's all about chomping
[38:58.360 --> 39:05.480]  everyone have an article here out of the International Business Times shot by
[39:05.480 --> 39:11.800]  Southwest 2015 TV networks HBO and A&E Nat Geo spin big and Austin to attract
[39:11.800 --> 39:18.040]  influencers trying to reach younger and more urban hip demographic because of
[39:18.040 --> 39:25.240]  their ratings going down only shows that are making under shows like Mike
[39:25.240 --> 39:29.280]  judges Silicon Valley never seen the show but did hang out with the whole
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.000]  basically the cast of it at out of his house shooting last year I'm gonna call
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.240]  Mike he's back in town we had to shoot some more videos but that's what this is
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.680]  all about ladies and gentlemen and of course Silicon Valley makes fun of the
[39:45.680 --> 39:54.720]  trend these it doesn't build them up as God they deserve to understand that
[39:54.720 --> 40:01.080]  they're told under their narcissistic mindset that they will ascend if they
[40:01.080 --> 40:05.400]  buy into everything the establishment puts out and instead all you do is end
[40:05.400 --> 40:08.860]  up being a slave of the system and don't affect change what threatens the
[40:08.860 --> 40:14.280]  globalist is doing things outside of their box outside of their artificial
[40:14.280 --> 40:20.000]  construct their artificial proto pre-matrix system of false reality that
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.800]  walls us off so that the globalist can control the stimuli and control the
[40:24.800 --> 40:32.920]  destiny of humanity which is no destiny at all I've already gone over the Russia
[40:32.920 --> 40:40.640]  situation it's all over the top before I go any further here today we're gonna be
[40:40.640 --> 40:46.040]  talking to a political president or from federal president today who dare to
[40:46.040 --> 40:54.400]  have a 501 C3 in America that teach to creationism and that was deemed by the
[40:54.400 --> 41:02.920]  feds is fraud pound free Kent Kent Hovind who was on the show it had to be
[41:02.920 --> 41:08.240]  15 16 years ago and they really didn't like him as he was a charming and nice
[41:08.240 --> 41:13.000]  guy whether you believe in creationism or believe in mainline Darwinism I think
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.200]  both of them become dogmatic because it's men interpreting the Bible and then
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.840]  making it their own dogmatic stuff and then then you've got other men you know
[41:20.840 --> 41:27.520]  saying that it's it's everything that Charles Darwin said I don't buy into
[41:27.520 --> 41:34.240]  either view and the elite don't either they buy into
[41:34.680 --> 41:39.120]  terraforming operations and that the earth was seated here that's in the New
[41:39.120 --> 41:44.280]  York Times the Financial Times what's it called pan transpermia belief
[41:44.280 --> 41:47.600]  basically if you want to see the creation myth of the elite that they've
[41:47.600 --> 41:53.240]  had for thousands of years going back to Egypt or Greece just go watch the movie
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.200]  Prometheus and you'll you'll have it all figured out I'm not saying that's what
[41:57.200 --> 42:05.040]  happened I'm explaining that panspermia is what the elite believe we're going on
[42:05.040 --> 42:10.280]  when they teach you all this Darwinism that's not what they believe do I believe
[42:10.280 --> 42:15.280]  that Adam and Eve wrote around on dinosaurs like Kent Hovind thinks no
[42:15.280 --> 42:21.600]  our dinosaurs walking around the day allopicus turtles saltwater crocodiles
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.560]  monitored lizards Komodo dragons absolutely they're dinosaurs they're
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.640]  from that era it's the only you could technically say is a dinosaur would be
[42:31.640 --> 42:39.160]  the crocodile but it's there have there been stragglers in certain areas of the
[42:39.160 --> 42:44.240]  world that have survived absolutely but should you be locked up in prison
[42:44.240 --> 42:49.280]  because you got a 501c3 and openly put out a big theme park that becomes
[42:49.280 --> 42:54.400]  popular no you can't have competing culture and they got away with Kent
[42:54.400 --> 43:01.000]  Hovind so now they've moved on to tens of thousands of denied 501c3s and
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.680]  tens of thousands almost everyone who's libertarian conservative pro-gun 501c3
[43:06.680 --> 43:17.560]  501c3 four charities pro-life conservative FBI foundations retired FBI
[43:17.560 --> 43:25.520]  agents the but that's the Paul Revere society all these groups are getting
[43:25.520 --> 43:30.360]  indicted or harassed or audited and then the Democrats admit it's come out in
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.320]  documents it was done against their enemies this is serious political
[43:34.320 --> 43:41.920]  oppression on a scale thousands of times worse than Richard Nixon he had the
[43:41.920 --> 43:46.240]  names of maybe 130 140 people he might have harassed five or six of them and
[43:46.240 --> 43:51.600]  leaked information the press good indict him impeach him remove him because it
[43:51.600 --> 43:54.160]  could grow into thousands and then millions if you got away with it he
[43:54.160 --> 43:57.360]  didn't get away with it but we sit here and watch the Democrats that turn into a
[43:57.360 --> 44:09.280]  surly cult of losers led by people like Al Sharpton a coke dealing FBI rat I mean
[44:09.280 --> 44:16.800]  this is a sick joke and now we've got a government run by a bunch of thugs trying
[44:16.800 --> 44:21.240]  to start a nuclear war with Russia and look Napoleon did it Hitler did it
[44:21.240 --> 44:26.160]  elites always become disconnected from reality and think they're invincible on
[44:26.160 --> 44:33.840]  power trips in their big ivory palaces I've read no exaggeration 300 400
[44:33.840 --> 44:38.760]  history books history magazines studied it it's it's it's obsessive once you get
[44:38.760 --> 44:41.640]  into it because you see humans make the same mistakes over and over again this
[44:41.640 --> 44:45.800]  time we've got bio and nuclear and chem weapons and a lot of other advanced
[44:45.800 --> 44:52.400]  stuff and we cannot afford a world war but see they want to bring one final
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.200]  world war and to bring in the one final world government and that's biblical
[44:58.720 --> 45:05.600]  they open a theme park about the end of the world I guarantee if you had the
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.400]  funds you built one the right spot it'd be very successful very lucrative that's
[45:09.400 --> 45:14.080]  they're scared of is is the alternative groups of any type shelf funding
[45:14.080 --> 45:18.120]  mainstream media can lie all day get government funding government stimulus
[45:18.120 --> 45:22.320]  it's okay we dare fund ourselves selling high-quality products oh it's nasty it's
[45:22.320 --> 45:27.560]  dirty oh my gosh they don't want us having energy they don't want us building
[45:27.560 --> 45:31.200]  any culture other than their culture that's what political correctness is
[45:31.200 --> 45:36.800]  is you must adopt that culture out in the west we've got video coming up the
[45:36.800 --> 45:43.960]  next segment all over the country it's happening where a group of black people
[45:43.960 --> 45:51.480]  with their white trendy Soros handlers college students show up and show up at
[45:51.480 --> 45:56.960]  restaurants and yell at people and say raise your hand in solidarity for brown
[45:56.960 --> 46:02.160]  who was shot in Ferguson or you're a racist and the whites all submit basically
[46:02.160 --> 46:10.560]  and raise their hands under threat that is pure Soviet behavior black lives
[46:10.560 --> 46:16.840]  matter protesters target white diners eating brunch that is our story on
[46:16.840 --> 46:21.880]  drudgereport.com the middle column regardless what you think about this
[46:21.880 --> 46:28.280]  and then they say why you know every something seconds or every you know few
[46:28.280 --> 46:34.560]  minutes somebody gets killed and certain percentage are black yeah and nine out
[46:34.560 --> 46:39.240]  of ten blacks are being killed by blacks and these Soros handled groups their
[46:39.240 --> 46:43.480]  answer is banned guns always hear that you know the NRA is the new clan because
[46:43.480 --> 46:47.560]  black people are getting shot in areas where they've banned the guns nine out
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.760]  of ten blacks that are shot in this country look it up are shot by other
[46:50.760 --> 46:56.800]  black people and are there some police out of control absolutely but this is
[46:56.800 --> 47:00.600]  being pushed to create division because they want to solve each other's
[47:00.600 --> 47:06.040]  throats and it's truly disgusting now let me just read you some of the other
[47:06.040 --> 47:10.840]  headlines that are coming up as well today I mentioned this yesterday but
[47:10.840 --> 47:14.040]  didn't get to it on the Sunday show the hills come out the next one article
[47:14.040 --> 47:19.920]  basically saying why the FCC power grab is illegal because it's not a law it
[47:19.920 --> 47:23.400]  came out of a regulation there wasn't the proper comment period it was kept
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.360]  secret it violates a whole bunch of federal laws just like Obamacare does
[47:28.360 --> 47:33.240]  they have to have a Supreme Court ruling changing law basically to say this was
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.200]  okay and even that would be unconstitutional because that'd be the
[47:37.200 --> 47:42.400]  Supreme Court making law but it doesn't even have that this is the other type
[47:42.400 --> 47:45.480]  of headlines I have okay
[47:45.720 --> 47:52.040]  Orwellian nightmare unleashed on schools now I told you this 20 years ago again
[47:52.040 --> 47:54.560]  not bragging I'm just saying this has been going on a while that WorldNet
[47:54.560 --> 47:58.360]  Daily has the proof when your kids go and take standardized tests now that are
[47:58.360 --> 48:02.400]  federalized under bushes and the neocons and the Democrats working together just
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.360]  like they work together on Obamacare and gun control and open borders and the
[48:06.360 --> 48:11.120]  FCC power grab Republicans went along with that when you go write essays you
[48:11.120 --> 48:15.600]  name it it's all kept by the feds and all put in databases and that's in this
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.040]  report they just have the documents so there you go you know they ask you in
[48:21.040 --> 48:24.560]  these essays right about your parents medicine cabinet for heaven's sakes I
[48:24.560 --> 48:28.920]  mean that's just you can't make this up your parents own guns this is
[48:28.920 --> 48:35.440]  databases with keyword ah federal lunch federal education the Department of
[48:35.440 --> 48:41.160]  Defense in many schools now under grants runs the AI cameras studying the
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.160]  students and scanning how many calories they eat from a distance that's
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.200]  San Antonio Express News three years ago look it up you can't make it up I mean
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.800]  folks it might as well be a space alien for 55,000 light years away that what
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.640]  the elite are building will be a new life form this AI system it's probably
[48:58.640 --> 49:04.000]  already self-aware and it's being built to end humans and have a war with us and
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.800]  win and it's not going to win with combat robots and micro drones that's a
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.320]  small part of it it's going to win by computer actuaries of the economy to
[49:14.320 --> 49:19.160]  incrementally shut things down and fight a psych warfare system with us with
[49:19.160 --> 49:23.600]  future predicting programs to predict mass movements and individual movements to
[49:23.600 --> 49:28.320]  then war game everything so it's impossible to beat only full awareness
[49:28.320 --> 49:31.920]  of the enemy takeover can beat it and let's just go with a Christian view
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.440]  because that is my view it is a spiritual entity from another dimension
[49:35.440 --> 49:40.920]  known as Lucifer Satan the devil the Bible's real folks it is a fallen
[49:40.920 --> 49:46.200]  entity I've studied this and it makes my face so much stronger that is on this
[49:46.200 --> 49:50.680]  planet with advanced intelligence ladies and gentlemen that is seeking to
[49:50.680 --> 49:55.560]  destroy this creation and build another one on top of it now the elites believe
[49:55.560 --> 49:59.520]  at skull and bones of Bohemian Grove that they are actually worshiping fallen
[49:59.520 --> 50:02.640]  angels that are the good guys and they're gonna give them eternal life and
[50:02.640 --> 50:09.080]  power that's right on the Bible folks my god we're on a planet and people can't
[50:09.080 --> 50:13.320]  even figure this out I mean it's all real it's all happening but they've
[50:13.320 --> 50:17.040]  seized the churches and the churches think that Christians don't get messed
[50:17.040 --> 50:22.320]  with that we just get teleported out of here no that comes after all this I mean
[50:22.320 --> 50:27.080]  this is epic people they're micro chipping folks all over Europe to have
[50:27.080 --> 50:34.760]  jobs now that was in the BBC three weeks ago but even if the spirit of Satan
[50:34.760 --> 50:41.200]  isn't real and I've studied this thing folks it's all it's it's not of this

[54:23.080 --> 54:28.240]  mouths of all the transhumanist all the top-tech people it's all over TV it's
[54:28.240 --> 54:31.520]  all over movies the world without humans get rid of the humans wear a
[54:31.520 --> 54:35.960]  parasite all hail the age of the machines we're being told it's over for
[54:35.960 --> 54:41.520]  us and that the elite are gonna merge with machines and become gods I mean
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.760]  that's the devil in the garden join me become gods so it doesn't matter whether
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.600]  this is real or not take a Carl Jung view that it's an archetype a dark archetype
[54:51.600 --> 54:57.560]  humans mass consciousness collective intelligence has combined to now build a
[54:57.560 --> 55:05.360]  giant satanic takeover system so either way you cut it it's real because we're
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.720]  manifesting it and I don't mean all that stuff about the secret where you have
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.120]  intentions and it happens you you've also got to have the energy the will the
[55:14.120 --> 55:19.000]  circumstance and the luck and then providence or sometimes dark providence
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  that's out there as well to do amazing things it's not just you imagine
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.360]  something and then it happens but when you get masses of people imagining
[55:28.360 --> 55:32.360]  something and doing it science fiction of a hundred years ago is almost all
[55:32.360 --> 55:38.760]  reality now because we're built in the image of the creator that built and made
[55:38.760 --> 55:43.960]  the universe this dimension you can say oh whatever does it matter you can say
[55:43.960 --> 55:47.800]  oh that's just stuff written by Jews 3,000 years ago you know what do they
[55:47.800 --> 55:53.320]  know doesn't matter we envision it we build it we are made in the image of the
[55:53.320 --> 55:59.240]  crater it's true whether it's fiction or not and I'm not even debating that I'm
[55:59.240 --> 56:06.360]  saying it's true because it's true veritas is veritas 2 plus 2 equals 4 it
[56:06.360 --> 56:13.400]  stands on its own I'm not gonna explain why I'll get to the black lives matters

[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.760]  official mainstream news now analyzing the legislation that wasn't
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:23.440]  legislation that came out of the executives pushed through the FCC that
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.480]  it is an internet power grab the tax and control it new Obama internet
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:34.840]  regulations mean new taxes and less service that's Fox News well we told
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:40.480]  you so it's a curtain mo article up on info wars dot com ar-15 ammo ban already
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.600]  back as Dems demand even wider ban this ties into the FCC situation I've just
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:51.840]  learned these tactics in 20 years on air if there's massive opposition forming
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.080]  to an ammo ban that would then set a precedent to ban all the rest the ammo
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.360]  within the ar-15 and then all the rifles and all the semi-autos which is the
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:03.760]  admitted plan by George Soros and others they stated it so it's Bloomberg just
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.920]  like the mayor proteam Mike Martinez said yeah we're gonna register guns in
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.840]  Austin and then ban them yeah that's our plan of course and laughed at everybody
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:17.480]  when it was brought up to even a speech last week I was on Tuesday and I said
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:24.000]  this is not real the ATF saying we've heard from you we're gonna shelve it and
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.600]  figure out what we're gonna do I said yeah they're gonna shelve it a week or
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:32.360]  two till opposition drops everybody thinks they've won it's just like saving
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:37.600]  private Ryan when he's fighting with the Nazi soldier and he's starting to get
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.720]  the upper hand with the bayonet about to stab him the Nazi goes don't hurt me
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.320]  don't hurt me let's be friends and then he hesitates the Nazi flips over and
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.440]  drives the knife into him I mean it's real simple and now the Democrats have
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:55.440]  announced they're moving forward and saying just ban all 223 basically an
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:03.240]  entire class of m855 that's a planking ammo so it's on just an outright complete
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.880]  man they actually want to come arrest you if you have it if they get this
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.320]  through so I told you they just waited till we all went home and thought we'd
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.480]  want a week and then they had us again and then they'll play possum again it's
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:22.480]  all warfare tactics let me shift gears FCC I told you that they wouldn't release
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.760]  the regulations they wouldn't do it during debate he wouldn't testify to
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.400]  Congress where the law supposedly comes from instead it's just a regulation and
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:34.040]  then they wait two weeks until the story leaves the news and then they release
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:40.080]  it and it's 400 pages not 332 and it's worse than we thought see how they do
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.280]  that it's tactics just like releasing a story on New Year's Eve or Friday night
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:51.240]  or signing the NDAA to secretly arrest Americans at 11 o'clock at night on New
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:58.960]  Year's from Hawaii this is how they operate and it's disgusting that's all
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.760]  coming up today it's all on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com now Kent
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.040]  Hovind is a true American political prisoner he's to try to call in from a
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.520]  federal prison and I don't know how to name the federal president as they'll
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.880]  run and start harassing him right away it'll take the bureaucrats a wall to
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.680]  figure out where he's at and how to stop the interview but it's a legal
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.560]  interview but that we've had him try to stop these before Kent when they were
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:27.960]  indicting him a decade ago or more was on with us creation speaker Dr. Kent
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.040]  Hovind has spent already a decade in federal prison charged up to a hundred
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.000]  years for mail fraud and you look at what he did it was nothing he was a
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  science teacher 15 years began a full-time creation ministry became very
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.840]  successful he debated more than a hundred scientists concerning evolution
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.880]  versus creation and created the well-known seven-part video creation
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.640]  series translated 30 languages he reached over a billion people he had a
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.600]  very popular theme park it was 501c3 which there's a lot of other Christian
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.600]  theme parks you're allowed to have that but you notice you've had thousands
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:03.680]  over 10,000 501c3s denied to Christian charities the last six years the
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.800]  numbers more like 15,000 with the oldest numbers about 10 and more than 10,000
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:12.400]  groups audited or indicted mainline conservative groups pro-gun groups pro
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:19.560]  life groups pro-veteran groups anything right of Mao Zedong basically but Kent
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:26.360]  Hovind was charismatic nice friendly great guy I didn't particularly agree
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:32.560]  with his brand of creationism I already talked about that doesn't matter I don't
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:36.760]  think men's interpretation of the Bible or these transhumanist eugenicists and
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.920]  and Darwin's view and social Darwinism I don't agree with that as well there's
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.520]  clear jumps in all this and manipulations and we're not being given
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.440]  the truth I mean the evolutionist have been caught in so many peltdown man and
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.400]  other frauds but I'm not going to debate all that the age of the earth any of
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:13:03.080]  that I've read the Bible I have my own interpretation and it's it's wild and
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.760]  the globalists believe something similar but from their perspective so they
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.400]  don't even believe all the top genetic engineers people they believe in
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.440]  transpermia and panspermia and off-world seeding they don't believe this but the
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.760]  point is even if you disagree with Kent Hovind why is he in prison with them
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.400]  with with 2020 specials about the incredible fraud he said dinosaurs were
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:28.920]  around during during Noah's time and Adam and Eve before that what a kook and
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:34.440]  he doesn't pay taxes and he's going to prison you can go start any church you
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:40.160]  want and get 501c3 you can teach that Ronald McDonald is the savior you can
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.520]  teach whatever you want that's called religious freedom the first amendment but
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.880]  see he went to prison he's been set up so now everybody else is fair game who was
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.200]  the minister of Nazi Germany first they came for the trade unionist and I didn't
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.960]  speak up because I wasn't one then they came for this group and finally they
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.160]  came for me it was nobody else left to speak now joining us first you'll
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.360]  probably ride shotgun with us into Kent being on with us Mark Adams has been on
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.280]  before he's writing a book on congressman Hanson I interviewed many years ago
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.320]  he's sick right now and can't come on he was indicted multiple times found not
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.960]  guilty so they kept arresting him and then driving him around in a truck for
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.160]  months called diesel until his feet burst they tortured him in holding cells
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.480]  you name it because he was trying to abolish the IRS you say why don't more
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.000]  congressmen do that because they'll grab you in torture the hell out of you
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  federal marshals will mark Adams is been fighting for Kent Hovind as well it has
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.680]  the documents in the history so mark this is about everybody here but I mean
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:47.120]  such a good loving Christian well-spoken charismatic charming guy I love the
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.120]  fact he's challenging this official a religion of Darwinism and and evolution
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.600]  as it's taught is just totally false been proven false but regardless even if
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.680]  Kent Hovind was wrong he has the First Amendment and a right to be a Christian
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.600]  that teaches his faith just like Muslims have a right to you know their faith but
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.960]  but there's a war on Christians but let's let's let's get into his case for
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:20.160]  folks that don't know about it right now Mark Adams well Alex it was in 2006
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:28.080]  when a jack booted Tommy Nazi government Gestapo groom squad arrested
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:35.560]  pastor Kent Hovind and his wife Joe at gunpoint inside their home in the dark of
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:43.680]  night and then later on that year pastor Hovind was convicted on a 58 count
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:53.880]  indictment now 45 of those counts had to do with so-called structuring that is
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:16:01.360]  Dr. Hovind was withdrawing money from his bank account in order to fund the
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:07.840]  needs of his ministry and for these withdrawals they were typically more
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:15.800]  than $5,000 but less than $10,000 and because he was doing that the government
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:22.640]  was pursuing him as if he was part of a drug cartel or a terrorist or a guy with
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.000]  no criminal record a school teacher about a successful ministry in a theme
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.680]  park and and we just put on screen the New York Times let's put it on screen the
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:38.240]  headline law lets IRS sees accounts on suspicion no crime reported it talks
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.440]  about old ladies with tiny businesses I mean I pull out cash all the time to
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.560]  give bonuses to people at Christmas and stuff but I give 300 bucks to employees
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.520]  you know it's like 10 $15,000 to get all that out that's not structuring that's
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.040]  after-tax money but this is how they use the quote rules not the law in a reign
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:04.600]  of terror go ahead exactly the IRS has a reputation of ruthlessly using these
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:13.040]  so-called structuring laws to terrorize innocent citizens there was hearings
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:19.520]  about this last month and the upshot of it was is that what the IRS would try to
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.480]  curtail they said we're gonna stop doing it and cut it back and we're sorry for
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.200]  34,000 innocent people having their lives ruined or people be through in
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:31.160]  prison for no reason and all our fake juries and the rest of it because they
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.760]  even go further but it's just like the ATF last week saying we won't ban your
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.440]  bullets they're back this week and this is a criminal operation indeed and in
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:46.960]  fact if you look into the court case itself it gets even worse the 11th
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:55.600]  Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction on all of the 45 so-called
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:06.480]  structuring charges but in 2013 the 11th Circuit overturned a guilty verdict on a
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:13.200]  separate case this was US versus Lang a separate case of structuring the overturned
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:20.120]  the verdict because of the way the federal prosecutors mishandled the
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.200]  case and there were clearly orders to go and get him because he was articulate
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.080]  good-looking reaching over a billion people with his ministry he was
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:35.720]  incredibly successful and so that's why they came after him indeed and now and
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.080]  like I said the bulk of the charges of these so-called structuring charges the
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.640]  11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction but then a little more than a
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:50.520]  year later when the same kind of case came before them they overturned the
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.160]  conviction on this guy Mr. Lang because of the way the federal prosecutors
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:01.480]  mishandled his case but the procedures that the prosecutors used on Mr. Lang
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:08.960]  were exactly the same procedures that they use on Kevin Haunt, Haunt but yet
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:18.520]  they will not apply that ruling retroactively to Pastor Haunt's case so
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:23.480]  in other words they overturned the structuring charges against Lang but
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:28.800]  even though the same kind of prosecutor misconduct was being applied in Pastor
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:35.000]  Kent Haunt's case they will not use that precedent to overturn his verdict
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.440]  unbelievable that was in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and that was in
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:46.000]  2013 we're gonna skip this network break as this is so important if they can get
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.160]  him they can get anybody instead of cowering in fear this agency needs to
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.120]  be abolished we need to go back to the taxing system we had previous to the
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.400]  fellow Reserve Act of 1913 and the subsequent income tax it is such a scam
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:06.040]  but he still languishes in prison even though the New York Times admits this
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:11.040]  is a criminal fraud their interpretation of the law used to persecute innocent
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:16.840]  people and anyone including folks that pull cash out of ATMs you know deposit
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:21.320]  your money pull cash out you are a criminal no using cash is not illegal
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:25.760]  using cash is not a crime I've been doing it for a long time I also use credit
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.120]  cards and stuff but if it's private stuff I'm doing and not a company function
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:34.240]  then I'd pay for a lot of stuff in cash and I give tips in cash and people like
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.040]  I'm trying to keep cash alive everybody knows that that's not a crime well under
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:43.240]  their system they could doll up and dummy up this stuff on me we'll go ahead
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:47.400]  and try it crux because we're sick of you and we're sick of your criminal
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.680]  activity and we're sick of the fact that all these Democrats and some
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.760]  Republicans and Al Sharpton oh you know Al Sharpton owns five million dollars of
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.800]  taxes and doesn't have to pay him I mean it's absolutely disgusting how they
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.320]  selectively use the IRS to persecute people and and to shut down this this
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:11.720]  person's ministry it is just amazing obviously the orders came down to
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:16.120]  persecute him this happened under Bush but it continues under Obama and now
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:22.160]  it's expanded continue Mark Adams breaking down the case and how he's
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:28.680]  doing in prison indeed now you mentioned Al Sharpton he owes over a million
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.920]  dollars in taxes and the numbers I've seen between four and six yes and then
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:39.920]  let's not forget Charlie Rangel Congressman Charlie Rangel he has a
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:46.640]  whole pattern of tax evasion special treatment and enrichment that seems to
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.840]  increase with his power and prestige in Congress there's an article exposing him
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:58.520]  on the New York Post a few years ago then let's not forget former Treasury
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:06.240]  Secretary Tim Geithner big headlines in form in our Forbes magazine Geithner's
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:14.720]  tax troubles are serious yet he goes on to become the Secretary of the Treasury
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:23.040]  another disturbing aspect during the trial now I'm referring to his first
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:30.720]  trial Kent Hovindt explained how an IRS agent Scott Schneider he was a
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:37.160]  witness for the government he sat at the prosecutor's table for the duration of
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:42.920]  the trial even though he's a government witness witnesses are not supposed to be
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:50.840]  in the courtroom and during that interview Pastor Hovindt explained he was
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:57.440]  concerned how the presence of an IRS agent you know might intimidate the
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:03.520]  jury well let's go forward we're putting the document on screen they had FBI
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:10.440]  agents on the jury now this is a separate case
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:16.880]  Alex this is from 1981 no no not that case yeah yes but what do you see here
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:24.720]  is US Attorney Harold Edwards is writing a letter to the IRS district
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:32.520]  director Woodrow Malone and you see right on page 2 Edwards is stating how
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:40.800]  agents of the FBI will be seated on the grand jury so this gives you some
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:45.720]  insight as to the lengths that our government will go through to persecute
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:53.280]  a targeted victim that's right they target who they want then they put
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.840]  government agents in at these federal juries grand juries and then juries as
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:03.600]  well that's why they have a 96 to 97% federal conviction rate because it's
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:12.240]  totally fake or no indeed in fact one of the conduct with government with
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:16.320]  conduct in federal judiciary that was discovered by Congressman George Hansen
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:24.560]  he disclosed how US attorneys were obtaining confidential tax records on
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:31.240]  jurors without that person's knowledge or consent so that's been going on for a
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.800]  long time well let's not go to what I told folks a decade ago that was
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.560]  declassified last year for decades they've used the NSA the DEA has to
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.920]  create fake cases with fake spy data without warrants and they create fake
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.960]  cases for the court do mock trials even fake evidence and then the judges even
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:56.520]  know and they go in and stage the whole thing the address deal case is very
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:01.960]  typical of that of course loving government run by the actual drug dealers
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:08.440]  indeed also there's another one dr. French Anderson is sitting in prison
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:15.240]  right now he has evidence that this is not the federal government this is the
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:21.360]  Los Angeles Sheriff's Department that framed him he now has evidence that the
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.160]  recordings they used in court were totally fabricated yet he could not get
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:30.400]  the courts to overturn his case
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:37.800]  well all I know is Ken Hoven was incredibly successful and they got him
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.400]  on wire fraud and they always seem to use that or the FBI comes to visit you
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.400]  and then ask you a bunch of questions then you get something a little bit wrong
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.640]  they claim lying to a federal agent the answer is never talk to them now talk to
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:57.440]  the hand that is the answer do not talk to them one bit and then the only way
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.360]  they've defeated EPA and FDA lawyers harassing companies is you then have to
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.720]  start investigating and doing lawsuits against the judges themselves and start
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.080]  doing corruption investigations on the judges and it's the only way they back
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.800]  off I mean the government I've talked to top national lawyers on air I've talked
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:18.920]  to the top a lawyer who sues the the FDA always trying to ban vitamins and the
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.920]  only way to shut them down is you start basically investigating the judge it's
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.520]  the only thing these mobsters understand and boy when you start
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.320]  investigating them it is incredible I got to say state judges aren't that corrupt
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.640]  on average compared to the feds and I'm not defending the states either they
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.760]  have their own problems that people who look to the feds to come in and fix
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:42.200]  things that's like asking Satan to come in and you know make slimer behave or
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.560]  something you know a little lower demon it's kind of mindless running around you
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.960]  know engage in mischief compared to the mastermind Satan himself what else we
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:57.400]  need to know Mark Adams about the Kent Hovey case yes we have some
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:05.680]  information about the judge us district judge Margaret Rogers I'm going back now
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:11.960]  to the first trial when he was sentenced by her and she said to him that his
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:22.320]  crimes were worse than that of a rapist now during a telephone interview from
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:28.920]  Mark Kent Holland he named Baptist minister Dr. Greg Dixon as one of the
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.640]  witnesses who heard Judge Rogers make that a
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:41.720]  outrageous remark and I spoke with Dr. Dixon and he affirmed me yes he heard
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:48.080]  the judge say that he also executed a signed affidavit
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:54.520]  affidavit stating that several other people also submitted sworn affidavits
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:00.360]  the reason why they took that course of action is when Kent Hovey finally got
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:07.120]  the court transcripts those words did not appear in the official transcripts
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:13.360]  yet even though they have witnesses witnesses who have submitted affidavits
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:20.000]  no investigation was launched as to why those words are missing of official
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:28.840]  court transcripts please continue writing it down okay now again judge
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:40.840]  Rogers in 2009 Judge Rogers cited two school teachers for content for
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:50.720]  silently praying before lunch oh afterwards 50 congressmen issued a
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:58.000]  letter supporting the teachers one of them representative Jeff Miller said a
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:07.040]  federal judge has gone well outside the bounds of the Constitution to declare
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:13.160]  that prayer offered among adults is illegal and that is from the Washington
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.880]  Times that's right we've got it on screen that was just recently and for
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.680]  those that don't understand this in Texas there was a case there's been a
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:24.720]  bunch of these just last year where a little it was a eight-year-old girl
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.320]  brought her little little pitcher Bible Sunday School Bible in her bag and they
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.760]  took it away from her and tried to suspend her as if you couldn't have a
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:35.720]  Bible in the school she could have whatever book she wanted you can have a
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.080]  Harry Potter book but not the Bible it is a war on Christians are we gonna put

[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.120]  early by the IRS early 90s I tried everything to find out what do you want
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.520]  I answered their letters they never answered mine finally they came with a
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:53.000]  SWAT team and to everybody off the property it helped my wife hostage for
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.360]  17 hours made her open the church safe took all the money out of there it's

[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:17.360]  never done anything illegal and they arrested us for structuring my wife
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.560]  had just gotten to sleep and they took her down to the courthouse in her
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.880]  nightgown wouldn't let her put a robe on wouldn't let her get dressed wouldn't

[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:35.280]  know amazing piano teacher so the charge was structuring which I'd never heard
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.520]  of they said well yeah you took your own money out of the bank actually it was
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.760]  ministry money out of the ministry bank account to pay ministry bills back in
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:53.840]  2002 2003 and 2004 okay we stopped in 2003 okay so what that's illegal well
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.400]  yeah you did it in a mouse less than $10,000 oh so we took it to trial I
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.840]  thought you're supposed to win your innocent there's no crime here at all
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.840]  after the government putting on their dog and pony show my attorney said don't
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.920]  even give a defense everybody can see you did not commit a crime the law says
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:15.520]  you have to have two or more transactions in one day each transaction is
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:21.240]  under 10,000 but you those two total over 10,000 okay well ours was one
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:29.040]  transaction every 12 days not a crime at all but then they said nope that's
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.360]  structuring over those years you withdrew $430,000 of ministry money to pay
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.520]  ministry bills okay and so we did not even give a defense at the end of trial
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.760]  the judge changed the jury instructions and said if you find they took out less
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.840]  than 10,000 you must find them guilty so he changed the law under judicial
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:54.200]  tyranny right there on the spot well yes a woman judge judge Casey Roger I
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:00.000]  think that was wrong to change the law and so the jury of course found us
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.560]  guilty well yeah they took out less than 10,000 you know go to the bank take out $10
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.560]  less than 10,000 so guilty then the judge said now all that money that was
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:13.720]  withdrawn even though you stopped doing this three years ago all that money that
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.240]  was withdrawn over those years you now owe it to the government they're gonna
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.760]  seize that money well I don't own anything I live in a church
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.760]  parsonage I drive a church van I don't own anything so they put in a motion
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.360]  saying we want to seize the church ministry property of course the church
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.880]  trustees that objection why don't you go seize Walmart they got more money you
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.960]  know why don't you go see something else no no they want to taste the church
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.200]  ministry property to pay this these structured funds when there's no crime
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.280]  sure all involved ever and sir in the time we have with you we know we know
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.640]  you're totally innocent the New York Times they had hearings last month that
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:50.880]  the law says 10,000 they're going after 86 year old women with no criminal record
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.840]  who run tiny diners that seat 10 people who would make cash deposits every day
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.280]  of less than a thousand and then would write checks on that they called
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.680]  depositing it structuring and money laundering so they do whatever they
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.880]  want outside of law it's all admitted you should be released they've overturned
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.720]  other cases like yours here's the big question why did they target you obviously
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.240]  to shut you down what do you think of the massive persecution of the church now
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:21.240]  it's meant to intimidate the church into submitting going under government
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:25.880]  faith-based initiative my view give us your take on that and then be how do we
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:33.440]  free Kent Hovey well yes there are plenty of websites free Kent Hovey.com
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:39.680]  it's H-O-V-I-N-D or we can name Hovey Congress needs to reveal that stupid
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.280]  structuring law they need to get a lot of pressure to say look would you IRS
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.760]  apologize for misusing it well that's step one but that's nowhere close to
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.200]  enough get Congress to repeal the stupid law and very important make it
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:56.400]  retroactive and say okay anybody ever arrested under this stupid law is here
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:00.880]  by released and all money taken from them is here by returned and they get a
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.760]  million dollars for every year false in cars. These calls from the Santa Rosa County
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:10.160]  Sheriff's Office. I've been locked up over 100 months away from my family I've
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:14.880]  been moved 23 times all over the country diesel therapy trying to shut me up I
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.840]  am an outspoken Christian I believe the Bible is literally true and
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.520]  scientifically accurate and with my science background I just I've done a
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:26.480]  hundred debates against atheists and I slaughter them sweetly and Christian love
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:33.080]  so they just hate me for just teaching the truth and there are thousands of
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.440]  anti-hovens websites. They are totalitarian scum this just proves it
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.360]  they're the opposite of liberals in your case you're such a gentleman you're so
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:46.560]  sweet you reached a billion people you are a superstar who was very humble you
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.760]  just come across as a total boy scout and and they are it just it to see an
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:56.320]  innocent man persecuted like this makes me sick and these churches have been
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.480]  intimidated by this type of stuff to submit to the government now and even
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:06.120]  teach what the government says it is disgusting. I'm sorry go ahead. To make it
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.760]  even worse to make it even worse a year ago I filed a perfectly legitimate
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.680]  lawsuit against the Bureau of Prisons for keeping my legal box and hindering me
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.280]  from filing my motion and I filed a perfectly lawful
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.160]  suspended the litigation pending which says hey could they want to sell the
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.240]  church property they did they already did and now they're coming after you for
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:34.040]  pro say activity tell folks about that. Yeah they wanted to finish trial last
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:39.320]  Friday they came after me again a two-week trial saying you face another
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:44.320]  hundred years in prison for filing this Liz Pendants and for contempt of court
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.760]  which is insane the jury was a hung jury on every count except for one they did
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:54.760]  find me guilty of contempt of court of a 2007 order and my attorney is putting
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.680]  in a motion saying look there was no law on that. Will you ever get out of
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.360]  prison? I mean I mean it's incredible how long how long you've been in
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.480]  prison how long will they keep you they just keep trying to pile it up what
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.280]  happened in the new court case? Well the new court case it was a hung jury on
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:18.840]  everything except one count when I was found guilty and that one carries
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.880]  anywhere from nothing to there's no limit 100 years I suppose contempt of
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.880]  court which what on earth is that so we're working now to get that jury
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:33.800]  verdict overturned who knows I was supposed to go home last month from this
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.840]  last charge but I've been sitting in a county jail with 11 guys sleeping on the
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:45.720]  floor and for 10 months now. Well I had Michael Allison on a few years ago he
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.000]  was facing life in prison for filming the police and taping the police on his
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.640]  own property and this and the state actually tried to get him life in
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:59.000]  prison for that I mean this is totalitarianism is it not? It is
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.640]  indeed and Edmund Burke said all that's needed for evil men to triumph is for
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.800]  good men to do nothing and we've got this is America for heaven's sake we've got
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:11.440]  freedom we need to take advantage of the freedoms and use it right now
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:15.040]  Congress can change all this Congress created this club that they're
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.120]  clubbing everybody with take it away Congress should pass a law that says
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.440]  no one involved in law enforcement at any level judges lawyers etc should be
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.320]  allowed to own stock in the prison system that's right profit is double
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.240]  dipping the longer they lock you away the more money they make I wrote a book
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.120]  about this under a different name called the kennel it's up on lulu.com and on
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:43.040]  2peter3.com it exposes the evil all I do like Jeremiah the prophet is just
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.400]  simply expose the truth here's what's happening and boy they hate the light
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:52.120]  evil men hate the light well you're a very righteous man I mean I mean people
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.600]  can pick up on that you're just a straightforward Jimmy Stewart you know
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:00.680]  type guy that's how you come off they cannot stand you because you are a
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.920]  leader can and you're a hero it makes me it hurts my heart though to think about
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:11.360]  how they've tortured you and desold you tell folks what they've done to you well
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.760]  like I said been moved 23 times I was moved to Colorado I live in Pensacola
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.320]  Florida it's supposed to stay within 500 miles of your home while I was moved
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.640]  out to Colorado against my will and then moved up to New Hampshire against my
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.480]  will I was moved on to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery it's only there four
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.600]  days and they took me out never told me why put me in county jail it's been
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:37.880]  me diesel therapy but God's been good I've written 37 books I've led over 700
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:42.680]  men to Christ half the Bible is written from prison or by people who've been in
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:47.360]  captivity or prison so God uses it it's coming to everybody if you stand true
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.680]  for the Lord it's coming so just get ready for it it's been a blessing in a
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:56.760]  thousand ways it's been hard I have a eight-year-old grandson that I've never
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:02.160]  held in freedom never I was born in two months after I came to prison I should
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.560]  have gone home last month I could go home today if they overturned this one
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:15.920]  count but yeah I love the Lord I love my country I'm trying to help and I
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:19.360]  think all the stuff we have posted on two feet or three it would help the
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.340]  things people these people the thing they fear the most is light and all
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:27.760]  Gideon had in the book of judges was two weapons light and noise shine the
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:32.080]  light make a lot of noise and the enemy started fighting each other that's what
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.080]  I'm praying here the IRS agents in my case need to be completely investigated
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.760]  start to finish the judges need to be completely investigated if they did
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.400]  nothing wrong okay but Congress impeaches judges if they don't rule
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.200]  according to good behavior they rarely do that but the Constitution says they're
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.680]  pointed for life during good behavior okay well check the case well kid I get
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.520]  tears in my eyes not so much for you but for all the other innocents they're
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.240]  persecuting for the unborn for the fact of how they don't have death lists for
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.840]  our veterans who do not treat and nobody gets in trouble the evil is
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:15.280]  intensifying is our country beginning to come under judgment I fear it is
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:19.600]  brother if any country ever deserved the judgment of God it's America we had a
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:25.920]  wonderful founding a amazing blessings from God and we have spit in his face
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:31.120]  and we've done so many things against his law that I fear well the Bible says
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.840]  for the transgression of the land many are the princess thereof because we're
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:40.000]  wicked we've got this huge bureaucracy so God's giving us what we deserve and
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.800]  it's sands I appreciate what you guys do to try to turn it around I'm in the
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:48.920]  same boat I think righteousness exalts the nation but sin is a reproach to any
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:53.440]  people all I've ever tried to do for 46 years is win souls and tell people live
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:59.160]  for God you have 60 seconds remaining you have 60 seconds kid there from your
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:05.760]  political prison you've got 60 seconds final words okay what people can do is
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:10.600]  deluge Congress now this judge had said please write to me and let me know what
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.480]  you think about Ken Hovind should this you know on this one county was found
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.640]  guilty of I don't know that it'll make any difference but Judge Casey Rogers
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:28.640]  number one North Palafox BALA FOX in Pensacola three two five oh one and just
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:34.440]  say Judge Rogers please let Kent go home it's been 100 months just go home we
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.680]  still think we're gonna win the case we can always go on appeal but Congress
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.600]  needs to stop some of these stupid laws they need to simply abolish the IRS
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.560]  what do we need them for just shut them down we didn't have until 1933 just
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.840]  stop but if not at least investigate them look what they did in my case
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:56.600]  classic example of everything going wrong with our justice system and there
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:01.520]  you go he's now back sleeping on the floor in a giant mass of stinking
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.280]  inmates and I don't say they're stinking people you just know it stinks in
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.920]  there and I got with no criminal record school teacher did nothing wrong and the
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:16.920]  so-called left it's why I detest them they are the opposite of a liberal the
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:23.400]  opposite of Thomas Jefferson the opposite of freedom Congress shall make no
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.920]  law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.480]  exercise thereof that's how the first amendment begins you've got a preacher
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:37.800]  who was successful who they feared who was getting really big and he wasn't
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:44.320]  even making a lot of money he took four hundred thousand dollars out for the
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:50.520]  entire ministry over two years folks he had films that were selling millions of
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.920]  copies he was airing them for free all over the world he had different groups
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:01.000]  giving him out free wasn't charging in many cases books for children it's the
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.200]  first amendment and the left didn't like it as they put him in prison they'll put
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.840]  everybody in prison they're not playing games do we still have Mark Adams
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.920]  they're listening to that he's on the line sir Mark I mean I literally got
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:18.120]  tears in my eyes hearing that not so much for Kent Hoven but it was how
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.880]  cheerful he was and how nice he sounded sounded like you know Jimmy Sturt in
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:28.160]  it's a beautiful life or a wonderful life but just to know that they're doing
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:32.640]  this now to thousands of people and on MSNBC they brag and say yeah we're
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.300]  arresting people for their speech we're going to shut the Tea Party down I mean
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:42.640]  these people are brazen totalitarian flaming crooks they're not even liberals
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.840]  they're dangerous they're dangerous final comments on the Kent Hoven
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:52.360]  situation mark well Alex you just referred to the stent to the prison
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:59.040]  complex that dr. Hoven is subjected to speaking of foul stent just one of the
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:07.000]  prosecutors in Pastor Hoven's first trial was US Attorney John Atkinson he's
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.720]  the one who was reported to have vigorously pursued a federal indictment
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:22.440]  against dr. Hoven now Hoven was convicted in January 2007 shortly after his
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:30.000]  conviction the US Attorney John Atkinson assumed room temperature when he
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.360]  voluntarily removed himself from the gene pool here's what happened we're

[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:47.960]  unseasonably cold but i just would have paid al gore money everything would have
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:54.320]  been all right we've already covered it just a massive amounts of news and that
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:58.280]  whole can't hope that interview really upset me because i follow that case off
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:05.760]  and on the last decade and i've caught HBO shows and comedy central and msnbc
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:10.600]  just loving the fact he's in prison and going can you believe he had a park where
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:14.760]  kids could go on dinosaur rides and where they claim that there were
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:19.800]  dinosaurs in the time of adam and eve he thank god he's in jail he was running
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:27.280]  scams and keeping money 501c3 i wouldn't care if they got a huge mansion put
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:30.600]  down important information with a little house and at a van they hated him
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.120]  because he was so good man that got so good compared to somebody like me makes
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:40.000]  me sick i don't it's just let me tell you something and i meant to say that and
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.480]  i was gonna say you do bad things are really good man judgment comes down on
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:48.920]  you really quick and i didn't even know or remember that the prosecutor was a
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.920]  pedophile that killed themselves remember covering that in the news at the
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:58.560]  time and not even knowing that it was the prosecutor for him and i've seen so
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:04.520]  many cases where the sicko prosecutors are like hardcore liberals and pedophiles
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:08.880]  and stuff i mean they're just sick and they're in the system you might get a
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:14.720]  great judge you might get a horrible judge that's why i want to be careful here
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.720]  it's not even the government itself it's bad it's it's alien institutions like
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:22.480]  the fellow reserve it's out of control bureaucracy is like the FCC and the
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:27.120]  justice department it's the some of these federal prosecutors but i've been
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:30.000]  other federal prosecutors that are doing a great job and i see them doing great
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.680]  things and going after big banks and stuff and then they die in a car wreck
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:40.320]  not somebody i knew but i've seen cases of that so fighting for good you can get
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.880]  killed too but you know it's honorable to you know for them to kill you it's not
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:50.320]  honorable to be a pedophile so it's a war folks there's just a war between good
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:54.760]  and evil going on and each and one of us every one of us it's in our heart the
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:00.000]  battle is going on our hearts and minds it's a battle of hearts and minds in the
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:07.560]  final equation and i just am god fearing i want to be good i want to be
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:12.120]  around people that are good i want to be involved in justice i want to be
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:15.680]  involved in helping little people i want to be involved in powering humanity
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:22.400]  not suckering humanity and i grew up thinking everybody was like me and i
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.680]  learned no a lot of folks aren't like that they enjoy screwing over stupid
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:30.600]  people i was never the kind of kid in the neighborhood i was like 12 or 13 that
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:33.560]  would get the nine-year-old kid who wanted to go out and you know hang out
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:38.440]  with the older kids and beat them up or tell them go rob beer out of that
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:43.640]  garage over there we're gonna we're gonna beat you up or you know humiliate
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:49.800]  people i always wanted to empower people and build people up and those of us that
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.240]  do have a heart that loves justice we're blind to evil because we just can't
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:59.280]  imagine that people have it out for us well we got to grow up and you got to
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:04.240]  get angry at these people and stop having fear of them get angry know that
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:06.920]  they're gonna go down on the end and just get your heart right and your soul
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.720]  right because i'm not worried about he that can kill my body i'm worried about
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:19.320]  my soul i've been said many times in many different ways but what a parable of
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:23.600]  imprisoning this innocent man and i'm sure so many others and this federal
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:30.080]  prosecutor it's caught in his own web of pedophilia and it's the very same
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:33.600]  jocelyn elders democrats and in europe they're trying and under legalized
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:37.680]  pedophilia see that's why they don't want the morals is so they can do
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:41.800]  whatever they want whenever they want and they see somebody righteous like
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:47.320]  kent hoven and it just absolutely outrageous i mean even if you don't
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:52.600]  believe what kent believes dr. hoven believes still you can see he's an
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:58.240]  honorable man and at least he's not a eugenicist we'll be back stay with us

[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:32.480]  i know there's a war i know what the stakes are
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:35.760]  and if we can just get the public out of that transfer minute to wake up and
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.040]  look around them they're going to realize how far
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:40.960]  on the rabbit hole we've gone and they're going to
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:46.160]  get concerned and then they're going to start wanting to know more
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.600]  we can free the hearts and minds out there not to believe what we believe
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.200]  not to see what we see but just to open their minds
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:56.880]  open their eyeballs their ears up their smell their
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:59.920]  taste their touch
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:08.160]  this boy when you are awake it is wild and it's crazy to see other people
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:13.040]  bought into the system totally unhappy vapid
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:17.280]  i was driving around downtown yesterday taking care of business
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:20.560]  before i came up to the sunday show
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:27.120]  meeting with some folks and i was looking at the south by southwest crowd
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:38.320]  and they looked soulless they looked weak they looked stupid
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:43.600]  they looked aimless or they had narcissistic weird looks in their eyes
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.520]  like they would stand on this weird smile on their
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:49.200]  face looking inward on a power trip like when you're five years old again
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.840]  imagine your batman or robin or something on a power trip
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.040]  you're meant to do that when you're developing archetypes in your mind
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:59.360]  but not when you're an adult it's this false media echo chamber
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:04.160]  it's mind control i mean what is mind control there's a thousand flavors of it
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:08.640]  but if i'm lifting weights or i'm jogging
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.360]  or i'm on an elliptical machine if i listen to high energy music
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:17.360]  it could be Beethoven or zz top i can go for an hour
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:26.800]  at 80 or 90 i guess they call it rpms without it 30 minutes at 70 and i'm
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.360]  bored that's mind control hardcore music that really touches
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:34.720]  your mind touches your soul that's why going back thousands of years they
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:38.320]  have trumpet blowers and drum beaters for war
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.440]  marching armies up to each other to cut each other to pieces or blast each
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.800]  other to pieces that's why in that old is it a
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:48.960]  jimmy dean song who sings that song in 1814 we took a little trip i don't think
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:52.480]  it's jimmy dean it's somebody else
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:55.840]  along with colonel jackson down the mighty missus ship we took a little bacon
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.440]  and we took a little beans and we fought the bloody british at the town of new
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:02.720]  orleans they talk about they step so high
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:06.960]  it's johnny horton johnny horton fast away and headed to
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:11.120]  headed to louisiana and they had
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.120]  must have been a hundred of beating on the drum
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:18.960]  what's the words they step so high you could hear their bugle yell
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:21.840]  and there must have been a hundred of beating on the drum i'm probably butchering
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:25.440]  the words from memory it's all teleprompter free yeah blow that up for
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:28.480]  me i'll actually read it on air but i'm going somewhere with this they found
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:31.360]  thousands of years ago men would march into battle
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:34.240]  and fight in a vicious berserker fashion
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.640]  as long as there was a right beat of a drum going that's war
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:42.960]  in 18th whether it was africa or or or ireland
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:47.360]  whether it was germania or the aztec kingdoms
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:50.960]  everybody wanted to go into war to the beat of a drum that's mind control see
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.640]  and it just goes from there just admit it's happening
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:58.480]  in 1814 we took a little trip along with colonel jackson down the mighty
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:00.640]  missus ship we took a little bacon and we took a
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.240]  little beans and we caught the bloody british in the town of new orleans
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:08.080]  we fired our guns and the british kept it coming there wasn't not as many as
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.360]  there was a while ago we fired once more and they began to
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:15.440]  running on down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:19.600]  we looked down a river and we see the british come
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:23.120]  and there must have been a hundred of them beating on a drum and i guess for
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:27.360]  about every 200 300 soldiers they'd have somebody on the drums that was
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.800]  a large army they stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.480]  we stood beside our cotton bales and did the say a thing
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:39.760]  we fired our guns and the british kept it coming there wasn't not as many as there
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:42.880]  was a while ago we fired once more and they began to run it
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:47.680]  on down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico old hickory said we could take
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:52.480]  them by surprise and we didn't fire muskets till we looked them in the eyes
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:55.440]  we held our fire till we see their faces well
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:59.120]  and we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave them hell
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.040]  we fired our guns and the british kept it coming there wasn't not as many as there
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:06.480]  was a while ago we fired once more and they began to run it
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:10.960]  on down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico so just think about the power
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.480]  of a drum humans are humans whether it was
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.480]  ancient japan or ancient africa or ancient america
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.480]  from the native americans they were all the same folks
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:28.320]  and we're being manipulated against each other
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.520]  using technologies hundreds of times more sophisticated than a drum
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.240]  just be aware of the manipulation and you've got the intellect and the spirit
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.160]  to trump it because the devil's manipulation is nothing
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:47.120]  but the devil will force himself and his system on you
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:50.960]  this world system this predatory system call it what you want will force itself
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:56.800]  god won't and his free will so if you want to trump the devil
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:00.160]  you've got to ask christ into your heart and we've had a lot of complaints by
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:03.520]  people but also a lot of positive stuff with me talking about jesus on here
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:06.240]  almost every day i just talked from the heart
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:10.640]  the enemy is rising up right now the enemy is persecuting people worldwide
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:15.280]  it's intensifying and my heart gets closer to god
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:18.560]  the more i just prepare myself for what's coming
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:23.920]  and that's just a normal process and all you atheists or people out there
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:27.040]  if you don't like somebody that has a relationship
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:30.400]  with a spirit of love and doing to others as you do unto them
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.680]  if that upsets you so much you really ought to look at that i understand
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.040]  big establishment churches doing the devil's work meant to
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.240]  discredit christ that's what you don't like it's not the true spirit
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.160]  and i would challenge atheists and people and many of them have done this
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.000]  just to ask god hey god of your real show me
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.920]  give me discernment let me see the other side now
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.640]  careful what you ask for because all i'm offering is the truth nothing more
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:01.680]  okay because when you get real discernment folks you can really see what's
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:04.800]  going on and i just hope you're ready for it
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.560]  a lot of people aren't that's why they've brought up a bunch of
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:14.320]  self-obsessed arrested development babies out there
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:17.280]  and i don't take some pleasure in the fact that so many men and women are
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.160]  arrested i take great pain in that orwell talked
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:25.520]  about dumbing language down so much that you couldn't even communicate with the
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:31.040]  pros and that's what we now reach at this point
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:35.120]  and anybody trying to warn them they think that you're a kook
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:39.280]  or that you know that they have power over you because they laugh at you
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:43.840]  you got to understand that's like a seriously mentally retarded or brain
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:46.320]  damaged person standing at a bus stop drooling
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:50.080]  laughing at you when you drive by in your car you need to feel sorry for
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.760]  it's not funny and when none of us should take pleasure and i've done it
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:58.560]  myself a thousand times or more calling him sheeple making fun of people
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:02.240]  like mark dice says he doesn't go cherry pick to show stupid people that's
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:05.680]  everyone he talks to he talks to ten people he shows all of them
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.600]  and nine out of ten say put gun owners in slave camps murder everyone world
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:14.080]  government abort children up to age five
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:18.800]  we do similar interviews this is what they've done to these people
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:23.840]  they're gone they're gone they know they had a soul when they were kids they
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:27.360]  were put in front of a tv and brainwash and brought up by brain damaged parents
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:30.960]  and now they're gone folks they're gone i look in their eyes
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:34.480]  they got shark eyes with that little pig smile they're gone
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:38.560]  there's a demon in there running the show they're gone
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:42.560]  it's not funny they're gone
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:49.200]  and they're gonna tear us apart that's why the meme is zombies zombies the
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:53.360]  military training to mow down zombies that's the public but before they kill
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:58.160]  you they take your soul before they kill you they turn you into an animal
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:01.680]  that's metaphysical they're not allowed to go after a free man
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:04.720]  and kill them they can imprison you and torture you they're not allowed to kill
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:07.440]  you in most cases when they do it breaks the
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.440]  metaphysical law and blows up in their face it's why they can't kill
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:16.880]  people like the last guest we had on earlier
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:20.640]  they have to torture them and hope they can break their will
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.720]  but you notice they only get stronger under the attack
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:28.720]  this is a battle our spirits are in these earth suits
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:32.560]  we are here being tested think about how epic that is ladies and gentlemen
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:35.440]  and science has proven that there's an essence beyond the brain
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:38.480]  that's why the enemy says every day in articles it was out today
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:41.920]  that oh the science love discovered it's only in the brain
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:47.280]  well of course it's biological the spirit then manifest and resonates
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:52.000]  through it and as below so above to use the ancient alchemist statement of the
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.520]  enemy but it's true it's it's i've talked about this
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:59.840]  it's mirrored levels of we we have a spirit
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:03.040]  but we live on through the genetics of our ancestors and we have
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.720]  their their archetypal condensed compressed memories
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:11.120]  so we are partially those that came before us
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:15.280]  and then we have spirits above that and there's so many levels
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:18.480]  that's why people get confused and go i'm having these memories
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:21.680]  of of things and i i feel like i've been here forever well you have
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.880]  that genetic code that's one level of kind of the symbiotic
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:30.480]  group creature that we are our bodies our organs
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:34.640]  are are like a jellyfish that's a symbiotic colony
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:39.600]  humans are colonies our bodies are cell colonies
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:43.360]  with electromagnetic systems that they admit pick up the
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:47.600]  the literal winds of space and that are also picking up fourth and fifth
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.000]  dimension resonances and as scientists look at this
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:59.440]  we are basically a biosuit but the biosuit itself has experiences
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:03.120]  and is alive now i didn't read this in a book folks
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:06.160]  i've read all the different scientific components to it and then there's other
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:10.880]  layers to it it's just it's unbelievable how fantastic this is
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:15.120]  and the enemy's trying to poison that and jam it because there's no way if they
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:19.200]  can't poison and jam that there's no way that we're not going to be stopped
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.480]  going to the next level the eye has not seen the ear has not heard
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:26.480]  what god has in store for us but this is a testing ground
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:30.240]  like boot camp you can believe it

[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:18.160]  here we took a little bacon and we took the little beans and we caught the
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:21.920]  bloody british in a town in new orleans we fired our guns and the
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:25.120]  british kept a pet affiliate britain woven in the fabric of
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:28.080]  society we fired once more and they begin to
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:31.920]  rarely vote the balance is campaigning draws to a close
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:36.480]  incredible attacks on free speech we look down a river and we continue

[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:00.000]  phones up on any subject dominix wants to talk about drudge report dot com
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.320]  yeah there's an ap article uh up there that i have in the stack
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:10.240]  one year left of water for california as california turns into a desert
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:13.280]  i guess drudge is linked to the la times i saw an ap article about how it's
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:16.000]  becoming a desert uh number one they cut off a bunch of
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.600]  water at clamoth falls six years ago seven years ago
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.880]  they're cutting the lakes off on purpose that dub tells what the plan
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.400]  with the kim trail spraying the geoengineering out in the pacific to
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:31.520]  block rainstorms coming in so this is on purpose this is economic warfare
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.520]  against california i don't know what the master plan is you can war game it
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:39.920]  but that's my take on it dominik what's your take on it calling
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:43.600]  from the former state of california now globalist command base
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:48.800]  west coast uh yeah alexis dominik from kim chasers man
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:52.640]  i wanted to say thanks for having no idea that you were going to call in and
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:56.320]  it was it and it was you were with a kim trail angle but see that's my angle
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.920]  because we know the plane spray in front of the weather front the meteorologists
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.120]  have been on and said they're killing killing those weather systems that
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:06.080]  that battle needed water what do you make of all this
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:09.840]  uh two days before every storm that comes in we see it
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:13.280]  they go heavy and the storm hits it no rain
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:17.200]  uh we just went to lake todo and shot episode the lake was
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:22.480]  four feet down the mountains were bare of snow
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:27.280]  in the middle of february and what was on top of the mountains except about
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:33.120]  20 kim trails well and we've had the father weather weapons on in 1946 he was
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:38.400]  flying into uh both pacific typhoons and uh
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:42.800]  atlantic hurricanes ben livingston and he's the admitted after we had him on
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:45.680]  he was on fox news discovery channel then he got threatened when he come on
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:48.400]  anymore he was well spoken at 90 something years old and it was all
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:51.360]  declassified that they were creating hurricanes or killing
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.640]  hurricanes or weather systems by 1967 stanford research navy
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:00.400]  certified uh with the air force involved as well
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:03.200]  and so we've talked to meteorologists about the different stuff they can spray
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:05.760]  they can spray and make it rain or spray and make it not rain
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:08.880]  and they've done the testing as you know they are killing the rain on the west
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:11.520]  coast what do you think at least for california and
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:15.440]  oregon what do you think the plan is there
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:19.520]  um i mean i think it's to dry turn it into a desert like you said and
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:22.240]  get up these farms for pennies on the dollar
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:26.240]  um i also that's it then turn the water back on that's right go ahead sorry
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:31.040]  that's exactly i also i also found an article saying uh
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.520]  that the top four bottled water companies uh all set up shop here and
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:38.480]  that there's no regulation on the groundwater so they could just suck it
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:41.440]  dry so that's why i called is i wanted to ask you
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:46.560]  what can people do to get a filter and bottle their own water now and you keep
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:49.360]  it storable how how do they keep it storable so people could
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.120]  find out i mean there's different additives and stuff but
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:55.680]  i mean you'll still only get water to drink they're just going to jack up
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:59.680]  prices and have a big scam and then say it's the new blue gold and put you in
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:02.880]  regulations on it and claim it's global warming and use the crisis
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:06.560]  they clearly are helping engineer has another power grab thank you so much
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:10.960]  great points dominate uh kim chasers that's a great documentary series they
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:16.640]  do sherry in texas thanks for holding thank you alex listen regarding the
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:19.600]  indoctrination indoctrination of our children
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:22.800]  here's a message of hope at least in my opinion okay
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:27.760]  that there's a bright creative intuitive mind born every day and the suckers
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:31.360]  are dying out so i think the globalist's greatest
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.040]  threat regarding us is our spiritual nature our
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:38.640]  ability to function and the fact that computer god
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:41.760]  i'm gonna keep you over and hold this is so important because i'm not cutting
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:44.800]  you off but yes they're gonna be children and we know this is
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:48.480]  happening just like they spray bugs with poison
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:52.720]  a few generations later they have bugs that are semi-immune and then immune
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:57.680]  by the seventh eighth ninth generation well you're having spiritual children
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:00.880]  but also genetically and chemically that are more resistant
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:06.080]  and so yeah no matter what they hit us with humans are very special we're just
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:10.320]  going to end up at least a percentage of us
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:15.120]  jumping that curve and actually making us stronger is that what you're getting at
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:18.800]  yes it's a mind-body connection that are the globalist don't want to admit that
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:23.680]  we have um that our right brain is capable of evoking and receiving god's
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:26.880]  guidance healing we have healers in our community we
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.160]  can't talk about because we don't want them disappearing overnight you know
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:34.320]  and and intercessory prayer heals and there was something on 60 minutes
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:37.760]  that exemplified how they're trying to confuse us about this
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:41.440]  well we're going to come right back and and get your take on that
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:44.960]  undoubtedly humans have a lot of potential the army found that in secret
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.800]  studies that were declassified they're trying to suppress
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:52.640]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:57.440]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.760]  another major health threat this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the
[02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:06.240]  entire city has been told not to drink the water
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:09.920]  Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency did you know that the

[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:54.080]  and they're waging war against humanity i didn't know that joe banister the
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:57.520]  former treasury agent uh been a frequent guest on the
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:59.520]  show and some of my earliest documentaries
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:03.200]  has called in he found out the irs was all a big fraud and
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:06.640]  heard exposing it they tried to put him in jail repeatedly he was found not
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:09.520]  guilty in jury trials another true american hero he wanted to
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:12.800]  comment on the kent hoven case a political prisoner
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:16.320]  now they're openly wage i was talking to a high-level state judge just a couple
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:20.960]  months ago and uh he said no i he goes it really
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:24.000]  opens my eyes the iris is really doing this and it woke up a lot of you to
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.600]  share that we really are interning this is state judge i mean this is really
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:30.800]  going on and sometimes this this is evil is so
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:34.160]  outrageous you can't believe it's actually happening
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:37.520]  it's industrial scale now it's not just a few evil guys
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:40.960]  trying to screw good people over in the system it is a unified effort the
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:45.040]  republican leadership is quietly backing it the democrats are on showing it and
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:48.080]  riding the beast we'll go to joe banister in a moment
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:52.080]  sherry in texas so you had a point about 60 minutes go ahead
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:56.240]  yeah there was an example of how our society is trying to lead us away from
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:59.920]  understanding that we are we're human beings but we
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:04.240]  but primarily uh we we also function from a spiritual level you know and
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:08.960]  connect we can connect with god that's why intercessory prayer heals you know
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:13.520]  so there was this episode um it was some years ago about these people with this
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:18.320]  amazing autobiographical memory they could recall any day from their
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:21.840]  way back three years old two years old that's mary lou henner we've had her on
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:25.760]  the show okay well in that show there was a
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:30.720]  segment in the show where they um they confused
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:35.840]  the viewers they they showed it was about where in the brain the activity
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:39.360]  takes place and a guy held up the model of of a brain
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:42.320]  but instead of holding it up on the flat of his hand
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:45.680]  and then pointing very clearly here's the front of the brain
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:48.480]  here's the back of the brain here's where the activity takes place in the
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:52.240]  right temporal lobe he covered the front of the brain with his left hand
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:56.000]  and then he covered like like holding either end of a football
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.360]  he covered the back end of the brain with his right hand
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:02.080]  and then he said and here's where the activity takes place
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:05.840]  and he he's he rotated his right hand around to point to the right
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:09.520]  temporal lobe and now mind you the front of the back of the brain he shows
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:15.360]  where they are then he covers them and so when he points to the right temporal lobe at that same
[02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:21.520]  time the camera starts spinning and the whole room is spinning this is I don't you know I mean I
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:24.960]  might have just been an actor on the show but I hear you and I appreciate your call I mean I don't
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:30.240]  know what the point of doing that would be what I was getting into the brain was that they have
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:33.680]  all these articles just saying we're just animals we don't have free will it's all in the brain
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:38.000]  but then the elites are trying to always influence the manipulators and we know there is free will
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:42.880]  unless you've been basically turned into a zombie now I want to hurry through calls I want to go
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:48.000]  to Mark Bob Daniel many others that are patiently holding Kent Hovind if you just joined us has been
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.600]  in jail almost 10 years school teacher no criminal record was where it had reached over a billion
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:37:00.720]  people 30 plus languages his books and videos have been translated into saying that the official
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:06.800]  story of evolution is a fraud well it's been proven a fraud but they try to make it a scientific
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:11.280]  debate to discredit Christianity so Christians then try to become scientists and then try to discredit
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:16.640]  that I don't buy into Kent Hovind's you know interpretation of the Bible completely and I
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:23.120]  certainly know the globalist transhumanist eugenicist social Darwinist are a bunch of a cultist
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:27.360]  because I studied their own writings I've actually read what Darwin and his cousin Galton and others
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.000]  wrote this was funded by the British royal family as an excuse to say the public were animals it
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:37.120]  went back to Thomas Malthus and saying that you know the 80% of the public should be exterminated
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:42.480]  that's why you always hear that number he said the earth had its carrying capacity by 1900
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:45.200]  well you notice it didn't
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:53.680]  so it's a complex issue but that doesn't matter he has the first amendment and even the New York
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:58.480]  Times admitted they had hearings last month that tens of thousands of people a year are not even
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:03.520]  indicted their bank accounts are grabbed if they complain they're then indicted and they have kangaroo
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:08.080]  juries these are being exposed that's why you're getting some juries actually finding against the
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:14.800]  IRS now because they're having to seat real juries not you know basically pick juries and
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:23.920]  people are being found not guilty but in the in the case of Dr. Kent Hovind he's still in there and
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:28.880]  they went after him because if they could take him down they could take everybody down and the
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:34.640]  law said taking ten thousand dollars out of a deposit before taxes and you were trying to
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:39.200]  launder money or hide it that that you could then be indicted for money laundering if it was an
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:43.840]  association with the crime well even the New York Times admitted well now they do it down to a
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:49.200]  couple hundred dollars and totally innocent people with no criminal records who were even getting
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:56.800]  after-tax money so there's a war on cash and a war on the people but bigger than that there is a
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:04.640]  war on Christians real Christians to intimidate the church to go under total government control
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:08.960]  and the faith-based initiative started by Bush expanded by Obama where you go to big churches
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:13.440]  now I don't care if they're Baptist Catholic what is it's house the illegals turn your guns in world
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:23.280]  government's good abortions not that bad Bill Gates loves you it is amazing and people believe the
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:29.600]  church is God now and they will sit there and go against the teachings of Christ I don't care
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:34.240]  what's Methodist you name it and your family goes to these I've talked to people family I have they
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:39.600]  go doesn't matter I'm going to that church I love that church the church becomes God well the state
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:45.040]  runs the church the state is now God now I don't know his take on this but Joe Bannister we take
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.840]  an hour you know going over all stuff he went through another hero of this fight former treasury
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:55.120]  agent heard radio shows heard the IRS was basically a collection agency a federal reserve didn't
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:59.840]  believe it spent a year researching it went to a supervisor said can you disprove this they said
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:04.560]  how about you just resign and then they tried to put him in prison repeatedly for giving speeches
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:11.520]  but he got good juries and was found not guilty but this is not a game the real war is here at
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:18.400]  home in America but Kent Hovind Dr. Kent Hovind he is still in prison sleeping on the floor
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:24.000]  and it doesn't matter if other cases have been overturned they're having hearings in Congress
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:30.160]  they tried to call him in and convict him on new stuff just last month and he was found not guilty
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:36.800]  in that trial except on one charge so they want to keep Kent Hovind in jail why do you think that is
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:45.920]  Joe Bannister well they definitely want to discredit and silence anybody that is a credible
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:52.000]  resource and that you know you don't have to be an IRS special agent or former one to be credible
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:59.760]  and Dr. Hovind is obviously very credible and they've got to they've got to silence people like that
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:05.200]  and you know they try to do it to me and I was fortunate I mean he deserved justice every
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:12.960]  bit as much as I did and didn't get it and of course he's making the miserable inside I try
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:19.280]  to make the miserable outside but I really Alex I just appreciate everything that you guys all
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:24.960]  do and I wanted to chime in to support what he asked as far as getting people upset so they'll
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:31.520]  actually uh you know shout out to these the policymakers and lawmakers but as you've educated
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:36.640]  your listeners for a long time there's always an ulterior motive behind the legislation that's
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:43.760]  proposed and passed in DC and and you're so on target the money laundering laws and the
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:48.160]  structuring laws that you talked about those are a part of the money this is what you were trained
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:52.240]  for years and have a degree in and you know rated real criminals you know that were really
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:58.480]  laundering money uh describe the hearings in congress the new york times article and and
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:05.600]  specifically why these are being misapplied well there's off these agendas as you've as you've
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:11.680]  described so many times are you know 50 year plans 20 year plans they have all this stuff
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:18.480]  you know ginned up before they implemented and with the money laundering they wanted to spy
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:26.560]  on all of america really all of the world on their cash transactions on any any financial
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:33.600]  transactions you've talked about fin sen the orwellian group that monitors financial transactions
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:39.440]  throughout the world and so they used as a veneer or a smoke screen that we have to go after these
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:45.280]  drug dealers and these drug smugglers and everybody you know most most americans are like yeah well
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:51.680]  let's go after them and so they picked the bad guy to go after and then they usher in this entire
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:59.440]  framework of a spy grid for all financial transactions and especially cash transactions
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:06.240]  and that way they not only can trip up people like mr hovind who uh you know they don't they
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:13.120]  want to silence but they can monitor everyone's transactions just as the nsa does with their
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:20.640]  spying and it's so the ulterior motive obviously as is the case over and over again is to spy on
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:26.800]  the american people but they use some other excuse to do that and and so i just want to
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:32.080]  encourage people to absolutely scream bloody murder to the policymakers and legislators
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:39.440]  because this is a it's just a trojan horse that they're spying on us financially to try
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:45.760]  to get rid of cash and monitor cash transactions while we still have it and it's just it's a
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:52.560]  it's a total screw job as you said let me think about how that's a orwellian takeover inverting
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:58.000]  reality if you want to use cash you must be a criminal admitting they're spying on everything
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.800]  with their financial crimes enforcement globally offense in and then on top of that they've got
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:06.560]  know your customer which they've expanded to everything and if i try to go to the bank and
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:10.720]  get three four thousand dollars out of i'm going you know overseas in case my credit cards get
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:14.880]  turned off when i go cover bill deberg or something got accrued like six seven people
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:19.440]  three or four thousand dollars isn't even enough so last time we left the country that we got like
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:23.200]  eight grand or something in case they turned our cards off because we've had that done before
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:27.760]  as a form of harassment and the bank was just like freaking out going we're gonna you know this is
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:30.560]  under ten thousand but don't think you're not going to get looked at i'm like looked at it's
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:36.000]  after tax money or it's company money i mean i don't care you know i i sent my reporters out with
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  like two thousand dollars cash when they take a team of three or four people to california or new
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.560]  york that's not enough to even get back if their cards get turned off um it's just crazy how they
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:52.960]  make all of us criminals and then it's not even really laws it's just regulations passed by herbert
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:58.640]  walker bush right well i again i didn't want to take any more time but i just want to let people
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:05.200]  know it's an absolute uh trojan horse and i really hope that you'll help dr hoven out
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:11.040]  with you know screaming at your legislators the policymakers that they they create this framework
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:15.440]  and then they go after good people and and it's got to stop and we all have to you know
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:20.720]  scream bloody murder about it well they of course went after you once you had a trial found not guilty
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:24.880]  you might recap that for folks and then i think a second time correct you didn't shut up you
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:30.880]  intensified think about him i know because it's coming on record they've told him we can't go along
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.280]  and we'll let you out they said just give us your ministry we won't put you in jail he said no
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:42.400]  10 years in jail just to hear how honorable and wholesome he was and to feel it in my gut uh or
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:49.040]  a christian would say in my spirit made tears in my eyes for the people that would put him in jail
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:56.000]  i was about to say on air man i wouldn't want to get between you know god and them god's going to
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.400]  come after them because i see people have judgment brought on them not when they die but on this
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:05.840]  this world and then the guest after hoven had left brought up the article we put it on screen
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:15.040]  i'd forgotten his prosecutor was a horrid pedophile who committed suicide so i mean just just a
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:21.040]  year later or less look at how judgment got brought on that guy i mean that that's what's so scary
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:27.120]  about this that god fearing part of me shutters when i see the things these evil doers engage in
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:34.960]  and i would encourage people with the way i've achieved the most peace uh is to pray pray for
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:40.640]  my enemies pray for those who want to do me do me harm let god take care of the rest and and
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:45.760]  your the peace will come i'm talking about even people that are mad because they go after uh
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:51.200]  ken hoven or joe banister alex jones you still gotta pray for him that's what jesus said to do
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:57.360]  and it's best to follow what jesus told us to do how have you done it because i would take
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:47:01.040]  three hours whole story but they put you through living hell and you've told me privately made
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:05.440]  you a much stronger man and that and that it's actually been rewarding i mean but but but describe
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:11.200]  what that that process of going across the stormy seas been like for you former special agent uh
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:16.480]  you know rising up quickly great record and then you found out about the matrix and agent smith came
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:23.600]  after you well the matrix is a pretty good metaphor because i really intended to spend a full 20 year
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:29.520]  career with the irs what the family and uh friends that are in law enforcement and uh really just
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:34.880]  wanted to do good by my country using my financial skills to help my country and defend the treasury
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:41.760]  and all these noble things and a few years into the career found that the some allegations you
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:47.360]  know that the iris things you talk about a lot how the iris is really just a scam it's a you know
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:53.280]  blood brother the federal reserve has to work with the treasury was seized there was a financial
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:48:02.160]  coup yeah i did to cheat the and steal from the people without them knowing and so it took me two
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:08.480]  years to kind of wade through it all to see wow i think there's enough truth here that i should speak
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:14.160]  up i spoke up they told me to hit the road but they didn't fire me they just said you better hit the
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:19.280]  road because we're we're not going to answer any of your questions and that was in 1999 back in the
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:27.680]  last century and i've been and i was attacked in 2004 and died uh acquitted in 2005 thankfully as
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:34.160]  as is deserved by uh mr hovind and so many other people and i don't really when you say
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:38.800]  you about crying now it really hurts me too because i don't you know i have to kind of we
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:46.400]  have to accept what our what our lot in life and god's will and i i got justice and i deserved it
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:51.200]  and there's so many people that deserve justice and at least you know in our eyes and don't get it
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:57.840]  so i just try my best here on the outside to make us think and there's lots of people like mr
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:01.760]  hovind on the inside there make kind of stink and we all just have we have to help each other
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:07.280]  and again pray for our enemies so while we're doing that because you know we need to follow what god
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:14.720]  tells us to do and then god will i think help us all the more well exactly the fact that all this
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:18.960]  is coming out about the structuring laws and the harassment of christians and now the whole christian
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:25.280]  community is starting to find out about kent hovind and i remember him he's in jail i think in god's
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:30.480]  plan he'll end up reaching even more people because of this persecution and you know he sounded
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:35.440]  stronger because he was on with me a few times before they put him in jail he sounded stronger
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:44.320]  now than he sounded 10 years ago let me look at all all the certainly in the gospels in saint paul's
[02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:53.200]  writings uh also all those writers were persecuted crucified tortured and that's that's the words
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:59.040]  that we live by today so we all have to do our best to be good examples and follow them as best we
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:04.960]  can as imperfect as we are but each one of us can do an awful lot you know every listener out there
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:10.560]  and you're doing a great job and all brother well you're doing a great job we're all in this
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:15.920]  together and this is a great test there is a war going on and that's what's so frustrating
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:19.440]  the system doesn't want you to ever know the federal reserve's private or ever know the
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:24.720]  nsa spying but all those veils are dropping so humanity can have a big choice whether we're
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:29.840]  going to go into total slavery or say no god always gives us a choice and we're being given a
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:34.880]  choice right now will we get the reprieve as none of a god undoubtedly this peace system's
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:39.360]  going to come in but do we get a reprieve more time or does it start to happen now we're at that

[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:39.360]  products like for quite some time now they really do work those out there listening i've talked to
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:46.080]  you before about like um uh aboriginal or american indian people and what you were saying earlier
[03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:50.480]  i'm glad i called you while you were coming to state of mind but i've kind of a testimony to
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:54.800]  give about like even going to churches like you said doesn't matter what church we go to
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:59.120]  people don't want us to believe that we can have a relationship with our creator
[03:00:59.120 --> 03:01:07.040]  you know i breathe the king james 1611 bible daily but um i think aboriginal american indian
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:11.920]  people hold a key uh even our ancestors we all come from a tribe you know the 12 tribes of israel
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:16.400]  all come from a clan but uh in our you know gna pass like i've talked to you before about
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:21.920]  awakening our dna and how there's memories inside of our you know our dna code and stuff and well
[03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:28.000]  that's right and and expanding on that people act like it's only africans or native americans that
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:32.560]  used to run around with feathers in their heads and beating on drums everybody's just two steps
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:37.360]  out of the jungle or two steps out of the hills we're all primitives and that's our culture and we
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:42.880]  need to people act like europeans landed in spaceships or something i mean it's just not the case
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:49.840]  we're all savages at heart which is a good thing right and added to that i mean we can all have
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:54.880]  a relationship with our creator we don't you know god doesn't necessarily live in any church or any
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:58.960]  building you know or creating his image that's right these churches want to make you go through
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:05.360]  their priesthoods first try to find god and then they obscure god and it's sickening thank you for
[03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:09.920]  the call you can always tell a discernment though who's real and who isn't mark and origan you're on
[03:02:09.920 --> 03:02:17.440]  the air good day to you alex alex i called last week basically about what i call my template for
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:24.800]  a solution i'd like to break it down just a little more today the um declaration of independence
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:31.600]  actually uh instructs us and authorizes us to throw off the tyrannical federal government
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:37.520]  even a state government if it does not abide by the constitution of the united states when swat
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:42.800]  teams raid houses now federally they will put it in the file and call for more jail time if you
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:47.600]  have a declaration of independence the founding document is seen as a criminal terrorist manifesto
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:54.800]  absolutely now alex my idea is simply this and it's based on the fact that we have uh
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:03:00.000]  seven percent approximate approval rating of the u.s. house of representative depending on the
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:05.600]  polls seven to ten yeah have about the same for the senate i would imagine and this is all around
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:10.720]  the fact that they've abrogated the constitution of the united states they've gone against it
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:14.880]  they've done just the opposite of what their sworn oath is to be and that's to uphold and
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:21.280]  protect and defend the constitution now this is the highest reason that we could have for
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:27.600]  actually recalling all of these members of the washington dc power base and the congress and
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:33.040]  the senate as well as it would apply to state legislatures and senate because there's been a
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:39.120]  lot of unconstitutional action there also now to put this into concrete terms alex i would
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:44.240]  recommend that we have days of seminar where such great broadcasters and there are a good
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:49.040]  number of them as yourself who for years have been exposing this evil that we have here in our
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:56.240]  government as well as to have recall petitions handed out at these gatherings open air all
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:01.680]  across the country out of doors gaining publicity sounds like a good idea i gotta jump real quick
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:10.640]  steven in florida go ahead yeah hey alex hey uh i forwarded an email to you from this group called
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:16.320]  freepress.com and so i hope you look at that in our census show okay we only have about 45
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:22.880]  seconds go ahead it was basically a great victory with what the fcc passed last week and i told them
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:31.360]  my response i said go to your site but i want to say this the time for the uh quite pandering and
[03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:37.200]  you know passive response on the part of christians what's going on is way past if you read
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:43.600]  patrick henry's speech that was the catalyst to get our founding fathers into the revolutionary war
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:47.920]  because he said it's time for war the time for negotiation is over with and i'm so
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:52.800]  tired of the uh response by christians well i agree we should at least up the rhetoric
[03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:57.680]  in the info war and get really aggressive or it's going to come to total takeover we're gonna have to
[03:04:57.680 --> 03:05:08.640]  fight
