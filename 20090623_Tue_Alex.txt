[09:38.000 --> 09:44.000]  ban any guns they want the president or his designants can just ban any guns

[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  to cover this coming up in T minus 50 minutes with Bob Chapman
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  Bankster holiday planned for September key story fired out last night by
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  Curt Nemo at info wars dot com we hope everybody sees this because this is
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  coming from good sources now I want to be clear before the media in September
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  comes back and misrepresents what Bob Chapman saying but Harry Schultz is
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  saying of the international investment financial economic geopolitical
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  newsletter named newsletter of the year by Peter Brimelow the market watch
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  2005 2008 Ron Paul says it's one of his favorite places for analysis the issue
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  is he's saying this as well we're getting him on tomorrow and Bob's talk to
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  his contacts and this is definitely an order that went out so just because they
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  put their safety off and put the financial gun to our head doesn't mean
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  they're going to pull the trigger we're just saying that good sources confirm
[11:57.000 --> 12:07.000]  this is being planned Paul and Bob Chapman's influential international
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  forecaster is reporting on the possibility of a so-called bank holiday
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  planned for late August early September according to Chapman's source
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.000]  analysis around the world are selling dollars in stockpiling money from
[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  respected countries where they operate from respective countries where they
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  operate some US embassies worldwide are being advised to purchase massive
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  amounts of local currencies writes Harry Schultz enough to last them a year
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  Schultz publishes in the Harry Schultz letter international investment
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  economic and geopolitical newsletter named as newsletter of the year by Peter
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  Brimelow of market watch 2005 2008 Schultz believes the global elite are in
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  the process of engineering an FDR style bank holiday of undetermined length in
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  order to sort out the bank mess that means panic everybody right during
[13:05.000 --> 13:14.000]  September October to pass the quote federal reserve reorganization
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  so that's perfect timing and of course I'm elaborating on this I'm going to
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  get back to the article that is perfect timing because remember they
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  engineered the crisis in October last year nine months ago eight months ago
[13:27.000 --> 13:34.000]  and said give us unlimited financial control and power give us total
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  anonymity secrecy no audits no agency can investigate us nobody can look
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  it's unlimited trillions we wanted to take a hundred trillion of taxpayer
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  money we could then be putting each American in a million and a half
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  dollars of debt they've already got it up to a hundred grand the last eight
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  months why not you know not counting the other hundred grand you already owed
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  in taxes just on the debt that's on top of what you pay yearly just an
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  interest of the bankers that were giving the money to the bankers and then we
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  pay interest to them for giving it to them I mean that's a good deal if you
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.000]  can get it huh and so they said do what we say or there'll be a massive
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  depression and they stopped the bailout of the stock market the plunge
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  protection team the president's working group on markets they stopped dumping
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  money in that week they're always propping it up always insider trading
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  for themselves it's a casino they've got red they use your money to go gamble
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  in a red casino they can't lose they run it and they go gamble in it with your
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  money then there's all the smucks and suckers that go in and play game you
[14:41.000 --> 14:51.000]  know playing that casino with the sharks what what idiots anyways the issue
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  here it's just the exact same profile this makes perfect sense and it's
[14:58.000 --> 15:05.000]  confirmed by people that don't play games and don't put out this info now
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  this could be embassy people feeding them bad info but this is coming from
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  embassies and I got a few contacts as well we got our feelers out the
[15:14.000 --> 15:25.000]  trouble confirmed this our antennae antennae are up and so this follows
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  the perfect pattern of how they'll get a bunch of hysteria going shut down
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  some banks grab a bunch of other banks and insurance companies that are
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  healthy but use regular regulators to do it and then they come out and say we've
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  got to have unlimited power over the economy as this new bill says we've
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  got to be able to seize any business any corporation or the economy is going to
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  die we're going to have a depression and they'll get a thousand to one phone
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  calls in congress against it the polls will say ninety eight ninety nine
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  percent against it just like it was in the last one but congress will say we
[16:01.000 --> 16:09.000]  got to do this or the economy is going to die and then the public will become
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  outraged and the congress will say okay we'll do what you want and then
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  they'll turn the economy off and say the bank runs were caused by people that
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  don't want a federal reserve dictatorship and then the media will say oh now
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  the public's for which they won't be but they'll say now the public doesn't
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  like it but there they realize it's got to happen and now the federal reserve
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  owns and rules America and they're going to have to take some public lands and
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  roads and infrastructure and give it to the investors but don't worry if you
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  just follow orders they'll fix the economy they'll get you working again and
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  then another six months you're down the road it'll be you all work for the
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  federal government now but through private corporations under federal control
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  and you've got to have this ID card in proper order and we need to be able to
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  have a job and we need the illegal aliens to help get America going they're
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  all legalized and anybody criticizing the market is going to be arrested
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  they're already talking about that because anybody criticizing the
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  federal reserve you're the ones that caused this if you would have just done
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.000]  everything they said that they wouldn't have had to become dictators okay and
[17:10.000 --> 17:18.000]  North com wouldn't have to be on the streets all right okay and all the
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  yuppies will chatter and get their newspapers out when they're at the bar
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  and talk and agree with the experts on TV and they'll all line up and do what
[17:27.000 --> 17:43.000]  they're told and that's how the raping that's how that's how it is to be a
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  nation of crack horror drug addict brain damaged prostitutes that's basically
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  what we are we're just a totally drugged out cigarette burns all over us
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  mindlessly gibbering watching saturday morning cartoons laying in a flea bag
[17:59.000 --> 18:05.000]  hotel with stains all over the carpet and just the lowest of the low johns
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.000]  of the world lined up for five dollars to have their way with us we're just
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  covered with slime we just watch the TV gibbering and drooling we don't have
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  any front teeth and the federal reserve just comes in with a night stick if we
[18:19.000 --> 18:27.000]  ever argue and just beats us in the head that's who we are that really is who we
[18:27.000 --> 18:35.000]  are we're a drugged out prostitute who weighs about 90 pounds with cigarette
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  burns all over with her with clumps of hair falling out a crack or right on

[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  mainline say it's really at 20 plus percent every week we have different
[25:34.000 --> 25:40.000]  ones on same thing over 20% not 10% like the media saying and it's going to be
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  25% by the end of the year and 30% in the middle of next year 30% 24% is
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.000]  depression era okay and people were self-sufficient during the Great
[25:54.000 --> 26:03.000]  Depression 90% of the country was rural and the vast majority of them were
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.000]  self-sufficient you still had some of the people that were rural or townies
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  they lived in a little town and weren't completely self-sufficient but their
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  neighbors were their cousins were so you had probably 75 80% of people that
[26:17.000 --> 26:24.000]  were self-sufficient 90% living in the country now it's 89% live in the
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  city it was 92 but there's been kind of a flight to the country the media
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  always implies that's racist I know I know a lot of blacks and Mexicans
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  and Asians moving to the country they don't like the crime the pollution
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  country living is great wanted to have the song of green acres is the place
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  for me farm 11 is the life for me in fact hey let's go out with that
[26:51.000 --> 26:58.000]  pull up green acres theme song for me man wish I could move to New Zealand or
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  Australia but they fell to tyranny before we did there's nowhere to run can't go
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  to Costa Rica I got a lady works for me after college with the Costa Rica she
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  says now it's crime-ridden everybody gets broken into people are now being
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  robbed at gunpoint it's like worse than New York City now in many areas of
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  Costa Rica it's collapsing everything's collapsing and they're going to say hey
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  you know what you just let the federal reserve run everything you let the
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  federal reserve take over the entire society you let the federal reserve run
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  your life you let the fed grab all the water supplies and claim jurisdiction
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  over any property that has one drop of water on it including rainwater
[27:44.000 --> 27:52.000]  aquifers or wells and will turn the money supply back on and why should they
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  we never rebel we never stand up they're just going to that after that six months
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  a year later have a new solution to the deeper crisis they've made so that's why
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  when I read that Bob Chapman Harry Schultz and many others have got very
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  good contacts and been proven right about and ninety five percent of the time
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  just like me we're not nobody's perfect except the good Lord they are
[28:16.000 --> 28:24.000]  considering doing this I saw this last night made some calls to folks I know
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  that have worked for the State Department and they're making calls to confirm
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  this if I just thought of another person to confirm this they'll get Wayne Madsen's
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  number call him right now and ask him if he can call some embassies and see if
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  this is true I mean I mean I know it's I know two different embassies told these
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  guys this but I want more confirmation because see if it's disinfo being leaked
[28:45.000 --> 28:51.000]  by the government which is very rare and it gets into why would they put out
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  disinfo bank rounds why would they put that out they don't want people to know
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  they're getting ready for that if they are and then it doesn't follow the logic
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  but it could be disinfo the you know some other reason for that and that's a
[29:02.000 --> 29:09.000]  long extrapolation I'm not going to get into here plus with one of these sources
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  this is somebody they say they trust and gotten good info from in the past but
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  that's still on a hundred percent but if we can confirm there's some other people
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  I just thought of Madsen he's got a bunch of State Department contacts I just sent
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  two reporters there to get some breaking news from him behind the scenes in DC
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  alright so we're gonna be watching that I got a bunch of other news coming up

[36:32.000 --> 36:38.000]  muzzled he keeps barking at night he's the one killing the hands it's the
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.000]  guard dog not us in fact we suggest that the dog be euthanized or at least
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  given away he's causing of course it's the guard dog trying to stop the
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  weasels trying to stop the foxes it doesn't matter they're saying those
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  conservative gun owners those veterans those people that criticize the fed the
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.000]  armies watching them you know that's public and good because they're dangerous

[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  so let me read this again on march 5th 1933 in the depths of the banker
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  engineer great depression newly elected franklin delin Roosevelt declared a bank
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  holiday the war powers act that forced banks closed for four days Roosevelt
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  then ran through the emergency bank act to the legislature passed by
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  congress on march night the act granted fdr near dictatorial control didn't
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  leave obviously not he was a dictator over the dealings of the banks it also
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  allowed the secretary of the treasury the power to compel every person in
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  business in the country to relinquish their gold and accept paper currency and
[38:23.000 --> 38:36.000]  exchange and what does the new bank act say gold textile mills 7-elevens gas
[38:36.000 --> 38:46.000]  stations computer stores credit unions marinas golf courses chocolate factories
[38:46.000 --> 39:00.000]  it doesn't matter auto body shops factories fabs everything docks roads
[39:00.000 --> 39:10.000]  dams reservoirs everything total financial dictatorship they're doing it again
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  and posing as our saviors while they do it
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  oh no the powerful offshore banks that already control the planet's financial
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  system they don't want military and physical control banks would never
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  bankrupt the economy to repossess land though it's in all their handbooks and
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  they would certainly never do it for absolute financial global dictatorship
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  even though they're in time magazine newsweek financial times of London and
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  hundreds of other publications saying they need a world financial dictatorship
[39:39.000 --> 39:49.000]  for your own good of course of course and they're going to make it all better
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  because they want you to have a happy life and they want you to have lots of
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  children and live in a nice house and have lots of vacation time all their
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  official Pentagon documents say they want to break the family up and
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  euthanize you and sterilize people and they're caught in the media again doing
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  it today and on and guardian but let's just trust these people they only funded
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.000]  Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Pol Pot and everybody else they're only ruthless
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  and see us as animals and have not just no compulsion against killing us it's
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  their religion they enjoy it let's just trust them it's good to have cameras in
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  the school bathrooms and on the street corners and have the police wearing
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  black masks that's that's good it's good to be thumbprinting at libraries and
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  businesses and grocery stores and to get and and a clock in at work and at
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  tanning salons and everywhere else it's normal it's good to have face scanning
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  cameras going up everywhere it's good to be tracked with license plate reading
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  software it's good that for 36 years at birth they took your blood secretly and
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  put it in a DNA eugenics database for bio weapon development race specific now

[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  like a lovingly grandfather that's what Bernanke is in Greenspan it's normal to
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  have them on TV shing their private bank above the law and no one can touch them
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  or investigate them that's completely normal it's completely normal to have
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  police all over the country now just robbing people on the side of the road
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  grabbing their cash out of their wallets like Mexico or North Korea
[41:36.000 --> 41:46.000]  help us help us God here we are now inside the final phases of the new
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  order takeover all the all the preparations all the setting of the

[42:51.000 --> 42:58.000]  destruction of the Bellarites and Constitution and they bake the bread
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  and they seared the steak and put a scald on it delicious flavor and now
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.000]  they're sitting down and they're starting to bite into that bread and
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  they're starting to slice into that steak they're just getting started on a
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  long seven course meal but they want to eat it while it's hot they're not
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  going to take their time anymore they took their time making the meal they
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.000]  took their time making the dinner and they got big goblets of red wine the
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  blood of the innocence that's their favorite part along with the steak is
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  the blood of the innocence all those abortions 50 million of them and it's
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  going to grow it's going to be even better so they're just now guzzling big

[44:11.000 --> 44:17.000]  dreams taking people's hopes they love the poverty they love the lack of hope
[44:17.000 --> 44:26.000]  the lack of and over it all the table itself is the television set the
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  plates and the utensils it's the device of mind control the device of
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  programming the device that brought this country to its knees so it can be
[44:36.000 --> 44:43.000]  feasted upon by the parasites of hell
[44:43.000 --> 44:50.000]  Benster holiday planned for September coming up 15 minutes with Bob Chapman
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.000]  and I said I get to this last week and I didn't and I can't find the article
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  Paul Watson was a Steve Watson wrote about it about the Wall Street Journal
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  I like the background he gives it's called it's time to cool the planet
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  cutting greenhouse gases no longer enough deal with global warming says top
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  scientists he argues that we also had to do something more direct Kim trailing
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  and then discovery channels got pieces where they need to build dome cities or
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.000]  the global warming is gonna kill us just total panicking lying to drive us into
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.000]  their arms so their neo feudal government agencies and Greencore
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  brigades of felons New York Times last week they're hiring felons in mass New
[45:33.000 --> 45:41.000]  York Times this is really happening their brainwashing your kids and turning
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  them against you New York Times also reported on that how how the seven
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  year old boss's mommy around she says I love my daughter boss me around she
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  she brings you know and and she she writes me tickets was actually about
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  they mentioned another mother in the article I'm combining to that was in
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  the one in Guardian article about in England the kids write their parents
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  tickets by the time they're 11 or 12 and then write dossiers on the mama takes
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  a hot bath bad carbon footprint the teachers are now drilling them on
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  turning mommy and daddy in and how their heroes I can't even take it anymore
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  it's just too incredible it's too over the top I mean just hardcore raging
[46:17.000 --> 46:24.000]  classical corruption science fiction nightmare that's how Dr. Paul Craig
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  Roberts I've been describing like that for over a decade that's how he describes
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  it now is it's like a science fiction dystopia that if you wrote a book this
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  insane this crazy this wild 20 years ago people would throw it down saying this
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  is too far fetched you know what's interesting about it they're over
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  killing the grid building the massive military grid the control grid the
[46:46.000 --> 46:52.000]  dehumanization grid the brainwashing grid around us over killing but not
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  moving overtly massively in a physical fashion against everybody they're
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  doing it an asymmetrical low intensity way with excuses they know they
[47:02.000 --> 47:05.000]  approach you and say oh I'm taking your kid because the neighbor said they saw
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  I'm playing the backyard alone you'll kind of still feel like it's the
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  authorities and let your kid disappear into their clutches or if your kid's
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  been late to class you know they they put your kid on probation no judge no
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  jury they just call you in and say sign this or I'm gonna take your kid and
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  the person waves their rights and signs that it's all contract fraud now your
[47:23.000 --> 47:30.000]  kid's in the system and so now they can white love inspect them and take
[47:30.000 --> 47:37.000]  their rights forever it's it's a seduction it's a induction it's a
[47:37.000 --> 47:47.000]  schmoozing into the tyranny it's an easing in it's like breaking a horse
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.000]  first you get it dependent one way to break a horse wild horse you got a pin
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.000]  it's got grain in it every day first the younger stupider horses the less
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  experienced they're not even stupid they're ignorant they go in they start
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  eating the grain finally the older ones start going in the Mustang start
[48:06.000 --> 48:15.000]  eating the grain and the water then you close the gate while they're in there
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  then you get them used to you walking around them for a few days feeding them
[48:19.000 --> 48:27.000]  and then you find those that are less skittish and scared and you learn to put
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  a bridle on them and then they're used to the bridle for a few days and being
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  fed after you put the bridle on them you put it try to put a saddle on them and
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.000]  then you get on them and they try to throw you off but then they learn that
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  they don't get hurt when you do it and then they get fed afterwards and that's
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  how they got shown welfare that's how they got us all dependent that's how
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  they got us used to taking orders and filling out the forms they give us
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  and waving our rights to the Fourth Amendment and doing what we're told
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  and now you'll answer the census and tell us how many guns you got and how
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  much money you make well now let us in your house
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  oh you'll let us ask your kids about what's in your medicine cabinet we'll
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  just have the kids fill out weekly reports on everything you're doing
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  oh you'll put up with that hell we'll tell the kids to bring cameras home and
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  spy on you notice how all the toys they push on kids are how to be a spy
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.000]  and how to spy on your parents and the TV ads it's all so much fun this is
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  really sick they're they're using your children's hunting instincts and
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  misappropriating them misdirecting them into spying on you a predatory
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  activity against you you look at the sociology the anthropology the
[49:33.000 --> 49:41.000]  psychology so they're easing you into this kill grid

[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  the lies anymore just everything Obama says is a liar distortion I walk out
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  during the break they got him on TV he gives like five press conferences a day
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  because they're ending America right now he's got to use his power before it
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  dissipates they cold-blooded leave admitted they know he's going to be
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  unpopular Joe Biden said that his approval ratings already dropped really 30
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  points was it 80 something now it's at 50 something they're probably going to
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  stage terror attacks to get that number back up so he can pose and say look I'm
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  going to take good care of you al-qaeda hit you and hit you hard I got to take
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  your rights though and I got to let the bankers run your life but I love you I'm
[54:52.000 --> 54:57.000]  Barack Obama you can really trust me but that's the point he's lied about
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  everything you ever said he do and everything that comes out of his mouth
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.000]  is a lie the CIA in the White House under Bush and under Obama are on record
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  that they're trying to overthrow Ahmed Denizide in the mood list that they're
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  trying to cause a color revolution there and that they've been funding the
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  student groups to riot and we posted mainstream White House press releases
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  admitting this I walk out during the break and there is Obama out of his mouth
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  saying there's a lot of people saying that the CIA is doing this and that we're
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  involved that's ridiculous I mean who would come up with something like that
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  that's a conspiracy theory and a complete lie we're not involved in Iran in any
[55:33.000 --> 55:42.000]  way I mean this is the most insane level of bull and the Shaw son that was part
[55:42.000 --> 55:48.000]  of the 53 coup he's now out running around crying on TV fake crying like
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  Glenn Beck does I got video that coming up later him having stuff put in his eyes
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  to fake cry on TV and there's no end to this fakeness it's just unbelievable
[55:57.000 --> 56:03.000]  ladies and gentlemen whether you're for attack on Iran or not just be honest the
[56:03.000 --> 56:12.000]  CIA and MI6 are on record they're there funding this whole thing
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.000]  by the way this was Sally character he is admitted one of the most vicious people
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  ever in the regime he was foreign minister on record he worked with the CIA
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  he was involved in Iran Contra and then he was in Beirut bombing the barracks
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.000]  it's on record he's the guy that all that so of course the CIA loves him you see
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  clearly that regime had some CIA connections when they first had the coup
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  over the Shaw it appears it was an attempt to destabilize the Shaw and then beat
[56:43.000 --> 56:50.000]  down the Islamic Revolution and the Islamos then betrayed the globalist in
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  their deal because that's what this is all about the Iranians the persons
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  invented chess and that's a historical record that went on and so they have been
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  so angry at this group ever since that is really legitimately against the New
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  World Order the evidence shows that and they want this guy out of there and I
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  mean to have Israel on TV mention Benjamin Netanyahu saying he's not involved
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  the massage chief has gone so far to say they want Ahmed energy to stay in power
[57:15.000 --> 57:23.000]  ladies and gentlemen that is absolute complete bull okay I'm gonna talk more
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  about what Bob Chapman coming up the bank holiday but this is really getting

[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  June 23rd 2009 Tuesday edition
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  we now have three hours spanning out before us simulcasting
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  with syndicated radio show at prisonplanet.tv
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  thank you all for tuning in today think if you're supporting prisonplanet.tv members
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  let me tell you about who's coming up in 30 minutes Dr. Ignatius Piazza
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  talking about all the anti-second
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  amendment bills introduced that are the greatest draconian victim
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  has ever seen Mark Fauber joining us top
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  market analysts saying we're going into hyperinflation joining us from
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Thailand coming up in one hour and then I'm going to get Wayne Madsen to pop in
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  to get his take because he's got a lot of State Department contacts and we've got him calling
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  him not that I don't believe Bob Chapman and Harry Schultz who are
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  both been proven to have really good contacts and
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  need to be listened to I'm just getting further vetting on this because this is a big
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  story as Bob is out there ferreting out more as well
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  of course Bob worked in the Foreign Service and in intelligence against the Russians
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  and worked all over the world South Africa, Germany
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  so he could speak to this I have contacts outside Madsen and others
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  ferreting out if this is happening at their embassies it's confirmed this is going on
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  some embassies are saying get ready for bank shutdowns, bank holiday
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  they've got that dollars may not be taken globally or maybe devalued
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  but they've got a hoard other
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  currencies we already see other countries moving away from the dollar very quickly
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  now this is coming up perfect timing to pass the banker takeover bill
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  which gives the Federal Reserve dictatorial powers just like the March
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  5, 1933 banker engineered
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  bank holiday emergency banking act which gave them dictatorial powers
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  and so they've announced that if I get
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Judge Napolitano video ready because people won't believe me when I say it we broke it we told
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  people over a week ago Ron Paul Bob Chapman ferreting it out
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  looked at the bill said yes this is a banking dictatorship
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  and now they're going yes we'll be your
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  leaders no judge no jury no bill of rights only the bankers
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  so I wanted to go over their national forecaster breaking this down
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  which Ron Paul calls one of the best researched trends
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  and investment letters out there also is saying
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  what Bob Chapman saying that embassy connections
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  around the world are saying they're getting ready for a bank run in September now that doesn't mean
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  this is going to happen it means they are preparing to do it
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Bob Chapman thanks for joining us
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  thank you very much and yes they are in preparation
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  but they may not do it but this is good intelligence
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  we've talked to people who are in a position to know
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  that these amounts of money are being received
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  by embassies and some of the embassies are receiving it
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  dollars to trade
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  for local currencies and they obviously
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  expect some problems and in the State Department
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  they are quite concerned but they don't know
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  really exactly what's going on which is interesting
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  compartmentalization if you may and
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  it could happen in five months from now
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  it could not happen at all or it might take
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  three or four months but there's something and you know
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  we get these reports about
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  the federalization of the police
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  forces and my last issue I had a letter from
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  a subscriber who said a friend of his was applying
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  for a job as a policeman and was sitting in an
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  office and then the office next door were a couple of people from FEMA
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  and the police chief and they were discussing federalization
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  well I mean Bob stay there
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  it's on record that the Arizona State Police are merging with the feds
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  I mean they're just publicly totally criminal
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  I also want to talk to you about the bill that's passed the senate committee
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  where the feds will have jurisdiction now over all the states
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  with the water and all surrounding lands I mean it's just it's all happening
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  right now history is happening right now

[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  how much will you need we don't know how much do you want all you can get
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  I'm Alex Jones I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  call 1-800-409-5633
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  again that number 1-800-409-5633
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  and the GCN radio network
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  by the way an official FEMA videographer
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  who saw the towers 1 and 2 and 7
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  the rubble how it had been destroyed with cutting charges
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  he is in exile in Argentina
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  and he's about to release that footage that video that they're
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  hounding him for also it's now come out that all
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  four of the flights two separate airlines for months
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  starting at the same date and that's coming up later they'd all been in mothballs
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  and they all launched that day specially
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  during of course the drills with the CIA practicing flying hijacked jets
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  into the World Trade Center in Pentagon at the exact same time as the rail attacks
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  so Norab would stand down thinking it was part of a drill
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  what bold boldness out of these people and so it's clear I want to ask Bob Chapman
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  about this they're on record wanting the new banking dictatorship
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  I want to play a two minute clip in Napolitano I played part of the shesh I want to play it all now
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  because it's not just Alex Jones it's Judge Napolitano on his Internet Fox show
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  they won't let him talk about this on Fox News at least I've never seen him do it
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  I think Napolitano is a good guy those people that know him behind the scenes
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  I've talked to him a bit behind the scenes and I think he's a good guy
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  people like Beck on the other hand who he lets him fill in for is an actor
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  and gets off on you know fake crying and manipulating people
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  and stuff like that coming up but going back to Bob Chapman
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Bob for those that just joined us some stations just joined us break down the international forecaster
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  we have it in our story at info wars dot com
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Bankster holiday plan for September what this means
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  why the embassies are being told to dump their dollars
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  buy a bunch of other currencies what the sources that you've got are saying
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  and what the sources that Harry Schultz with his renowned newsletter
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  MSNBC has given the award of a newsletter of the year
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  so I mean this is coming out for some pretty credible sources
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  well very simply my sources are
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  people who are working in embassies and so
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  I'm getting my in first hand and
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  and I do know some people in the State Department
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  they're almost as old as I am and
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  I haven't been able to contact them on this issue but what I do know
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  is that they when I last talked to them didn't know
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  any more about this than I did nor actually had they heard of it
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  and but anyway Harry Schultz
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  picked it up and what he did in putting
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  a piece in his letter which I reprinted in
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Mayan this past issue was reiterate some of the
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  things that I had said and he said it was his suspicion
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  that the elite plan was for another FDR type bank
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  holiday of indefinite length and perhaps
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  very soon and why would they do that well it's
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  interesting that today's Tuesday
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  early Monday the IMF said
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  that if the United States does not increase its exports
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  then a dollar devaluation has to be looked at
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  if you noticed yesterday
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  the World Bank said that they saw a
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  minus 2.9% GDP
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  for the year worldwide
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  and that was quite a bit away from the plus that they had
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  projected earlier the IMF
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  was talking about frugality
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  and people pulling their horns in so to speak
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  and getting their economies back into shape again
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  and of course the U.S. Federal Reserve
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  and the Treasury have all the other countries
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  going in the opposite direction they have zero interest rates are close to it
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  which was dictated by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  and at least the top 20 in many other countries have followed
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  and they have also increased money and credit
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  it varies widely Britain money
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  and credit increased this last month for 17.4%
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  in the European
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  Central Bank which is the Eurozone they increased
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  theirs by only 6.8%
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  not over 12% previously what they were doing was holding
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  interest rates high and forcing money into the system
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  along with credit and the U.S. told them to lower the
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  interest rates it was more important and so that's what they did
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  and now they've cut back on their issuance of money and credit they really don't want to go along
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  with this program and I can't help but think
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  that 60% of the
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  privatized toxic waste those bonds
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  with mortgages in them was sold in Europe and to this day
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  there has never been a legal action or a criminal action
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  against the banks and the reading services who did this
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  and so that tells me they had to have been in on it
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  and I think they're kind of getting cold feet right now
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  and so that's why they've got to go ahead and get total dictatorial powers
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  for us and say that if you investigate the Fed or criticize the Fed
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  you're a terrorist because they are the terrorists they are the financial
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  terrorists they are the criminals and they've got to go for broke here Bob
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  that's why I spent the last three months on Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  and I'm amazed they allowed me to
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  they did say one thing about me not talking about the Fed and I kept on talking about it
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  and they didn't say anything anymore well let me tell you what's happening Bob and I'm sure this has happened to you behind the scenes
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  I go on a lot of local Fox and some of the local CNNs around the country
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  like News 8 here in Austin and I've even talked to some of the producers at National CNN
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  they go no we know this stuff's real and my guys were at the National Press Club
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  for four or five hours with Wayne Madsen
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  and they said all the old reporters famous reporters were going
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  yeah Alex Jones is right it's a new world order takeover the banks are bankrupting us by design
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  but shh you know they got spies in here don't talk about it and so
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  I mean it's just everybody knows who's got half a brain Bob
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  yeah well when I go on to these different programs with these commentators
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  in Chicago and New Orleans and so on and so forth
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  these are very large reaching stations
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  and you know before I go on the air they giggle and say
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  well I'm glad you're here to do this because we don't dare
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  because they'll fire them
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  as an abutment just like you are
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  we're surrogates for them
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  they bring us on so they can slip it out and even kind of laugh at us but then behind the scenes they go
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  no no thanks for your courage Bob I want to get into some other areas here
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  of course I know you've been reporting on the water bill
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  but here I have the actual Senate breakdown
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  this is from the US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  background information on S787
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Fine Gold Clean Water Restoration Act now this is what the Senate says
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  because I keep reporting this for the last couple weeks people don't believe me
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  this is their boil down of the bill
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  okay in fact we've got the new document camera above me zoom in on this and I'm going to read this to folks
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  okay they're amending the Clean Water Act to strike the term
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  navigable waters whatever it appears replacing it instead with waters of the United States
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  which describes it as water puddles, wells,
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  aquifers and saying that they control the land that any water is on
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  so total federalization not just for the water
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  erase the distinction between federal and state jurisdiction over waters
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  I mean this is total federal government takeover
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  impose federal regulation over anything that impounds water including private lakes, ditches
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  and dry stream beds that occasionally get wet and they're now saying they're going to ban ranching
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  the Texas Cattleman's Association's on record they already tried this with the wetlands saying
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  run off from cattle from them making you know ruts in the ground
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  that's going to be illegal and they're going to come fine and fee you without warrants come on your property
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  impose federal regulation over anything that impounds water
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  including private lakes, ditches and dry stream beds and occasionally get wet
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  expand regulation from the current focus on discharges to the border activities
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  affecting waters including the possible regulation of air pollutants
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  allow federal controls on limits of the legislative power of Congress
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  under the Constitution so this is Congress voting to give its authority away to private bureaucrats
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  and it goes on this is
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  bigger than Lincoln's power grab this is bigger
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  this is so we got this with the banker
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  reform bill that makes them over I mean this is a total takeover
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  Bob it certainly is and you know
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  one of the things you just slightly referred to
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  in that is the CO2
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  that's given off by the human waste excuse me animal waste
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  no that's what they want to tax human you're right go ahead
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  yeah that's how I cap and trade and so
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  that's part of that you know they've been trying to do that for about
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  50 years that I can remember yeah they tried the wetlands act harassing everybody
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  that got overturned in court so yeah now they're just saying the attorney general
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  can ban all guns at once if he wants to bill introduced racing through the house
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  the feds control all water and all property it's on Congress has no authority
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  the Federal Reserve rules everything anything associated with money
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  or the economy from hot dog stands to movie chains we rule
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  I mean this is it Bob is it not it certainly is and
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  the one cake in their armor here is what they said
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  three weeks ago this economic situation is gotten out
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  of control we have to bring it to a halt and I
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  don't think they're capable of doing it and that means
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  more unemployment and never mind all of their
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  stimulus program or even the next stimulus program
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  to come unemployment is still going to grow people are going to lose homes
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  you know three million people have already lost their homes and
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  we're going to be looking over the next three years at unemployment
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  somewhere in the vicinity of 35 or plus percent maybe as
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  much as 50 and they're not going to be able to control it
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  and that's why I was speaking earlier about homeland security
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  the federalization of the police troops showing up
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  in places in remote Montana where they've
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  never seen troops before and on and on
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  they're they're practicing they're getting ready and of course info wars had a piece
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  on July 27th through 31st I think it is
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  when they're going to have these joint maneuvers
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  they admit with foreign countries to quote suppress the
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  American people I mean this is not even hidden anymore and as you said
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  they're openly federalizing all the police Army Times says the Army's now
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  going to wage war on the American people Bob stay there I want to get your take on Iran
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  when we get back stay with us
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  on the average Americans work
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  out their golden years unfortunately with taxation the rising cost
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  of food energy housing and medical many retirees are forced to live
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  below the poverty line is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be answered by reading

[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  alright bob you're back with us friday in the second hour for full hour in just a couple days
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  and i've been throwing in all my points here bottom line
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  there's no doubt this is one of those things that happens every 60, 70, 80 years
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  in society how they decided to go ahead and start
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  commandeering the iranian ships iranians are going to fire nukes in response
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  as big or bigger than the cuban missile crisis nobody's even talking about it
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  clearly the CIA admits they're staging the iran problems
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  and then obama's on tv lying saying we're not involved in iran that's crazy
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  when it's officially admitted i mean this is incredible where do you see that going
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  water takeovers total federalization total banking takeovers of all
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  money industry i mean do you agree
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  this is the jump point everything we've seen up to here was just a build up
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  this is now the final conflagration i think you're
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  right they're pulling it all together and the
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  we've talked about all these points with the exception of iran and i was
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  asked to do some programs in regard to
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  iran and the people who were opposed to
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  what supposedly was a rigged
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  election and i said no and they said why
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  and i said because the united states government has a long history
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  although with her own government the government's in twice in that country for that matter
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  and if i had to guess i would say at this point
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  and this is before this all got into riots etc
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  i would guess that the united states government was behind the whole thing
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  because it's a matter of fact that they had been in there along with
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  them aside with lots of money stoking these people
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  are getting on record trying to do this exact thing saying on the news
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  we're trying to stroke a revolution
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  go ahead by exactly and that's why i passed
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  on it and i said no i think it's the opposite i think the u.s. government is behind
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  this and of course when you have the president come out and say well these people are saying that we're behind this
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  or not of course they are otherwise they wouldn't have said anything
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  well the last white house in this white house
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  obama increased bush's covert ops for revolution
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  blowing up mosque bombing buildings they admit they do it
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  i mean this and iran has been taking it taking it taking it taking it
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  taking military attacks launched by the west in there on
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  record mean we post all the mainstream news and then it comes out bbc's
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  faking photos that are really people for akhmet denigide
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  not for the other guy faking they probably shot that woman themselves
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  but i mean i believe they really killed her it's real video but that's probably staged
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  the way it's shot they just walked up shot her out in the stomach and filmed it
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  i mean just absolutely amazing that that's going on
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  and again i'm not getting on either side here this is clearly staged
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  and then then it comes out that that that this individual
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  who's claiming he won announced it hours before the polls
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  lost saying it had been stolen when the evidence was it
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  wasn't stolen and then it turns out he was the cia liaison
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  as the foreign minister of iran with iran contra i mean
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  this guy's a deep cover operative all the evidence shows that bob
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  that's right and so it is an american operation
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  and they're trying to over throw the government iran and they're not going to
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  get away with it
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  i mean you know they just not going to and uh...
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  uh... i i watched a tape on uh... uh... subpoena brzezinski
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  earlier today and uh... he said that
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  did you see that one no no i i i'm sorry bob ramps i was just
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  saying that's right i've i've got the clip we're just
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  he says he says we need to intelligently manipulate and keep manipulating
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  because he admits they're doing it go ahead sorry
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  well not only that he says uh... that
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  we gotta do this very quickly because uh...
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  uh... you know what time of the essence
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  and it's just one of these other another one of these color revolutions as they
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  call them where they go in and overthrow governments and this is the latest
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  and i think they might have bitten off a bit more than they can chew here
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  because uh... i think what's going to happen now
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  is that the people who they've paid to do the demonstrations
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  they've been told if you keep on doing that and creating violence
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  uh... you know we're going to have to retaliate and what the republican
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  guard is saying you keep it up you gotta end up getting shot
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  and uh... so i think this thing is going to simmer down
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  and the election has been certified and you know
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  the united states is the last country in the world to talk about rigged elections
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  and i don't want to go into detail but you know what's happened in our own country
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  and they're rigging elections all over the world
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  look what they just did in Mexico two years ago with the election of Calderon
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  the whole election was stolen and they do it everywhere
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  unbelievable bob Chapman great points and yes
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  here's the chief advisor on foreign policy to Obama saying

[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  front sight t-shirt and I was like hey I'm about to have them as a sponsor but the
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  reason I have him on today is not as a sponsor just as a guest
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  because he's trained thousands of police law enforcement he's trained
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  thousands of citizens and talking to police and others they say this is above law enforcement
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  training and so I was just honored when we got contacted
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  by Dr. Piazza Dr. Ignatius Piazza be a sponsor
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  on the show and I thought why not have him on as a guest to talk about
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  when he's talking to these police and people and citizens what are
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  what are they saying about bills let the attorney general ban entire classes of firearms
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  by imperial fiat when he wants to
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  bills to put a million plus they made it secret the last
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  six months so we don't know it was a million 100,000 then according to the LA Times
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  so it's probably a million and a half by now Americans
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  no judge no jury haven't been arrested they just put you on a terror list
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  they're saying if you have bad credit you'll be on the no fly list now and no buy no work list
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  I mean this is right on 1984 what they think about
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  all these other bills to go after black powder and gun importation
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  I mean it's really happening that's why people are out there
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  buying guns at record numbers they've been reading the bills and meanwhile the media says it's a
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  conspiracy theory there's no new bills and then right next to it the New York Times
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  going yes if you're on the terror list no guns
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  again but they won't say how you got on the list or wire on the list or how you get off the
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  list it's just the hallmark of tyranny and the website
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  is frontsite.com
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  there's a bunch of other ways you can check it out
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  you can also go to Ignatius-Piazza.com
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  we'll put links to that up on infowars.com
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  but again frontsiteoneword.com doc it's good to have you on with us today
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  well thank you very much Alex it's a pleasure to be here
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  I'm flattered that you happen to listen to the show sometime
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  I shouldn't be surprised if so many of my listeners over the years
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  have told me how great your training is and I'm not hyping this
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  the word on the street is you've got some of the best training
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  open to the public period and a lot of law enforcement reviews say
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  this is above law enforcement level training what does that mean
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  well basically if you went into a police academy and went through their program
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  when you got out at the end you're going to have
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  basic law enforcement skills or you can come to frontsite
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  for our four day defensive handgun course and at the end of that four days you will have better
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  skills than what you would have received if you got through the police academy
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  or basic training on the military and we even get people
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  that are SWAT team members that come out and take our classes
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  because in that four day period of time we can provide
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  them with a more intensive experience which brings their level
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  of skill up to a much higher level than what they would get
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  going to a police in service training where they go to the range for
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  two or three hours in between everything else they're doing so a person that's serious
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  about gaining a level of skill with a firearm whether it be
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  handgun, shotgun, rifle, submachine gun, selectfire, M16
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  whatever it might be if you want to get a level of training that exceeds what you're going to find
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  in the military and in law enforcement but get it
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  in a very, very user friendly, compassionate environment where nobody gets left behind
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  there's no drill instructor attitude there's not a bunch of macho baloney
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  going on you can just get down to the actual learning absolutely
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  you're not going to sit there and listen to war stories all day long or hear offensive
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  language or anything like that it's great for the entire family and that's
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  I think the reason why you're running into so many people we've been training folks out there
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  for 13 years but we started back in April of 1996
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  on some leased facilities in California with 10 students
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  in a two day defensive handgun course and the word of mouth
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  about the experience that they get with frontside has just caused us
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  to essentially double every year and we're now training
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  thousands of students every weekend in fact we just finished
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  well what is today Tuesday we just finished up a class that had
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  about 500 students in it this weekend taking
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  handgun courses our 30 state concealed weapon permit class
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  and again what you see is people coming out initially normally the
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  husband comes out and takes the class and by the time he's done he goes
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  I want to get my wife back here and then she wants all of the
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  teenagers to get the training and pretty soon they're telling their friends
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  at the social club and a church and it just continues to grow because
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  what we try to do is literally provide a life changing experience
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  for people they come in they're maybe
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  new to firearms or they've had firearms for years but never really learned the proper
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  way to use them when it's needed most to defend one's life and after that
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  four day period they're literally changed their complete outlook
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  well life is different well doc as you know
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  people who even have good firearms training lose it over time
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  I mean I've been so busy the last decade plus that I've
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  got my safety training and even my skill with
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  long rifle shotguns handguns it's still better than average
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  but then I can't imagine all these people out just buying guns for the first time
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  having them locked up and not knowing how to use them maybe going out and shooting them once or twice
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  that is not the answer obviously and with all this gun buying
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  record gun buying is a good sign firearm purchasing we need to have the training to go along
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  with it and I've told my wife and she's a pretty good shot I've taken her out to the shooting range
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  when I have time and she's gotten good with a handgun but
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  we all need to do this I need to take time out I've been so busy for years I don't even have a consult carry
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  and I should have one so I can protect myself I kind of
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  just macho ignore it but the issue is everybody needs to take time out and
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  if I have the time and I may make the time to come out to your facility
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  and go through it but also a lot of police go through your course
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  a lot of other people do why are police agencies
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  taking their folks out to be trained by you I mean this is just a claim you're making
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  that it's such great training why is your training better than theirs is it because they're still following
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  older models I mean what type of training do people get
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  well you know some departments are still a little bit behind the times based on
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  you know their personnel and equipment and their ability to do the training
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  other departments are so big and bureaucratic that
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  they have a real difficult time staying on top of the best training
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  I think the real reason that officers come out
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  and this is an even greater testimonial to our program officers military
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  officers as well as police officers come out on their own dime
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  to get our training because once they realize that what they're
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  getting through their academies and their in-service programs are the basics
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  and the minimum standard that the city council or the
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  chief of police can afford in the budget they realize you know what
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  this insurance is to be as good as I possibly could be with the equipment that they're giving me
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  and they come out on their own dime purchase our courses purchase our lifetime memberships
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  and train with us to keep their skills at a very very
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  high sharp level I think that's the reason it's you know it's the reason why a military
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  a Marine Corps officer will come out and take our practical
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  rifle course to get tuned up and ready before he's deployed
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  it's the reason why parents send their kids to us before those kids go
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  to the military so that they know the parents rest easy knowing
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  hey I did everything I can to make sure that my kid has the ability to
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  use that handgun shotgun and rifle that he may be given and thrown into harm's way
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  this is the reason why they come out it's an
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  intensive experience over a four day period of time that basically
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  exceeds the levels of training and skill that you can
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  acquire through a police academy or through your basic training in the military
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  so this is immersion also I've looked at some of the bureaucratic training
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  where they train you on this they train you on that and it's it's over a long period of time
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  you're not immersed and a lot of times cities are run
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  by globalist and mainline liberals who don't like
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  guns and so it's almost seen as evil so yeah that's why a lot of police
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  military as you said come out to take your course I want to get into your view
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  on the gun grabbers and what you're hearing from police and military and also
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  citizens coming in because you're dialed in really the center of the gun culture
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  like Larry Pratt's fighting it legislatively kind of up on the mountain
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  on the hill but you're in the hinterland you're out there with the people
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  I think of anybody out there one of the best cross sections for intelligence
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  for the patriot movement the liberty movement freedom lovers constitutionalists
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  to really know what the sense of the troops are
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  you know here in this nation not just the military troops but the American people
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  so I want to get into that in a few minutes the time we have with you Dr. Piazza
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  but first I keep plugging this on air and I get all these inquiries people saying
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  explain it to me how do folks get this free handgun
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  how are you offering it why are you offering it and tell us about
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  the different services of frontside.com
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  basically if they go to frontside.com they can subscribe to 15 free gun train reports
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  and I'll start training them right there at their computer with some of
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  the same material that we provide to the students who travel
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  across the country and spend thousands of dollars to take our classes so make sure
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  they do that. Secondly we have training manuals available
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  these are manuals that teach all of the same techniques
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  that we teach in all of our different courses those are available on the website
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  and then they'll also see the free gun link and basically the way this
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  works is that they can receive our five day
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  training program the four day defensive handgun course
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  plus the one day thirty state concealed weapon permit course which by the way
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  you walk away with everything you need to apply for and receive
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  non-resident permits in the state of Florida Nevada and Utah
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  with current reciprocity agreements in place with those three states
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  that allows you to carry in over 30 different states in the union
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  so yeah this is the way to do it I mean I'm tempted to actually come out there and do it myself
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  in fact you ought to come out and do some kind of a remote show so that all of your listeners
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  can see it you know see what's going on well I may do that because the issue
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  is I with with Texas laws about handguns I don't have a concealed carry
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  I carry a rifle around when I'm getting death threats and stuff
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  and then I got kids and stuff and I have to remember to get it
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  out and put it away and you know the person in your
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  public exposure definitely needs to carry a gun with them all the time
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  and that's why I carry a shotgun or rifle but it just did it just
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  but anyways absolutely I need to start carrying a handgun but go ahead
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  so basically we provide the four day course the one the additional one day thirty state
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  concealed weapon permit course that's normally a twenty five hundred dollar course
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  we provide that plus all of the gear that you would
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  need for the course the belt the holster the magazine magazine pouches
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  flashlight we throw in a t-shirt a hat a logoed shirt and hat
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  a folding logoed knife all of the training manuals
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  we provide that five day course and all of that material for the price
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  of eleven ninety nine it's about a three and a half to one return
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  on what it would cost for you to get that then as a bonus
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  we provide a free Springfield Armory
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  XD pistol in your choice of nine millimeter forty or forty five
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  so basically you get over four thousand dollars in training
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  and gear and a gun for eleven ninety nine if I was about
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  to say I mean just interrupt you because it's blowing me away I don't know and explain how you
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  can do this because I'm doing the math the training the five day course the free
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  gun the concealed
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  you know permit thirty state I mean those things are six hundred to a thousand dollars
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  at the cheapest seems like four fifty here in Texas
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  just to get a Texas concealed carry so this litter I mean am I right
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  to say you're doing this at cost basically then or below cost
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  actually at many times it's below cost the reason we're doing
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  is real simple you know front sites purpose from the time we started
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  front site is to positively change the image of gun ownership in our lifetime
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  and help restore the second amendment back to what it used to mean
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  that's the way to do it is the gun culture I mean absolutely we've got to take America back
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  and then show everybody what the gun culture is and I've just got to add they're attacking
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  our second amendment but you're absolutely right doc now though the gun culture is
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  taking ground back and even liberals are figuring out this is about
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  empowerment and honorably defending yourself and not being a slave I'm sorry go ahead
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  that's fine and this is what our purpose has been from the start and it's really
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  what also separates us from you know a lot of the other people in the gun industry
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  we're putting our money where our mouth is to try desperately to train as many
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  people as we possibly can law abiding responsible students
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  levels that exceed that of the law enforcement military community again
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitude so that everybody that leaves front
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  site is a walking talking perfect example
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  of responsible gun ownership and you know our purpose is so strong
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  in this that we don't have to make money on on on a person the first
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  time they come out I want to provide them with the ability to have the have
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  a good gun you know not some crappy you know piece of
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  saturday night special stuff it's not going to hold up if they need it but actually have
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  a real gun that they know how to use and all the gear that they
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  need with it and this is what we found people take advantage
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  of this offer they come out the front site they're totally blown away with
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  how well they're treated how much they learn they want their entire family
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  to take the program and they become people like Joe Bannister like
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  you had on your show they're in the culture they're in the culture we just like
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  grandfathers inducted me into the second amendment culture you're trying to induct people
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  who just bought guns but aren't in the real culture and this
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  is so special what you're doing well thank you they just don't really know what
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  they don't know I mean there's millions of people out there buying guns
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  but only a very small percentage of truly understand that
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  when they have to use that gun for real they're going to be half as good
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  and half as smart as they were on their best day on the training
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  range which probably didn't even wasn't even a training day it was probably they went to the
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  range put some rounds in the magazine or in the cylinder
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  of the revolver fired a few shots and thought okay I could hit the target
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  I'll be okay they have no idea how the adrenaline is going to be
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  surging through their veins how their heart's going to be pumping out almost out of their chest
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  it's going to be pounding in their head their hands are going to be shaking they're going to be
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  sweaty they're going to fear for their life and when that happens your
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  only half as good as your best day training and if you didn't train
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  you know you're lucky if you survive the encounter so we want to bring people
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  to the reality of knowing that the training is just as important
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  as the gun in fact we have a motto that mindset and training
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  trumps equipment meaning the way you think about a life and death
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  encounter is more important than even the training you have and the training
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  is more important than the weapon you have because a good man with the right
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  set and the ability can can basically defend himself with anything
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  but if you have a gun and you know how to use it you are a different
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  person for the rest of your life and that's what we provide
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  it's a comfort of skill at arms knowing you can defend yourself you can defend
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  your family you can defend your community you can defend your country
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  if needed and you can absolutely far exceed the people
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  that are out there carrying guns for a living well it's like that you come see us
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  you know frontsite.com whenever I
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  hear about old people being robbed and killed in Chicago and New York and L.A.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  when I hear about young women who get raped and are begging on the 911 call you know those calls
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  over and over again it's like why didn't somebody train their daughters
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  why didn't somebody arm it why do they let themselves be disarmed in New York
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  in Chicago I mean it's so pathetic and then old folks getting
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  looted and killed by young thugs an old man or old woman who knows how to use a firearm
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  it's like they're the incredible Hulk it's a great equalizer against the scum

[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  doctor Ignatius Piazza
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  is our guest the owner and founder of front site
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  websites Ignatius-Piazza.com or front site.com
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  and he is a sponsor but I've got him up today just to talk about what he's doing
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  and his view and I want to have him back up in your future talk for a full hour just
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  about the second amendment culture and how we defend it and take your calls
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  but doc in the few minutes we've got left in this segment the next then I got a big financial guest
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  coming on for the listeners out there on some key info with hyperinflation
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  I can't think of anybody out there who's talked to more people more police more
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  military in and around the second amendment more citizens
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  and everybody I talk to is really wanting to go to war with the feds I want to avoid
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  but I understand that avoiding conflict is the real mastery of it
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  only defending yourself if you have to
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  but with the foreign offshore banks seizing the country openly taking over
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  what's your view of this whole global system what are the police
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  and military and citizens saying you talk to
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  well the people that come out the front site of course don't necessarily at least at this time
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  represent the views of everyone in the country but I will tell you they're
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  much more informed about all of the all of the terrible things
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  that have been going on for many many years
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  in terms of the US losing its sovereignty
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  becoming so indebted that we may never get out of
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  a situation that we're in unless something drastic
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  like you're referring to occurs they are basically
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  arming themselves because they believe
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  that we're on the path to
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  problems that are in fact going to require everybody
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  who wants to survive it to have a firearm and know how to use it that's why they come to us
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  if there are people that are concerned about their personal safety due to
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  crime but there is definitely an undercurrent of people
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  that understand that hey this country is not what it was when our grandfathers
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  fought and died for it during World War II
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  they're very patriotic they have long lineage of people that have in fact
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  served the country they understand the Constitution
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  and because they're so much more informed than the average citizen they can read between the
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  lines with what is being told to them in the newspapers
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  and in the mainstream media and many of them listen
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  to your show I mean I've had numerous people contact me
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  and say you really should sponsor the Alex Jones show and when I started
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  listening to it I understood why and that's why we're doing it
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  Well it's a great honor to have you here because I always heard front sites the name front sites the best
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  police military I know, patriots and then here we are
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  years later together I remember Chris Athanas a friend of mine
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  local TV show radio show in like 98 just ranting and raving
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  about front side and how I had to go and how I had to be part of it
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  and I know that I'm losing my gun culture my second amendment
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  my sons and daughters have gotten a little bit of
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  training and you know we got in the backyard with the BB guns they're getting pretty good
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  but the issue is I need to make sure
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  that frontier training that I didn't realize until I read history books later
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  that I was being given the frontier training which of course isn't as good as what you do
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  but the basic stuff that was passed on from before this country was a nation
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  it was colonies and that was so special because they hadn't had those rights in Europe
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  and then I realized that I'm the first generation we're on this big second amendment guy
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  and it's not dying but it's not just
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  absolutely kick butt like it was say my grandfathers
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  who as soon as they went into world war two look out they were you know could shoot
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  a turkey at 6,000 yards or whatever and me I got to shoot two or three times
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  before I hit the turkey at 6,000 yards so just absolutely
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  great to see what you're doing and God bless you for what you're doing
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  and you know the police and military that you talked to are they starting to figure out what's going on
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  well again the students that come to see us that are military law enforcement are a very patriotic
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  group of people and they're the type of people that you would
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  want on your side if this ever you know push ever came to shove
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  and I want to compliment you on the fact that I agree with you the best thing is to avoid
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  a conflict nobody wants a conflict but we certainly don't want to be
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  abused either absolutely try to avoid
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  a conflict but I'm not going to get on my knees in a ditch to a bunch of commas ours
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  and let them have their way with me Dr. Piazza let's do a few more minutes on the other
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  signed and we've got a financial guest joining us from Thailand stay with us

[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  environment you know the basics a lot of people don't get in this because they want
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  to be macho and I have to admit even at a subconscious level I'm like I don't want to
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  get all those super good experts and and and and that is pathetic
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  loser mentality I barely have that but there's this little lingering
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  thing as a macho guy I don't know how to use a gun I don't want to you know go be
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  involved in that it's ridiculous don't be embarrassed to go out and learn how to
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  water ski or snow ski don't be embarrassed if you want to go join a golden gloves boxing
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  or kickboxing most people never get outside the
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  box because they're too afraid of even looking stupid or looking bad but once you get
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  in it you're like man this is great no boxing or anything some of the things I've done
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  in my life I mean you need to just get into it go ahead
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  and and and and make the plunge and nothing is more important
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  until learning how to defend yourself with the ancient right of armaments and the
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  best thing out there is the handgun is the firearm is the rifle read Thomas
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  Jefferson it is the essential of a free human being and the way to
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  defeat the gun grabbers is our culture lifeblood and you've got to
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  spread that idea that's why I've had lots of groups aren't that aren't even sponsors
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  and that aren't as professional or good as frontside because I'm trying
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  to get this thing kick started and it is happening all of us together so 800
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  987-777-19800 987-777-19 or

[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  well I just again want to thank you for your support and I encourage
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  all of your your listeners and viewers go to the go to the frontside
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com and at least subscribe
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  to the free gun training reports because I can start training you
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  right at your computer with some of the same information that people are spending thousands
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  of dollars to receive at our facility and and start learning what
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  we're trying to teach and understand the mindset of
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  using a firearm when it's needed to defend yourself in the lives of your loved
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  ones and also learning when it's not appropriate because that's one of the things that we also
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  teach not only we teach when to use it but more importantly when
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  you should not use a firearm so you can also keep yourself out of jail
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  so these are all very important topics now and it's reportedly the best thing
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  out there everybody I've talked to that's done including a lot of federal people
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  like banister but also police I know they just say it's really great I mean a lot of it's
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  simple common sense too but in my experience don't wave a gun
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  around unless you're protecting yourself and are prepared to use it and if you go
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  ahead and pointed at somebody you know generally then if they don't immediately get on the
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  ground you got to go ahead and take care of them but it's important to not give advice I guess
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  until they've actually come out there and gotten the full totality of the knowledge and
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  absolutely absolutely most people just do not know how much they do not know
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  when it comes to the use of a firearm to appropriately defend your life
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  and that's what we give them in that four day program in the fifth day with the 30 state
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  keeps the concealed weapon permit as Thomas yeah as Thomas Jefferson
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  said the great object the great goal is that everyone be armed

[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  radio network
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Mark Fauber of the GloomboomDoom.com report
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  currently in Thailand this is a top expert
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  he's on Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN you name it
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  and he is the editor in chief of the GloomboomDoom.com
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  our websites of course are info wars.com, prisonplanet.tv, info wars.net, jonesreport.com
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  and his predictions and tracking have been very very accurate
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  and that's why we bring you the financial experts who actually have
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  a proven track record not the ones that were telling us everything was going to be great
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  two years ago when they knew full well we were going into a recession slash depression
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  he's been on the news lately talking about the next two, five, ten years
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  not sure when the real specter of hyperinflation what that means
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  it doesn't have to be Zimbabwean or Weimar Republic level
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  to be devastating so I wanted to get him on to talk about that also his prognosis
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  for the dollar because we've got people like Harry Schultz
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  who's a highly respected and pretty accurate in the past also Bob Chapman
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  has confirmed from embassy people he knows that they are telling embassies
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  to clear dollars, hoard foreign currencies for September
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  now is that just some drill or is that an ominous sign of global dumping
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  of the dollar who knows we'll ask them about that and a lot more in the next 20 minutes
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  Mr. Fawber thank you for coming on with us. It's my pleasure
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  okay you got the floor tell us about the specter of hyperinflation
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  what you see happening in the world economy is there going to be a recovery or is this just the beginning
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  well basically the US economy went into
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  recession in October November 2007
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  but initially because the government
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  manages to massage figures it didn't show up
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  right away but after September 2008
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  the global economy fell off the cliff
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  and we probably kind of bottomed out in March April
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  but it doesn't mean that we will have a strong recovery
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  I think if you look at the cycle 2001
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  when the recovery began to 2007
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  we reached a peak prosperity sometimes in 2006 early
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  2007 in the world and we're not going to
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  go back there anytime soon
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  the problem I have with inflation is this
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  the government's reaction to the crisis has been essentially to slash interest
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  rates to zero in other words the very policy
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  that created the crisis post 2001
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  when the Fed slash the Fed fund raised
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  from six and a half percent down to one percent
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  and kept the Fed fund raised at one percent until June 2004
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  when actually the recovery had begun in November 2001
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  that led to the housing bubble to the credit bubble
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  and to the problems that we are facing today
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  so the same policies are now applied zero interest rates
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  which of course robs essentially the savers of any income on their deposits
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  with banks and in treasury bills
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  and at the same time this time around
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  we have this huge expansion
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  in the fiscal deficit in the budget deficit of the US government
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  and the projections who knows what they will be
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  eventually but I'm sure this year the fiscal
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  deficit will be in the order of two trillion dollars
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  now the government is forecasting that it will come down next year
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  but I'm not sure about that
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  now when you combine large fiscal deficits with
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  expansionary monetary policies it is very likely
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  that the joint inflation will be relatively high
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  once inflation is relatively high
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  and the economy doesn't recover then the government will print
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  even more money and that will then accelerate
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  the level of inflation rate
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  now over the decades tracking this sir
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  and being on the boards of scores of countries internationally looking at this
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  what's the inside scoop if any on what the private fellow deserve
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  is really planning what the central banks in Europe are planning
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  and they're openly announcing all this new power to regulate themselves
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  to grab whole areas of the economy, Obama's firing heads of GM
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  and hacking it up in pieces and handing it out to cronies
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  I mean it's getting really serious
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  we have two systems until the end of the 1970s
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  in the world essentially free market capitalism
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  the market economy and the planning economy
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  and as you know on the communism socialism
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  central planners totally failed with their policies
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  to create sustainable economic growth
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  and if you traveled to Russia in 1980
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  or to China in 1980 these countries were really impoverished
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  and the US in particular
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  today is moving towards an interventionist
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  policy of the government
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  moving into the economy and trying to fix the economy less right and center
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  in the extreme case you would go essentially to the
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  planning economy but it's not going to happen right away
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  but basically the more the government has an influence in the economy
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  and intervenes in the economy
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  and I have to stress that the current crisis is not a failure of free market
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  it's a failure of government intervention
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  one of the big interventions was obviously Freddie Mac
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  and Freddie Mac which essentially had
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  cheaper access to funds than the banking system
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  these were the big bankruptcies in America in terms of size
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  and also other regulatory intervention into the money market
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  in the price of money by the Federal Reserve post 2001
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  also as I just mentioned created a problem
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  it's not that the free market has failed it's interventions by the government that
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  failed and now these failed policies
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  are even enlarged and that is where I have a problem
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  with the current economic policy makers
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  yes sir I mean I'm no economist but it's just common sense watching the markets
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  following how this works you have these elite banks elite brokerage
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  firms elite power structures who want the planned economy
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  as Carol quickly wrote in tragedy and hope they actually are what I'd call
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  crony capitalist monopoly capitalist they're not free market
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  they're actually using government regulators to force the sale of banks brokerage firms
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  credit unions infrastructure to them
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  forged being rewarded for the crisis they created and now vertically integrating
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  everything and now they've made the crisis
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  even worse since the banker takeover in October of last year in Europe and the US
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  and now they're I'm sure you've seen the the the new
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  quote federal you know
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  where they're claiming they're going to have new regulations
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  when you read it it just says absolute power of the Federal Reserve to do whatever it wants
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  to take over any industries I mean again where do you see this ending just with
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  one global bank ruling everything this new bank of the world that we're going to pay our
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  carbon taxes to
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  it's difficult to see where it will end but as I point it out
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  I think it will end with much more inflation
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  and there is a big misconception in the world
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  which is that when the economy is weak they are no inflationary
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  pressure usually when you have a strong economy
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  you have low inflation and when you have weak
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  economy you have high inflation because of the
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  government interventions in the economy through fiscal measures
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  fiscal deficits and through expansionary
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  monetary policies basically you can have huge excess
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  capacities and high inflation the two have nothing at all to do
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  with each other well would you call this I think we will have high inflation
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  and at the same time I think what we will eventually
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  have is some kind of social unrest because
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  I can't believe that people will be fooled forever
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  by what you call crony capitalism yes sir
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  and I want to speak more on that but
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  I mean that begs the question how long can this
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  go on with this crony capitalism or monopoly capitalism
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  well we can go on for quite some time
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  and you know make things much worse
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  but my view would be that within the next
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  5 to 10 years when the public
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  realizes that the economy does not improve
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  and possibly in my opinion actually deteriorate
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  and is faced with actually higher taxes
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  which may not be obvious but
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  they will happen because of the large deficit then at that
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  stage I think there will be you know a social revolution
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  or some kind of social revolution or the next thing the government
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  will do to distract or distract the attention
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  of the people on bad economic conditions they'll start the war
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  very well said that's what they normally do
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  and it looks like with North Korea and Iran they could be steaming towards that goal
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  would you call the most likely outcome a type of hyperstag inflation
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  where the real economy is dying but they flood the world
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  with these worthless notes and credit
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  and so we're going to have a continual stagnation like Japan
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  or will it accelerate towards a black hole with an overlay of
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  inflation and how babble that inflation be
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  I mean will it approach Zimbabwe or Weimar or will it be
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  20-30% a year?
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  Well I tell you it doesn't really matter whether inflation is 10-15%
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  a year or whether it's the Zimbabwe style of inflation
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  but if you go up to 10% inflation a year it's likely that you will then go
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  to 15% and if you're at 15% it's likely you go to
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  15% and so forth. Once it's
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  inflation magic is let out of the
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  bottle it usually accelerates
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  and expands so I think the likelihood that
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  it will have eventually high inflation rate in the U.S. are very high
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  Won't that inflation spread worldwide?
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  Aren't we already seeing inflation all over the world? I think that's a very good question
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  So you see in America they publish a fancy
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  core inflation and core inflation on the state with the true cost
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  of living in Crete. Hello?

[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  that's fascism

[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  That's bloom-boom-boom.com
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  Okay, start finishing up your point about the economy
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  and inflation and worldwide. We're already seeing these
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  dollars being printed driving up inflation in eastern Europe
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  and places, aren't we? Well, my point is this,
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  let's say if I traveled 20 years ago to emerging
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  economies, the price level was very low. But
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  after the US began to pile up large freight
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  current account deficits which led to current account deficits
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  to grow from $150 billion in
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  1998 to currently around $800 billion.
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  This $800 billion flows into the world
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  and in many countries they inflated the price level
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  with the result that today if you stay in a hotel
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  in Sao Paulo or in Shanghai or wherever it is, it's
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  as expensive as in the US. So I think that
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  the inflation figures in the USA
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  by just excluding energy and food prices do not
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  reflect the true cost of living of a physical
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  household. I don't know whether any of your listeners have
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  insurance agreements that have gone down. They're all going up,
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  healthcare costs going up. All contributions
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  to the government for garbage
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  collection and so forth and so on. All this is going up.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  All the taxes are going up and they're telling us we've got low inflation.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  Exactly. I mean the joke is a total joke and don't forget
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  this is the worst economic contraction
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  post-second world war. In such an economic contraction
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  prices should come down but they haven't.
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  So my view is that once the economy picks up whatever that is
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  next year or in five years or in ten years, I think
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  there will be strong inflation pressures in the state.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  Absolutely. We've already got serious inflation with 20% unemployment
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  with the real numbers. My God, imagine when it's 5% unemployment.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  Are they going to dump the dollar? I know that people aren't sure
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  but we see the world creeping away, kind of moving quietly towards the
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  exits, the dollar going up and down wildly.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  I mean you're out there in Asia right now, the dollar
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  has clearly been devalued. You were just talking about that. Is the dollar a dead duck?
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  Yeah, I think so in the long run but
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  you understand the long run could be ten years
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  or even more and in between you can have strong rallies.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  I mean we had a period now between March of this year
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  and just ten days ago during which
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  inflationary fears overcame and people rushed
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  into commodities and equities and gold and so forth
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  and the dollar was weak at the same time. Now maybe you have
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  a month or two or three months where the dollar could rebound
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  somewhat, where bond prices could rebound somewhat, in other words where
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  interest rates would decline somewhat and then you have again more
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  inflationary fears and during this period of time
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  obviously equity prices would move lower but I think in the long
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  run with Mr. Bernanke at the Fed and with the
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  economic policies of the US that are in my opinion
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  misguided because the economic policies of the US target
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  consumption when they should target capital formation, in other words
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  capital investment in the form of infrastructure, in the form
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  of capacity expansion in new
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  industries, capital investment, education
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  and research and development so the consumption is basically
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  a loss for the economy. Yeah, so what's happening is
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  we're in a cannibalistic economy where we're
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  all living for today still running up the debts and the whole infrastructure is
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  going to hell in a handbasket. Where do you see the United States in 5-10 years
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  as a third world fallen empire like the Romans
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  in 4-10? You see I was just a couple of days in
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  Sao Paulo in Brazil and I travel extensively. I can tell
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  you when I first went to Sao Paulo in 1974
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  there was a huge difference between Miami, San Francisco,
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Los Angeles, New York and Sao Paulo. Sao Paulo
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  being underdeveloped and the American cities being well developed
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  so relatively well developed. Today I don't see any difference
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  between Sao Paulo and the US large cities.
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  And I also see the third world coming up but we're dropping.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  Yes, I mean it's not necessarily that the US
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  is tumbling to the bottom of the ocean
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  or drowning to the bottom of the ocean but in the last
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  20 years other countries have made huge progress
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  and are now major competitors to the US. And so
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  the US and also to some extent Western Europe have stagnated
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  while others have come up. Got it. Mark Fauber. Mark Fauber, thank you

[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  But First Bill In Iowa Disagrees
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  Let's See What This Is
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  Hey Bill
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  Yes Alex, I'm One Of Your
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  Biggest Fans
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  But Anyway
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  Earlier In The Broadcast
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  Did I Misunderstand
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  Or Did You Say
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  That You Could Shoot A Turkey
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  At 6,000 Yards
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  Yeah, I meant 600 Yards
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  That's Funny
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  You Know What Happens When You Get On Air
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  Just Like Dr. Piazza Was Saying
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  When You Actually Get In A
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  Shoot Out With Somebody
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  You Lose Half Your Mind
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  And Aren't As Good As You Are When You're Calm
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  When You're On Air
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  And You're Sitting Here Just Talking To Somebody
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  And 600 Yards
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  Not 6,000 Yards
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  Obviously A 50 Caliber
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  You Might Be Able To Shoot Something
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  At 1,000 Yards
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  And I Actually Have
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  Shot Like Old Junk Cars
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  At A Buddy's House
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  At 1,000 Yards
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  At Night With Tracers
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  Now That Is Fun
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  Looks Like Star Wars
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  Big Red Tracer
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  Shots Out
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  And Boom
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  You See It
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  At 1,000 Yards
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  And Then You Hear Like
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  Fonk When It Hits
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  But Yes
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  I Constantly Do Stuff Like That
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  Like One Time I Said
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  You Know In 1676
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  We Started The War With The Red Coats
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  And Later I Hear The Show
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  And I'm Driving Down The Road
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  Re- Broadcast
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  And I'm Like It's 1776
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  So Yes I'm Correct
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  Didn't Sound Stupid
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  But I Mean That
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  That Happens When You're On The Air
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  4 Hours A Day
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  I'm Constantly
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  Probably Once Or Twice A Day
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  I Was Diagnosed Dyslexic
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  Now Who Knows If Dyslexic
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  And All That's Even Real
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  Maybe It's Just Normal
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  That Certain Percentage Of People
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  Write B's Backwards
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  And D's Backwards
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  And I'll Flip Numbers
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  That's Why My Wife Does The Accounting
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  And Not Me
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  So I'm Constantly
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  You Know
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  600 Yards
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  6,000 Yards
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  I Was Thinking Of A Shot I Took
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  The Fence Line At My Uncle's
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  Was 600 Yards Away
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  And This Deer Jumps Over It
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  And I Fired Once
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  And I Saw It Hit The Ground
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  Right In Front Of It
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  And I Fired Again
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  Right In The Chest
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  And He Fell Over And Died
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  I Was Shooting Him Straight On
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  And So That Was The Last
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  600 Yards
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  625 Yards Actually
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  Shot I Took
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  But I Did Only My Second Shot
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  But When I Was Like 14
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  I Would Have Killed Him On The First Shot
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  So That Was The Issue
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  Yes
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  About That
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  I Just Had To Gig You On That
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  I Thought
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  Yeah My Grandpa Could Shoot A Turkey
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  At 6,000 Yards No
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  Yeah Keep Up The Good Work
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  My Friend
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  Alright Buddy I Appreciate
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  Yeah When I Was Like 16
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  Probably My Best Shot
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  When I Used To Go
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  Shooting Every Weekend
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  With A 243
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  We Had A Shooting Range
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  Out On Our Property
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  A Fence Line
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  And I Could Put A Tabasco
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  Bottle
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  Up On The Fence Post
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  And I Could Shoot
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  The Red Cap Off
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  At 200 Yards
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  And That Was Like A
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  Five Power Scope
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  Not Even A Very Fancy Scope
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  Now
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  If I Tried Two Or Three
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  Times At 200 Yards
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  I'd Be Able To Hit The Tabasco
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  Bottle A Little Tabasco Bottle
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  I Hit It Every Time
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  It Was A Big One
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  In Fact I Used To Go
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  To The Shooting Range
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  And I Could Sit There
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  At 100 Yards
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  And Shoot To The Same Hole
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  Sometimes Times
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  I Mean Same Hole
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  Same Hole
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  Same Hole At 100 Yards
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  Just Boom
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  You Know Just Perfect
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  Now That's Precision
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  And Now
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  100 Yards You Know
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  I Can
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  I Can Make A Big Hole
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  But I Mean I'm Talking
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  The Same Hole Folks
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  And That's How You Build
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  A Skill
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  And Then You Lose It
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  So That Was My
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  Whole Issue
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  Talking Fast
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  See The Problem Is
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  I'm Actually
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  And I Appreciate Your Call
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  Bill
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  I've Actually Listened
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  A Lot Other Talk Show Host
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  What They Do Is
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  They Wait With A Guest
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  And Then Let Them Talk
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  And Then They Take Their Time
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  When They Talk
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  That Is The Guest
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  The Host Does
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  They Just Do It Real Slick
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  And Real Calm
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  And Wait
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  And Then Talk Slow
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  And Even Though They're
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  Interrupting More
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  It Has The Illusion
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  Of Not Interrupting
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Whereas Me
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  I'll Kind Of Fast Throw
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  Stuff In With A Guest
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  Because I Got The Thought
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  And I Don't Want To Forget
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  It
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  And Then I'll Say
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  6,000 Yards Instead
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  Of 600 Yards
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Okay
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  That's How That Works
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  Doesn't Even Matter

[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  Of This
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  But For Those

[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  To Persecute
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  Them
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  And They've Always

[2:50:14.980 --> 2:50:22.380]  Yeah, yeah, and they're taking me in. Hello. Yes, we're here. Yeah. And they're taking
[2:50:22.380 --> 2:50:27.500]  me in, right? And they take me, you know, with no shoes, no socks, nothing. And I want
[2:50:27.500 --> 2:50:31.580]  people to get an idea of what they do when they take you in, right? Because when they
[2:50:31.580 --> 2:50:35.620]  take you in, right, they strip you out and put you in a freezing cold room for hours
[2:50:35.620 --> 2:50:41.500]  on end. And then they'll pack you in there with about 40 other guys in a room designed
[2:50:41.500 --> 2:50:46.660]  for about eight. And they'll leave you guys in there all night, freezing. It's like 32
[2:50:46.660 --> 2:50:51.100]  degrees, 33 degrees in there, laughing and joking about it. You don't, you can't get
[2:50:51.100 --> 2:50:55.460]  medical. Yeah, it's all part of torture. It's all part of torture. Don't worry, those
[2:50:55.460 --> 2:50:59.100]  jailguards are going to lose their house to their kids are going to die brain tumors
[2:50:59.100 --> 2:51:03.660]  from the fluoride they're drinking. They want evil, they get heart disease is on the rise,
[2:51:03.660 --> 2:51:08.300]  clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[2:51:08.300 --> 2:51:13.380]  by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor
[2:51:13.380 --> 2:51:18.180]  circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something
[2:51:18.180 --> 2:51:23.220]  is wrong. Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's

[2:54:12.540 --> 2:54:20.220]  Coming up later, I'm going to show video, play the audio of Beck staging crying and
[2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:25.580]  having stuff put in his eyes to then go cry. He does the same thing on his TV show. And
[2:54:25.580 --> 2:54:29.820]  again, I'm not into attacking Glenn Beck. It's just he is a Judas Code operative. The
[2:54:29.820 --> 2:54:33.140]  mainstream media wants to be pro-new world order and works for the banks. Most of them
[2:54:33.140 --> 2:54:37.740]  just admit it and are anti-freedom openly. Beck acts like he's us and then constantly
[2:54:37.740 --> 2:54:43.620]  says arrest us. And then meanwhile, the police are actually out doing it, pulling over little
[2:54:43.620 --> 2:54:50.620]  ladies with canning supplies and they got a pocket constitution. How to play that. I
[2:54:50.620 --> 2:54:54.940]  mean, they literally are going like they found the most poisonous deadly snake or an abominable
[2:54:54.940 --> 2:55:01.940]  snowman. The Yeti was in their trunk or something like giant cobra jumped out. They got a little
[2:55:01.940 --> 2:55:07.860]  pocket constitution basically urinating on themselves. I mean, this is brainwashing
[2:55:07.860 --> 2:55:15.340]  folks. I got one. She's got what I swore it off to. It's deadly dangerous. And then arresting
[2:55:15.340 --> 2:55:19.220]  people that have my videos. I mean, this government is rogue and criminal. We're going to talk
[2:55:19.220 --> 2:55:23.540]  to him in just a minute. That's why it's important folks to get the money masters, how banks
[2:55:23.540 --> 2:55:29.100]  create the world's money. This three and a half hour film 1995, well produced. You want
[2:55:29.100 --> 2:55:35.140]  to understand how this stuff operates, get it at infowars.com. Got that deal I keep mentioning

[2:55:59.860 --> 2:56:03.660]  The latest film by William Lewis, excellent film blowing the American dream life on the
[2:56:03.660 --> 2:56:06.620]  edge of a bubble. Excellent to explain to people out there that don't know what's going
[2:56:06.620 --> 2:56:13.500]  on. If we don't educate people, these criminals are going to win. So 888-253-3139 to call
[2:56:13.500 --> 2:56:19.820]  an order. 888-253-3139. Or you can see all of my films online right now, including reflections
[2:56:19.820 --> 2:56:23.540]  and warnings at prisonplanet.tv. Want to thank all the members there who are members
[2:56:23.540 --> 2:56:29.100]  of prisonplanet.tv. You can also write to me again, Alex Jones, 3001 South Lamar, sweet
[2:56:29.100 --> 2:56:34.420]  100, Austin, Texas, 787-04, and all your purchases of the books and videos make this
[2:56:34.420 --> 2:56:39.180]  operation possible. All right. So going back to doc and the minute or two we got left,
[2:56:39.180 --> 2:56:44.700]  I'm going to come back, go to John, William, Julio, M.H.L. and others, finish up doc. So
[2:56:44.700 --> 2:56:49.980]  they finally had to let you go though. Yeah. And they let me go and I got out and came
[2:56:49.980 --> 2:56:56.020]  home and that was when I realized, right? That there had to be something that I could
[2:56:56.020 --> 2:57:01.140]  do to let people know what was coming. And so that's why I started the channel was so
[2:57:01.140 --> 2:57:06.500]  that I could just share some of what they were doing to me because this is always, it's
[2:57:06.500 --> 2:57:10.420]  always incremental. If they're going to start, they're going to start with us and people
[2:57:10.420 --> 2:57:16.460]  are going to cheer about that. But then it's on to them next. They're on the list. So it's
[2:57:16.460 --> 2:57:21.060]  on to them next. And I can't thank you enough for having me on, Alex. I really appreciate
[2:57:21.060 --> 2:57:28.700]  that. And I joined up prison planet a couple of weeks ago and it's excellent. I love it.
[2:57:28.700 --> 2:57:33.700]  I think everybody should. So well, doc, listen for the time. Well, thank you. I'm just glad
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:38.660]  that you put a YouTube up channel and in a few months had tens of thousands of views.
[2:57:38.660 --> 2:57:41.980]  Your videos were all getting thousands of views every time people really were connecting
[2:57:41.980 --> 2:57:46.260]  with you. And then they erased your channel because they're scared of you and everybody
[2:57:46.260 --> 2:57:51.040]  else. They don't want you fighting back. I'm sure the local fed said, take that down.
[2:57:51.040 --> 2:57:55.840]  You're back in your channels even bigger now in just a few days and they censor you again.
[2:57:55.840 --> 2:58:00.820]  We just prove you to this run by a bunch of new order scum. We start doppelganging all
[2:58:00.820 --> 2:58:04.940]  our material and other sites and no, they're openly announcing they're going to start shutting
[2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:08.700]  the web down. This is mainstream news. So we better use it while it's there. And I like
[2:58:08.700 --> 2:58:14.180]  the fact that you're coming back, you're speaking out, you're not just rolling over and just
[2:58:14.180 --> 2:58:17.700]  start doing videos about other kidnapping your wife's kids, you know, really expose
[2:58:17.700 --> 2:58:19.860]  this. Take care, doc. Good to hear from you.
[2:58:19.860 --> 2:58:25.620]  Thank you, Alex. You got to take care going to start the final hour. There's been some
[2:58:25.620 --> 2:58:30.060]  new big 9 11 developments. Jason Bermas will be popping in the last 15 minutes of the show,
[2:58:30.060 --> 2:58:35.100]  but your calls and a ton of other news I haven't even gotten to straight ahead in 60. Well,
[2:58:35.100 --> 2:58:52.460]  the station IDs network ID 70 seconds will be right back. Hello, friends. This is Alex
[2:58:52.460 --> 2:58:56.220]  Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self sufficient. And today
[2:58:56.220 --> 2:59:00.740]  that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[2:59:00.740 --> 2:59:04.220]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line. You have your own bread. You'll never have
[2:59:04.220 --> 2:59:08.420]  to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[2:59:08.420 --> 2:59:12.420]  If you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation,
[2:59:12.420 --> 2:59:16.740]  but you know, eatfoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E
[2:59:16.740 --> 2:59:21.140]  coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports. And they do it at almost half the

[3:00:16.220 --> 3:00:26.780]  Thank you for joining us. We are now in the final hour of this Tuesday edition. I'm going
[3:00:26.780 --> 3:00:31.220]  to recap some of the top stories in the groceries. I haven't covered yet, but first, I want to
[3:00:31.220 --> 3:00:36.820]  continue with your phone calls. Let's talk to John in West Virginia. John, you're on
[3:00:36.820 --> 3:00:41.980]  the air. Welcome. Hey, how's it going, Alex? I listen to you every day. I love you all.
[3:00:41.980 --> 3:00:45.820]  We love you too, my friend. What's on your mind? Well, you know, I mean, we got to talking
[3:00:45.820 --> 3:00:51.380]  about this. You know, I joined the military back in 91 and on the cover of our training
[3:00:51.380 --> 3:00:57.700]  manual was a big globe and it said, global reach, global power. And you know, I really
[3:00:57.700 --> 3:01:01.980]  didn't think about that much until I started listening to you all. I mean, you know, look,
[3:01:01.980 --> 3:01:06.700]  I try to drill this into my friend's heads and then, you know, also like last night you
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:09.540]  were talking, you know, get off your butts and do something, you know, and I was telling
[3:01:09.540 --> 3:01:15.820]  my buddy, you know, we got to do it. We got Ray Hall, our company in office up here, him
[3:01:15.820 --> 3:01:21.500]  and Rockefeller signed this bill for 6.5 million to get from Homeland Security. And I was trying
[3:01:21.500 --> 3:01:26.820]  to explain what that meant to my friends. I said 80% supposed to go to local shares
[3:01:26.820 --> 3:01:34.340]  and other entities like that and 20% supposed to goes for the compulsory service. And then
[3:01:34.340 --> 3:01:40.620]  FEMA gets 100,000. So I called his office to ask him about and asking about why he keep
[3:01:40.620 --> 3:01:44.620]  voting against the American people. And the only thing that I got from them was, would
[3:01:44.620 --> 3:01:50.220]  you like to leave a message? You know, so I think we're going to go up and I guess
[3:01:50.220 --> 3:01:54.100]  protest and be considered terrorists of the world.
[3:01:54.100 --> 3:01:59.700]  Well, look, they're trying to say all protest is terrorism. When all our veterans supposedly
[3:01:59.700 --> 3:02:05.020]  fought and died for was that right to create a chilling effect. Singer not allowed to protest.
[3:02:05.020 --> 3:02:08.740]  We're about to have the Federal Reserve, not just get unlimited money, but run everything.
[3:02:08.740 --> 3:02:12.660]  And the feds are federalizing all the states with this water bill saying not just the water,
[3:02:12.660 --> 3:02:17.620]  but everything surrounding it. They admit total takeover, just unspeakable level. They
[3:02:17.620 --> 3:02:22.580]  have to try to intimidate us so they can grab their ill gotten gains. They are the criminals.
[3:02:22.580 --> 3:02:26.820]  They are the bad people. They are illegitimate. We are in the right. That's why they're hiring
[3:02:26.820 --> 3:02:32.260]  thugs and scum and control freaks. And I don't see it working. And I appreciate your call.
[3:02:32.260 --> 3:02:35.540]  God bless you, sir. Good to hear from you, John. William in Texas, William, you're on
[3:02:35.540 --> 3:02:36.540]  the air.
[3:02:36.540 --> 3:02:37.540]  Hello.
[3:02:37.540 --> 3:02:38.540]  Yes, sir.
[3:02:38.540 --> 3:02:39.540]  How are you doing, Alex?
[3:02:39.540 --> 3:02:40.540]  Good.
[3:02:40.540 --> 3:02:43.140]  Better to talk to the man who knows the truth.
[3:02:43.140 --> 3:02:45.100]  Well, I try. What's on your mind?
[3:02:45.100 --> 3:02:52.980]  Well, I have several things I needed to tell you. First of all, in regards to Mr. Piazza,
[3:02:52.980 --> 3:02:59.700]  I think his front-side program is absolutely astounding. I think it's something everybody
[3:02:59.700 --> 3:03:06.140]  should do. And I say that because I'm retired from Texas Parks and Wildlife, where we offer
[3:03:06.140 --> 3:03:10.980]  a hunter safety course. And I think that's important for people to do as well.
[3:03:10.980 --> 3:03:15.820]  Absolutely. I have promoted those. And I've promoted all sorts of apple seed group. I
[3:03:15.820 --> 3:03:22.100]  mean, whatever you do, they phased out a lot of the YMCA and Boy Scout shooting, unfortunately.
[3:03:22.100 --> 3:03:24.580]  But we need to get that culture back.
[3:03:24.580 --> 3:03:32.620]  Oh, absolutely. I thoroughly agree. And if nothing else, you know, they learn the do's
[3:03:32.620 --> 3:03:44.140]  and don'ts about a firearm. And the next thing is in regards to the 9-11 event, I have been
[3:03:44.140 --> 3:03:50.180]  watching world events and scripture and things like this for several years. I became very
[3:03:50.180 --> 3:03:55.460]  interested the morning that that happened and knew that there was a lot more to it than
[3:03:55.460 --> 3:04:01.860]  was just meeting the eye. And along with your info that you put out and some of the videos
[3:04:01.860 --> 3:04:07.100]  I've seen and information I've been able to gather, I thought, well, you know, I really
[3:04:07.100 --> 3:04:11.740]  wanted to get to the bottom of some of this. There's a very good friend of mine I've known
[3:04:11.740 --> 3:04:19.420]  all my life. He is an executive with American Airlines. I quizzed him about this. And his
[3:04:19.420 --> 3:04:27.180]  is basically on the airliners supposedly lost that day. And he told me there were no airliners
[3:04:27.180 --> 3:04:30.580]  lost that day out of their fleet.
[3:04:30.580 --> 3:04:35.260]  No, absolutely. In fact, I got Jason Burma's coming up. We'll just do this now with Jason

[3:08:01.300 --> 3:08:07.220]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[3:08:07.220 --> 3:08:09.220]  a war on for your mind.
[3:08:09.220 --> 3:08:15.780]  Okay, I was going to get into a bunch of huge new 9-11 developments just today and there's
[3:08:15.780 --> 3:08:20.420]  developments like this every day or two now. Tens of thousands of them in triplicate total
[3:08:20.420 --> 3:08:23.940]  black-off attack. There is no way to deny it.
[3:08:23.940 --> 3:08:29.060]  Hijackers trained at bases, embassies told they were CIA led them in with security clearances
[3:08:29.060 --> 3:08:33.620]  trained at bases, heads of defense language school going public saying it's an inside job.
[3:08:33.620 --> 3:08:39.220]  These guys were US spies. I mean, on and on, drills of the same buildings being attacked,
[3:08:39.220 --> 3:08:43.380]  the buildings being blown up, the firefighter saying it was molten steel, blasted off,
[3:08:43.380 --> 3:08:48.180]  thermate, thermite found, confirmed, the government's own reports, the sole foundation,
[3:08:48.180 --> 3:08:53.540]  the thermite didn't know why it was there. I mean, but it's so big, they know we can never admit
[3:08:53.540 --> 3:08:56.740]  it publicly because it would bring the whole system down. People just, it's too scary. The
[3:08:56.740 --> 3:09:01.620]  government did it. Well, yeah, and they bombed resin and killed 500,000 Germans in one night.
[3:09:01.620 --> 3:09:06.180]  They bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They gave, they sterilized half the Native Americans in
[3:09:06.180 --> 3:09:11.540]  the country. This is in the 70s. I have mainstream news, one in Telegraph where they go sterilize
[3:09:11.540 --> 3:09:15.300]  women in Africa when they go in to think they're getting the medical checkup. They just pour a
[3:09:15.300 --> 3:09:21.060]  filly in, get in there and cut the tubes, baby. I mean, this is how they roll and they're doing
[3:09:21.060 --> 3:09:25.620]  it to you. They took your blood at birth 36 years ago. Everybody born for 36 years, anywhere in the
[3:09:25.620 --> 3:09:31.060]  western world, global program, you go in a illegal DNA database. I told you that 12 years ago. Now
[3:09:31.060 --> 3:09:34.420]  it's front page, the Austin, America State's been going, yeah, they secretly took your blood
[3:09:34.420 --> 3:09:38.020]  because you wouldn't get it, but it's for your own good. And the genome projects got it. And
[3:09:38.020 --> 3:09:42.260]  it is related to Bray specific bio weapon development. But hey, we got to kill you. I mean,
[3:09:42.260 --> 3:09:47.220]  you know, and the cops love it. They're injecting their kids to drinking fluoride. Oh, God, I love
[3:09:47.220 --> 3:09:52.500]  dying. I love the government. Hey, old government. I mean, just makes me sick that we put up with
[3:09:52.500 --> 3:09:57.140]  this crap. All of us together thinking we're fighting with each other. Now I want to go back.
[3:09:57.140 --> 3:10:00.420]  I'm sorry. I got a little upset there. I want to go back to William and Texas. William,
[3:10:00.420 --> 3:10:04.100]  you're saying you were calling in about the firearms issues saying you were retired,
[3:10:04.100 --> 3:10:08.420]  Texas Parks and Wildlife shooting safety course, which is a shooting course really good.
[3:10:08.420 --> 3:10:13.620]  When you went into your buddy, executive of American Airlines, I've had FAA people talk to
[3:10:13.620 --> 3:10:19.460]  me. I've had American Airlines. I've had other company people tell me, but it's on record that
[3:10:19.460 --> 3:10:26.660]  all four flights were at 25% exact occupancy apiece on a day where the East Coast was 89%
[3:10:26.660 --> 3:10:32.180]  occupancy that they even had that average. Magically, these guys have been all these flights
[3:10:32.180 --> 3:10:35.860]  doing drills that they were going to take over with James Woods reporting it going to the FBI
[3:10:35.860 --> 3:10:40.020]  with the captain saying, we think these guys are hijackers. The FBI said, shut up or we'll arrest
[3:10:40.020 --> 3:10:45.700]  you. Don't tell anybody. These were operative. We have it in triplicate, but we've got new
[3:10:45.700 --> 3:10:49.780]  developments today. But you're saying this is hearsay, but it's interesting story anecdotal.
[3:10:49.780 --> 3:10:54.580]  Tell folks specifically your friend and executive American Airlines explaining
[3:10:54.580 --> 3:11:00.740]  none of our fleets missing. Well, I knew, I knew there was something not quite right with this
[3:11:00.740 --> 3:11:07.700]  from the very beginning and that I guess that's what got my curiosity up. And when I found out
[3:11:07.700 --> 3:11:13.860]  through the news, you know that there were American Airlines aircraft involved, then I knew I could
[3:11:13.860 --> 3:11:18.820]  get to the bottom of it because this guy's like my brother. He wouldn't lie to me and he didn't.
[3:11:18.820 --> 3:11:24.660]  And he specifically said, no, we didn't lose any airliners that day. Now along with that,
[3:11:24.660 --> 3:11:29.860]  my brother was an executive with Delta Airlines for 13 years. And one thing,
[3:11:29.860 --> 3:11:34.740]  a lot of these executives do is they know people in other airlines. And so I quizzed my brother
[3:11:34.740 --> 3:11:42.180]  about this and he knew some higher ups in the United Airlines and they did not lose an aircraft
[3:11:42.180 --> 3:11:47.460]  that day either. Well, let me explain. They have the NASA facility switching planes. When you read
[3:11:47.460 --> 3:11:53.540]  the declassified Northwoods plan, it's how they paint up one plane like another have CIA and
[3:11:53.540 --> 3:11:56.500]  government people notice how most of them were government. They were staging their desk to be
[3:11:56.500 --> 3:12:03.060]  part of the hoax. They get on the plane. It takes off goes one place, then the drone goes another,
[3:12:03.060 --> 3:12:10.020]  but go ahead. Well, the next thing that I got really curious about is a passenger manifest.
[3:12:10.980 --> 3:12:16.500]  And as far as we can tell and everything these guys, my brother and my friend American has told
[3:12:16.500 --> 3:12:23.780]  me is that, you know, they don't have any records of that. So, you know, this sounds like a real
[3:12:23.780 --> 3:12:29.540]  elaborate. No, no, no, that's associated press to they. The first passenger list weren't right.
[3:12:29.540 --> 3:12:34.580]  The new ones came out. Then the hijackers weren't on the list. There were other names than they were.
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:40.500]  There's all sorts of chicanery going on. Anything else? Well, one of the things Alex is very,
[3:12:40.500 --> 3:12:47.460]  very important. And I'm a cancer survivor. I have been through six surgeries, chemo and
[3:12:47.460 --> 3:12:54.900]  radiation only to be sent home and given six months to live. I have now made 16 years since
[3:12:54.900 --> 3:13:01.780]  my last chemo treatment due to studying and researching human immunology and health and
[3:13:01.780 --> 3:13:08.100]  nutrition. And there's one thing that I would like to point out that this is very, very accurate.
[3:13:08.100 --> 3:13:13.460]  I work with a lot of people with health problems, especially more cancer patients than anything.
[3:13:13.460 --> 3:13:21.780]  PH? I beg your pardon? PH? Well, that has a lot to do with it. Yes. There is one thing in particular.
[3:13:22.420 --> 3:13:30.340]  The raw unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar is the key thing in this. And the reason being is
[3:13:30.340 --> 3:13:38.420]  there are over 55,000 negative fungus in the world. And all 931 diseases cannot live in this
[3:13:38.420 --> 3:13:45.380]  raw vinegar once it's present in your body on a constant basis. And we take people just like I was
[3:13:45.380 --> 3:13:50.820]  that are sent home to die from cancer centers and cancer doctors. And we turn them around in
[3:13:50.820 --> 3:13:56.180]  just a few months by putting them on a particular program. It's real simple. It's a year's supply
[3:13:56.180 --> 3:14:02.420]  that's cheaper than going to the doctor one time. But it works every time we have yet to see it not
[3:14:02.420 --> 3:14:07.140]  work. Amazing. Send me the information or write an article for us. We can't make claims, but you
[3:14:07.140 --> 3:14:12.100]  can tell if folks your experience writers at info wars.com, write that up. I want to make sure Kurt
[3:14:12.100 --> 3:14:16.020]  and Paul and everybody are checking these and getting them posted. Writers at info wars.com
[3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:20.660]  kind of have an op ed piece. Thank you so much, sir. Jason, we've got multiple developments. You
[3:14:20.660 --> 3:14:26.020]  know, when we see this headline at info wars.com 911 FEMA videographer at ground zero goes public
[3:14:26.660 --> 3:14:30.900]  and he's on record. He was there and has the video to prove it. But it's not just him. It's all these
[3:14:30.900 --> 3:14:36.660]  other firemen and police and medics I've talked to an interviewed and police officers that saw them
[3:14:36.660 --> 3:14:40.980]  saying get back. We're going to blow the building up. Then the CNN footage services people were
[3:14:40.980 --> 3:14:44.900]  where the cops are saying get back. We're going to blow it up. And there's our witness on the side.
[3:14:44.900 --> 3:14:49.540]  You know, years after they're telling us these stories. There's the video. People go that was
[3:14:49.540 --> 3:14:53.940]  actually on CNN that day. So we're proven right on that. The firemen saying there were bombs going
[3:14:53.940 --> 3:14:59.620]  off. Barry Jennings saying in the mysteriously dying. All of this going on. And then we had the
[3:14:59.620 --> 3:15:04.900]  firefighters who found the black boxes put them on four wheelers. The fed said you never saw that.
[3:15:04.900 --> 3:15:09.300]  That's in Philadelphia Daily News. That's in whole book about it. Associated press. Yeah,
[3:15:09.300 --> 3:15:13.220]  we've talked to them. The majority of victims families believe it's an inside job. We've had them
[3:15:13.220 --> 3:15:18.660]  on. So we've got the heads of the biggest groups on saying the majority believe that. So it isn't
[3:15:18.660 --> 3:15:24.100]  just one piece here, one piece there. The truth is coming out. Burma's tell us about these latest
[3:15:24.100 --> 3:15:29.780]  developments, including these planes all being mothballed until the special day. Yeah, it seems
[3:15:29.780 --> 3:15:36.500]  that due to an FOIA request by Aiden Monaghan, he does more FOIAs than I've ever seen anybody.
[3:15:36.500 --> 3:15:40.260]  He gets a lot of great development. You can see the actual documents of the U.S. Department of
[3:15:40.260 --> 3:15:46.100]  Transportation sent back to him. And they are now claiming that the four aircraft that were used on
[3:15:46.100 --> 3:15:56.020]  9 11 had not been used since December of 2000. So that means a nine month window. But that doesn't
[3:15:56.020 --> 3:16:02.020]  seem to coincide with what they put on the Internet. There's a separate Internet Regulation List
[3:16:02.020 --> 3:16:06.900]  where these planes were scheduled to fly on September 10. And there's the Department and
[3:16:06.900 --> 3:16:11.780]  there's the Department of Transportation's internal document with all the information.
[3:16:11.780 --> 3:16:16.180]  But the issue here is notice right when Bush gets in, they decide to go with the operation.
[3:16:16.180 --> 3:16:20.500]  And that's when they go into mothball and start preparing them exactly as a Northwoods plan called
[3:16:20.500 --> 3:16:25.620]  for exactly how we document martial law. They could have had two different programs going on
[3:16:25.620 --> 3:16:29.860]  simultaneously. Continue, Burmese. Yeah. I mean, I just thought this was, you know,
[3:16:29.860 --> 3:16:33.220]  something we had to report on. Obviously, the insinuation here is that they may have been
[3:16:33.220 --> 3:16:37.540]  fitted with global Hawk technology. If it wasn't already present, we knew global Hawk technology.
[3:16:37.540 --> 3:16:42.820]  You covered that in Masters of Terror and Road to Tyranny. Well, remember Bush, a day after the
[3:16:42.820 --> 3:16:47.380]  attack, he's in New York and he said he's given a speech and he says, we've got systems for remote
[3:16:47.380 --> 3:16:51.380]  control where this won't happen anymore. And the person behind him grabs him by the arm and says,
[3:16:51.380 --> 3:16:57.860]  stop it. Yeah. And he goes, oh, we got to find that video. I saw it live on TV. Since the 60s,
[3:16:57.860 --> 3:17:01.780]  they've had big jumbo jets taking off and landing flying from California to Australia. Well,
[3:17:01.780 --> 3:17:07.220]  if you listen to the Northwoods plan, I mean that the Joe Kennedy Jr. died the firstborn.
[3:17:07.220 --> 3:17:13.060]  Yeah. He died remote controlling. He had a chase plane in a, I think it was a P 38 lightning,
[3:17:13.060 --> 3:17:19.380]  chasing another B17 loaded with explosives as a cruise missile. The Germans weren't the only ones
[3:17:19.380 --> 3:17:25.380]  that had these, the V ones, V sixes. The point is they've had remote control aircrafts as World War
[3:17:25.380 --> 3:17:30.020]  II. Oh, oh, by far and like I said, read the Northwoods document. Like you said, these people,
[3:17:30.020 --> 3:17:34.100]  they say remote control. Well, well, they, they say U S military on what seems to be a commercial
[3:17:34.100 --> 3:17:38.420]  flight. They put that flight in the air. Then they have a, another flight the same way painted
[3:17:38.420 --> 3:17:42.500]  up that's remote control. Then it, the road control doesn't stop there. They are also going to
[3:17:42.500 --> 3:17:47.540]  remote control. They painted up Russian MiG fighter and that remote control, the aircraft is the one
[3:17:47.540 --> 3:17:51.700]  that shoots down the other remote controlled aircraft weight. It's even crazier. Folks,
[3:17:51.700 --> 3:17:57.380]  read the documents. Then somebody else is going to drop debris over a field while a drill is
[3:17:57.380 --> 3:18:02.340]  taking place. So the people taking part in the drill, see the debris over the field and they
[3:18:02.340 --> 3:18:07.380]  believe it's a real attack. That's how elaborate and compartmentalized that plan was and to have
[3:18:07.380 --> 3:18:13.220]  Marines attack U S army bases and blame it on the Russians. Now stopping there, let's remember,
[3:18:13.220 --> 3:18:19.140]  Hitler did this. The British constantly did this for 300 years. It's called false flag. Now in West
[3:18:19.140 --> 3:18:24.980]  Point training for higher level officers for people, they're taking that training to try to go for
[3:18:24.980 --> 3:18:31.540]  that later in life. In, in the strategic operation, there is pawn sacrifice or even higher peace
[3:18:31.540 --> 3:18:35.620]  sacrifice. And it's a classic thing going back to Alexander the Great. You'll deploy a smaller group
[3:18:35.620 --> 3:18:39.380]  knowing they're going to get overwhelmed and killed. And you do that to draw the enemy out,
[3:18:39.380 --> 3:18:44.180]  not being able to resist crushing that smaller force. Now you can have your troops come up over
[3:18:44.180 --> 3:18:48.900]  both the hills and encircle the enemy with your main force. There's many different variants of this
[3:18:48.900 --> 3:18:54.740]  where you'll say kill 10,000 of our soldiers, use them as bait. It's just standard military ops. So
[3:18:54.740 --> 3:18:58.740]  they said, look, we're going to have to kill a lot of Americans. It's what we need to do for our
[3:18:58.740 --> 3:19:04.340]  empire. And they just did it. And, and, and this is how it's done. And then it got released two years
[3:19:04.340 --> 3:19:09.780]  ago. Rumsfeld with the top generals, the retired generals who were lying and saying they weren't
[3:19:09.780 --> 3:19:14.740]  on Pentagon payroll and they were the advice for all the news channels that are basically CIA run
[3:19:14.740 --> 3:19:20.180]  knowing, you know, Rumsfeld minus a little major terror attack. 9 11 sure helped us. We need another
[3:19:20.180 --> 3:19:24.660]  one. And they go, yeah, I know what you mean. We need that, don't we? They almost say they did it
[3:19:24.660 --> 3:19:30.820]  on tape. I mean, they're just enjoying themselves because they're, it's a religion of not caring
[3:19:30.820 --> 3:19:35.140]  about you. It's a control freaks religion of we're going to put sodium fluoride in the people
[3:19:35.140 --> 3:19:38.900]  and they're going to be retarded not be able to face us down. We're going to shoot your kids up
[3:19:38.900 --> 3:19:44.020]  with brain damage and chemicals. It's all a big enjoyment. Look at the cattle. They can't figure
[3:19:44.020 --> 3:19:49.060]  it out. Look at the cattle. They can't resist us even as we kill them. So your pawns to them,

[3:21:02.100 --> 3:21:09.700]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources, 800-686-2237 extension 128. And let's take in a brief mind
[3:21:09.700 --> 3:21:15.460]  movie. We're surrounded by gestures, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington,
[3:21:15.460 --> 3:21:21.220]  D.C. Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all
[3:21:21.220 --> 3:21:26.820]  will be well. The stimulus package is working. A bailout is coming your way. And while we're flat
[3:21:26.820 --> 3:21:31.940]  broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink. Pardon me? Back to the real
[3:21:31.940 --> 3:21:37.140]  world. We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security. Protecting
[3:21:37.140 --> 3:21:42.180]  your assets is solely up to you. No one else is coming to the rescue. Please call me John Swenson
[3:21:42.180 --> 3:21:49.540]  800-686-2237 extension 128 to discuss investing in precious metals, gold, and silver with a 6000
[3:21:49.540 --> 3:21:57.060]  year track record of success and security. I'm John Swenson 800-686-2237 extension 128 and
[3:21:57.060 --> 3:22:05.140]  together we'll create a package that really works for you. It is a big idea. A new world order.
[3:22:05.780 --> 3:22:10.660]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:22:10.660 --> 3:22:17.620]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years,
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:23.860]  their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of
[3:22:23.860 --> 3:22:33.140]  exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world
[3:22:33.140 --> 3:22:39.140]  government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:22:39.140 --> 3:22:42.900]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[3:22:42.900 --> 3:22:46.260]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[3:22:46.260 --> 3:22:53.700]  aptitude. Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now

[3:23:09.060 --> 3:23:14.340]  getting worse, but there is hope. Robert Beatles' new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do
[3:23:14.340 --> 3:23:19.300]  and how to do it. Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book. And the
[3:23:19.300 --> 3:23:26.020]  best part? This book is priced under $10. Don't be the victim. Be a victor. Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[3:23:26.020 --> 3:23:51.060]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net. Again, Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[3:23:56.020 --> 3:24:23.540]  All right. I want to finish up with this 9-11 news. I'm going to come back in the next long
[3:24:23.540 --> 3:24:31.220]  segment to take your calls and cover news. Okay, Jason Burmos, we've gotten into the fact that the
[3:24:31.220 --> 3:24:36.580]  Transportation Administration midst, oh, these planes, all four, two different airlines magically
[3:24:36.580 --> 3:24:41.700]  had been mothballed at the same time and then rolled out together and then only had 25% occupancy
[3:24:41.700 --> 3:24:47.380]  exactly. And then the list later didn't match the list of people that got on the plane. And you've
[3:24:47.380 --> 3:24:52.580]  got these Arabs that the CIA ordered led in the country and that were trained at military bases
[3:24:52.580 --> 3:24:56.740]  on record. But then no one wants to discuss that. Let's just give up all our rights because Al Qaeda
[3:24:56.740 --> 3:25:00.580]  hit us and the government loves us. And let's again take lots of injections. Yeah. And no one's
[3:25:00.580 --> 3:25:05.140]  supposed to discuss the fact that these four planes that were allegedly hijacked didn't emit a hijacking
[3:25:05.140 --> 3:25:10.900]  code. Yet the other quote unquote hijackings that went on that day that are exposed by the FBI's own
[3:25:10.900 --> 3:25:15.140]  team eight report. See, a lot of people don't know that there's a bunch of sub reports that go into
[3:25:15.140 --> 3:25:19.060]  the 9-11 commission report. And you can now download those in PDF form. And they'll tell you about the
[3:25:19.060 --> 3:25:24.340]  other hijackings that I cover and fabled enemies. Those ones did emit hijack signals, Alex, but
[3:25:24.340 --> 3:25:28.820]  magically the four that were hijacked that they weren't. Oh, yeah. Those were the decoys that
[3:25:28.820 --> 3:25:35.700]  distract. And for those that don't know, they admit that four Doomsday planes were over New York
[3:25:35.700 --> 3:25:41.700]  and D.C. and shadowing the attack drones. And then it's admitted it's the Doomsday Black Ops
[3:25:41.700 --> 3:25:46.740]  planes running the attack. The shadow government attacked us to then have the pretext to bring
[3:25:46.740 --> 3:25:52.820]  North come out, to bring out the army brigades, to bring in the federalization grid so the bankers
[3:25:52.820 --> 3:25:58.580]  could then take over the country, implode the economy and bring in world dictatorship. Excellent
[3:25:58.580 --> 3:26:03.460]  terror attack launched by the Pentagon. Well done. And you know, uh, that gentleman who was on the
[3:26:03.460 --> 3:26:07.140]  line before talking about American Airlines and United not losing a plane. Well, it is interesting
[3:26:07.140 --> 3:26:12.260]  if you actually sit down and listen to the Nora tapes instead of just, you know, relying on what
[3:26:12.260 --> 3:26:16.340]  the mainstream media and the liars told you at the 9-11 commission, we actually have a commissioner
[3:26:16.340 --> 3:26:19.860]  now writing a book saying everything that Nora had said was a lie. I think Philip Shannon is the
[3:26:19.860 --> 3:26:24.100]  one that did that, but we're almost out of time. No, 9-11. It's like they said, Burmese. Everything's
[3:26:24.100 --> 3:26:27.700]  fine. I just want to say they were chasing flight 11 for 40 minutes after hit the tower. It doesn't
[3:26:27.700 --> 3:26:31.780]  exist. Every government's fine. All right. This guy comes out, right? He was there the day off. He
[3:26:31.780 --> 3:26:36.820]  had restricted access. What does he say was his first red flag? Oh, well, it was really odd how
[3:26:36.820 --> 3:26:41.700]  FEMA already had their command centers set up the day before and they were on the scene. And then
[3:26:41.700 --> 3:26:47.060]  they got caught about that in testimony, then lied, and then later had to admit, okay, we were
[3:26:47.060 --> 3:26:52.020]  doing a drill for tripod to for terror attacks and anthrax attacks. We've moved the command center
[3:26:52.020 --> 3:26:56.580]  out of the CIA building seven to the end of the pier. So it turns out they lied. They were there
[3:26:56.580 --> 3:27:01.060]  beforehand, but that's fine. Again, no big deal. The government cares about you. Take the vaccines.
[3:27:01.060 --> 3:27:04.820]  You know, when this guy got a call, like, bring me some tap water. Four eyes. Good. I mean, no,
[3:27:04.820 --> 3:27:09.700]  it is a call magically after the first plane hit. And it's not even known that it's a terrorist
[3:27:09.700 --> 3:27:13.060]  attack. Just a small plane is at the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, this guy gets called
[3:27:13.060 --> 3:27:16.580]  and he thought to himself, well, why are they, why is FEMA getting involved in an accident?
[3:27:16.580 --> 3:27:21.620]  He got called before the second plane even hit the tower. Oh, come on. They're trying to find
[3:27:21.620 --> 3:27:29.140]  Alcada, Jason. Well, you know, we got to get rid of the Bill of Rights. Alcada. Alcada is going to
[3:27:29.140 --> 3:27:35.220]  hit us. You know, this guy goes into how he was in certain places in the building, such as one of
[3:27:35.220 --> 3:27:40.740]  the CIA command center. I just love America. And the documents are mysteriously gone. The safes
[3:27:40.740 --> 3:27:45.540]  aren't there. It looks like they might have moved some documentation out beforehand. And he's literally
[3:27:45.540 --> 3:27:51.300]  says he's got all this video that he can't even go and find all the anomalies himself. And he openly
[3:27:51.300 --> 3:27:56.020]  talks and alludes to not only the control demolition. Well, he should immediately just load
[3:27:56.020 --> 3:28:00.660]  it all to YouTube channels. Because he's saying they're after him. He's crazy. He doesn't put this
[3:28:00.660 --> 3:28:05.860]  out. Yeah, I hope he's that technologically savvy. Think being, you know, a videographer for FEMA
[3:28:05.860 --> 3:28:12.420]  under an official capacity. This is yet another FEMA whistleblower. We have all the firefighters
[3:28:12.420 --> 3:28:18.020]  and police and black boxes and bombs going off and firefighters going. It was molten metal like
[3:28:18.020 --> 3:28:23.780]  a swag heap. And I can cut an article out of New York Newsday from five days after the attacks
[3:28:23.780 --> 3:28:29.460]  where Peter Baker Sky, the head of FEMA in New York, cops to the fact that there are temperatures
[3:28:29.460 --> 3:28:35.620]  of 2,700 degrees at the world trade. We don't have to believe him. We have the NASA photos.
[3:28:35.620 --> 3:28:40.260]  Oh, I know. People tell me the NASA photos are doctored and those don't. Those are only heat
[3:28:40.260 --> 3:28:44.980]  surface temperatures. So they're not Northwoods isn't real. Yeah. It doesn't matter of ABC News
[3:28:44.980 --> 3:28:49.300]  and Baltimore Sun report. But tacky and Giuliani didn't go on television and before the commission.
[3:28:49.300 --> 3:28:53.860]  And the US government is, you know, there's not a 2004 Army manual how to stage terror attack.
[3:28:53.860 --> 3:28:57.700]  No, none of it exists, Alex. It's all, you know, unicorns and fairy tales, apparently.
[3:28:57.700 --> 3:29:06.020]  Well, all I know is Obama's balanced the budget and the CIA said today is not involved in Iran.
[3:29:06.020 --> 3:29:12.420]  And he says he's not hired one lobbyist. And he said he's not introduced any gun bills
[3:29:12.420 --> 3:29:15.620]  to restrict the Second Amendment. That matter of they're all public and are.
[3:29:15.620 --> 3:29:23.380]  I'm believing Obama and I'm believing 9 11 and I'm believing it all because I am patriotic.
[3:29:23.380 --> 3:29:27.380]  And I think this bill with the feds are federalizing all water to take over everything is
[3:29:27.380 --> 3:29:32.980]  good. And I think it's good that they're trying to add more than 15 new vaccines to forces to
[3:29:32.980 --> 3:29:39.780]  take every year. And again, I just trust the government and get out of here, Jason. All right,
[3:29:39.780 --> 3:29:44.420]  Jason Lee back tonight, nine to midnight. He is one sick person not agreeing with the government.
[3:29:44.420 --> 3:29:50.420]  Governments have never lied. They're the reason the sun shines and the grass grows. Remember,
[3:29:50.420 --> 3:29:58.180]  we're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.220 --> 3:30:05.860]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.860 --> 3:30:10.500]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:30:10.500 --> 3:30:15.780]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:30:15.780 --> 3:30:20.900]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:30:20.900 --> 3:30:25.780]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:30:25.780 --> 3:30:29.860]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[3:30:29.860 --> 3:30:34.020]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[3:30:34.020 --> 3:30:39.060]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[3:30:39.060 --> 3:30:43.540]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[3:30:43.540 --> 3:30:50.340]  science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[3:34:42.820 --> 3:34:48.020]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply

[3:34:52.500 --> 3:34:57.060]  for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold. There's
[3:34:57.060 --> 3:35:02.420]  a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling
[3:35:02.420 --> 3:35:08.900]  the food supply. Governments are storing seeds. The UN is storing seeds. Globalists of every
[3:35:08.900 --> 3:35:15.300]  strive are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle. Why do you think this is? You know why. Control
[3:35:15.300 --> 3:35:20.900]  and power. Solutions from science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist hands and into the
[3:35:20.900 --> 3:35:26.260]  hands of the people. One seed bank at a time, one family at a time. Survival Seed Bank from

[3:35:56.580 --> 3:36:01.780]  new t-shirts in here. Punch up on infowars.com for people. I really haven't announced this.
[3:36:02.420 --> 3:36:08.420]  We've got 20-something new shirts now. We're adding new shirts every week at infowars.com.
[3:36:08.980 --> 3:36:12.980]  And we're selling these at really low prices. And it also supports our operation. We're trying
[3:36:12.980 --> 3:36:18.580]  to expand around here. But these are come and take it shirts about the Second Amendment. You'll
[3:36:18.580 --> 3:36:27.860]  definitely win friends and make enemies with. And yellow, cold pepper flag. Don't tread on me

[3:36:34.020 --> 3:36:42.580]  toll-free 888-253-3139. There's the Evil Minuteman shirt, Evil Paul Revere on the front. Let them know
[3:36:42.580 --> 3:36:46.580]  we're not going to be cowed by them. They're trying to create a chilling effect so we won't stand up
[3:36:46.580 --> 3:36:50.820]  and be patriotic and let the folks know what real patriotism is. Real patriotism is not
[3:36:50.820 --> 3:36:55.460]  Federal Reserve ruling us, offshore banks ruling us, communist bureaucrats ruling us
[3:36:55.460 --> 3:37:00.500]  for the bankers, SWAT teams rating everybody, gun confiscation, secret lists where gun owners
[3:37:00.500 --> 3:37:06.260]  can't own guns. Freedom is private property, the Second Amendment, mom and apple pie, guns and ammo,
[3:37:06.260 --> 3:37:11.460]  and liberty and self-sufficiency in 1776. Freedom is not 1984.
[3:37:11.460 --> 3:37:18.500]  And so you got all these ridiculous t-shirts and trends and things out there and clothing lines
[3:37:18.500 --> 3:37:24.340]  that are in fake neocon stuff that's supposedly patriotic. We want to make these shirts, you
[3:37:24.340 --> 3:37:29.140]  know, a huge trend in buzz and it's actually taken off like a rocket, like a Saturn rocket to the moon,
[3:37:29.140 --> 3:37:34.420]  baby. So keep pushing it everybody. Wear your colors out there openly. They can't get us all
[3:37:34.420 --> 3:37:41.220]  infowars.com or 888-253-3139. I love that. Don't be a sucker infowars.com shirt on the
[3:37:41.220 --> 3:37:46.900]  back and on the front and it's got worst president ever with a picture of George W. Bush and then
[3:37:46.900 --> 3:37:52.580]  split face beside it of Barack Obama until now. That's great to wake up liberals and conservatives.
[3:37:52.580 --> 3:37:55.860]  They'll be, what's that mean? Obama supporters will be, well, you don't like Bush, but you don't
[3:37:55.860 --> 3:37:59.700]  like Obama and you can break their paradigm and conservatives will go, you don't like Obama,
[3:37:59.700 --> 3:38:03.620]  but you don't like Bush. Either explain to me and you can explain that it's all controlled.
[3:38:03.620 --> 3:38:08.020]  Attorney response team shirts are great. It's all available at infowars.com.
[3:38:08.020 --> 3:38:14.100]  Okay. And there's yours truly. We're in the attorney response team ball cap. Very handsome hat.
[3:38:15.780 --> 3:38:19.860]  I tell you though, people bow down to law enforcement so much that looks a little bit like
[3:38:19.860 --> 3:38:23.700]  a police raid shirt, but you know, it's turning response team yellow on blue.
[3:38:24.260 --> 3:38:27.060]  And let me tell you, when I walk in a restaurant or something, even if they don't even know who I
[3:38:27.060 --> 3:38:32.660]  am, it's like, oh, yes, sir. Oh, let me get your seat for you. Oh, drink here fast enough
[3:38:32.660 --> 3:38:36.660]  because they're so brain dead. They don't know it's a patriot shirt. They think you're a cop.
[3:38:36.660 --> 3:38:40.660]  And so I almost don't even wear this shirt out in public because I don't have people
[3:38:40.660 --> 3:38:45.300]  groveling to me, but certainly when you go to like protests and stuff, the cops see it and go,
[3:38:46.420 --> 3:38:50.740]  because everything is about coloring. Just like there'll be a beetle that has like the
[3:38:50.740 --> 3:38:54.500]  two eyes on its back. It's not really eyes, but it looks like eyes. Then birds are scared
[3:38:54.500 --> 3:38:59.300]  to eat it because it looks like big eyes, you know, or butterflies. That's why butterflies,
[3:38:59.300 --> 3:39:03.940]  it looks like two eyes. That's to scare birds because birds see eyes that are that big. That's
[3:39:03.940 --> 3:39:08.660]  a big animal. So a bird that this big isn't going to attack something that's got eyes that are this
[3:39:08.660 --> 3:39:12.740]  big because an animal that's got eyes that big would be about this big. See, those are the
[3:39:12.740 --> 3:39:17.300]  tricks of nature. We'll see if the same thing, cops see something in yellow and blue. They kind
[3:39:17.300 --> 3:39:21.700]  of go, it's one of us. It's a God. And then they go, what's tyranny response team? What is that?
[3:39:21.700 --> 3:39:26.740]  Are you a God? Because you've got the coloration because everything's been dumbed down to that.
[3:39:26.740 --> 3:39:30.740]  I didn't realize what these tyranny response team shirts with the info wars.com would do.
[3:39:30.740 --> 3:39:36.100]  But they certainly shake everybody up. They're like, is that a God? And they actually think like
[3:39:36.100 --> 3:39:40.980]  Zeus is walking upon the earth and you're wearing God colors and some cops will say, you're allowed
[3:39:40.980 --> 3:39:46.180]  to wear that. That's a God shirt. They have the same thing in England. Ancient England, you couldn't
[3:39:46.180 --> 3:39:51.300]  wear the color purple or red. Those were royal colors. You're almost wearing a royal color.
[3:39:51.300 --> 3:39:55.620]  And it doesn't get very upsetting. The police are like, he's wearing God color. You're allowed to
[3:39:55.620 --> 3:40:00.580]  wear yellow and blue. We're all we're God level too. Now, you know, you can wear costumes. We can
[3:40:00.580 --> 3:40:05.620]  wear costumes. That's what headdresses and crowns are about. Oh, it's the queen. That's what the
[3:40:05.620 --> 3:40:11.060]  police uniforms are about. We're better than you. Well, we can wear God uniforms too. See, it really
[3:40:11.060 --> 3:40:17.140]  shakes them up. Who's you understand what I'm saying here? Good, good, good. Make sure just
[3:40:17.140 --> 3:40:23.380]  who's sometimes just kind of going, huh? Oh my God, ladies and gentlemen, I've had too much
[3:40:23.380 --> 3:40:28.580]  coffee today. Most days are like two cups. Sundays are like three or four and they brought a big
[3:40:28.580 --> 3:40:35.380]  thing of Starbucks in the day for some reason. And Starbucks is shouldn't be legal. I'll tell you
[3:40:35.380 --> 3:40:40.580]  that right now. All right, I'm going to shut up. Julio in Illinois, you are on the air, sir. Welcome.
[3:40:42.260 --> 3:40:47.300]  Alex, thank you very much. Thank you for what you've been doing for the American people waking
[3:40:47.300 --> 3:40:53.380]  me up and waking everybody up about these horrible people that are the real criminals
[3:40:53.380 --> 3:40:56.660]  in this country. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you, sir. What's on your mind today?
[3:40:58.100 --> 3:41:04.100]  The media. I'm a junior at Western Illinois University. I'm broadcasting major. Thank God I
[3:41:04.100 --> 3:41:10.740]  want to be a sports broadcaster and not a lying journalist like I see on TV nowadays like Glenn
[3:41:10.740 --> 3:41:16.740]  Beck and all these people on MSNBC, Chris Matthews and all these people. What is, what can like
[3:41:16.740 --> 3:41:22.740]  future journalists like myself, gorilla news people, as you mentioned, can do to ask tough
[3:41:22.740 --> 3:41:28.420]  questions? What do you think we can do? And I recall a YouTube video, an interview you had
[3:41:28.420 --> 3:41:34.500]  with some guy who was going to do a website about putting up in videos. Can you give us an update
[3:41:34.500 --> 3:41:38.660]  about that? Well, yeah, Darrell Rundus is going to create another free search people to upload
[3:41:38.660 --> 3:41:42.820]  their videos to. I think you do it news or something. I forget the exact name. We'll have
[3:41:42.820 --> 3:41:47.140]  it back on when it launches. But if I was you, I wouldn't wait. Do your sports broadcasting.
[3:41:47.140 --> 3:41:53.220]  That's fine. But on the side, even with a pseudonym, you know, a pen name, have your own
[3:41:53.220 --> 3:41:58.740]  blog and just do a little blurb every day photo. People start linking to it to have your own analysis.
[3:41:59.460 --> 3:42:03.140]  All of us start speaking, not just repeating what the mainstream media says by there being
[3:42:03.140 --> 3:42:08.340]  more voices. That creates the real diversity of ideas and thought, not the fake diversity of what
[3:42:08.340 --> 3:42:12.900]  the new orders is. You know, their diversity is believing what they say. It's not real diversity
[3:42:12.900 --> 3:42:20.260]  of ideas and thought and renaissance. So there's that going on. There's legal AM transmitters
[3:42:20.260 --> 3:42:25.780]  that with the right antenna, even on an apartment, I'll go out two, three, four miles, start running
[3:42:25.780 --> 3:42:30.020]  Internet radio over that. So the audience is there and then do a one hour show whenever you
[3:42:30.020 --> 3:42:34.260]  feel like it. You're in rush hour. You might have 50 listeners wouldn't use to stop in front of an
[3:42:34.260 --> 3:42:39.860]  audience of 50 people and give a speech. So micro FM, calling to talk radio,
[3:42:40.820 --> 3:42:44.900]  the best way to break into radio. I didn't have to do this, but a lot of people I know have
[3:42:44.900 --> 3:42:49.940]  listened to me and done it. You go buy an hour on a local AM or FM station. Just say I want to
[3:42:49.940 --> 3:42:53.940]  cover the news from a libertarian perspective, kind of use that term. So it sounds somewhat
[3:42:53.940 --> 3:42:58.900]  mainstream, but not too radical. Get on, pay for it at first, 50 bucks, 100 bucks an hour,
[3:42:58.900 --> 3:43:05.620]  whatever it is, get a few sponsors, even if it's tiny to pay for it and plug your news blog.
[3:43:05.620 --> 3:43:09.300]  And then there are literally hundreds of people that I know now that have radio shows around
[3:43:09.300 --> 3:43:16.420]  the country who just did my idea. Very simple. I mean, just do something. Don't wait. I mean,
[3:43:16.420 --> 3:43:20.980]  believe me, they may want you to have that degree to have some credentials to do sports broadcasting.
[3:43:21.860 --> 3:43:25.540]  The biggest thing you're going to do to break into sports broadcastings with local stations,
[3:43:25.540 --> 3:43:30.820]  just have a good attitude, be there, you know, hang out with the people that are on it,
[3:43:30.820 --> 3:43:36.100]  try to become a sidekick on the shows. That's how you get on radio. Not, there's always three or
[3:43:36.100 --> 3:43:40.660]  four guys in any radio office who've got all these degrees, but are timid and, you know, they're
[3:43:41.700 --> 3:43:46.660]  going to be taking the garbage out. So you just got to get on the air, do it, do it, do it.
[3:43:47.620 --> 3:43:55.380]  Also writing news copy, create a site where at first you just have commentary on sports and then
[3:43:55.380 --> 3:44:00.260]  interject some of your political stuff on the blog. Like have a section on the blog that has that.
[3:44:00.260 --> 3:44:02.100]  A lot of different ways to do it. Anything else, Elia?
[3:44:02.980 --> 3:44:11.300]  One more thing about these Bilderberg group. How can these guys literally think they can get away
[3:44:11.300 --> 3:44:15.620]  with all these crimes that they're doing? How come you don't see lawyers out there?
[3:44:15.620 --> 3:44:20.100]  Well, they've gotten away with so much before because power gets away with power until people
[3:44:20.100 --> 3:44:23.700]  finally fight it. I got to jump. Appreciate your call, Elia. Talk to you for hours. I
[3:44:23.700 --> 3:44:28.340]  could get to others. Unie, I believe I'm pronouncing that in New York. You're on the air.
[3:44:29.220 --> 3:44:34.180]  What's going on, Alex? How you doing, sir? Good. I had a question because I haven't been
[3:44:34.180 --> 3:44:40.260]  watching your show for too long, but just to be brief, I've been incarcerated before in New York,
[3:44:40.260 --> 3:44:45.540]  right? And I hear, you know, I know this is a Patriot show, but I wanted to ask you like,
[3:44:45.540 --> 3:44:50.100]  because I've seen the show that you had did with Amy Allen when, you know, you,
[3:44:50.100 --> 3:44:53.540]  the guys you were talking about, some guys that beat her up or something. Yes.
[3:44:54.260 --> 3:44:59.380]  Um, where the question I wanted to know was like, if I deal with, you know, like the hood,
[3:44:59.380 --> 3:45:03.300]  and you know, actually your name is big in my neighborhood and a lot of places in Brooklyn
[3:45:03.300 --> 3:45:11.460]  and everywhere else. But anyway, where do the gang bangers, the felons and the so on people trying
[3:45:11.460 --> 3:45:16.980]  to correct the mistakes that they've made fit into this whole picture? Well, are they just like
[3:45:16.980 --> 3:45:25.380]  the bad guys are? No, no, absolutely not. I mean, people when they're young, that that's why until
[3:45:25.380 --> 3:45:31.060]  you're 17, 18 previously, that was sealed because there's a lot of founding fathers and famous people
[3:45:31.060 --> 3:45:37.540]  that stole watermelons or beat up the neighbor or got caught running moonshine in the old days.
[3:45:38.180 --> 3:45:43.140]  And so that's why when you're young, you do stupid stuff. I mean, I was never a criminal, but
[3:45:43.140 --> 3:45:48.100]  I stole beer a few times out of golf carts. And, you know, uh, I didn't really start fights, but
[3:45:48.100 --> 3:45:52.660]  I probably went overboard a few times for people in the hospital. And so all of that got sealed.
[3:45:52.660 --> 3:45:56.340]  It's no secret. I never got in trouble for stealing beer a few times. I'm just telling
[3:45:56.340 --> 3:46:00.580]  that publicly. So none of us are perfect nowadays. You get caught stealing beer, you go away for,
[3:46:00.580 --> 3:46:04.660]  you know, 10 years and, you know, they call you al-Qaeda and they're now trying to upload the
[3:46:04.660 --> 3:46:09.300]  juvenile records so people don't have any rights. Uh, but, uh, you know, none of us are perfect.
[3:46:09.300 --> 3:46:14.340]  Uh, you know, a lot of times you're with friends with BB guns walking down the railroad track
[3:46:14.340 --> 3:46:18.020]  and your friends start shooting people's cars with the BB guns. And for, you know,
[3:46:18.020 --> 3:46:22.420]  what the cops pull up, you barely get away. You know, I wasn't out shooting people's cars
[3:46:22.420 --> 3:46:26.500]  with BB guns, but I was with kids doing it. And that's why the number one parents need to keep
[3:46:26.500 --> 3:46:31.700]  their kids away from other bad kids and explain to your kids, look, you start seeing other kids
[3:46:31.700 --> 3:46:35.620]  doing something wrong. It's going to ruin your life. Just leave. So what if your friends are
[3:46:35.620 --> 3:46:40.020]  there and they're not going to call you a wimp? You say, I'm going home. Uh, but no, you're not
[3:46:40.020 --> 3:46:45.220]  bad. The government ships the drugs in hoping you'll see all the bling, hoping you'll get caught
[3:46:45.220 --> 3:46:48.900]  selling them for them. So they can put you in their private prison that's bought and paid for
[3:46:48.900 --> 3:46:53.140]  with laundered drug money. So they make money at every level of the scam. That's why these guys
[3:46:53.140 --> 3:47:00.340]  are master crooks, master architects of corruption. So, uh, no, no, I don't pass judgment on anybody,
[3:47:00.340 --> 3:47:05.860]  sir. I mean, you know, I've, uh, I've done plenty of bad things myself. I mean, I, I thought I was
[3:47:05.860 --> 3:47:10.740]  a tough guy when I was a teenager that I'd put a few people in the hospital where they could never
[3:47:10.740 --> 3:47:14.660]  think straight again. That isn't something I'm proud of. Now, even if they started the, you know,
[3:47:15.700 --> 3:47:19.860]  we all growth, that's why they want 18 year olds for the military because they're young, dumb and
[3:47:19.860 --> 3:47:26.180]  full of, you know what? And that's why we got to protect our youth and just hope they survive
[3:47:26.180 --> 3:47:32.180]  long enough to get wisdom. And so no, I'm not in, in, in judgment here. Okay. And cause I was,
[3:47:32.180 --> 3:47:36.340]  I, cause I was, I was locked up with a guy, a lot of rough guys, but you start seeing that
[3:47:36.340 --> 3:47:41.300]  they just made bad mistakes. And then I can't tell, like, cause I heard the guy earlier on your show
[3:47:41.300 --> 3:47:46.740]  with the bike, with the bike, um, the motorcycle gang thing. And you know, I look at it cause it's,
[3:47:46.740 --> 3:47:50.820]  it's all relative, you know, like, I know some, some, some, some dudes that's involved with gangs,
[3:47:50.820 --> 3:47:56.420]  they good people, but I don't know how to comment them because if, if I'm saying, well, if you got
[3:47:56.420 --> 3:48:02.740]  locked up for a gun possession or whatever, you'll never get a gun anyway. They deserve to have guns.
[3:48:02.740 --> 3:48:07.620]  It, it's a, it's a criminal system where they set up the society in Chicago and New York,
[3:48:07.620 --> 3:48:12.020]  run by criminals, the higher ups get the lower levels to do their work form. Then they take
[3:48:12.020 --> 3:48:17.540]  your second amendment away, but the whole, no, no, no, it's all ridiculous. Look, I don't care
[3:48:17.540 --> 3:48:22.260]  if somebody's been caught with a gun. That's the government being criminal, making normal behavior
[3:48:22.260 --> 3:48:27.060]  criminal. Okay. Who I want is Donald Rumsfeld who said the government's allowed to run child
[3:48:27.060 --> 3:48:31.540]  kidnapping rings and Dinecore can do it and nothing's going to be done. Those are the real
[3:48:31.540 --> 3:48:36.980]  criminals, the masterminds. Look, I appreciate your call. I got to start getting to this now or I
[3:48:36.980 --> 3:48:41.780]  never will, but we're going to go to Garrett and Cody and Shamer if we have time, but I got to
[3:48:41.780 --> 3:48:50.180]  play this. Now this is Glenn Beck doing his fake crying for, uh, Esquire or is it GQ? I forget
[3:48:50.180 --> 3:48:55.700]  the GQ or Esquire point is they shot video of it. He knew they were shooting it of him doing fake
[3:48:55.700 --> 3:49:01.060]  crying. Now he does the exact same fake crying almost every night when he says, I love America.
[3:49:01.060 --> 3:49:05.060]  We've got to arrest the nine, 11 truthers that they were there with al Qaeda. And he goes,
[3:49:05.860 --> 3:49:11.300]  so I just wanted to show you this because it's fake and everything. And he knows he's in the
[3:49:11.300 --> 3:49:15.700]  cover of magazines known for crying and his fakeness. He's meant to make conservatives and
[3:49:15.700 --> 3:49:22.580]  libertarians look bad at the same time. Here he is making himself cry, but then he's also meant
[3:49:22.580 --> 3:49:26.660]  to sucker in a lot of conservatives and people to believe he's good. So he can then stab him in
[3:49:26.660 --> 3:49:29.780]  the back and say the FEMA camps aren't real. Go ahead and fade the audio up on this.
[3:49:31.140 --> 3:49:35.620]  Instant sadness. Now here he is posing for the cover of a magazine as if he's crying.
[3:49:35.620 --> 3:49:45.380]  Yeah, it was GQ. I got the two mixed up. Now when he's on his show,
[3:49:46.020 --> 3:49:58.100]  he's laughing at his viewers staging the crime. Okay, so there is being faked there. It's all
[3:49:58.100 --> 3:50:01.940]  a big joke to him that he's conning everybody getting 50 million bucks. Now let's go ahead and go
[3:50:01.940 --> 3:50:06.420]  to the other video. And I'm going after this guy because he's a complete phony. I mean,
[3:50:06.420 --> 3:50:10.500]  even with a new order and attacking us, that's fine. Just admit who you are. Him saying he's
[3:50:10.500 --> 3:50:14.580]  with us. Now, now, now, now this is him on Fox. Go right to the part where he's going,
[3:50:14.580 --> 3:50:20.260]  I just love America. I'm sad. And he's not really crying. It's fake. Here it is. And we don't have
[3:50:20.260 --> 3:50:29.140]  it yet. Here it is because all day I've been wanting to play this. Here we go. We'll just come
[3:50:29.140 --> 3:50:33.700]  back after the break and play it because that's not the part there. Can we get two computers in
[3:50:33.700 --> 3:50:37.380]  there so we can switch back and forth? Because I know we got the worst internet in America in
[3:50:37.380 --> 3:50:44.580]  this office. When we come back, we'll try to play for it. We'll see if we can. All right. It's not
[3:50:44.580 --> 3:50:49.460]  my IT people's fault either. The place we chose said they had cable modems and everything. They
[3:50:49.460 --> 3:50:57.380]  don't. So all we have is T1s. And I guess T1s are like today's dial up or something. All right,
[3:50:57.380 --> 3:51:04.260]  I'm Alex Jones. Final segment right ahead. Stay with us. More than 700 chemicals have been found
[3:51:04.260 --> 3:51:08.180]  in our drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[3:51:08.180 --> 3:51:12.820]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled
[3:51:12.820 --> 3:51:18.100]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works
[3:51:18.100 --> 3:51:23.380]  with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron. And it
[3:51:23.380 --> 3:51:29.460]  inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically
[3:51:29.460 --> 3:51:34.660]  lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment
[3:51:34.660 --> 3:51:39.700]  facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you?
[3:51:39.700 --> 3:51:45.940]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[3:51:45.940 --> 3:51:55.300]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653. That's 1-877-886-3653. Or order
[3:51:55.300 --> 3:52:00.980]  online by visiting us at Directive21.com. That's Directive, the number 21.com now.
[3:52:02.100 --> 3:52:07.540]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.180 --> 3:52:13.060]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:13.060 --> 3:52:18.980]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[3:52:18.980 --> 3:52:24.180]  interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in
[3:52:24.180 --> 3:52:29.220]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:52:29.220 --> 3:52:36.020]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:36.020 --> 3:52:43.060]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[3:52:43.060 --> 3:52:50.500]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception
[3:52:50.500 --> 3:52:58.420]  today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception.
[3:52:58.420 --> 3:53:05.140]  The people strike back. Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies
[3:53:05.140 --> 3:53:10.420]  from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid. Even as energy experts are reporting
[3:53:10.420 --> 3:53:14.580]  that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid,
[3:53:14.580 --> 3:53:19.700]  some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge,
[3:53:19.700 --> 3:53:24.740]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[3:53:24.740 --> 3:53:30.100]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts?
[3:53:30.100 --> 3:53:34.420]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own
[3:53:34.420 --> 3:53:39.620]  private supply of electrical power? If so, this will be the most important information you have
[3:53:39.620 --> 3:53:45.140]  ever heard. Solar power generators are finally available. They have no moving parts to wear out
[3:53:45.140 --> 3:53:51.540]  or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[3:53:51.540 --> 3:54:04.900]  so go to mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Check out mysolarbackup.com before you lose your power.
[3:54:04.900 --> 3:54:09.780]  I love doing this radio show. I make a lot of mistakes. I'm not perfect, but at least I'm
[3:54:09.780 --> 3:54:14.900]  for real and I'm fighting tyranny and I get to get to know all you people. So I salute all of you
[3:54:14.900 --> 3:54:22.260]  out there that love freedom. Crank it up, baby!
[3:54:22.260 --> 3:54:49.060]  Absolutely. Man, there's all this news, but I want to take a few final phone calls too.
[3:54:49.060 --> 3:54:54.740]  Son of Shaw says protesters defeat and lead to nuclear war. He definitely wants a coup.
[3:54:54.740 --> 3:54:59.060]  Vaccinate Canadians under 40, natives first. They say Canada is preparing to forcibly
[3:54:59.060 --> 3:55:04.980]  inoculate the entire population. That's out of the national post. Mainstream news is admitting
[3:55:04.980 --> 3:55:09.380]  that polar bears can swim and their numbers are actually up. It's all lies. Here's the media shows
[3:55:09.380 --> 3:55:15.620]  these photos and says, look, it's drowning when they hunt out on the ice floes. But finishing up
[3:55:15.620 --> 3:55:19.780]  with Glenn Beck. Okay, we have the clips now. I showed you footage of him putting stuff in his
[3:55:19.780 --> 3:55:26.100]  eyes to fake cry, but that's for a photo shoot. But it's the same stuff over the top on TV.
[3:55:26.660 --> 3:55:31.940]  I just love America. We got to arrest the people that 9-11 truth. They're like, oh god, I'm scared.
[3:55:33.300 --> 3:55:38.180]  How do we have a CIA operative on? What do we do about these Americans? Man, they're free speech.
[3:55:38.180 --> 3:55:43.060]  I agree. It's how we defend America. I'm Glenn Beck. And he's meant to make all
[3:55:43.060 --> 3:55:46.820]  conservatives libertarians look stupid. He's meant to discredit anti-New World Order
[3:55:46.820 --> 3:55:51.140]  to the liberals while at the same time telling the right wing, oh, I'm going to look into the
[3:55:51.140 --> 3:55:55.380]  camps. I think they're real. And then, oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I promise. I just want to tell you the
[3:55:55.380 --> 3:56:01.140]  truth. They're not real. It's all lies. The government cares. Now they are building some
[3:56:01.140 --> 3:56:06.820]  for emergencies, but those are good. I'm your friend and he does it. It's like a sick joke on
[3:56:06.820 --> 3:56:11.140]  everyone. It's some kind of sigh out, folks. Go ahead and cut to him. This is him doing fake
[3:56:11.140 --> 3:56:17.060]  crying on TV. Here it is. Have gathers. We're even going to join some people in the hills of
[3:56:17.060 --> 3:56:22.340]  Hollywood, California. Yes, believe it or not, my producer stew. No matter where you are right
[3:56:22.340 --> 3:56:28.980]  now, the message is clear. You are not alone. I'm going to show you how an idea that started
[3:56:28.980 --> 3:56:33.940]  with a single phone call on my radio show has grown into something that millions are now participating
[3:56:33.940 --> 3:56:38.420]  in. But the show isn't about me. It's not about the president. It's not about parties or politics
[3:56:38.420 --> 3:56:44.420]  or anything else. It is about proving that the real power to change America's core still resides
[3:56:44.420 --> 3:56:57.860]  with you. You are the secret. You're the answer. Oh, sorry. I just love my country and I fear for it.
[3:56:57.860 --> 3:57:05.140]  It seems
[3:57:08.100 --> 3:57:13.700]  like the voices of our leaders and special interests. That's enough. Yeah, like Fox News
[3:57:13.700 --> 3:57:17.140]  special interests telling us all global warming is real. You mean those bastards? The Wall Street
[3:57:17.140 --> 3:57:20.980]  Journal telling us it's all real. They got a Kim trellis to keep us safe. You mean this?
[3:57:21.940 --> 3:57:25.380]  We're out of time for calls for those that are holding Garrett, Cody and
[3:57:25.380 --> 3:57:29.780]  Shammer. You can call back tomorrow. I'd love to hear from you. Go back. Let's go out, though,
[3:57:29.780 --> 3:57:34.180]  with the video of him admittedly fake crying. It's the exact same thing. This CIA operative,
[3:57:34.180 --> 3:57:40.660]  it's all a big joke to him that they get off on the fact that you're gullible. Stop being gullible.
[3:57:40.660 --> 3:57:45.380]  You know what you do. You know you're good. You know you're pro-liberty, anti-New World Order.
[3:57:45.380 --> 3:57:50.020]  You activate, you take action. I don't care if it's a newsletter to 10 of your neighbors that you
[3:57:50.020 --> 3:57:53.940]  write up a few articles you think is important every month. Hey, Bob, got a newsletter I'm doing.
[3:57:53.940 --> 3:57:58.020]  I want to give it to you. Tell me what you think of it. Oh, look, there he is. Oh,
[3:58:00.500 --> 3:58:07.060]  practicing crying for his slaves. He's here to Judas Goat, the resistance to the New World Order
[3:58:07.060 --> 3:58:13.780]  and slit our throats, get our confidence and then discredit us. Oh, it's sad sometimes.
[3:58:13.780 --> 3:58:18.180]  Great job, crew. Great job, everybody at Genesis. Great job, AM&M affiliate, global shortwave,
[3:58:18.180 --> 3:58:22.660]  internet, satellite, everybody. Keep spreading the word about the show. The real resistance,

[3:58:49.060 --> 3:58:55.060]  Hang on. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important
[3:58:55.060 --> 3:58:59.060]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent
[3:58:59.060 --> 3:59:03.860]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line or you have your own bread.
[3:59:03.860 --> 3:59:08.020]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family. In any
[3:59:08.020 --> 3:59:12.500]  emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[3:59:12.500 --> 3:59:17.540]  but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift durable food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:17.540 --> 3:59:22.260]  salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last
[3:59:22.260 --> 3:59:30.100]  year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit eFoodsDirect.com
