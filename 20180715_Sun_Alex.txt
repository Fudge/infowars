[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Okay, last time, this is cell phone radiation.
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  This is your brain on cell phone and wireless radiation.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Any questions?
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  This message is brought to you by MFullWars.com
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.000]  in the hopes that if you're going to fry your brain and body with radiation,
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  that's your business.
[00:16.000 --> 00:42.000]  For God's sake, let's protect our children.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday,
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[00:55.000 --> 00:56.000]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  Okay, let's jump right into the giant field of information that we have to go over.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  Number one, as I've been telling you for two years,
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  the Democratic Party Plan announced by Hillary just months before she lost to Donald Trump
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  was to demonize MFullWars, misrepresent what we've said,
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  because we are seen as the tip of the spear of Americana and its re-emergence,
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  then use that demonization to label all other conservatives, libertarians,
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  nationalists, Christians, you name it,
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  and deplatform everyone from Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it,
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  which are about 80% of the worldwide web traffic.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  CNN announced on Thursday that they had met with other so-called media companies
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  and other so-called journalists and professors of journalism,
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  and we're asking Facebook why we weren't completely banned.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  And I'm going to go over all these quotes coming up.
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  Facebook then said, look, we already restrict 80% of conservatives' posts.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  That's the number I told you previously, because we can actually see it on the graph.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  It's not just me, it's everybody.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  Diamonds and silk, it's 97%, because they're so lovable,
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  they're so funny, and they're not negative.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  They're even more effective than I am, so they're 97% banned.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  They had congressional hearings two months ago on it.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  So you've got CNN, The Kings of Fake Media,
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  kicking all this off Thursday, covering it,
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  and then you had the Washington Post, The New York Times, New Yorker Magazine,
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  all of them weigh in and say, yes, totally banned anyone that is a conspiracy terrorist.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  That's anyone that says they're liars.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  You know, like we said, that they'd give them the debate questions at CNN to Hillary beforehand.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  Of course, it came out in WikiLeaks, but you can see she'd been given them beforehand.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  It was all studied and ready, and she instantly answered with a canned prepared statement.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  You can see when something's rigged.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  Mama didn't raise a fool, just like I told you, some of her town halls were fake.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  I know 80 millimeter when I see it.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  I know fake when I see it.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  You know a Hollywood movie because of the production quality.
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  It's so real, it isn't real.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  Months later, it came out.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  Indeed, it was totally fake with hired actors.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  So they're mad that we're covering this.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  So they misrepresent and say that I said nobody died at Parkland.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  That's what they listen to these articles.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  That's fake news.
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  No video of that.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  They say I say there's Martian colonies.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  No video of that.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  And then they say, we got to deplatform him.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  Well, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted out and said, really, CNN is supposedly the policeman that's going to run all this.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  Seriously, if someone is going to lead the charge against fake news, shouldn't they be a lot more credible than CNN?
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  Then they said Donald Trump Jr. endorsed info wars.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  More deception by CNN.
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  When all he did was say you shouldn't be the arbiter and list what is news or what is it news?
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  Because again, even Facebook said, look, one person's fake news is somebody else's news.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  The media is in a war.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  The liberals put out fake news.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  Conservatives put out fake news.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  But then they added, but don't worry.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  Info wars post are dialed back 80%.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  They went on to say, really, actually, it's more than that.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  Only if you go to the page, do you see it?
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  We don't let people share it.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  And if they do, we penalize them, which is social engineering.
[04:23.000 --> 04:31.000]  So the censorship here and the smarter corrupt tech giants like Google and Facebook are in the news saying, shut up.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  This is racketeering we're involved in.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  We are displacing and quieting an entire section of a country.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  And we're using Alex Jones as the case point.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  He's already been shut down on our platforms.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  You idiots actually say it.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  You're going to make him a martyr and get Trump to do antitrust.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Shut up, CNN.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  Shut up, Washington Post.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Shut up, CNN.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  You foaming at the mouth anti-free speech so-called journalist.
[04:56.000 --> 05:25.000]  We're going to screw up our takeover.
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[05:36.000 --> 05:43.000]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:24.000 --> 06:44.000]  It was Hunter S. Thompson who invented Gonzo Journalist where you make the story about yourself.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  I mean, others had done it, but he coined the term Gonzo Journalism where you go and create the story yourself.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  That is not what M. Full Wars is doing.
[06:51.000 --> 07:00.000]  I have a raft of incredible, world-shaking news, extremely exciting, extremely informative, extremely important.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  And I'll get to all of it.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  But if this was happening to anybody else, it would be my top story.
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  In fact, I am quite frankly pinching myself thinking maybe this is virtual reality, like Total Recall.
[07:16.000 --> 07:25.000]  And I'm just playing some video game where I'm the hero fighting the evil, eugenicist, globalist who are trying to censor everybody and poisoning the water with fluoride.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  But then it's all real and it's really happening.
[07:28.000 --> 07:41.000]  I have to pinch myself when I spent two hours this morning doing different searches on Google, Alex Jones, CNN, M. Full Wars, CNN, M. Full Wars Congress,
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  M. Full Wars platform banning, M. Full Wars censored.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  And each time I click it, it'd be 4,000 articles, 2,000 articles, 400 articles.
[07:49.000 --> 07:58.000]  There are thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands
[07:58.000 --> 08:12.000]  of articles just in the last week saying ban M. Full Wars and take it off the air, ban it on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, sue it out of existence, shut it down.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  But that's not why this is important.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  This is a PR ad campaign to end the First Amendment.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  They're having hearings on it Tuesday in Congress.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  We're going to tell you the committee and the rest of it.
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  But when I, the last five or six days since they've been doing this, when I read hundreds of the articles, Document Cam shot police for TV viewers.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  This is just from the last three days here, like 60 of them.
[08:35.000 --> 08:46.000]  They admit in every article, going to Facebook and Google conferences, the New York Times, the New York Post, the Washington Post, the LA Times.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  They all go, we all agree Alex Jones and other conservatives need to be banned.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  If they question anything we do, we call them conspiracy theorists or racists and they're banned.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  But they said if we're too obvious about banning Jones, there could be antitrust suits.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  Trump may do something.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  People were dumb as they talked to each other in the newspapers, like they're only talking to themselves.
[09:08.000 --> 09:19.000]  And they say, look, Google and Facebook are already censoring conservatives 80% dialing them back.
[09:19.000 --> 09:26.000]  Some 97% like diamonds and silk because they're so sweet and articulate and are positive with everybody.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  They're just too sweet little ladies.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  So they're 97% banned.
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.000]  Hearings two months ago admitted it, 97% dialed back to entertaining smart, funny black ladies.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  Talk about how they like free market America.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  That's evil. That's bad.
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  And they had Congressman Hank Johnson, the guy that says, islands float.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  I'm not joking.
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  Saying shame on you, shame on you, making a lot of money on Facebook.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  They were made any money.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  We build Facebook, we build YouTube.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  They say it's this open platform, then they censor people.
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  And for years, they then deny it.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  Oh, we're not shadow banning.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  We're not blocking you.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  We're not.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  And then you get undercover veritas videos of YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter with all of their executives.
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  They have them all on video going, our main enemies, veterans and gun owners, anybody with an American flag on their site.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  We just, we just shadow ban them.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  And they think they're talking to people on Facebook and Twitter, but they can't share it to anybody.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  So they think they're all alone and they get really depressed.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  Call fraud against a whole class of people censoring and controlling what they can say and do over the modern telephone.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  They say landlines are totally going out.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  People do use Facebook and Twitter.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  They do use private messages and they're in there reading all that.
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  So they have draconian Chinese communist style censorship coming in.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  Communist China now has taken control of Apple.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  They've officially moved their interstate run and now let the government run their systems.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  They're iCloud computing their key codes.
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  They have the keys to the kingdom.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  And notice last week you couldn't send Taiwanese emojis of the Taiwanese flag.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  Your phone would crash anywhere in the world.
[11:06.000 --> 11:16.000]  If you were in the U.S. or in Germany or in Russia or in Japan or in China or in Taiwan or in Hong Kong or in Durban, South Africa, your phone would crash.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  And they said, oh yeah, the government said do that.
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  We did it.
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  So see if they can control the emoji you can send, they could ban anybody's voice print.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  They could ban anybody's image.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Whatever they want with algorithms, they can ban it.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  Think of the control Hitler would have had with this.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  So I've got literally 60 articles.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  I counted them here.
[11:38.000 --> 11:47.000]  Just the ones I had time to read the last few days where in every article they admit that they've already banned info wars off their platforms.
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  They're just angry.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  We're on close to 300 radio stations.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  400 TV stations and 80 plus cable stations.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  So they know Congress is listening.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  The military is listening.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  The police are listening.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  And the Streisand effect has happened where they've been trying to suppress us.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  And so it's made it even more popular.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  So yeah, we don't get shared on Facebook, YouTube or Twitter like we did before.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  And other people have been socially conditioned to other conservatives to not be hardcore unless they don't get censored.
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  But they're still getting censored.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  They give in to the scam.
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  The Pavlovian conditioning of we give you a piece of meat if you're a good little globalist.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  We shock you if you're bad.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  It's operant conditioning.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  And they admit it.
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  But see, here's their problem.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  Google, Facebook and Twitter are all saying to CNN and the Washington Post.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  I have the articles right here.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  They're saying, stop it.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  We've already strangled them idiots.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  They already can't share.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  We don't even let Christians share ministry information.
[12:46.000 --> 12:55.000]  There's an article in World Net Daily where a Christian group, you said a song about Jesus and it was banned because they said that, you know, that's politically incorrect and is political.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  So, so it's happening to everybody ahead of the midterms.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  That's the plan.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  And Europe already has massive censorship.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  China already has it.
[13:06.000 --> 13:15.000]  And we're adopting a global social credit score tied into everything you do where basically the public can vote on you.
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  Like Yelp and so can governments, corporations where you can't even have a job or travel or live.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  China's already done this to 12 million people.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  If you don't submit and play ball.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  Is this a political ad?
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  Facebook thinks so.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  Another thing is that they've banned political advertising, but not for Democrats.
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  For Christians, for conservatives, for pro-life, for members of Congress that are women who are conservative, they just banned them.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  They're calling for Trump to be banned.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  They block almost all of his push notifications.
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.000]  When he sends out a tweet, you've got to go to his page to get it and retweet it.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  And the president is even aware of this when it's admitted.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  So we're writing a detailed report showing the executive saying it.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  Every paragraph that we claim will have a link to them saying it tomorrow.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  A 37-page report is being compiled by Mike Adams, who's an incredible researcher, computer programmer.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  You name it.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  Paul Watson's doing one in the morning.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  And these reports will be sent to Congress.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  They will be sent to the president.
[14:20.000 --> 14:34.000]  And they will detail, not in our words, but in their words specifically how they've already muzzled nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, how they cut back the president's reach on the internet 90%.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  And how it's still not working for them because people have broken with the mainstream media and with the big corporate outfits.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  But here it is.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  Tech crunch.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  Facebook would make a martyr by banning info wars.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  And it goes on to say, Jones is already quarantined like the disease he is.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  Don't you understand?
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  It opens up antitrust suits and discrimination.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  And Congress will move if they know.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Go read it.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  They think Congress is so dumb that they are in all these articles going CNN, shut up.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  We're already censoring Jones.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  And it hasn't worked.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  And we're censoring everybody else, you idiot.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  Shut up about it.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  Just, just, just six months ago, they were denying it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  Now they have to admit it to Congress.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  You understand the liability of this?
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  Just calling everybody fake news?
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  We're going to come back and go over these incredible articles and what they're doing and then shift gears into what Trump's doing and the EU so much to cover.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Please stay with us.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  We'll be right back on the other side of this important break.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  Tell everybody you know how you're listening and to tune in to get through the censors.
[15:40.000 --> 15:58.000]  You are the resistance.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we haven't enforced life.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  They take hours.
[16:04.000 --> 16:10.000]  Michael's DX plus now is a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, it's back in stock.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  So you can upload it.
[16:25.000 --> 16:34.000]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine four to five toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  That's a spray you do.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  You can also swallow it.
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[16:43.000 --> 16:51.000]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  It's so essential to spread the word.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  This 4th of July is special.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  Everybody can see it.
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.000]  They can feel it.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.000]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance, the globalist.
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  That's why this 4th of July, I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about info wars now more than ever.
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  And what would the world be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the globalist?
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported info wars?
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[17:27.000 --> 17:34.000]  So please think about info wars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  We have record sales going on right now, free shipping on hundreds of different items.
[17:40.000 --> 17:47.000]  More than 20 items are 50% off like Brainforce Plus, X2 is 40% off, knockout sleep aid 1776,
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  silver bullets 995 colletal silver and free shipping.
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.000]  You can't beat that.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  This 4th of July is special and our sales are special to match it.
[17:56.000 --> 18:25.000]  InfowarsStore.com
[18:26.000 --> 18:46.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:58.000 --> 19:09.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  It's made in the USA.
[19:15.000 --> 19:22.000]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[19:24.000 --> 19:34.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[19:34.000 --> 19:45.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you,
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield, infowarslife.com.
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  The battle for the First Amendment is now.
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  These species are under attack globally.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  Will they recognize it?
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.000]  They'll lose it.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  It's up to you.
[20:27.000 --> 20:49.000]  InfoWars.infowars.com.
[20:49.000 --> 21:03.000]  Tomorrow's news today, the vaunted dreaded enemy of globalist scumbags, pedophiles, corporate, pruning, globalist garbage.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  Thank you again so much for joining us.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  Now I have unbelievable news coming up.
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  The president says he thinks the European Union is a foe.
[21:12.000 --> 21:19.000]  He's demonized by our traitor media for pointing out the sky is blue.
[21:19.000 --> 21:26.000]  We're also going to look at Rosenstein not smiling anymore after House Republicans spotted with his impeachment docs.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  They're being introduced tomorrow.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  Why don't they go along with old Jeff Sessions?
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  Well, he says if Rosenstein's removed, he'll step down.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  Yeah, compromise is the name.
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  Also, we're going to look at who is America TV review.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  They're saying it's absolutely boring and horrible.
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  Sasha Baron Cohen goes around dressed up like me half the movie.
[21:47.000 --> 21:58.000]  I've talked to folks that have already seen it in Hollywood with InfoWars t-shirts and stickers and says horrible racist things attributed to InfoWars defamation by comedy.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  It'll be another failure and fall flat on its face, even though the whole system throws itself behind it.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  We're so sick of Hollywood.
[22:05.000 --> 22:06.000]  It's unbelievable.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  We'll play that review coming up.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  We'll play the stupid trailer for it.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  Also, he tried to get me in it.
[22:11.000 --> 22:17.000]  I told the producer, I said, showtime's not doing a piece about both sides in America to bring us together.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  I said, I bet that's a fricking infiltration hit piece.
[22:22.000 --> 22:30.000]  And of course it was just like I never even aired it a few weeks ago when they canceled the opposition that attacked me four nights a week.
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  Too lazy to work on Friday, a late night show on Comedy Central, Redstone's Viacom.
[22:36.000 --> 22:45.000]  And we just got to think our lucky stars that the globalists are still directed by, you know, 95-year-old, you know, globalist crypt keepers.
[22:45.000 --> 22:57.000]  Because it's like, Diane Feinstein can't get the endorsement of the Democratic Party in California and they just endorsed a communist.
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  I mean, they're showing their real colors, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  And the Democrats keep trying to run crypt keepers.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  And I love old folks that are patriots, but, you know, these old globalists are just a mess.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  And everywhere, they just keep trying to run these fossils.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  The Democrat millennials don't want that, man.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  They want Venezuela.
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  They want Antifa.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  They want collapse.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  They want some free stuff for a couple of years and everything to collapse.
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  Missouri loves company.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  Well, we're going to stop them.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  Don't worry, but this is serious.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  So that's all coming up.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  Also, secret plot to evict Julian Assange from Ecuadorian Embassy Discover.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.000]  We're going to get to that.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  We're going to get to so much more today that I haven't even mentioned.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  But let me just get back to the big inch a lot of here.
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  Oh, I forgot to tell you guys, Roger Stone's on next segment.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  He's one of the top stories in the country, obviously.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  Now, 12 Russians or 13 have been indicted.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  Now, first thing indicted, 13 web bots.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  And it turned out those companies showed up and said, we didn't do what you said.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  In fact, we were doing advertising for Hillary.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  So now he's trying to get that case dropped quietly.
[24:11.000 --> 24:19.000]  So now he's just indicted people claiming Russian intelligence agents were running Goosa for 2.0.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  And you know, stole the election. It wasn't American people.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  So I forgot to tell you, text Roger real quick.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  He's on his way to the airport, but you can call it next segment.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  So that's all coming up.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  And then the whole second hour, I will go through all of this,
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  try to break down just where we are historically.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  But here's the deal.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  I'm going to wait till Roger's gone after the next segment to get into this because it's got to be done right.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  You know, I did it in the first and second segment.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  We just tuned in, but I don't think I really did it justice here.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  I mean, this isn't me hyping this.
[24:50.000 --> 24:58.000]  There are thousands of articles this week into this Sunday saying ban info wars.
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.000]  And then you read from the tech meetings with the so-called journalists and with the so-called journalism professors,
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  all discussing how to kill free speech.
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.000]  So you go to major universities today to learn how to strangle speech and how to create cult members.
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  You've all seen Missouri State and Evergreen College and Washington and all the videos.
[25:19.000 --> 25:27.000]  Yale, Harvard, where they say no whites allowed on the campus today.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  And then an Asian reporter shows up with his camera that goes to the school as part of the newspaper.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  And a white woman walks over and says, get me muscle.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  No whites allowed.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  She means white men or Evergreen saying no whites allowed this weekend.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  Or remember, you know, Yale, you've got the liberal professor who's a real liberal going, now it may hurt you.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  There's Halloween parties and that people dress up as different things, but cultural appropriation is not bad.
[25:56.000 --> 26:06.000]  It's like they told my younger daughter when she was at a retreat, school camp retreat,
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  they said, listen, don't call that a Chinese fortune flower.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  Little girls write the things and they sit there and you pick a color, you pick a number and then they write a fortune in it.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  Everybody remembers that. It's so cute. They make them with construction paper.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  Don't call it Chinese. Don't call the Chinese New Year Chinese. Call it Asian.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  Just saying Chinese is hurtful. Whoever said that, it's their New Year, their calendar, 4,000 years old.
[26:31.000 --> 26:40.000]  It's like saying the Roman alphabet or the Sumerian text or the Egyptian hieroglyphs or Newton's apple.
[26:40.000 --> 26:49.000]  Or German or English or Russian or Spanish or Aztec or Mayan. It's something they invented.
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.000]  Like calling beautiful horses from Persia, Persian horses.
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  It's a war on language. They know what they're doing where all you know is superstition and are scared of words.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  Never forget like five years ago, I'm laying by Barton Springs, this big natural pool here in Austin,
[27:10.000 --> 27:17.000]  and I watch a Mexican and a white guy jump in the pool and they go, man, they can tell they were super stoned.
[27:17.000 --> 27:26.000]  They're like, dude, I want Chinese food. The Hispanic guy did. And the white dude goes, man, that's racist.
[27:26.000 --> 27:34.000]  And he was, oops, sorry. Say it, I want Chinese food. I want Mexican food. I want Italian food.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  I want Southern cooking. I want soul food. I want, I want it. I want Japanese steakhouses.
[27:40.000 --> 27:49.000]  This is the, this is on purpose where every language, every word, everything is bad. This is mental illness.
[27:49.000 --> 28:00.000]  This is insanity. And this has got to stop. They want to totally bully you until you say and do and act however they want.
[28:00.000 --> 28:12.000]  And they've now announced hearings on, the way they've got the hearings, even though it's bipartisan, is we need to look at fake news and stuff on the big social networks.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  And then you've got these Republicans that don't even know what planet they're on, not know what's going on.
[28:16.000 --> 28:24.000]  And the Democrats are in there openly saying ban info wars. And then you read all the news articles, they go, and then everybody else we disagree with.
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.000]  It says anyone that's a conspiracy theorist or racist, they define Trump as all that.
[28:30.000 --> 28:36.000]  They're the liars. They're the fake news. And they're coming because they can't win a debate to shut us down.
[28:36.000 --> 28:58.000]  If we mobilize and expose this, it'll be their waterloo. But we've got to mobilize against it. We'll be back.
[28:58.000 --> 29:09.000]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium. This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.

[33:20.000 --> 33:25.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he.
[33:29.000 --> 33:34.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:34.000 --> 33:49.000]  All right, Roger Stone is driving to the airport right now, but we're getting him on the line.
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  He has been told, and he's read over the indictment and it doesn't say his name.
[33:55.000 --> 34:06.000]  Clearly they're talking about him, that he is tied into the case against 12 Russians.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  They're claiming our intelligence operatives.
[34:08.000 --> 34:20.000]  Now, Rod Rosenstein, who's about to get impeached by the House of Representatives and the Senate, he made it clear that we have no evidence any U.S. citizens were involved with Russia trying to hack the election.
[34:20.000 --> 34:30.000]  Remember, they already indicted 13 bots from Russian PR companies.
[34:30.000 --> 34:40.000]  And then when the Russians showed up to court a few months ago, showing that 80% of their funding, which we already knew, was from the Democratic Party and that we're just a PR firm.
[34:40.000 --> 34:48.000]  And that during any election, their PR firms in England, in Europe, in Russia, in Japan, people use those to get around campaign finance laws.
[34:48.000 --> 35:00.000]  There's a little bit of hanky-panky going on, but Hillary had 80% of the money, so surprise, surprise, 80% of the spending, roughly, was Hillary's.
[35:00.000 --> 35:11.000]  So that's why they've got a big problem with this whole Russiagate thing, because it's Mueller on the tarmac for Obama and Hillary.
[35:11.000 --> 35:22.000]  Hillary State Department, when she was doing the Uranium One deal eight years ago, giving them super weapons grade uranium sample of what they were going to be buying if they gave Hillary a couple hundred million dollars.
[35:22.000 --> 35:34.000]  I mean, look, if Trump was on tarmacs giving people weapons grade uranium as a sample to sell out 25% of our strategic stockpiles, I'd say send his butt to prison.
[35:34.000 --> 35:46.000]  And that's what's so crazy is, Mueller and Comey and the Clintons are literally on the Russian Tatas. They're on the Russian mammary glands.
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  I mean, they are on them, baby. They are making biscuits. They are getting the milk.
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  And they were also getting it from the Chinese and everybody else. I mean, that's what, to be a Democrat is to hate Americans, sell it out. Everybody knows that.
[36:00.000 --> 36:10.000]  They're the ones always selling out our missile secrets and everything else. They're the ones that hate America. They're the ones that they had the Ninth Circuit rule, you can't wear American flags in public in all those western states.
[36:10.000 --> 36:18.000]  Seriously, look it up. They're hurtful and symbols of hate. The Democratic Party wants the American flag banned.
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.000]  Remember Trump after Charlottesville, he said, if they want to take down the Confederate flag, next they'll want to take down the American flag.
[36:24.000 --> 36:32.000]  And the next week they said, yeah, we want it taken down too.
[36:32.000 --> 36:41.000]  So you cannot make this up.
[36:41.000 --> 36:49.000]  Let me give you a cell phone number. I'll just abort if he can't get on. It's no big deal. We know about the case, but I can't play.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  Let's see for an hour and a half on air, whether we get him on because I've got, I've got to cover this attack on the First Amendment.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  Man, that is the big, gigantic, mega sized enchilada out in front of everybody.
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  And they have an exact public plan to get rid of the First Amendment.
[37:05.000 --> 37:13.000]  They admit using info wars and WikiLeaks, by the way, four months ago, the Wall Street Journal.
[37:13.000 --> 37:23.000]  Four months ago, the Wall Street Journal came out and remember everybody else picked it up and had the headline, hold on to your tinfoil hat, YouTube is coming for Alex Jones.
[37:23.000 --> 37:32.000]  And they said, well, we're the new, I'm the new CEO since they sold or selling news corps to Disney or splitting it up.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And we don't want other people on the Internet. We just want big companies.
[37:36.000 --> 37:45.000]  And so we're going to set the precedent with Alex Jones and WikiLeaks. And once we've banned them as fake news, then we're going to ban everybody else from having their own platforms.
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  And you'll only get maybe a hundred different things on your Internet.
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.000]  Now, this is a public statement.
[37:55.000 --> 38:08.000]  Then it started CNN misrepresenting what I've said, what I've done, saying I said nobody died at Parkland. No video of that.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  Saying I said there were crisis actors. No video of that.
[38:13.000 --> 38:21.000]  And then they ban our YouTube channel. And then we upload to our own site. Well, I really said, and I said, no such thing.
[38:21.000 --> 38:30.000]  And so they had to reinstate it. And Bloomberg said, oh, there was a mutiny at YouTube of the Southern Poverty Law Center people they hired to ban Alex Jones.
[38:30.000 --> 38:45.000]  Yeah, you can't make this up. The Southern Poverty Law Center, 20,000 people, they got a half billion dollars offshore to go and have interfaces on every major web tech site.
[38:45.000 --> 38:55.000]  And then to ban not just me, but everybody else. And they admit in all these articles is coming up next segment. I'm going to read you the quotes that they Facebook and Google said to them at these conferences with CNN.
[38:55.000 --> 39:07.000]  They said, shut up, idiots. We are already censoring info wars. We are already censoring 80% of the post of conservatives across the board.
[39:07.000 --> 39:16.000]  They're going to have racketeering suits and free speech suits and antitrust suits on us if we completely ban them. They don't know their band.
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  I do. Project Veritas got the video eight months ago with the executives going we've already banned them. They don't know it. The dumb Hicks.
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.000]  And he goes, what's a heck? Anybody promoting troops, police or national sovereignty or the American flag?
[39:31.000 --> 39:41.000]  Well, who's your number one enemy? Alex Jones. I've been sitting here telling you this and now they're publicly doing it.
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  And the crazy people at CNN are so out of control.
[39:47.000 --> 40:03.000]  And then Washington Post, the New York Times and thousands of other LA Times New Yorker magazine, they're like just ban him completely and arrest his ass.
[40:03.000 --> 40:18.000]  We go to Roger Stone. We got him on the line. Roger, we can see the multi-faceted attack demonizes, misrepresent us, deplatform us, sue us, and then go to Congress and try to bamboozle a bunch of tech ignorant Republicans
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  that, oh, we're just ratcheting back all the fake news. No, they're not. They let Democrats threaten like Keith Overman to murder anyone they want and to put out lies about all of us.
[40:26.000 --> 40:37.000]  This is the war for this country and the president needs to learn how serious it is and bust up these trusts. And we're sending reports to Congress and the president tomorrow that are bombshell.
[40:37.000 --> 40:48.000]  Bombshell stone. And of course, on top of it, you got Mueller, the literal Batman with uranium to the Russians breathing down your neck with a whole new flotilla of fake indictments.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Roger Stone joining us.
[40:50.000 --> 41:01.000]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right. It's a veritable war of censorship. They fear info wars because we're the cutting edge. We are the tip of the spear.
[41:01.000 --> 41:15.000]  And there's no doubt in my mind that a crucial element of their plan for a silent coup against Donald Trump is to silence info wars because we go where no one else fears to go.
[41:15.000 --> 41:25.000]  And that's why it's a three step process. Take away our First Amendment rights, ban info wars on the Internet. Take away our Second Amendment rights.
[41:25.000 --> 41:37.000]  Take away our First Amendment rights, take away our Second Amendment rights and then stage a silent coup on Donald Trump, either through impeachment based on some trumped up charges.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  Or 25th Amendment.
[41:39.000 --> 41:47.000]  What you first predicted a year and a half ago, everything you've said has happened by the numbers. What's going to happen next, Roger?
[41:47.000 --> 41:56.000]  Well, it's very interesting. It appears to me that the indictment of the 15 Russians is largely for public relations.
[41:56.000 --> 42:11.000]  They'll never come here for trial. They'll never be an inspection of the DNC server in order to determine whether they were, in fact, ever hacked by anyone. Never mind the Russians.
[42:11.000 --> 42:21.000]  This is a PR coup for the Special Counsel. And I think it's meant to prop up his sagging public opinion.
[42:21.000 --> 42:32.000]  And I should have started the interview with this. Clearly he's about to meet with Putin on Monday tomorrow, so they released this big giant farting church on Friday to obscure that.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  Yeah, they undercut the pros of the United States while he's out of the country. It's really outrageous.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  I know you've got to go. I know you've got to go. Just come back and finish up on this on the other side. Oh, you're about to be at the airport.
[42:44.000 --> 42:52.000]  We've got Roger Stone with us. One of the top stories in the country is this new ridiculous fake indictment of these cable or elves that don't exist.
[42:52.000 --> 43:17.000]  12 and 90 will be right back.

[43:57.000 --> 44:15.000]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,
[44:15.000 --> 44:27.000]  you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.

[45:16.000 --> 45:25.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:25.000 --> 45:36.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[45:36.000 --> 45:50.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:50.000 --> 45:58.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[45:58.000 --> 46:07.000]  This 4th of July is special. Everybody can see it. They can feel it. The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[46:07.000 --> 46:17.000]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance to the globalists. That's why this 4th of July, I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about InfoWars now more than ever.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  And what would the world be like if InfoWars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[46:21.000 --> 46:29.000]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars? We would not be having the victories we have today. So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[46:29.000 --> 46:36.000]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.

[47:24.000 --> 47:34.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:34.000 --> 47:42.000]  You know, I pointed out that Peter Strauch acted like people that you see at the state hospital or who were schizophrenic on the side of the road.
[47:42.000 --> 47:51.000]  And if you look at his girlfriend, if you look at Howdy Doody over there, Rosenstein, if you look at any of them, they look like power-mad mental patients.
[47:51.000 --> 48:03.000]  I mean, everybody saw it. He acted like a complete loom bag who was on MDMA or something. I mean, he was making shark faces, psycho faces.
[48:03.000 --> 48:15.000]  These people are the worst. The scum of the earth that got in control of the FBI, worked for Hillary, covered up for, called to the president, and now Mueller acts like he's the head of the United States.
[48:15.000 --> 48:23.000]  He's been caught in total fraud. He indicted 13 bots, turned out the Russians showed up. Now they want to drop the case because none of it was real.
[48:23.000 --> 48:34.000]  The bot companies have been hired by Hillary. And now they're back with 12 more indictments this time of Russian intelligence officers, knowing full well they won't be extradited here, so it's more made up crap.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.000]  And they're trying to target InfoWars and Roger Stone. This is asinine. But Roger, as you were pointing out during the break when I was talking to you,
[48:41.000 --> 48:51.000]  the craziness of a failing media operation like CNN, that is something like 45th, I have the latest Nielsen ratings,
[48:51.000 --> 49:01.000]  that's many places behind reruns of Yogi the Bear, Yogi Bear, that they are out policing at events with Facebook saying shut down InfoWars,
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  and then Facebook says, I have the articles right here, hey, we're already dialing back all the conservatives 80%. Do you understand?
[49:07.000 --> 49:14.000]  They're going to have major cases for racketeering and discrimination and antitrust against us if we totally ban them off the platform.
[49:14.000 --> 49:24.000]  And CNN and the Washington Post, they go, we don't care, we want them banned now. What in the world do you think is going on, Roger Stone?
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  It was unbelievable. I turned on CNN this morning and they were openly talking about banning InfoWars.
[49:30.000 --> 49:42.000]  Now, if CNN is a media organization, how would they justify under the First Amendment advocating the extinguishing of another media organization?
[49:42.000 --> 49:51.000]  The Washington Post doesn't talk about closing the New York Times down. They are petrified because of the millions of people that we are reaching
[49:51.000 --> 50:03.000]  and galvanizing and educating, and it's driving them crazy. A key element of their coup d'état plan is to have no dissent for there to be no platform,
[50:03.000 --> 50:12.000]  no forum for patriots to object, which is why closing InfoWars down is a crucial part of their plan.
[50:12.000 --> 50:22.000]  And it's why we need to move ahead into the courts and to bring an action against them for antitrust and for monopolistic practices.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  This is thuggery is what it is.
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  Roger, I've studied U.S. history, so have you. It's incredibly interesting. It's riveting. I mean, I know our history.
[50:32.000 --> 50:42.000]  We've had some problems about five years into the Republic. During the Civil War, Lincoln moved against newspaper editors and owners that said that he should be killed.
[50:42.000 --> 50:50.000]  I mean, I'm not supporting what he did, but I could see in a war. That's people saying overthrow, kill the president, and that's a Civil War.
[50:50.000 --> 51:01.000]  This is the Democrats admitting in all these articles, anybody can go read them, that, oh, once we ban InfoWars, we're going to have the president set to completely de-platform all conservatives,
[51:01.000 --> 51:09.000]  and we want Trump banned off Twitter, and we want Donald Jr. banned. They're in the news saying shut down their political competition.
[51:09.000 --> 51:20.000]  This is so incredibly criminal. They call us fake news when they are incredibly famous for fake news and staging debates and putting out lies and WMDs.
[51:20.000 --> 51:30.000]  I mean, if you try to go through it and saying that Trump got rid of the bust of Martin Luther King and just the incredible lies they tell on a daily basis, this is incredible.
[51:30.000 --> 51:46.000]  Well, there's no question about it, and this is the first time in our history when one of our major parties refuses to accept the results of a Democratic election.
[51:46.000 --> 51:55.000]  I wasn't happy when Barack Obama was elected. I wasn't happy when he was re-elected, but I abided by the results of the election.
[51:55.000 --> 52:10.000]  This is nothing short than an effort to undo what they couldn't do at the ballot box, and if the president does not understand that this bullet is heading his way, then he's in even more grave danger.
[52:10.000 --> 52:22.000]  This isn't about Paul Manafort or Alex Jones or Roger Stone. It's about the presidency, and our friends on the right need to recognize that InfoWars is the test case.
[52:22.000 --> 52:35.000]  If they shut us down, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, they're next. They need to recognize that they are next.
[52:35.000 --> 52:54.000]  I want to be a trillion percent clear. I want to be infinity clear. I don't care about my ratings. I don't care about being a big shot. I don't brag about our reach or how much money we bring in or how much we spend to do this.
[52:54.000 --> 53:05.000]  The enemy knows that before they started censoring us, 86 million viewers a week, and I didn't hit. That's real people. We're talking hottest thing in the world, other than drudge.
[53:05.000 --> 53:19.000]  And then they've crushed us down. It made us even more rockstar. Our numbers are still stratospheric, but they say that in the articles. They go, we've crushed him, but now everybody else reposted and changed it, and it's total rockstar.
[53:19.000 --> 53:26.000]  What do we do? So that's the debate they're having that, well, we secretly censored InfoWars, and it's still getting out, though.
[53:26.000 --> 53:33.000]  So the Democrats say completely ban it, and they go, no, that'll create a Streisand effect. I mean, listen, here's the deal, Stone.
[53:33.000 --> 53:43.000]  Historically, this is so insane because they're obviously lying villains who misrepresent what we've said, then try to shut us up so they can defame and slander us.
[53:43.000 --> 53:53.000]  And then now they're having a giant national debate in public about the best way to strangle all nationalist conservatives, pro-veteran, pro-capitalist speech.
[53:53.000 --> 54:00.000]  They are outrageous criminals. They are the villains. I've never heard of even dictators admitting they're doing this in the open.
[54:00.000 --> 54:06.000]  This is beyond the Communist Chinese, man. Can you believe they've stooped to this? This is their waterloo.
[54:06.000 --> 54:14.000]  If the libertarians and conservatives and churches and Christians and veterans groups stop buying into, oh, we're ashamed of InfoWars.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  Oh, it's being demonized. You know, Donald Trump Jr. says, well, CNN shouldn't lead the fighting against fake news. They're the kings of fake news.
[54:20.000 --> 54:28.000]  That's just not a support of InfoWars. It's saying they shouldn't be the arbiter. No, there must be an embrace of it and an exposure of how they've misrepresented.
[54:28.000 --> 54:35.000]  We must take it head-on and not be bullied, but all these old Republicans still think mainstream TV is dominant.
[54:35.000 --> 54:44.000]  It doesn't have one-hundredth of the views of the conglomerate Internet where we're winning. You people have victory in your hands for the next ten generations.
[54:44.000 --> 54:56.000]  If you'll just take it in your frickin' hands and stop being cowards, my mission is not to be in D.C. or New York or L.A. with all you mummies with the number one TV show that reaches five million people a night.
[54:56.000 --> 55:04.000]  No offense to Sean Hannity. He's a great guy. And he's got a huge radio show even bigger. Sean Hannity's bigger on the Internet than the radio that he is on TV.
[55:04.000 --> 55:14.000]  And he's one of the only ones that isn't a complete coward. And all I'm telling you is, if everybody doesn't stick with us, you will all go down and these pieces of crap will win.
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  Now get up off your asses, get motivated, and defeat these sons of bitches. Go ahead, Stone. I'm sorry.
[55:20.000 --> 55:32.000]  You know, Alex, every day we point this out, and it's just as true now as it was yesterday. When people see a link to any story on InfoWars that they find compelling,
[55:32.000 --> 55:41.000]  they need to repost it on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, on Snapchat. They cannot silence us all.
[55:41.000 --> 55:47.000]  They may come after you, they may come after me, but they cannot silence all of us.
[55:47.000 --> 56:00.000]  And there's a magnifying effect, an amplifying effect, when you take our best links and you put them up on your social media, you send them to your friends, your family, your circle of activists.
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  They cannot snuff out the flame of freedom if people will do that.
[56:05.000 --> 56:14.000]  And this is epic. This is authoritarianism, rearing its head with people that want to run our children, our religion, our money.
[56:14.000 --> 56:23.000]  They want to control our lives, and then they lie about us and have all these weird, anti-free speech professors drooling over how they want to silence us.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  Because we know what they want to do, Roger, after they silence us, don't we?
[56:26.000 --> 56:33.000]  Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. They just called the full man for it.
[56:33.000 --> 56:41.000]  Let's briefly talk about that. I called you this week when I saw the headline in CNN about, oh, he's getting VIP treatment, and I read down a paragraph and said,
[56:41.000 --> 56:50.000]  oh, his phones are all listened to with his lawyers, and they know his defense, and they say it's criminal that he's putting on a defense, so they're moving him to solitary confinement so he can't talk to his lawyers.
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.000]  And they call that VIP treatment. That is so illegal, so unconstitutional.
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  Yeah, do you wonder whether this is Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia?
[57:01.000 --> 57:08.000]  Look, they just want to squeeze him and make him plead guilty so they can avoid a trial.
[57:08.000 --> 57:17.000]  They don't want to go to trial because they don't want to talk about the misuse, the unconstitutional, illegal use of these FICE awards.
[57:17.000 --> 57:26.000]  It is their Achilles' heel. What is it that Rosenstein won't hand over to the U.S. House of Representatives and Devin Nunes?
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  It's information regarding the FICE award.
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  We're going to break. We'll do five more. Five more with you, then I've got a special guest, but Roger, look at that headline from Politico.
[57:34.000 --> 57:41.000]  Who would have ever thought this? They got in trouble for listening to 9-11 Al Qaeda members' phone calls, and they should have been in jail because they're not citizens.
[57:41.000 --> 57:47.000]  Neul or tame listening to Manafort's jail phone calls. Politico! I mean, good God!
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[57:57.000 --> 58:05.000]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[58:05.000 --> 58:14.000]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[58:16.000 --> 58:26.000]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[58:26.000 --> 58:38.000]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful microbalancing properties.

[59:51.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  All right, finish up with Roger Stone. I've been ranting. I know the Clintons and the globalists hate the country and have sold it out.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  All Trump had to do was just get their boot off our neck and we'd start turbocharging, which happened.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  And then to watch these enemies circle like buzzards around me and my family and to do it to Roger and others, it makes me mad.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  It makes me want to fight because I don't want to sit here with half measures against these.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  I saw Strock and how demonic and cowardly and scumbag-ish and psychopathic he looked and it didn't make me be afraid of him or Mueller.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  It made me mad at my shelves that I haven't done more to defeat them.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  And I will! On the altar of God, we will defeat them like King George III and the rest of the trash.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  I swear on the altar of God. I swear it. My full will.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Roger, finish up before I get too angry. What does the president need to do? What does Trump Jr. need to do?
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  What do we need to do to finish these enemies? Because I can feel they're preparing to launch their counter-strike.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  We have an unelected federal prosecutor running the country. There are no checks and balances on him.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  There are no governors. There is no oversight. That's not what the founding fathers had in mind.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  The president needs to discharge Mr. Sessions, Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Mueller, and he needs to do it before it is too late.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Mueller is taking on millions more in dollars and platoons more of young Democratic prosecutors while forming a Republican killing machine.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  President has to take immediate action. Those around him who say, oh, Mr. President, this isn't aimed at you. You're not the target.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  And like you told me the other day when they were doing all this stuff behind the scenes, we can't talk about the both of us.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Okay, Alex, that wasn't what you said. Stop worrying about it. This is posterity. We have to attack. And you're right.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Posterity. This is our children. It isn't Republican Party or any of this. These people want full control over us.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  That little demonic piece of crap, Strock, thinks he will rule my family. No, no, no. Go ahead.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  So, look, I think it's vital that people call and write the president, tell him the truth, that this is a coup d'etat, a slow-motion coup d'etat.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  And to the extent that the president is reassured and believes this isn't coming his way, he is sadly incorrect.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  And that's why Rosenstein did that faint where he went, oh, we're not saying any citizens were involved with the Russian intelligence agencies in the new indictment.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  That's total crap. That means the daggers out and they're about to make their move on the president.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  Alex, I am bolting for the gate here at the airport, but let me leave you with this, the victory or death. I'm with you, my brother.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  I know you've got to go, but one minute more. They admit they're trying to cause civil unrest. They admit they're going to try to overthrow the president.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  I know you've got to go on your plane less than an hour.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Gut level, what else can the listeners and viewers do? Because this isn't hyperbole. I'm here to get people out of their coma because I'm having to go through not the fear, but just the commitment myself.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  And it pisses me off that we're ruled by trash white stork. Why is he still on the FBI payroll?
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  Well, we cannot fight without war chest. People need to go to the info wars.com store now, make a contribution to the cause, go to stonedefensefund.com now, make a contribution.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  We cannot fight without resources. That is probably the single most important thing info warriors can do to help the coming Armageddon.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  This is it. This is the battle of Ragnarok. This is the battle of the gods and we're at the middle of it. You're right. I didn't even plug last hour.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  They're telling me plug and I'm like having trouble financing us and I'm just so obsessed with info. I don't do it, but the money is critical.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  Again, how do people go to your defense fund, which is you just defeated Obama, one of his suits, but they got a bunch of others.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Stonedefensefund.com. Stonedefensefund.com or go to the info wars site where you can make a generous contribution.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  All right. Thank you, Roger. We'll talk to you again tomorrow. Roger's coming to town.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Alabama bound.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Absolutely. Good job. I'm going to settle down, man. I just looking at Strach. He's such a such an evil. Oh my God.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  His basement should be checked. I mean, I mean, oh boy, that is bad news right there.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  He thinks he's going to beat us. No, you won't demon living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States, but a lot of us on the big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  Church Hill's chair, Winston Churchill, the man that wrote the three volumes set,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  the history of the English speaking peoples, quite a intellectual, but a manly cut.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Well, they're freaking out on Trump when he was invited into his study and was told to sit on it as a setup.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Oh, sitting in Churchill's chair, his famous easy chair will take a photo.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  They called him a traitor. How dare you imply you defeated the Nazis, which he never did.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  I'm going to talk about that here in just a moment, just to illustrate how the fake news media works.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  But here is the crux of the matter. Here's the key to it all.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Multinational corporations in the 1950s knew the U.S. had control of the planet.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  They decided to parlay U.S. power into global power for themselves.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  It had been U.S. and British corporations select ones that had actually shut up Hitler and the whole eugenics movement.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Not the average American was like that, but there were robber barons that were very racist, very evil, into control.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  And they developed a very diabolical plan for the long term, which we're now living under.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  Trump is trying to change that.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  And now, if you just joined us, the Democratic Party, the big corporations are so arrogant that they are in thousands of publications in the last week,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  calling for infowars.com and myself and anybody we have on air that's part of the operation to be banned from the Internet like Communist China does.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  Now, the tech giants came out and they said, listen, I'll show you some of those articles here.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  They said, listen, you're going to make info wars a martyr.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  We've already effectively banned them on our platforms.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  And the Democrats are like, well, why are we still losing elections?
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  And they go, because people hate you and info wars already has an audience, people that are awake.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  See, you've got to reapply lies and confusion over and over again.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  Once somebody's awake, it doesn't work anymore.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Once they get the game, once they know the scam, once they catch a cheat in the cards, they don't play cards with you anymore.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  Like somebody in business, you catch them ripping you off, you don't go back in business with them.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  So these big tech giants hijacked America, made trillions of dollars off of it, and then they got such a hard on for the country,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  they financed the universities, the schools, everything to turn us all against each other and turn us into basket cases so they could manage us
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  and make sure the golden goose they'd gotten stayed under their control.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  But you turn the golden goose into a mentally retarded drooling idiot.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  And Trump doesn't want to do that.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  He goes, let's just make everybody successful.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Let's just give people an opportunity.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  Let's stop domesticating people.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  LBJ wrote dozens of letters saying, these black people, they'll edit me saying this.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  I gotta say it like this.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  That's what the media does, folks.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  They take me out of context.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  So you can go just type in LBJ's letters.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  By the way, I'm not joking. That's what they do.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  I quote them, they play the audio and then say I said it.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  But LBJ's famous for saying that these black people are incredibly uppity because they've been suppressed under segregation.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  It wasn't a good thing.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and ishy.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  So many black areas were richer than even middle class white areas, lower unemployment, lower illegitimacy.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  What I was about, we're going to be successful under this pressure.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  Their own hotels, their own restaurants, their own cleaners, their own doctors, their own universities.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  It was a golden age.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  Okay.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Not because segregation was good or all that, because that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  People said, we don't need them.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  We don't need this crap.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  Like I covered my face, though.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  They'll edit this audio and put it out.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  This is what they do.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  They go, look, Jones just said, you know, they said, black people, where are you?
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  What they do, man?
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Seriously.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  I say Hillary Clinton killed a bunch of people and by funding Al Qaeda and ISIS killed a bunch of little kids in the Middle East.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  They edit that and say, I said it was in a pizza place and then get people assuming.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  So I have to do this now.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  I do this because it's not that you are stupid as a viewer or listener.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  It's the general public.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  If I don't do this, they will edit it.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  So again, Margaret Sanger called black subhuman hired blacks to app poses liberals so they can get control of their communities.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  And again, I'm not assessing on black people.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  I'm not going to use political correct terms either.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  That's what went on.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  And so they've done it over and over and over and over again.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  And Trump's like, you know what?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  We're not going to sit there and break up families.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  We're not going to sit there and tell people they can't be successful and can't have a husband in the house.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  This is ruins culture.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  We're going to actually create jobs and opportunities and honor workers again.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  We're going to cut back on some of this welfare and create independence again.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  And they're pissed, man.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  They don't like this happening.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  I'm serious.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.080]  I'm actually go to a screen now just put a screen up to when we talk because they they'll just do everything
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.040]  You know, I should she'll just say what I say. No, they're gonna edit it
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.480]  It's just it's just when you watch the criminals at CNN or MSNBC
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.560]  Even Fox with Megan Kelly did it and they edit what you say
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.800]  And they've got the little telltale sign as they'll blur the video like we got HD uploads
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.720]  Do you ever notice on when I'm on the news? It's always Comedy Central or or HBO or Showtime
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.800]  It's blurred. You can barely see what's going on. It's cuz they're editing the video and they don't want you to see the jump cuts
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.740]  Man when you see them do that, they're robbing you. They think you're stupid
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.840]  Does that not make you angry? God, it makes me angry not for me
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:19.040]  Not that weak-minded leftist try to spit it spit on me in the street. It's that they've been lied to like that
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:29.760]  To where I can't even quote them because media matters run by George Soros the Nazi collaborator will literally take it and
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.360]  Edit it and blur it and put it out
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.720]  Like if I say I don't hate transsexuals
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.280]  I don't hate anybody for how they live or what they do as long as it hurts somebody else
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.200]  But they're always changing words and saying what you can't use on Twitter or Facebook single ban
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.680]  You have you use the word training and that's a word that those folks came up with themselves
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:57.240]  That's their name for 20 years. How can then Twitter vote at the executive level to ban that and the headline was this week
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:04.040]  Alex Jones attacks transsexuals and says he hates them. It's a lie. I said I hate
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:11.760]  What they call drag queen festivals they have in public schools around the country where elementary students come up with
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:18.440]  Dollars and stick them in a big fat guy in a wigs outfit in a g-string with his testicles hanging down
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.440]  I don't care if it's heterosexual homosexual
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:28.160]  Whatever it is leave the children alone and when media matters and salon do that. They know they're defrauding you with the truth
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:36.520]  But again the New York Times salon HBO vice they've all said pedophilia is okay
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:44.160]  And you watch they'll take what I just said to Mara and have a whole lie out about it
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.080]  But that's what they do because they want to destroy culture and
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:55.360]  Society and want to divide and conquer everyone and want to defraud people because they're a bunch of worthless
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:03.360]  mercenaries that have sold out who are weak cowards and they're losing and that's why they've got thousands of articles a week saying
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.840]  Ban me and shut me up so I can't defend myself while you lie about us
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.360]  But it doesn't matter because no matter what you do to info wars the human spirit will go past it no matter how you censor us
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.600]  Or try to shut us down. You'll never succeed because there is a
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:23.800]  Beating spirit in the breast of every man woman and child on this planet that wants to be free and wants to have a future
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.800]  And you may get it over on us for a while
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:32.440]  But long term you're not going to get it over on humanity and you're gonna lose and see I'm not like you a psychopathic
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.440]  globalist luciferian
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.200]  Self-serving nutball
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.480]  I'm so self-serving that I know I'm gonna die and I want humanity to go on because I love humanity
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.760]  And I love our quest and I love this big battle
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.240]  We've been on this planet to get to the level or edit
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:54.120]  I want us to win and because I'm a fan of humanity and because I believe in that dream
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:01.320]  I know I'm going forward with all of you and your children and that's why I am more than willing to be destroyed
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:08.520]  And now my prayers to take on the globalist at point-blank range are coming true and we are now on the chessboard
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.800]  facing the globalist king and queen as
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.800]  I the rook engage in a desperate gambit to be destroyed
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.780]  But in the end bring them down and that's where we stand at the fulcrum coming up
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.880]  Mike Adams who has written a key report to Congress that I asked him and commissioned him to do
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.280]  They'll be sent to the president more coming up tomorrow
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:33.720]  We'll join us on the draconian plan to kill the first amendment watch civil war and bring down the republic key
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.120]  Globalist battle plans death star plans will be laid out coming up

[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.560]  All right, I haven't gotten into Trump and Churchill yet and how they're demonizing him for them saying hey sit in this chair
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.280]  Take a photo while you're visiting you know here at the museum
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:42.560]  But it's true that he should be sitting in Churchill's chair. I'll explain why
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:48.920]  And then Rosenstein not smiling anymore of your house Republican spotted with his impeachment docs
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.160]  so
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.160]  It was about
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.560]  930 last night that my phone kept ringing and I had it in the bedroom and I was in the living room
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.560]  My wife and my daughter and I went back in and I saw the message and it was that a
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:15.800]  Fellow that worked here almost seven years six seven years Joe Jennings had had been hit by a car and died in north Austin and
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:24.000]  Joe was just always such a positive hard-working guy one of the engineers up here and also the director of David night show
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.640]  Along with some of the other co-directors
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.080]  that
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:35.000]  When I heard it it just wasn't real and of course, you know Joe's got four children his wife's really nice
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.560]  And you know, I've been out to eat with him and been here at the office with him a lot
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.960]  But he's the guy that I was always telling my wife
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.160]  Hey, we ought to you know hang out with him and the kids his kids are really nice
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.440]  He and Marcos Morales are real good friends. His daughters are real nice as well
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.920]  And there's there's there's Julian and McBreen and Owen and Jennings so
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.080]  Jennings normally drives his car to work
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:03.120]  And he's got puts on a leather jacket the gloves everything drops a big cruiser, but sometimes he rides his motorcycle and
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.160]  And he's real safe driver you name it, but the police said that
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.760]  We're getting the police report, but they came to the house was in his neighborhood
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.480]  They said two miles from your house is most dangerous place not even highway
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:21.480]  Some somebody an SUV just smacked him knocked this helmet off. He was pretty much dead on impact and
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840]  It just shows you how fast
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.400]  Somebody can be in your life and be out of your life
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.000]  You know, I took off Friday to take care of family business and I was here Thursday
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  And I walked in the morning and I was busy had a bunch of stuff to do and Joe was in there wiring up the big new studio
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:43.320]  And he had music on he looked so happy with these wires in his hand and and and pliers and he said oh hi Alex
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.840]  He was just always genuinely so happy. They say the good die young. I mean he wasn't 50 yet and
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.800]  He's just gone. He's he's he's gone
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:58.360]  I'd have anything to go back in a time machine and warn him of bringing back, but there he was going to get his haircut last night
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:05.160]  And like 630 got his little haircut driving back to his house in a residential area SUV smacked him
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.640]  Yeah, go to fullscreen on that photo. Yes, please. Thank you and and he's he's gone
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.280]  So thanks to George Soros is
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.600]  Thanks to George Soros's lawsuits
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:26.600]  And and thanks to the globalist banning on some Google ads and everything they have restricted our attempt to expand
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.600]  in the face of the enemy and
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:33.720]  You know, I just end up then donating to project Veritas or the hashtag walk away movement
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:39.600]  Or or or many other groups that I give to does just the basic seed money ends up really helping me get the word out
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.600]  There's no strings attached for him for wars.com
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.600]  But in this case, I am going to
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.600]  Try to sell the bus I have and I was gonna travel the country eight seven eight years ago
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.600]  It's still a great bus and give the proceeds with family. I'm gonna make a big donation myself
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.600]  But I don't I don't have a ton of discretionary funds, but I'm going to do that
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.600]  Next week, I'm not gonna say the amount but it's it's larger than this
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:08.600]  But you know, his wife's a part-time masseuse. He takes care of his elderly mother. They all live in one house
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.600]  He's just a really nice guy
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:18.600]  And so he has a go fund me Joe Jennings Memorial fund go fund me.com forward slash Joe dash Jennings dash Memorial dash fund
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.600]  Or just go to go fund me go fund me so leftist, but they do take zero percent of money that they probably ban it
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.600]  It's associated with me. This is some memorial fun, but I'll probably do that. It just is who they are as a left
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.600]  But Joe's a really good guy
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.600]  And you know, he's still alive in our hearts and minds. We know he's in a better place. He you know, he loved God
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.600]  He was always so positive that it was almost like a joke how nice he was
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:45.600]  But his wife really loved him and nobody was the best man she'd ever known and his kids were all really well behaved and good
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:51.600]  So that tells you something right there. One of their children is in the shot with their children or what 15 down?
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600]  I think like three and
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.600]  And again, I'm not a nanny state guy people say, well, why do you have a motorcycle if you got kids?
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.600]  Well, he wrote it on the weekends. He wrote it safely
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:04.600]  You know, you can get killed in a car to the most dangerous thing in the world is the highways to the about 55 minutes heart attacks and cancer
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.600]  And it's just you know look out for motorcycles
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.600]  But you know the bottom line here is you don't know how long somebody's gonna be in your life
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.600]  And I just wish I'd have spent more time with Joe Jennings
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.600]  I wish that I would have
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.600]  Because I really don't do anything but spend the time with my kids and just work all the time
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.600]  And it just you know makes you realize this is what we're all fighting for so I'm gonna make a large donation
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.600]  and
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.600]  I'm gonna try to sell that bus because I never use it anymore and it's had the new turbo put in and it's a really nice bus and
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.600]  I'm gonna try to sell that and all the proceeds will go to his wife
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.600]  And some other things we're doing also, but I'm gonna make a large donation as I said this week
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.600]  But they're not even I tried to call him today to say I'm really sorry about what I'm gonna
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.600]  You know try to make a large donation to you next week and they were just they didn't want it
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.600]  They were like thank you so much. We're don't even just they're too shell shocked
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.600]  You know dad goes out to get his hair cut down the street two miles away and then the police come to your door and say sorry
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.600]  You know he's he's dead
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.600]  They I mean they just
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.600]  They didn't take him to the emergency room. He was he was dead when they got there
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.600]  So I guess that's a you know
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.600]  Silver lining the whole situation
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:17.100]  But Joe Jennings was a patriot. He'd worked in the bunch of big he was a direct new director in Miami and a news director
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:21.480]  Was it like a Washington DC and you know, he was a patriot. He wanted to work here
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.600]  They ended up moving here was it six seven years ago
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.520]  from Florida to work here and
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:37.280]  He's just a treasurer and he's gone but he's in our hearts and the work continues on so be sure and go donate to that
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:44.080]  That's a Joe Jennings Memorial Fund. Go fund me calm Joe Jennings Memorial Fund and if you're a radio listener
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.000]  You'll know him if there's any other Joe Jennings in there
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.360]  Cuz it's got a picture of him and his wife and three kids and his wife such a sweetheart as well
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.080]  it's very hard for me to even call and talk to her and
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.800]  Because she's so devastated, but you know, it's better to loved and lost than never have loved at all
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.960]  That's sick as they keep pointing out. We won't be here if I don't plug seriously folks

[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.640]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:06.920]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:13.240]  Including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:19.000]  In the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:22.680]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.720]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:38.120]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.320]  In fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.960]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.600]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.880]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:05.880]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:24.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.760]  I want listeners
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.680]  To know this I appreciate you. I'm very thankful for you. No matter where you come from or what color you are
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.160]  You love liberty. You are the light in the night
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:45.240]  You are the individuals the globalist fear. It's not alex jones. They fear. It's not even mike adams. They fear
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.560]  It's not even donald trump. They fear or a matt drudge. They fear or joe jennings. They fear or ron paul or rand paul
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.320]  It's all of us together wanting freedom wanting a future being hard-working
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:04.600]  Being uh, being rugged individualists. They fear americana because it was the greatest expression so far of the renaissance
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.160]  and of the incredible inventions and ideas that came out of it now
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:17.800]  No one because all the big so-called internet free speech groups are soros and left as funded now it happened the last five years
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:25.480]  No one on the left aclu you name it and I've got lawyers like randaza. That's the top first amendment lawyer right now in the country
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.720]  Uh, even the derchwitz comes out. You know, it says the same thing first amendment's under attack
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.160]  They all agree the left's trying to kill it and in europe
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:38.680]  They're killing it and apples move to china with their code keys and emojis of taiwan are being banned
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.800]  Americans can't send it your phone crashes. That was a little too obvious. So they quit crashing the phones on friday
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.960]  It's here
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.280]  And so in literally thousands of articles. I've only read a couple hundred of them
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.080]  I mentioned a bunch earlier and showed them tv viewers radio listeners
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.080]  They admit
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:01.800]  We're just using info wars that we've demonized and misrepresented and taken a few cherry picked things out of context as the case point
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.160]  They're having hearings on tuesdays try to mainline
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.280]  censoring libertarian conservative nationalists
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.840]  independent health news
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:15.160]  vaccine awareness real liberal anti-war stuff all of it off the internet
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:21.960]  And then facebook and google went stop it. Here's the articles. They said we've already basically banned everybody
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.440]  We haven't got rid of jones completely because it's too obvious. We can have an antitrust suit
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.280]  Facebook would make a martyr by banning info wars tech crunch
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.520]  Facebook won't ban info wars for good reason like both sides do it and what about youtube?
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:42.760]  That's new york magazine, but they have already banned us. They say 80 percent. What did I say a month ago?
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.360]  I said we can look at the graph. It's 80 percent. They don't let you share it
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  They peg our live feeds
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.720]  We should have live feeds with three million viewers. I just do it for my house. They don't let you have it. They kick you off
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.880]  They don't even know what i'm talking about. They just censor so this segment the next mike adams who's a engineer
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:04.520]  computer programmer naturalnews.com has over 300 sites bestselling author
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.440]  Watson's writing a report tomorrow. That's a boil down. But mike's
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.800]  Taking the challenge because i've been talking to folks
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.880]  Uh, who are aware of what's going on and then they say well alex
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:21.960]  What's the full architecture of how they're already shadow banning the president how they're already not letting most's push notifications on twitter
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.480]  Go out and they go, what do we do? Well, i'm like, well, let's lay out the problem
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.040]  Then let's talk about the solution antitrust
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.680]  Let's talk about just exposing it making them stop because they're doing it ahead of the midterms
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:38.200]  And thank god singing in the wash post and thousands of other dying dinosaur media got greedy and said
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:43.800]  We don't just want them strangled quietly. We want their heads cut off with guillotines publicly
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.160]  Our legs are cut off. They don't want us to put tourniquets on
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.080]  Facebook's smart
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.960]  But see the left wants to haul us up and pillory us
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:57.880]  In public and burn us at the stake and that's where they'll fail and again facebook said that they said listen
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.760]  You understand it's illegal what we're doing
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.240]  We'll so so mike adams
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:08.520]  You got your big report coming out tomorrow morning natural news dot com info wars dot com paul will have his as well
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.400]  They'll both link to each other. This is an executive
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.400]  report
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:19.640]  To the public to congress to the to the president which the listeners need to i'll get it directly to the president
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:23.640]  Don't you worry, but everyone needs to hammer it so it's coming out of their ears
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.520]  So thank you for coming on with this on sunday night lay out this tour de force you've put together mike
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:36.120]  Well, thank you, alex. It's good to join you today. Um, my condolences to your crew for the loss of a of a valued staff member
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.360]  Uh, he would want us to of course keep keep fighting and that's what we're doing right now
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.920]  This report the working title is the censorship master plan decoded
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:52.840]  It it is subtitled the blueprint for how tech giants covertly silence online speech and how america can fight back
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.760]  against corporate tech
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:00.760]  monopolist and this document really lays out. I mean, you know, I have a software background a tech background
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:07.160]  This document lays out both the technical methods of censorship, but also the psychological methods
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.720]  of lynch mob
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.480]  Oppression that goes along with that censorship because as you know, it's a it's a trifecta
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:20.440]  I mean, it's a it's a three branch censorship effort to demonize you they have to legitimize it
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.600]  They have to stir up the hysteria and that's and by the way, since you announced this
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:29.000]  Because they'll probably I'm glad you did. Why don't you go ahead and publish it natural news tonight
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.760]  In case they try to steal that headline so everybody can now go and get it tonight
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.000]  Look, I mean, let's go ahead and do a soft launch tonight. We'll post it on info wars the morning. How's that sound?
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.360]  Well, that's that's that's great. I'll do that tonight
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.880]  I'm gonna have a formal pdf put up tomorrow
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:48.360]  But I'll get it out early on natural news tonight in an article form
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.680]  Also videos will be posted of course about it
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:56.040]  But in addition to laying out the the censorship methods both covert and overt censorship
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.680]  Which include things that have not really been discussed that much before
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.320]  Such as doubt interrupts
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:08.200]  Doubt interrupts are ways that that the tech giants cast doubt upon your website when a user is trying to share a link about you
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.520]  They try to create doubt and then they do characters
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:17.320]  Interest like you're on the phone with your neighbor and they go don't really listen to bob. This is literal real-time interfacing right?
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:22.440]  There's there's also email interruptions. So you have an email newsletter
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:29.080]  You probably know I'm sure your tech people can confirm that when people subscribe from gmail that gmail will
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.720]  single you out for a specific
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.480]  severe type of censorship as if they were walking down the street accosting the mailman
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:44.760]  And grabbing all the letters from info wars and ripping them to shreds to make sure that people can't receive the mail that they've asked for
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.400]  So that's also going on as well. So a high-tech version of what went on the soviet union
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.880]  Absolutely
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:57.240]  But more importantly this report alex lays out what I believe is a detailed intellectual argument
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.560]  That demolishes the attempted internal
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.360]  Justifications for censorship that are currently being invoked by these tech giants. Let's be clear
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:09.240]  You are breaking down and we're breaking down the blueprint of how they're doing it
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:13.320]  So congress who are not tech experts and others the president can take action
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:17.160]  Every claim you make of this big piece that's coming out, you know, like a week in the making
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:20.200]  Is is is their own admissions continue?
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:26.440]  That's right. It's it's well documented and well cited the entire document which is about 40 pages
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.120]  I'm just I'm just doing a final review of it tonight to get it online
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:37.240]  It's intended to be reviewed by lawmakers and regulators who must take a role in this if we are going to take back
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:44.360]  America and this platform of free speech take it back from the tech giants that have become very dangerous monopolists
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.800]  who
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:55.000]  Assert their quote right to censor you and others like myself because they they assert that you are hate speech or that
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.120]  You the things that you talk about such as wanting to protect your nation's own borders are
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:07.480]  Inherently hateful or racist which is of course an absurd idea. So I dismantle all of those logical fallacies
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.560]  I also
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.680]  How these tech giants are outsourcing the censorship efforts to third-party companies
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:20.840]  Moderators so-called trusted flaggers so that the companies themselves can claim well, we're not censoring anyone
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:27.880]  We outsource that job to these other people, but all those other people are radical left-wing organizations such as the SPLC
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.720]  So all of this was laid out in the document. It's going to be bombshell
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:37.720]  It's going to open the eyes of a lot of people and it's coming out, you know in less than I don't know 16 hours or whatever
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.720]  It'll be out tomorrow morning
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.040]  amazing and and
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:47.960]  The reason we're so serious here and the time is short is they're going to a new level where they're calling for complete
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:54.360]  Internet de-platforming system-wide within lawsuits to shut down our sites themselves
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.440]  And then and then obviously targeting the the servers to kick us off
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.880]  I mean this this is the big move ahead of the midterms and something big they're planning against trump
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.000]  Well, you're exactly right and one thing I point out in the report is that robert muhler himself
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:16.360]  Declared that the russians attempted to defraud the united states of america through very small
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:23.880]  Monetized attempts to interfere with the election. Well by that very same logic google facebook youtube twitter and others are massively
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.360]  Defrauding the united states of america in this run up to the midterm elections
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:37.560]  They are selectively censoring voices that are pro trump pro america pro constitution conservative voices pro christian voices and so on and this is
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:45.800]  Fraudulent this is an actual organized criminal operation when you come back run through a first look at this key report, but understand folks
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:51.800]  What's different is they're in literally hundreds of articles thousands. They're out there. I can't read them all admitting
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.320]  They want to silence everybody and admitting info wars is the test case

[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:27.000]  Just can't wait to get on the road again the great texan willy nelson bringing us in
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.920]  Mike Adams is our guest right now. We'll go back to him in just a second
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:38.680]  What's been missing is a blueprint a layout of how big tech the democratic party soros and the globalist
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.800]  Are admitting in their own publications like we're idiots
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:49.960]  How they're already censoring nationalist conservatives classical liberals anybody they don't agree with and now they've ratcheted up to over 80 percent
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:53.720]  Of our posts our emails everything being intercepted being blocked
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.840]  It's beyond anything that the east germans ever did
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.480]  It's beyond what the nsa has been doing but now mike adams
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:10.280]  Engineer computer programmer best-selling author researcher working with info wars is going to publish a big 40 page report tomorrow
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:13.000]  paul watson has one as well because i was talking to
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:18.840]  People in congress folks in the campaign the white house and they said we know what's going on
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:23.400]  We're looking at some anti-trust busting. We're looking at you know other areas
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.120]  What's the full scope? Well
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:32.200]  Just last week the democrats came out admitted their plan just banned everybody. They've already shadow banned us so they've already
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.840]  Jumped the shark here. They've already made the first amendment of martyr in their own words
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:43.080]  They've already really upset a lot of people but they bought off all the leftist so-called free speech protectors
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.640]  the electronic frontier foundation
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:49.480]  Uh, the I mean we have the top lawyers the first amendment. They were big liberals. They go. Oh, no
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:52.280]  Nobody does it now, but maybe mark rondaza and
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:58.600]  uh, alan dershowitz and a few others everybody else is scared or on soros payroll like the like the
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.240]  southern property law center
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.240]  Or the folks over there
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.920]  With the aclu so it's up to us the libertarian conservatives the nationalists to put a report out
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.600]  This report will be out in one version of natural news calm
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.640]  The info wars.com early in the morning a pdf version hammer congress hammer talk radio
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:23.240]  Hammer everything because the fights now again. They start with info wars. They demonize it. They get a mob mentality
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.480]  They try to take it all down. We got eight and a half minutes. Mike Adams. I'm gonna shut up. You've got the floor
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.480]  Break down what's in this report why it's so important where we are right now
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:38.040]  Okay, this this report is as you mentioned intended to be a primer for legislators
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:43.960]  You know many people in washington dc don't have a strong tech background and they don't understand exactly how the censorship is happening
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.880]  Or even how to fight back against it
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:51.000]  For example, there are hidden algorithms that google uses a search search down ranking algorithms
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.600]  Manual penalties, you know punitive measures that are sort of black box measures that no one can see
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.840]  So there's a lack of transparency even in the way that the censorship is happening
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:07.160]  Where those who are being censored are not fully aware of how they're being censored the shadow banning for example on twitter and facebook
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.880]  So all of the people in washington dc who are really they're going to have to assert
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:17.880]  The government authority to protect free speech and stop the malicious discrimination
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:25.080]  You know we we live in a country where we have roundly rejected the idea that individuals can be discriminated against by private companies
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.000]  Based on the color of their skin, but we're now enduring mass discrimination
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.840]  By private companies based on the color of our ideas
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:40.040]  This must be rejected by the government and the government has a compelling interest to assert the right to protect the free speech of individuals
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:45.160]  In our free society. Were you going to say something? Uh, no, no, no. I I was just uh
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.280]  I was just I was just agreeing with you. I'm sorry
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:53.320]  Joining joining remotely sometimes I hear sound effects. I thought that I thought you were about to speak on something
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.280]  No, you're doing a great job. Mike and great job in your report continue
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:04.520]  Yeah, uh, also along with this are very important intellectual arguments that can be cited by legislators or even a judicial
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:11.320]  Decision makers. This is a roadmap in their own words that they're censoring us and laughing about it
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.640]  That that that everyone can see in their own prima facie words
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:25.400]  Uh, absolutely, but also modernized with with the understanding the context that today we live in a hyper connected online society
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:30.360]  And that the ability to express yourself through online platforms is now an essential
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.920]  means
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:37.720]  Or go to a go to a restaurant or use a bathroom or a hotel
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:41.960]  They are utilities in their own words. They're monopolies and they're denying us access
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:48.280]  And the left's justification of saying that they have the right to cut you off because they don't like the color of your speech
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:55.560]  Is essentially the same as if they were to say well an electrical company could cut off your electricity because you're using that electricity
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:02.200]  To run a computer to post comments that are endorsing Donald Trump. Well, that would be absurd or if a company said
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:10.280]  Uh, you don't have the right to receive radio because you're tuning to you know info wars or shawnhannery or whatever
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.720]  You shouldn't have the right to receive radio signals because we don't like the content of the signals that you're receiving
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:19.160]  So we're going to surround your house with a radio blocker technology
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:24.760]  That this is the the sort of equivalent of what they're doing today or imagine if 30 years ago
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:30.200]  When the physical public square or let's say the neighborhood sidewalk was a place where you would
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:36.440]  Roll down the sidewalk. You'd say hi to your neighbors. It might discuss things with friends. What if they said well?
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:40.440]  We don't like you. You're not welcome here. You can't walk down the sidewalk
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:46.200]  Not solely because of the color of your speech and the color of your ideas. That's what google is doing today
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:49.400]  That's what facebook is doing youtube twitter many others
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:57.560]  These are gross violations of fundamental human rights human dignity and even i believe constitutional protections
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:04.200]  But they must be asserted by the government and the assertion of the protection of free speech
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:07.320]  Is of course already enshrined in federal law
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:17.080]  The federal government could right now indict the executives of let's say facebook for engaging in racketeering violations of the rico act
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:20.120]  They also don't have to go that far. They could right now
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.440]  invoke antitrust
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:26.200]  Regulation action and they could break apart these companies. These are monopolies
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:32.600]  Some of them have 80 or 90 market share of their respective service areas like you break them apart exactly
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:36.440]  People need to have options the other very important point alex
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.240]  This is a crucial logic point to the argument of all of this
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:45.240]  Is that these giants achieved monopoly dominance through fundamental fraud when they were launched
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.560]  They pretended that they would be an open platform
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:54.520]  Don't be evil will always be open. We're a utility. They broke their public trust. They broke their social contract
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:58.760]  That's exactly it and i even used that that term the social contract
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:05.800]  But you see now after they have achieved market dominance and monopoly status power and influence on the internet
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.120]  They now then selectively ban
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.360]  conservatives, but they don't even give
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:16.200]  The reasons for they don't even tell the truth that they're banning you because you're talking about
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:20.760]  Well, they're bragging all these undercover videos that oh the slaves don't even know we've banned them
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.680]  And so here's the deal. They think congress is dumb. They think the president's dumb. They think we're dumb
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:32.360]  They've gone so far though that they will be defeated now and again go back to the media
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:36.920]  The leftist old dinosaur media that's being you know shut down by the by the big tech
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:40.520]  They're bitching saying give us access shut everybody down
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:45.320]  They're already force-feeding mainstream news. They're like shut up. We're already censoring them
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:50.680]  Isn't it beautiful how cnn and the new york times and the washington post just blew the whole thing wide open
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:58.440]  Well, yeah, it it's fascinating too because as I outline in this report cnn is essentially asserting this absurd
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.680]  of
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.640]  Truism where if you if you work for cnn
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:11.640]  You are magically transformed into a god-like omniscient being who can see reality with absolute clarity and has no personal bias whatsoever
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:15.480]  You are distortion free if your paycheck is signed by cnn
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:22.200]  Well, this assertion by the way reminds us of the pre magna carta days when the king said that
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:27.000]  That I the king am the representative of god and thus my word is the word of god
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:29.720]  And thus I define what is right and wrong
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:36.040]  cnn is invoking the same argument as these kings of ancient times saying that they define
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.160]  Reality they define the southern prairie law center and all these groups that now run
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:46.040]  Politifact and all that these are the most discredited groups cnn's discredited
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:50.120]  How are they like the high and mighty supreme court deciding this and look at this headline?
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:57.640]  I love the new america, but they're wrong cnn upset that facebook hasn't censored info wars facebook said we censor him 80 percent
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:02.840]  They said we just don't want them to know we are being censored. That's the whole point
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:09.320]  Well, the fact that cnn is calling for censorship of a competing news organization your organization
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.480]  It really exposes that cnn is fraudulent from the get-go
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:22.280]  It exposes the the lack of any kind of intellectual honesty in their position and again cnn pretends that they have a unique
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:24.680]  divine power
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.480]  To discern truth and that this power is not accessible to anyone else
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:35.560]  And yet they never explain how this power came to be acquired solely by cnn or other left-wing media outlets
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.520]  That's what gave him the divine right of kings that you're talking about. I mean they had hundreds of articles last month
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:43.640]  shang banned my old videos on amazon
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:51.880]  Documentary shang they're not documentaries ban them and they called in-game nazi when the whole film is against eugenics and nazis
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:58.920]  Right, right, of course. Well, this is the thing the news narrative is not about news
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:02.600]  mainstream news narratives are about controlling and shaping reality
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.320]  The news is the cover story. Uh, they pretend to be providing information
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:11.880]  The general public is rebelling. So now they're taking the velvet glove off going iron fist
