[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:30.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones well last
[00:30.800 --> 00:37.440]  Friday we saw 130 people killed in Paris and six different attacks and now on this Friday we've got
[00:37.440 --> 00:46.000]  at least 27 dead in Mali in West Africa after two gunmen screaming ala Akbar took over a
[00:46.000 --> 00:54.560]  Radisson hotel and basically stalled the police with demands while they executed people but they
[00:54.560 --> 00:59.840]  took their time they asked folks if they were Muslim if they said yes and could cite verses of
[00:59.840 --> 01:11.600]  the Quran they were not killed but if they could not they were executed Mali hotel attack UN counts
[01:11.600 --> 01:18.800]  27 bodies as Haas the situation ends we'll be breaking that down gunmen shouted God is great
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.080]  or ala Akbar as they stormed the Mali hotel security source said and of course they have strict
[01:24.080 --> 01:31.360]  gun control in Mali so obviously no one could fight back I'll guarantee you let's say if you
[01:31.360 --> 01:36.480]  attack the Radisson in downtown Austin, Texas nice little hotel sometime when we have guests in
[01:36.480 --> 01:42.720]  town to be on the show that we put them there it's an affordable mid-range nice hotel I'll
[01:42.720 --> 01:47.280]  guarantee if somebody tried that here in Austin, Texas that maybe one out of ten people's packing
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.640]  they know how to shoot center of mass and these guys would have got their butts shot off real fast
[01:52.640 --> 01:57.360]  in fact we've had events like this where an off duty police officer up in garland stopped the
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.320]  mass murder once the jihadi started storming in to kill everybody it didn't go the way they
[02:02.320 --> 02:06.960]  thought it was going to go they thought they'd roll through the parking lot shoot up the front
[02:06.960 --> 02:13.120]  of the building didn't go too well and that's why the head of Interpol came out two years ago
[02:13.120 --> 02:19.760]  when the Kenya attacks on shopping malls there also by the God is great folks said that the
[02:19.760 --> 02:28.000]  answer is arming people like they quote do in Texas and Colorado but meanwhile Europe is passing
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.320]  laws France is passing laws I have at my stack here today to restrict what guns you can get
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.080]  you can get some hunting rifles and shotguns in places like Austria and places like France if
[02:40.080 --> 02:45.280]  you do background checks jump through a bunch of hoops go through a bunch of hunting club
[02:45.280 --> 02:52.960]  you know filings you can get a gun but now they want to go ahead and take those because the terrorists
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.000]  got their fully autos illegally and made their explosives illegally or got their plastic explosives
[02:58.000 --> 03:05.520]  illegally none of that matters they came in illegally and they just said come on in we love
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.480]  your fake passports show that Germany now could declare civil emergency put troops on the streets
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.720]  to ban demonstrations against the invasion and that's in the stack today as well
[03:17.760 --> 03:23.120]  Obama will not let the missing migrants the missing refugees because they're now getting
[03:23.120 --> 03:30.240]  dumped off from Louisiana New York from a florida california from minnesota to tennessee
[03:30.240 --> 03:38.080]  they're just disappearing they're disappearing they're not showing back up at the refugee centers
[03:38.080 --> 03:44.080]  and obama says we will not track them because it violates their rights but they'll spy on you and I
[03:44.080 --> 03:51.200]  and put us on no fly list and have the IRS terrorize more than 10 000 churches and other tax
[03:51.200 --> 04:02.320]  exempt organizations if you're right of mouse a tongue literally they issued they issued one 501c3

[04:08.800 --> 04:17.200]  organization you can matter again pure naked discrimination at a sickening level racketeering
[04:17.200 --> 04:24.640]  in everybody's face nothing done unprecedented in fact i'm just going to set this stack down
[04:24.640 --> 04:31.520]  because this particular stack is probably 30 articles or more it's pure pure new world order
[04:31.520 --> 04:37.200]  and really reveals everything so that is coming up and we're going to get into a lot of science

[05:04.400 --> 05:08.480]  but german authorities covered it all up according to an eyewitness who was told to keep quiet about
[05:08.480 --> 05:13.680]  what he saw a paramedic saw an explosive device and ambulance before the germany versus netherlands
[05:13.680 --> 05:17.840]  game which was canceled after french intelligence told german authorities about the impending
[05:17.840 --> 05:22.640]  attack involving several bombs authorities later claimed no explosives were found but the paramedic
[05:22.640 --> 05:27.200]  says he witnessed the bomb and was ordered not to talk about it after special forces arrived on the
[05:27.200 --> 05:31.520]  scene three police officers were also reportedly disciplined for leaking information about the
[05:31.520 --> 05:36.080]  alleged discovery of the bombs german authorities may have decided to conceal the fact that the
[05:36.080 --> 05:39.920]  explosives were found in order to prevent a panic amongst the fans who had gathered around the
[05:39.920 --> 05:44.720]  stadium before the match and also to protect german chancellor angelo merkel was open the

[09:07.360 --> 09:12.800]  attack hotel in molly's capital i guess the associated press didn't get the memo that you're
[09:12.800 --> 09:19.600]  not supposed to use the word islamic extremist or radical islamicist again two gunman took hostage
[09:19.600 --> 09:29.440]  170 people at a radisson blue hotel in molly and french us special forces reportedly with
[09:29.440 --> 09:40.320]  the local molly paramilitary storm the facility taking them out about 15 minutes ago the hostage
[09:40.320 --> 09:45.200]  takers would look at people's passports and ask them if they were muslim then have them
[09:45.200 --> 09:50.480]  recite the quran they took their loving time over the few hours and if they could not cite the
[09:50.480 --> 10:00.640]  quran they were terminated freed hostage breaks down some of what happened will be going over
[10:00.640 --> 10:08.160]  some of what they witnessed but i want to tie all of this in together we have french recruiting
[10:08.160 --> 10:13.680]  centers seeing a surge in army recruitment after the attacks they've now raised the death toll in
[10:13.680 --> 10:20.720]  paris now that more have died to over 130 and i thought i'd just add the french people if they
[10:20.720 --> 10:24.000]  want to really do something shouldn't probably join the military i'm not saying don't join the
[10:24.000 --> 10:31.120]  military i'm saying your own government backed the very al qaeda slash al nazar slash ices jihadis
[10:31.920 --> 10:37.920]  in the last five years in syria france has been one of the main culprits of this and now in the
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.320]  whole world turned against ices they kind of double crossed them two weeks ago and started
[10:42.320 --> 10:48.240]  bombing some of their facilities and so now ices is struck back that's the clearest picture we've
[10:48.240 --> 10:55.600]  got of what exactly happened so i just think the french president that's currently in sarcozy before
[10:55.600 --> 11:05.280]  him are all guilty of libya and guilty of syria and backing jihadis and suny radicals it's a fact
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.200]  and so we got john carrey running around threatening russia saying you better not join with the
[11:11.200 --> 11:16.000]  chiites the chiites haven't been starting fights the chiites
[11:18.640 --> 11:26.560]  are the minority in islam and are not on the offense clearly and the west is allied with the
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.440]  saudi arabian backed majority group and that's what's happening so france the french people
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.640]  you want to do something your war is at home with the criminals there in your royal palace
[11:36.640 --> 11:40.720]  where they have the government buildings located today
[11:43.600 --> 11:51.280]  update now let's just tile this together obama dhs says they won't track missing syrian refugees
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.080]  because it violates their constitutional rights liberals continue to tell us that
[12:00.080 --> 12:04.720]  vetting process refugees is under control they insist the federal government is monitoring every
[12:04.720 --> 12:10.400]  syrian once they make it to america see even that that statement most of them aren't syrian
[12:10.400 --> 12:16.720]  but of course that's totally fake earlier this week a syrian refugee went missing in louisiana
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.040]  the refugee was in the process of resettling in the baton rouge area when he went missing
[12:21.840 --> 12:25.840]  and it goes on to have the white house announcing they will not track him because it would violate
[12:25.840 --> 12:32.160]  his constitutional rights even though he's here basically illegally and has run off and violated
[12:32.160 --> 12:36.640]  it and is on a type of diplomatic parole no he can't be tracked but you can
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.840]  they can have license plate reading cameras scan you and if your insurance is up to date the cops
[12:41.840 --> 12:49.200]  are flagged to pull you over but that's okay but you can't track the folks out of syria
[12:50.720 --> 12:57.840]  here's another headline washed in times obama's actions shield most illegals from deportation
[12:57.840 --> 13:03.600]  even as courts stall amnesty so he doesn't care if the court say it's illegal and he can't act
[13:03.600 --> 13:09.120]  outside congress and all the rest of it they're just not deporting anybody
[13:11.040 --> 13:13.840]  and then ice is ordered to release them totally above the law
[13:16.800 --> 13:22.480]  absolute abject lawlessness by the president they have a name for it when a leader does whatever
[13:22.480 --> 13:29.360]  they want it's called dictatorial behavior it's called authoritarian totalitarian behavior
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.040]  and people that engage in those activities are called dictators or despots let's continue
[13:35.040 --> 13:41.920]  the crackdown begins europe just passed strict controls to make it difficult to acquire firearms
[13:42.640 --> 13:45.120]  zero hedges breaking this down at info wars dot com
[13:45.120 --> 13:52.640]  now when you read deeper again you can go get a special license take courses and get a single shot
[13:52.640 --> 13:59.040]  rifle sometimes or a shotgun for hunting in austria for hunting in places like france but
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.080]  it's very hard it's like getting a concealed carry in chicago you got to jump through some
[14:04.080 --> 14:10.720]  political hoops a very low gun ownership what is it in france like 3% generally wealthy people out
[14:10.720 --> 14:18.000]  in the countryside england 20 something years ago went ahead and just banned that too where you can't
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.120]  even basically be part of a hunting club it's it's nearly impossible
[14:24.720 --> 14:29.920]  well now they're moving to get rid of that so you knew that was coming we have democrat congress
[14:29.920 --> 14:36.720]  people in what new york and in illinois both this week coming out saying france shows us that we
[14:36.720 --> 14:40.560]  should restrict the second amendment because terrorists might get guns oh and they're plastic
[14:40.560 --> 14:46.240]  explosives and they're full auto ak-47s lady they smuggled the guns in they were military guns you
[14:46.240 --> 14:53.920]  moron but she's not a moron she knows her constituents are idiots meanwhile we're going
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.160]  to cover this story just because these uh german uh police officers these female police officers
[14:58.160 --> 15:02.800]  look or soldiers excuse me look really good and they're black uniforms i mean i just i'm sorry
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.440]  women and black uniforms look good especially when they're super hot i'm sorry i'm sorry just
[15:07.440 --> 15:14.560]  have to say it Germany could send troops into the streets for the first time since world war two
[15:15.520 --> 15:22.480]  berlin debates contentious move as france extends state of emergency and idly boost protection so
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.320]  germans can't have guns but oh they're politically correct when i see videos and photos like
[15:28.320 --> 15:34.080]  like almost all the women i mean i guess all the cops in germany now are women which i'm not against
[15:34.080 --> 15:40.240]  women being police or military but when when it's they juxtapose it in the socialist wonderland
[15:40.240 --> 15:47.280]  where men can't have guns and men can't wear pants but but but women can again it's all basically a
[15:47.280 --> 15:54.000]  sigourney weaver brainwashing it's an agenda so we're going to take your guns the few you that
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.160]  have been able to have them with all the special licenses and now we're just going to put women
[15:58.160 --> 16:04.240]  with guns everywhere who by the way are arresting people that demonstrate against the open borders
[16:04.240 --> 16:11.200]  and facebook all over the world i've got several articles today use banning people and the police
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.800]  are actually going after people in in the netherlands and sweden and germany that criticize the open
[16:16.800 --> 16:24.480]  borders so women in black uniforms show up to nanny state you and they have found statistically that
[16:24.480 --> 16:29.040]  women police officers in totalitarian regimes will enforce some of the most bizarre garbage it's
[16:29.040 --> 16:35.680]  just been proven it's just been proven uh that in totalitarian states women will follow orders
[16:35.680 --> 16:43.120]  more often than men in many cases you just look it up for yourself uh pupil 63 million muslim support
[16:43.120 --> 16:49.760]  isis in 11 countries and is generally because women have something to prove on average more than men
[16:49.760 --> 16:56.240]  when they're put in a traditionally male role of course i think it's sexist that i can't have babies
[16:56.240 --> 17:01.200]  so i demand the government give me a womb transplant i don't care because 100 million dollars i want it
[17:01.200 --> 17:08.160]  i want it now because i'm stunning and brave my daughter's dressed up my parents french bulldogs

[17:24.240 --> 17:29.600]  25 percent of europeans excuse me french pulled this year that they call them french i think they
[17:29.600 --> 17:36.720]  are french so they support isis boy that's that's kind of scary 25 percent because see it's real
[17:36.720 --> 17:42.400]  rock star in islam now and you kind of get impact and bullied if you aren't part of the jihad against

[17:52.000 --> 17:58.320]  why not the most important question i mean you know i saw this meme up on info wars dot com this
[17:58.320 --> 18:05.280]  morning it said uh when we're done destroying our country we're going to destroy yours it was in the
[18:05.280 --> 18:11.840]  article about the reformation and the rest of it now islam needs one the most important question

[18:16.880 --> 18:21.200]  of just the russians blowing up the oil refineries donald trump said they should do months ago
[18:21.200 --> 18:26.000]  just more common sense the media made fun of that because that's how they think they're constituent
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.600]  viewers are idiots which they kind of are uh he says blow up the funding and the fuel the energy
[18:31.600 --> 18:37.040]  of the enemy that is insane because that's the first thing you do in war is cut off the funding
[18:37.040 --> 18:46.320]  and blow up the energy just 101 default cut off funding blow up the energy sources i mean even
[18:46.320 --> 18:51.200]  kids should know that and empire strikes back what's the first thing the imperial walkers
[18:51.200 --> 18:58.000]  try to take out the generators in children's movies you got to figure it out but when donald

[19:06.640 --> 19:10.720]  written by foreign insurance companies to rapists and double and triple prices and there was going
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.960]  to be huge fees and fines associated with it and now it all came through so he's discredited

[24:33.040 --> 24:42.000]  with the sunday radio slash tv transmission so obama shields most illegals from deportation
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.400]  even as courts stall amnesty and in places like travis county austin texas the black democrat sheriff
[24:51.120 --> 24:54.560]  their the democrats are running people against him trying to unseat him
[24:55.200 --> 25:03.280]  nationally demonizing him because he deport's on average three to five felon illegals a week
[25:03.280 --> 25:08.880]  to be technical he gives them to ice who then just releases them but you see that's that's
[25:08.880 --> 25:16.880]  that's dereliction of duty in my view not deporting more people that are criminals but he does at least
[25:16.880 --> 25:24.640]  go after a few felons and so they have to attack him for doing anything because common sense might
[25:24.640 --> 25:31.440]  actually be recognized then and then the whole house of cards starts to crumble that we're told
[25:31.440 --> 25:37.360]  we live in a police state to keep us safe but our borders are wide open and giant floods
[25:37.360 --> 25:44.400]  of illegals are literally marching in over the southern border and in europe the images
[25:44.400 --> 25:52.720]  of just tens of thousands marching in in huge columns towns of 102 in germany are told you
[25:52.720 --> 25:59.920]  will take 300 400 people towns of a thousand are told you'll take 5000 you'll pay for it
[25:59.920 --> 26:08.160]  you'll accept it you're bad and troops are going on the streets to make sure you submit to it
[26:08.160 --> 26:16.560]  meanwhile shock dhs report there are 73 airport employees on terror watch list
[26:18.160 --> 26:22.400]  so how will they properly screen syrian refugees the fbi and others have said
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.160]  they're not even screening them but obama says no the fbi is screening them everything is fine
[26:26.160 --> 26:32.160]  but we can't track anybody because it violates their rights but we'll track everything citizens do
[26:33.600 --> 26:39.440]  i mentioned this but here's the article dutch police sees control of facebook page
[26:40.240 --> 26:46.560]  over anti migrant comments authorities remember zucker berger month ago got caught with merkel
[26:46.560 --> 26:51.600]  onstage saying don't worry i'll shut everybody down oh and hillary's in the news they've gone to
[26:51.600 --> 26:58.080]  the popular uh comedy club in la and they're actually asking the club to remove videos off their
[26:58.080 --> 27:04.480]  site and to not have people speak there that criticize hillary because if you ever start
[27:04.480 --> 27:11.200]  laughing at her it's game over folks see because she's such a liberal she wants speech ban and so
[27:11.200 --> 27:15.520]  we're going to strike back against this in the third hour today we haven't done a contest in a while
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.320]  this one's going to be big we'll be announcing it in the third hour today but we're going to have a
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.240]  contest and we're going to run this one really good i'm going to have rob jacobson honcho it
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.600]  he'll kind of organize it all make sure the good entries get posted daily at info wars.com
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.240]  we're going to have a contest make fun of hillary first amendment contest i'm going to shoot a video
[27:34.240 --> 27:41.360]  about it today and it's only going to run for one month uh so it'll run from the 21st to the 21st
[27:41.360 --> 27:48.960]  of december and then i will announce i will announce the winners uh on january 2nd of the
[27:48.960 --> 27:54.000]  make fun of hillary free speech contest and i'm because i'm telling you folks it's getting crazy
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.880]  i heard this yesterday on the radio after i left i've seen it in stack but i didn't read the article
[27:58.880 --> 28:04.960]  about hillary wants comic silence the criticizer and i just didn't get to it and then i actually
[28:04.960 --> 28:12.560]  started reading it i mean the last factory's probably one of the top incubators of top talent
[28:12.560 --> 28:20.560]  in the country i mean that's where joe rogan my good buddy joe rogan the the the the the modern
[28:20.560 --> 28:28.640]  chuck norris that is kind of the character he's become a lot of people who are not well including
[28:28.640 --> 28:35.440]  including fbi officials looking into whether yes it's all very very funny but clinton goes after
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.920]  the last factory in fact we put me that judicial lost article i've got a couple of them here but
[28:39.920 --> 28:47.120]  but with a straight face i can't believe i'm on air talking about national polls with a large
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.760]  segment of democrats wanting people that don't agree with man-made climate change being arrested
[28:52.480 --> 28:58.880]  i don't even believe that even though they admit it it's just so alien so totalitarian so
[28:58.880 --> 29:10.960]  unliberal so scary so seedy so discredited so disgusting so over the top and then they're
[29:10.960 --> 29:17.680]  actually going after the last factory to silence them to not make fun of her this is the political
[29:17.680 --> 29:24.000]  correctness that's why jerry seinfeld won't go to any colleges this daughter has rebuked him
[29:24.000 --> 29:31.760]  like out of some new age cult like like a false of doom follower with a double edged dagger for his
[29:31.760 --> 29:42.240]  political heart is there a dagger such as this she wields from me his daughter comes to him and says
[29:42.240 --> 29:48.720]  the word father and mother is bad boy and girl you will not say it anymore it's sexist we're on

[30:23.440 --> 30:28.400]  by the paris attack where french nationals were targeted for the government's decision to carry

[39:01.040 --> 39:05.360]  when i take her off my shoulders it feels like for 20 minutes i'm flying you know the longer
[39:05.360 --> 39:08.800]  you carry a big pack the better it feels you know the longer when you take it off
[39:10.560 --> 39:14.560]  that's what it was like now i'll warn you you should talk to a physician this is not a joke
[39:15.280 --> 39:18.720]  it'll go into your thyroid and push out all sorts of stuff and i'm not gonna say that's

[40:21.920 --> 40:28.720]  paris france now they're in london we're on the front lines i may try to send paul to molly he's
[40:28.720 --> 40:32.880]  pretty close to africa just three hours away the issue is they'll strike somewhere else next that's
[40:32.880 --> 40:38.240]  what i want to ask paul watson right now we now take you to london england paul joseph watson
[40:38.240 --> 40:45.520]  then we'll talk to joe biggs in the segments after that he is by parliament square right across from
[40:45.520 --> 40:52.800]  big bend like i recognize where paul is he's very very close to where the statue of of course the
[40:52.800 --> 40:58.880]  big world war two leader winston church hill is located paul i know you guys are also planning
[40:58.880 --> 41:04.320]  to go to some of the ghettos where women are told don't wear dresses wear hoods on your heads no
[41:04.320 --> 41:10.720]  liquor uh where brits are told or irish or scots are told you're not welcome we know that happened
[41:10.720 --> 41:18.320]  in russells belgium with you guys what have you discovered uh in the last 24 hours since we talked
[41:18.320 --> 41:23.840]  and what do you make of the molly attack that's killed at least 27 people well obviously one of
[41:23.840 --> 41:28.080]  the big stories today is the molly attack but also the raids in mollenbeek of course we went
[41:28.080 --> 41:33.520]  there a couple of days ago and were basically chased out the area um by these fanatics that
[41:33.520 --> 41:38.320]  weren't keen on us being there now they've had nine more raids in france and belgium last time i
[41:38.320 --> 41:44.320]  checked seven in mollenbeek so again that's an epicenter of this ghettos ideology that's why they
[41:44.320 --> 41:49.760]  call it the ghettos capital of europe another interesting story which i put up on in paul's
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.960]  dot com this morning is remember we had the stadium attack or the attempted stadium attack
[41:54.960 --> 42:00.560]  in germany hanover um on tuesday night of course they evacuated the people 90 minutes before the
[42:00.560 --> 42:06.640]  kickoff of the soccer match between germany and the netherlands they later claimed that no explosives
[42:06.640 --> 42:12.640]  were found even though french intelligence tip them off beforehand to a five-man cell that was
[42:12.640 --> 42:19.120]  planning to attack that soccer stadium as well as a train station and a bus stop it since turns out
[42:19.120 --> 42:24.640]  that a paramedic has now gone public and this is being uh reported by bill newspaper over in germany
[42:25.360 --> 42:31.760]  she said that she or it is a he he directly saw the explosives he saw the bomb in the ambulance
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.800]  during that whole incident can you imagine if that would have gone off and killed thousands
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.240]  my gosh what are the socialist thinking it's only a matter of time until this happens do
[42:42.240 --> 42:47.920]  they just not care as long as they wreck europe well you could look at it two ways and police have
[42:47.920 --> 42:52.240]  come out as well and divulged information about these bombs they've been disciplined they obviously
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.960]  want to keep this quiet you could say well they didn't want people in the immediate area to panic
[42:56.960 --> 43:02.400]  because there were thousands of fans gathering outside they wanted them to calmly leave the area
[43:03.040 --> 43:07.440]  or it could tie into the fact that german authorities just in the past few weeks have
[43:07.440 --> 43:13.200]  covered up a lot of these migrant rape cases that have happened in and around uh refugee camps in
[43:13.200 --> 43:18.880]  germany uh another criminal behavior because in their own words they didn't want to quote legitimize
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.560]  critics of mass migration so if it turned out that this germany attack was again like paris which
[43:24.560 --> 43:28.880]  we know now at least three of the individuals involved in the plot and the mastermind himself
[43:29.600 --> 43:35.360]  abused this refugee crisis to slip into europe if it turned out that that attempted attack in
[43:35.360 --> 43:39.760]  germany on tuesday night which would have killed hundreds of people if it had been successful
[43:39.760 --> 43:44.320]  was again the work of some of these migrants that have slipped into germany as a result of
[43:44.320 --> 43:50.480]  merkel rolling out the red carpet imagine the damage that that would have done given that the
[43:50.480 --> 43:55.920]  anti-immigration party in germany is already soaring in the polls it's up to something like
[43:55.920 --> 44:01.600]  15 percent from basically having zero support whatsoever 10 years ago so did they not release
[44:01.600 --> 44:06.080]  that information because it was a real attack and because it was uh set to be the work of
[44:06.080 --> 44:09.920]  you know some of these migrants that have stepped in or was it just to get people away from the area
[44:09.920 --> 44:15.600]  calmly but a paramedic is saying that she saw the bomb she saw the explosives in this fake ambulance
[44:15.600 --> 44:21.280]  and that was also a divulged by three police officers who have been disciplined for releasing
[44:21.280 --> 44:26.080]  that information so at the moment it's still alleged but that we ought to be given medals
[44:26.080 --> 44:31.200]  they should be given medals and this is came out days ago now we have police officers coming out
[44:31.200 --> 44:37.520]  very credible we need to get this story completely viral now on facebook on twitter it's one of the
[44:37.520 --> 44:43.280]  top stories on info wars dot com report german government covered up terror attack at soccer
[44:43.280 --> 44:50.560]  stadium witnesses told not to talk about discovery of bombs this is our top story on info wars dot
[44:50.560 --> 44:56.960]  com again we have a new redesign site that works much better it's much quicker but i still don't
[44:56.960 --> 45:01.680]  like the fact that we can't red link an article we're going to have that capability by next week
[45:02.320 --> 45:08.640]  but this needs to be moved back to the tiles not just the front page this needs to be pushed widely
[45:08.640 --> 45:14.720]  listeners you have the power to expose this another terror attack in molly today if this
[45:14.720 --> 45:20.480]  was in the u.s and i'm not kidding we've had attacks at for hood that killed 14 we've had attacks
[45:21.200 --> 45:26.560]  at army navy recruiting centers marine corps recruiting centers and our media is so controlled
[45:26.560 --> 45:33.200]  here they never say it's islamic terror so it is absolutely essential okay we can red link then i
[45:33.200 --> 45:38.720]  want it red linked we need to red link this right now and get this out to people because i'm telling
[45:38.720 --> 45:43.840]  you folks if they would have blown up that stadium they might actually cover this up and claim a
[45:43.840 --> 45:49.600]  right winger did it i'm telling you german government is so socialist so collectivist so
[45:49.600 --> 45:55.200]  evil that i'm telling you they will go to any length to cover up islamic terror paul in fact more
[45:55.200 --> 46:00.640]  and more i'm worried that with all the brainwashing all the preparations with homeland security that
[46:00.640 --> 46:05.600]  we know they've got active programs they've done it before to frame patriots for what the globalist
[46:05.600 --> 46:10.480]  have done or what their islamic radical henchmen have done and i'm really concerned about that paul
[46:10.480 --> 46:15.120]  because i've been thinking how will they get away with this and more and more i think they may
[46:15.120 --> 46:20.800]  blame it on us i mean they already blame everything else on patriots well i mean then you've got
[46:20.800 --> 46:26.480]  obama saying that anybody who is concerned about that in america is worried about widows and orphans
[46:26.480 --> 46:32.240]  we've already had one of these syrian refugees go missing out of louisiana still missing and
[46:32.240 --> 46:37.120]  the ths came out and said oh we can't track them and we don't really care because of their
[46:37.120 --> 46:42.640]  constitutional rights this is somebody who's just arrived in the country they told them oh you
[46:42.640 --> 46:47.600]  you're going to dc to meet up with your family you need to register with authorities in dc again
[46:47.600 --> 46:52.560]  didn't track them didn't ensure they did it and now that migrant has completely disappeared
[46:52.560 --> 46:56.960]  we've got reports of suspicious people around the pentagon all these other reports and it's a
[46:56.960 --> 47:00.400]  threat and people are worried about it and rightly so of course now they're trying to get the bill
[47:00.400 --> 47:07.040]  through they've got it past congress harry reid has vowed to squash that bill simply to have checks
[47:07.040 --> 47:12.000]  on these migrants coming into america stringent checks which is what is required after what happened
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.880]  in paris and obama says oh everybody's just concerned about orphans and widows well i mean
[47:16.880 --> 47:22.320]  here's how the constitution works if you're a citizen you don't have to go through stringent
[47:22.320 --> 47:27.360]  checks until you committed a crime and or suspect but when you're coming here as a migrant or as an
[47:27.360 --> 47:32.240]  illegal or as an immigrant you have to go through the process like ellis island was a three month
[47:32.240 --> 47:36.960]  process you know they keep saying oh get rid of the statue of liberty we're not letting unlimited
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.400]  people in we've been the most open but it doesn't mean we have to have a submarine with no doors on it
[47:44.240 --> 47:50.320]  well i mean it's people say oh all these migrants are on terrorist well not everyone out on the
[47:50.320 --> 47:55.280]  street at night is a criminal but you still lock your door right i mean it's just common sense
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.920]  and even in europe now without you know shengen i didn't make a big deal out of the bubble but when
[47:59.920 --> 48:05.200]  we were in barcelona one of our crew was out walking on the beach at night and got robbed i mean you
[48:05.200 --> 48:10.960]  know it's just a fact i'm sorry go ahead yeah so now in europe even without you know less life
[48:10.960 --> 48:15.520]  less safe air open border policy they've said they're going to have checks every time you go
[48:15.520 --> 48:19.440]  between a different european country currently there are no checks whatsoever you don't have to
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.240]  show your passport or anything they're now going to check people's passports and run it against a
[48:24.240 --> 48:29.040]  list of terrorist suspects now if they're going to run your passport anyway they you would think
[48:29.040 --> 48:34.000]  they would do that in the first place but now at least europe has introduced that check so again
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.600]  it's not kind of this oppressive crackdown it's just basically making sure that you want a terrorist
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.400]  and apparently old barma is not too concerned about introducing a similar program in the us
[48:44.400 --> 48:51.360]  and it is a concern because we had a poll two days ago i posted it one third of syrian migrants
[48:51.360 --> 48:58.000]  they polled them had sympathies or supported isis one third of these syrian migrants coming in
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.920]  were polled and they said they had sympathies with isis so again it's this myth that this is a tiny
[49:03.920 --> 49:10.000]  tiny minority of radicals it's not we had a pew poll out today which i posted upon
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.840]  on prisonplanet.com this morning 63 million muslims had sympathies with isis you know about 200
[49:17.840 --> 49:24.240]  million didn't all they tell in the truth who knows well look at the greece turkey game the soccer
[49:24.240 --> 49:31.520]  match where they the entire crowd basically for turkey chanted a la ot bar during the moment of
[49:31.520 --> 49:37.120]  silence this this is absolutely despicable because you contrast it with what happened in england
[49:37.120 --> 49:43.440]  england played france the same night impeccably observed minutes silence turkey immediately
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.320]  started booing it because again there's a lot of isis supporters in turkey they blame france's
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.240]  foreign policy for the massacre of all these innocent people who had nothing to do with it
[49:52.240 --> 49:58.000]  then you had azerbaijan again same thing booed the minutes silence out of complete disrespect to
[49:58.000 --> 50:04.000]  the paris victims i'm telling you folks of the a lot of these third world muslim nations want war
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.560]  they absolutely hate the west and that means they hate us not our criminal governments
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.640]  and our criminal governments are working with them against us it's so obvious how do you think
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.880]  obama plans to get away with this or merkel don't they understand that they've gone too far
[50:20.560 --> 50:26.000]  it's complete insanity um you know you've got a situation in paris where people should be angry
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.160]  they should be angry with their politicians for having this policy that allowed these terrorists
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.680]  to come in in the first place and yet what do we see in paris yesterday there was a video
[50:35.680 --> 50:41.200]  hogger muslin it was a guy wearing a blindfold at the plaster deliver he wasn't even saying sorry
[50:41.200 --> 50:46.960]  himself he was saying c muslims aren't bad it was a stunt it was just ridiculous virtue signaling
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.560]  so all these liberal hipster douchebags could feel better about themselves again they should be angry
[50:52.560 --> 50:56.400]  at their government for allowing you're right paul you're right we're gonna come back with you and

[53:00.400 --> 53:06.640]  an important message right now the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable
[53:06.640 --> 53:12.960]  crisis but they're about to lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart
[53:12.960 --> 53:19.120]  in ways you never imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to
[53:19.120 --> 53:24.800]  protect look i've made predictions like this before a few years ago i warned that the housing prices
[53:24.800 --> 53:31.360]  would collapse before that i warned that dot-com companies would crash and they did those who listened
[53:31.360 --> 53:36.560]  had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will
[53:36.560 --> 53:44.640]  affect us all i've posted a free video at dollardanger.com maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions
[53:44.640 --> 53:50.560]  but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself you can watch the video for
[53:50.560 --> 54:01.680]  free right now by going to dollardanger.com again that's dollardanger.com the genesis communications
[54:01.680 --> 54:08.480]  radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[54:16.080 --> 54:21.840]  coming up former u.s senator mike revel's going to be joining us on air he wants to talk about the
[54:21.840 --> 54:27.520]  28 pages the saudi connection and i want to explain there are criminal elements in our
[54:27.520 --> 54:32.960]  government and others that have been working with the wahhabis out of saudi arabia for more than 50
[54:32.960 --> 54:40.320]  years and wiki leaks is talking about it the iranian leaders are talking about it whether you
[54:40.320 --> 54:47.040]  like wiki leaks or like the iranian leaders it's a fact and so when these attacks end up happening
[54:47.040 --> 54:50.480]  our government's trying to cover it up because they're in bed with these people now have they
[54:50.480 --> 54:54.400]  turned against each other now is there really bombing of ices going on that isn't conducted
[54:54.400 --> 55:03.840]  by russia looks like it and ices is getting really upset but we'll get the senator's take on all of
[55:03.840 --> 55:09.280]  this right now i'm going to joe biggs in front of big ben and parliament they're in london england
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.640]  joe biggs i know you guys are planning to go into some of these no go ghettos to document that with
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.960]  paul then you're going to be coming back i guess it's sunday uh or correct me if i'm wrong but
[55:18.960 --> 55:24.000]  what have been your observations so far we now have 27 dead at least executed if they couldn't
[55:24.000 --> 55:32.240]  quote the quran uh ian molly at this radison hotel i mean i tell you they need to have a
[55:32.240 --> 55:37.680]  second amendment there don't they yeah of course they do i mean that's one of the great things
[55:37.680 --> 55:42.160]  that makes us who we are in america the fact we have that ability you know like we said before
[55:42.160 --> 55:47.520]  when ices came to texas they were shot down it was quick it was over you know when you give people
[55:47.520 --> 55:53.120]  the ability to arm themselves you take away that body count because like we've said before
[55:53.120 --> 55:57.440]  when seconds count it takes police minutes to get there and by the time they show up you
[55:57.440 --> 56:01.040]  have a body count it doesn't mean that the police aren't good or any of these guys can't do their
[56:01.040 --> 56:06.080]  job but they can't be everywhere at the exact same time when something like that happens you know
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.160]  last i thought it was very interesting i was watching uh anderson cooper they actually flew
[56:10.160 --> 56:15.600]  him into paris he was out there at the uh one of the uh memorial areas and they had this washington
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.840]  insider they called him that had flown in and they were asking they said why do you think the
[56:19.840 --> 56:25.600]  attack in paris happened and he says it's simply because of the eu's policy of the wide open borders
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.320]  he said the fact that you can go from country to country and not have your passport checked and not
[56:30.320 --> 56:35.680]  have your bags checked and you're able to move freely and do something like that so essentially
[56:35.680 --> 56:41.120]  you have this washington insider saying hey we need to close the borders the wide open borders
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.520]  is what allowed this attack to happen saying the sky is blue and they act like that's politically
[56:45.520 --> 56:50.080]  incorrect but but then meanwhile back here they want to leave the borders wide open so they know
[56:50.080 --> 56:55.520]  what caused that attack and yet they want to allow that to happen here and i'm sitting here thinking
[56:55.520 --> 57:00.080]  why would they want to let wide open borders happen well you know in europe all across europe
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.880]  they're implanting those uh those chips into people's hands do away with the borders put chips
[57:04.880 --> 57:08.640]  in everybody's hands you can control what's going on that way and it seems like that's something
[57:08.640 --> 57:15.760]  they're trying to move in towards what are your other observations well thus far you know
[57:17.280 --> 57:23.600]  that attack in paris i think was something that really motivated a lot of these cells out there
[57:23.600 --> 57:28.160]  that they saw the success rate uh from their standpoint and i believe that more and more
[57:28.160 --> 57:31.440]  of this stuff is going to happen you're going to have more distractions you're going to have
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.840]  more attacks you're going to have a lot of things going on it's not over it's heating up it's picking
[57:35.840 --> 57:40.400]  up very quick i mean as we've been saying well last few months you can see this storm coming
[57:40.400 --> 57:46.160]  now the leading edge has hit us it's going to get more intense and these people are unpopular in the
[57:46.160 --> 57:53.280]  west but they're rock stars in their home countries where this is very popular that's what people don't
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.920]  get so that's why this is going to intensify yeah i mean there there was explosions in the subways
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.480]  here last night at the baker street stop at the underground and they're coming out saying oh it's
[58:02.480 --> 58:06.080]  you know that was a controlled that this and that but there's stuff happening everywhere people are on
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.400]  edge planes are getting turned around all this stuff's happening people setting off fireworks
[58:10.400 --> 58:15.680]  and scaring people everyone's on edge and that's what they want complete and total fear did you
[58:15.680 --> 58:21.680]  have any trouble getting back into england um no not at all i mean it's a lot easier to go from
[58:21.680 --> 58:26.480]  brussels into paris and it is from paris into england you've got to go through more security
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.320]  but you know inside there you can do whatever you want from brussels all that all right stay there
[58:30.320 --> 58:34.240]  i want to ask where you're going next because i want you guys again to go in to these no go

[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:24.720]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones we got 27 dead in molly africa at a radison
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.200]  hotel where jihadi's took over they were killed about an hour and 15 minutes ago but not before
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.560]  they killed 27 people that couldn't quote the caran we can quote the caran you were good to go
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.680]  so yes they kind of discriminate the liberals won't mind that they think it's kind of cute
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.680]  they like the jihadi's going back to joe biggs in london england
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.320]  were reportedly there were explosions in the subway last night but that's been covered up
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.160]  joe biggs other observations and where are you going next well we actually have a store we're
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.360]  going to work on i don't want to give away too much about what's going on but we actually have
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.320]  what we believe between all of us is a pretty big store that has to do with the embassies
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.560]  overseas and i'll leave it at that because when we spoke to the person in france
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.400]  due to some legalities you know we've got to see what we can do how we can get the story out without
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.600]  getting up our passports frozen and i'm not able to get back home on sunday oh they're not going to
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.520]  do that they don't want to make a big scene out of it you want to pray for them to pull stuff like
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.440]  that but go ahead yeah but i think it'll be a really big story it's going to open up a lot of
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.000]  eyes and it's kind of i think it'll be really big and at the same time you know we'll do what we can
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.600]  to uh film these areas tomorrow we uh we spoke to a few people they know of where some are you know
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.840]  we might get a rent a car or something like that and try to do some filming and just to kind of show
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:45.360]  how those areas are and get some of those signs and get some of the minaretts and the call to prayer
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.760]  and all that that's what i really want you to get i know you got run out of brussels i understand
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.680]  you didn't get footage because it was so spontaneous and restaurants and on the side of the road and
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.080]  cars following you but people need to see that to really understand how serious all this is because
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:07.440]  it just shows they want a clash of civilizations to destabilize our countries what do you think
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.320]  i mean you obviously joe biggs we're almost the last week saying more attacks are coming
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.600]  i agree that's a no-brainer i think it's only going to get more intense in the next few months and
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.800]  the word we have from washington is we're going to have a guest on about this sunday they are
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.760]  expecting an attack in the united states in the next two weeks well it's interesting when you
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.280]  actually look at these this isis kill list it's target list that they put out um they've only
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.360]  specifically named washington dc that's the only place where there's any kind of political
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:44.240]  involvement whatsoever but there's places like berk virginia san marcos texas some really small
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.360]  places that just don't make sense and the fact that they're upset with how the west does something
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.920]  they're upset with the bombings all this i've never understood why they don't go and attack
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.480]  government facilities why they keep killing uh you know going into theaters and things like that
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.680]  that really doesn't help their cause out whatsoever so the first one to get the maximum kill rate
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:10.000]  they don't want to hit hard targets because they're cowards yeah so i i just don't you know i i do
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.280]  think that there's attack imminent in america you know it's it's stuff's popping up everywhere it's
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.000]  happening it's ramping up it's only going to be a matter of time and i guarantee you before christmas
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.880]  there will be something huge and catastrophic and that's just the sad part about it because i know
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.200]  they're getting ready like we said before it was on the top of drudge this morning you know the
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.480]  french prime minister is coming out warning of isis using some kind of chemical attack and we were
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.160]  one of the first to report on that yesterday morning as well that's right well actually
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.800]  info was broke that and we should do a story about that as well what do you make of them the german
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.840]  government covering up police are saying the ambulance full of explosives at the sport stadium
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.800]  well i believe kind of what on the side of paul that they did that to maybe not have mass confusion
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.880]  hysteria people running around and creating a bigger scene i think that someone alarmed it the
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.240]  the person he was speaking about then the cops heard about and they said all right well it's
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.840]  nothing you know everybody just kind of walk away we're going to cancel the game and you do that to
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.880]  kind of keep the chaos from going on because like i've said before whenever they do these attacks
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.120]  there's someone and that crowd filming that's what they want that's how they get their propaganda
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.600]  across because when they film those attacks and they film people screaming crying running in fear
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:28.640]  it helps uh get more of those possible recruits out there that they see that they see the fear
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.280]  they want to be part of that yeah because for us this would not be a recruiting video it makes
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.480]  us want to throw up but for the scum they're trying to get the little psychopath wimps they
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.600]  really get off on people being scared of them yes exactly so i think that it could have been
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.520]  definitely something like that i definitely think that there was a good chance there was explosives
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.120]  and that ambulance and they tried to do what they could to kind of cover that up and push it back
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.360]  but at the end of the day who knows like you said the german government's corrupt uh yo we're out of
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.040]  time i'm gonna let you get back to your reporting i'm gonna come talk to you during the break it's

[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:13.680]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.840]  two months ago i flipped out on air for about a week they had conferences with the vice president
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:29.120]  and others in dc they announced the strong cities initiative to actually put un hubs in every major
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:36.720]  us city federally but also un funded to train police to train local governments on how to
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:43.680]  follow un treaties and rules and i really freaked out about it obama administration and the un
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.880]  announced global police force to fight extremism in us they admit they're going to try to restrict
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.600]  free speech they're going to basically put you can't make this up community organizers black
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:59.040]  lives matters on police review boards to federalize police but that's only part of it it's taking
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.800]  everything over universities you name it and all this bullying is about that the un in arizona
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:12.640]  in texas saying we can't have a border same stuff they're doing in europe well this is fox news
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:20.640]  planned un hub in washington aims to influence u.s counterterrorism strategy the united nations
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.400]  agency will set up hubs to coordinate federal and local police in a management plan covering the
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:34.160]  activities in the office of the high commissioner for human rights or the oh chr global government
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:42.960]  and it just goes in and talks about how it's going to basically direct our local governments you
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:49.040]  cannot make this up i'm going to be covering this more after our guest leaves us at about 40 after
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.400]  i'll get more into the molly attack to kill 27 today at the rattison blue
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.120]  hotel where the jihadis went in and said can you quote the caran if you couldn't they killed you
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:06.480]  you so we've got all of that news now i i want to be clear i was against the iraq war because
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.760]  saddam hussein didn't attack us not that he was a good guy i was against the invasion of libya
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:17.680]  because qaddafi had worked with with the last for eight years he had given up all his weapons
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.880]  and he was helping all of africa i mean qaddafi really was giving 99 of the money the state had
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.040]  to the people aqueducts roads colleges women going to college women not having to wear hoods on
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:36.560]  their heads i mean he really was being altruistic just a fact our government bipartisanly went in
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.600]  with the french and others they supported it sarkozy set up qaddafi he thought obama was his
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:48.400]  friend and hillary joked we came we saw he died now those very wahabi has found a saudi arabia
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.120]  that pulled off vengazi are in syria and now they're coming into turkey they're coming into europe
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.680]  they're coming into the united states most the refugees really aren't refugees in my view they are
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:04.720]  are jihadis that have come in 80 percent or military age men and you're going to see attacks
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:12.560]  now senator mike revelle mike revelle dot us uh is somebody who i really respect whether you
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:19.360]  be liberal or you be conservative the point is is that he has always exposed back when he was in
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.320]  the senate as well that there's this close relationship with our government and the saudi arabian
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:33.200]  government that corrupt monarchy that is funding so many radical sunnies and he has been pushing
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:43.360]  to get the 28 pages released he has been pushing to expose all of this because i've talked to walter
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.760]  jones there's a republican of course revelle was a democrat i've i've i've had the quotes from senator
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:56.720]  graham who was on the commission former senator graham foreign government involvement 911 shouldn't
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.640]  stay secret and that's what the senator is talking about but i've talked to people that have seen it
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:08.400]  and it was bare minimum saudi arabia running the supposed hijackers our government standing down
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  and people say well it goes further than that of course it does but what we can prove is enough
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:20.240]  for a criminal investigation to open this all up so i'm simply going with what we can prove
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.880]  where is the apologies of those that's demonized senator gravelle myself and others we have all
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:36.560]  these whistleblowers who've gone public fbi nsa translators sabelle edmunds and others exposing
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:42.240]  the fact that our government protected al qaeda colonel schaefer could have killed bin laden
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.600]  twice before 911 was ordered to stand down so why are they allowing these attacks to take place
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.000]  because then they can take our freedoms they don't want to war against iraq they want to war
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.240]  against america so i really appreciate senator gravelle's courage in exposing all this and taking
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.560]  time out to to to go out and speak about what's happened and to put it in context with the tragic
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.400]  attacks because with our western governments turning a blind eye to radical islam that allows
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.720]  radical islam to attack the peaceful muslims that are the majority in the middle east in other areas
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.880]  and to bully them in the submission and it allows the discrimination against muslims that are not
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.720]  going along with this so it's a very serious situation senator thank you for coming on with us
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:30.240]  well thank you for having me alex i've been on with you before sometime back i tried a long time
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:35.680]  ago it's it's good to have you back on senator one of us is getting older both of us are my
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.920]  friends you look good uh where do you want to start i mean you're a real expert on this you've been
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:46.960]  speaking out on it since 911 let's start let's start with the 28 pages uh it's it's absolutely
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:55.520]  somewhat ridiculous that they've been classified because the the congress is a co-equal branch
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:02.080]  of the government and so the executive cannot classify anything that affects them and it can be
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:08.160]  top secret because under the speech and debate clause of the constitution a member of congress
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:14.560]  has a right to inform his constituency of what the government is doing of course that's the
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:22.080]  foundation of democracy if if you as a citizen do not know what your government is doing then how
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:30.320]  can you react to change the policies of government this is why this issue is so fundamental to our
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:38.320]  democracy and why it's so important now obviously it will end and i can into it as you can what the
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:47.600]  28 pages say and it essentially says that the saudi government uh both of uh not necessarily
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.680]  official but the the way they spread money around there to anybody who's anybody then they take
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.440]  this money and they can donate it to whatever cost they want so the Saudis over the last three four
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:08.480]  five decades have have uh have financed the wahhabist doctrine which is of course this doctrine
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.560]  where they cut off heads where they stone people where women uh have no rights to speak of it all
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:21.120]  the most oppressive form of Islam no question and and of course we make a big deal about
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:28.000]  the ISIS doing these cruel things but but Saudis do this is a matter of course and we put up with
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.520]  this and the reason why we put up with it is because we think that's fact that they provide
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:41.360]  oil to the free world in the quantities they do that this is important it's not important in that
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.760]  when you're comparing what the what the results of this sucking up to Saudis have done over the
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:55.280]  period of years what we see in the Islamic world today with jihadists the extremists is all a product
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:03.120]  of wahhabist teaching that was been paid for over generations by the Saudi government and the Saudi
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:09.840]  leadership well i obviously agree with you it's a stated fact but ignorance about these geopolitical
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:16.960]  and cultural issues is just rampant i hear some pundits saying we should blow up iran for this as
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:23.280]  if they're connected to isis when i ran is the arch enemy of isis exactly and not only that
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:30.400]  the enemy of Saudi Arabia it's Saudi Arabia and israel that have been agitating for the
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:37.600]  united states to invade iran when iran is not a threat to us in fact iran would be a natural
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:45.280]  ally for us in the area but but because netanyahu for 20 years has been shouting for the rooftops
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.200]  said well we're going to get the bomb next week we're going to get the bomb in a year this is
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.560]  20 years ago he's been doing it so essentially what we've perpetrated is a fundamental big lie
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:03.360]  about what the situation is in iran iran has the the ayatollah khamenei after the revolution
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:08.640]  what he did is he issued a fatwa saying that we would not use weapons of mass destruction
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:15.360]  now this is part of their religious beliefs and khamenei the present leader has issued also a
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:23.120]  fatwa saying the same thing and so iran never wanted the bomb in fact on july 15 when they signed
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:28.960]  the agreement in janiva rohani the president made a statement which was so prophetic he says
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:35.040]  thank god we now have an agreement to stop iran from getting the bomb which he never wanted to get
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.800]  and that's been the facts of it and and so now well whether whether we buy that or not the
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:46.080]  point is our government overthrew their secular leader of 53 muhammad mozadek with a false flag
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:53.440]  declassified operation ajax on record we probably double crossed the shah and put radicals in i mean
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:18:00.160]  over and over again we see this destabilization campaign and we know Saudi arabia's got nukes
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:08.000]  that's now been coming out it is just a mess and it's a war crime to overthrow syria and put
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.960]  basically al qaeda in charge no no question and uh and of course every time you hear our president
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:23.040]  talk about syria he talks about the fact that uh the Assad has to go well who are we to dictate
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:30.640]  this is part of the neocon control of the administration uh under bush and under obama
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:37.200]  and that is the control that says that we can go around the world and demand regime change
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:43.360]  from anybody that doesn't quite knuckle under to our hegemonic leadership well sure i mean
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.440]  looking at net and yahoo and i try to stay neutral on all this and i see the different
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:53.440]  factions but why would israel want to be cozyed up with Saudi Arabia and then want to have this
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:59.040]  war with iran and and iran does make some insinuary statements but it's just crazy then we see the
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:05.440]  ayatollah come out and say two days ago repeat what wiki leaks said said hey the west is behind
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:11.120]  isis our media translated it saying the ayatollah says america carried out the attacks well that's
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.960]  not what he said they always twist it he said your government helped create isis in syria
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:23.200]  and the friendship involved as well well that's the truth so i'm not siding with iran i'm siding
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:28.880]  with the truth but it's another example how they do twist what iran says all the time all the time
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.320]  and that's that's the unfortunate part of american media american people aren't stupid but they are
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:41.040]  totally uninformed as to what's been going on in the world i could i could guide you to another area
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:48.240]  where now in the middle east it's a mess we invaded iraq we we invaded uh or caused the
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:56.800]  invasion of uh libya and now syria and and you recall when uh victoria newlin who's under a
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.720]  sec who was uh assistant secretary of state under hillary made a statement that we had spent about
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:10.080]  four billion dollars to destabilize the government of the ukraine yes and then after the coup we we
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:15.760]  blame putin but we're the ones that instigated that whole mess and and i can point to you what's
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.320]  going on in south george soros bragg that he helped get the four or five billion dollars
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.520]  they're moving right up against the russian border with missiles it is insanity it's very hurtful
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.440]  because i'm pro america and i don't you know have delusions about these other countries
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.880]  but it is bad to see the people running things really becoming the villains and losing america
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.480]  soft power isn't this a disaster for our overall national interest i mean haven't they mismanaged
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:48.480]  things totally totally in fact i i draw this parallel alex and that is the four horsemen
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:56.400]  of the apocalypse that's been our foreign policy conquer war uh famine and death and that's what
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:03.680]  we've been doing for the last 25 30 years in world affairs and we're continuing to do it and of
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:09.760]  course we spice it up with the rhetoric oh we're for freedom our values and all this our values
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:17.520]  abroad have been horrible horrible and we see this now in southeast asia when we try to as we try to
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:24.800]  demonize putin and our american media we're doing the same thing with zizhen ping and and the chinese
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:32.960]  and uh and all that is is for us here let me draw a parallel in in world history uh there's always
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:40.480]  there's been about 16 instances where you have a rising power about to displace an existing
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:46.400]  power superpower and that's what's going on between ourselves in china china is rising
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:51.840]  but it's only rising economically it's not rising militarily this is a repeat of world war one
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:58.400]  well boy i'll tell you you just hit the nail on the head if you look at what happened in august
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:08.560]  1914 and you you look at what's going on in the the way we're teeing up things in a world today
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:15.680]  an accident could happen and it would thrust the world in a thermonuclear war an accident and that's
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:21.360]  exactly how the first world war started was one accident after another that nobody wanted to go to
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:27.600]  war but we all went to war and that's the situation we find ourselves in right today with the us
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.880]  putting out provocations to china that are unnecessary and it was all because in world
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:38.080]  war one as you know and many historians are making this parallel now because the british empire was
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.600]  in trouble it was overextended it was threatened by german inventions germany was displacing them
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:49.680]  with technology and railroads and science and chemicals and textiles and pharmaceuticals and
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.640]  so the british empire openly in their newspapers daily said let's start a war with the germans
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.600]  the austrian-hungarian empire you know let's defeat them and then that disaster led to world
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.080]  war two and that disaster i mean this but this time as you said we've got nuclear weapons
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:10.480]  we can't afford this this time that's right and then when you listen to the republican candidates
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.120]  and even hillary at that point talking about how we should uh essentially go to war
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:26.240]  and this is insanity and this is our leadership the congress is as culpable as as is the executive
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.560]  and that's why you're tirelessly on your own behalf and working with larouche pack
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.320]  out exposing what's going on and i guess out of self-interest me too people say oh thank you
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:41.040]  for what you do thank me for what i do i'd have children i don't want to have a war with china
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:48.080]  and russia alex you put your finger right on it it's self-preservation uh we could start a
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:55.840]  land war whether it's in ukraine or in uh asia but it would quickly become a thermonuclear war
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:01.520]  a land war may not affect you and i directly but a thermonuclear war we are both doomed
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:07.920]  and that's the reason why we should be concerned as citizens and citizens not only at the united
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:14.000]  states but citizens of the world one of the problems we have as a country is we americans
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.040]  think we're so superior we're smarter than anybody else we are an empire in decline and we refuse to
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:29.840]  admit it and and and we we shore up our military expenditures which are sacrosanct with fiat garbage
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:34.720]  money i want you to speak to that and people spin it like putin's insulting us saying we're not
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:39.200]  exceptional he's just simply saying if you read the full text or watch the videos i have
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.920]  he goes stop thinking you're god stop thinking that nobody has interest with you stop thinking
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:50.240]  you're invincible stop encircling us uh you know and stop being delusional and and you know that's
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.600]  the truth we need to stop being so delusional we're exceptionally in debt we're exceptionally fat
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.800]  we're exceptionally ignorant we still have a lot of exceptional things and america was exceptional
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:06.160]  in good ways i mean i love america but i'm telling you we really have become a very dangerous joke
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.720]  if when you love your country you want your country to do the right thing and and of course
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:19.440]  so many of these crazies have this my country right or wrong that is the height of immorality
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.040]  because when your country is doing wrong you should work to correct it so that we can be proud of
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:31.440]  everything we do not just some of the things we do amen to that former u.s senator mike
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.400]  ravell is our guest he's talking on talk shows writing articles what are the best websites i
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.480]  know there's your website there's the declassified the 28 pages website uh mike ravell dot us what's
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.680]  the best sites for folks to visit to learn more about getting the 28 pages out stopping a war
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:55.440]  i shine them the the larouche website would be the best source what's called the uh executive
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:03.200]  intelligence just larouche pack dot or yeah and and that site is just awesome in the details
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:10.560]  and the the abilities they bring to it they have a global organization and they're extremely talented
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.160]  people and knowledgeable people and and i'm i'm delighted to be associated with them
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.880]  unfortunately i don't have any staff and i just represent myself at this point in life
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.960]  but they've been very helpful in getting the message that i have uh out and uh with the
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.840]  with the people not only in the united states but worldwide well i've got to say people don't know
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:38.560]  that linden larouche was in the os s in world war two and then uh would make weekly helicopter
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:43.600]  flights to see i headquarters would meet with ronald reagan and then the demonization of the
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:49.440]  larouche group is is another victory of media mind control uh just where they'll go larouche
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:55.840]  ha ha ha having no idea that he helped launch star wars uh the space you know the modern space
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:01.200]  program uh the the the systems that made the soviet union back down he's credited with that
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.880]  and and and it was a victory for the establishment uh when the bushes had him set up and put in
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.760]  prison because they were so jealous of him uh i mean i may disagree with some of the ultimate
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:17.120]  goals of the larouche group but the analysis historically is just so spot-on it's really
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:23.120]  amazing uh how they expose the drug war as a replay of the boxer rebellion and and how the
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:28.080]  globalists took down how the imperialists took down china i mean the more things change the more
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.480]  they stay the same and i know that he's 94 now still completely there but not really doing
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.520]  interviews anymore uh but i'm glad that you're there for him to help do this senator gravel because
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.320]  uh without the larouche group so many people and again i'm not a part of it either but i mean just
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:47.440]  the stuff in their intelligence report because i've studied history myself is so accurate it's
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:54.080]  really not anywhere else condensed the way they do it you're so right and and and i could encourage
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.080]  people to go there and as you point out when you when you read their stuff it's the analysis
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:08.080]  this the intellectual breath of it all is just awesome uh and now what you read when you meet
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:14.800]  these people and several of them have been been to jail they've been been to jail as part of a
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:24.400]  political persecution yes and and so when you meet them you you're just struck by one how sincere
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:32.160]  and kind they are how humble they are and how bright they are and so i i can't uh well they want a new
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:36.640]  renaissance they know america could be the greatest country in the world and lift up the planet and
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.880]  they've they've they've really got some amazing ideas and and if not the latest ideas of course the
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:50.480]  endorsement of the chinese silk road one belt one road where where you would take the western china
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:57.760]  and tie it with roads and rapid rail transport and internet connections of fiber optics from
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.960]  western china all the way to europe north into scandinavia south it would just explode all the
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:10.320]  economies oh here here's their vision they want to unify the world economically at a higher level
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:17.040]  than it presently exists so everybody can enjoy the benefits of modernity this is what they're
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:24.080]  advocating uh the china is trying to lead and of course the uh larus group has put a lot of meat
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:30.720]  on the bone to help them as they pursue that goal now compare that goal to the united states
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:38.320]  militarization of the planet with lead it with us leading as a hegemon here obama let's come back
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.600]  and talk about that because when we say america globalist megabanks to control our country that's
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:50.720]  my issue is there in control of our government stay with us we're on the march the empires on
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:30:01.840]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network islamic extremists armed with guns and throwing
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:08.960]  grenades stormed a luxury hotel in molly friday morning hostages were taken at least 27 people

[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.480]  while some hostages claim they were freed only after reciting verses from the quran fears remain
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:26.160]  that the attack in bamako may be linked or inspired by the paris attack where french nationals were

[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.480]  everything sir we have a soviet submarine launch detection i wish i didn't know about any of this
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:44.320]  i wish i was like everybody else the parallel between world war one and how the germans were
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.880]  peacefully the austrian-hungarian empire was peacefully dominating and becoming a new empire
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.040]  economically and the british empire didn't like it and basically started world war one
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:01.600]  and then you know what happened that led to the versace treaty really horrible sanctions on germany
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:09.280]  designed to create the next phase we can't have this mode anymore is what former senator
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:15.200]  mike revelle is getting at and i'm not saying the chinese aren't somewhat militaristic but
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.120]  they're conquering the world through economic behavior u.s firms could have gone out and and
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:26.480]  had 96 of rare earth minerals controlled in australia and africa and latin america i mean
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:32.400]  everywhere we're being out competed on every front our elites have sold our jobs out to china
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.920]  so it's also schizophrenic where they're starting fights with them but also selling out to them
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:44.960]  and the answer is development the answer is free market countries working together the problem is
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.840]  they've created a fake world government that's run by these corporates that are crony capitalist
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:56.080]  so how do you get past that and how do you get past the point of these unstable foreign policies
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.640]  run by special interests that don't even understand what they're doing at a certain level
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.120]  that's what concerns me as senator is our own military has been telling the white house let's
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:11.600]  not start a war with russia let's not start a war with china they've been saying don't back isis
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:18.800]  but the bureaucrats and the corporate interests they want to play general and think they're invincible
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:25.680]  and no matter how many things blow up in their face they just keep increasing their their hubris
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:30.240]  that that doesn't that doesn't look very good that doesn't make me sleep very good at night
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.480]  you're a smart guy geopolitically but around the world what is your take on the state of the
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:41.760]  planet right now and how we somehow get our country back well first off you have to acknowledge and
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.880]  you do it very well in fact i don't want to miss this opportunity i'm interviewed by a lot of
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:52.640]  organizations and i gotta tell you you're the most competent that this this handles an interview
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:59.280]  so you and your staff deserve a great thank you sir i'm flattered but but what when you say what is
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:07.920]  the answer you have to look back and say well you know we it all started with 9 11 and 9 11 gave
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:14.400]  license to the political and military leadership and the police powers of the state to go ahead
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:23.680]  and take over control in an appropriate unbelievable sums quote in the name of safety uh in and they
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:30.720]  totally in the media is part of this plan to continually install fear in the public general
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:37.440]  public you alex you have a greater likelihood of dying of cancer than of ever being touched by
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.360]  anybody who's a terrorist that's the fact of the situation better chance of a honeybee killing me
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:55.520]  yes sorry the killer bees yes but the answer i don't have i well i do have and i personally
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:01.360]  believe that the answer is direct democracy and that's very difficult for people to absorb
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.320]  because when you look at the problem there's only two venues for change one is the government
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:13.520]  where in lies the problem and the other is the people but the people don't have the power to exercise
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:21.920]  an intelligent judgment in this regard intelligent judgment is lawmaking the central power of government
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:29.840]  is making laws and and so if only the leadership has the power to make laws and only the leadership
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:34.800]  has the power to change the constitution then of course there is no way out of this dilemma
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:39.120]  it's an oligarchy and i used to really be afraid of of direct democracy within some
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.720]  type of republic framework obviously for protections but now i entertain it because we
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.480]  already have global corporations who have a direct democracy buying our politicians
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:57.760]  so we already have a direct democracy of the tiny elite so you know that's right you know alex you
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:04.240]  put your finger on when you say well let's let's have direct democracy but no we're afraid of the
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:10.320]  people but we're not afraid of the people who are screwing us to death right now with the oligarchs
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:17.200]  and and not only in the united states the united states of the globalization of our military
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.480]  capability is done through nato that's the globalization of the military industrial complex
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:30.080]  so what is the answer now with the supreme court decision of united where corporations as individuals
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.600]  can pump more money into politics than they ever could in the past will never be able to fight
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.560]  them with the way things are structured today we and then there's the flip side they'll use campaign
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.680]  laws to restrict free speech and and as they're now talking about it's so hard to navigate
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:52.720]  because they can twist anything we try to do that's right and and of course isis and it's ill
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:40:01.840]  win because here look what happened in paris guys with weapons guys with some explosives take on the
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:08.800]  world essentially and throw the world into a fear cauldron where we just spend billions and billions
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:16.560]  of dollars in reaction to what was done for several thousands of dollars at that rate isis is winning
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:22.000]  now they're gonna bankrupt us whether they win on the ground they win by what they cause us to do
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.440]  in our governance process look at how reagan launching fdi made the russians panic and then
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:34.080]  we're we're panicking to islamic radical terror and it is bankrupting us it certainly is that's
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:40.880]  the whole issue i was raising before we are an empire in decline and we're trying to lean on our
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:48.560]  military prowess to to continue our leadership role in a world and we're going to go the way
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:54.560]  of the spanish empire and that the at that at the end of the spanish empire the best thing that
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.640]  the spaniards could do is make wonderful swords well we're going to be able to at the end of our
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.640]  empire make wonderful weapons that will foist on the world and of course that could bring about
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:12.880]  the armageddon we all fear very well said former senator mike revel is our guest he was working
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.480]  with larouche pack dot org where you can read the breakdown on the 28 pages what we know is in it why
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:24.720]  needs to be made public so we can force a real discourse about this as best you can tell because
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:30.240]  i'm trying to figure it out what is really going on in syria with isis being backed by the west but
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:36.560]  now not being backed by it or is that for show and where do you see all that going i mean again why
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:46.000]  would our policymakers openly back al-qaeda because of stupidity because of the the here again the
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  nail con vision is to have regime change whether it's in ukraine or whether it's in syria every
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:03.520]  time president obama talks about syria he always lays the gauntlet out that well asad has to go
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.280]  well who are we to determine of asad has to go and then he turns around and we say oh they're dropping
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.560]  barrel bombs on their people they're dropping barrel bombs on the areas that are in revolution
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:20.560]  which essentially is what we did in our civil war and so asad is the constituted government
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.000]  and the russians are backing asad well he's given up his weapons and he said i'm ready for a process
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:35.360]  to leave of course he is but he doesn't want to leave the way obama the way qaddafi left left
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.960]  after we turned against him and drug to the streets dead that's right that's right no
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:48.240]  the the answer the answer is for the american people to become informed and to go ahead and
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:54.560]  react in this forthcoming election i can tell you i personally support bernie sanders i think that
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:00.320]  when he's talking about a revolution that that this is the answer now whether he'll be able to
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:06.560]  affect it whether the american people will rise up with the information that being put out all i
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:11.200]  can do is hope so and well see there's a lot of really smart intellectual people like you that i'd
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.520]  call a classical liberal and then you talk about bernie sanders though you know he wouldn't even
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:20.160]  get rid of the federal reserve or or audited once it got down to it he acted like he was for it to
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:25.520]  look him down to it i mean i agree he's not a organized criminal like hillary uh but you know i
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:32.160]  just i just think we give corporations more power either way you know big government they can run
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.600]  socialism they can run fascism they can run i don't know how you ever get them out of politics
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:43.040]  well first off it's it's you follow the money where's the money going the money's going to
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.920]  hillary the money's going to republicans uh it's not going to bernie sanders bernie sanders is
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:54.560]  getting his money from ordinary people the average contribution is what 33 dollars so what what will
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:44:00.080]  happen is after bernie gets into power and i hope he does because it's our only hope at this point
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.680]  then what he'll be faced with is how does he overcome the military industrial complex how
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.560]  does he overcome the control of wall street which will have control of the congress that's not going
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:16.000]  to change he's got to find a way to go over the head of the congress to go directly to the american

[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:08.640]  i wanted to go to the gym i wanted to push myself and work out harder and that led to me being able
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:13.280]  to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that which i would
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.880]  never done i i never would have done that uh two years ago shane has said over and over again
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.080]  more than just libido and energy it made him want to get into the gym more it made him want to get
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:29.600]  in better shape and believe me the steiners have amazing genetics uh his brother is a world champion

[01:47:41.760 --> 01:48:04.400]  shane noticed the mental clarity bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.040]  he's already completely shredded i gotta admit for me the biggest effect has been libido now
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:13.440]  i've never claimed to have a body like some beach model but back when i was 20 22 years old and
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.000]  worked out every day i looked great but over the years and being married having three kids
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.040]  working 18 hours a day i gained basically 100 pounds and it's been a long process losing that
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.080]  weight in the last four years but if you look at the photos and the videos of what i looked like
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.920]  four or five years ago versus today the results are dramatic i'd already cleaned up my diet i was
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:39.520]  working out hard but i'd only lost about 20 pounds it was adding the other key ingredients
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:46.400]  from info warslife.com that helped me personally go to the next level and shed another 35 pounds
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:51.920]  this has actually made me feel so good that uh here lately about a year ago i started training
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:58.160]  jujitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing i mean it's it's amazing that two
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:04.800]  years ago i was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now i'm training with MMA fighters

[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:12.400]  upset by the rebel flags okay i get it they have free speech they can be upset by it but the point
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:20.640]  is that it's not terrorism and then the hillbilly types are like we'll be seeing y'all and they
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:25.760]  go that's a threat and then they're like yes threat just the threat and then next it's banned the

[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:13.520]  what he saw a paramedic saw an explosive device in ambulance before the germany versus netherlands
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:17.680]  game which was cancelled after french intelligence told german authorities about the impending
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.480]  attack involving several bombs authorities later claimed no explosives were found but the paramedic
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:27.040]  says he witnessed the bomb and was ordered not to talk about it after special forces arrived on the
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:31.360]  scene three police officers were also reportedly disciplined for leaking information about the
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:35.920]  alleged discovery of the bombs german authorities may have decided to conceal the fact that the
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.760]  explosives were found in order to prevent a panic amongst the fans who had gathered around the
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:44.560]  stadium before the match and also to protect german chancellor angelo merkel who has opened the

[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:06.400]  now that ties into the strong cities initiative that aims to control the police everything and
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:13.920]  you know i had a few weeks ago when this got announced the first time dr paul craig robertson
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:19.760]  former editor of the wall street journal you know smart guy and he goes alex the u in it and taken
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.840]  over it's the u s government and i went it's all perspective the criminals that have hijacked our
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:32.560]  government want other international entities with no checks and balances imf world bank xm bank
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:39.920]  international treaty organizations like the tpp that have their own legislative power outside
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:48.720]  government so they're transferring the power to systems they control so yes it is the elites
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.960]  in the united states and europe set up the u in yes it's been a creature of the u s and the rock
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:59.520]  of fellers but they're transferring the power to it and they use it as a diplomatically immune
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:05.760]  system they can jump back and forth you know like some criminals are from israel they can run back
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:10.160]  to israel or people could you know run back to the city of london that's its own deal or the
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:15.040]  vatican it's the same thing but bigger and so that's coming up at the bottom of the hour but i
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.600]  wanted to get peter schiff on today to pop in because obviously uh you've got a lot of analysts
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:25.120]  saying they expect a rate hike of one percent for two years three years he's been saying no there's
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:29.600]  not going to be a rate hike when they keep claiming it's imminent they're going into this qe buzz
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:35.120]  light year beyond infinity but they could i mean we're about to find out and and and they should
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:39.840]  raise rates as chef has said under free market conditions uh now we're talking about charging
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:43.520]  you to keep money in the bank but if they do it's going to cause problems if they don't it's going
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.800]  to cause problems they've got all these weird numbers factory orders down manufacturing down the
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:54.880]  last two months zero point two percent but then they claim jobs are up i mean what is the truth
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:11:00.960]  of this peter schiff heads up multi-billion dollar uh fund that we're going to be uh telling you about
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:11.200]  as well uh euro pack dot com where should we start peter well you know first of all everybody is
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:17.760]  excited now about the fact that they believe the most recent minutes the fomc federal open market
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:24.400]  committee minutes basically guarantee a december rate hike but if you actually read those minutes
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:32.000]  they don't say that at all all they say is that a majority of the members believe that the conditions
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.800]  may be right for a rate hike in december but they're not sure it depends on the data and they're
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:44.400]  going to make a decision you know in december so none of that to me sounds any different than the
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:49.680]  rhetoric we've been hearing all year long so i don't think it's a sure thing but i would say that
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:56.080]  it's probably more probable that the fed might actually move and do a quarter of a point not a
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:03.120]  whole percentage point but just one quarter of one percent which is basically nothing if the stock
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:09.520]  market is near record highs uh you know the day before that meeting and it looks as if everybody
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:14.560]  is okay with this tiny rate hike they might have their cake and eat it too but you're predicting
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:19.440]  a quarter now because that would be kind of both you know well i still think they probably won't
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:23.920]  do it because first of all there's a lot of time between now and then the market could sell off
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:29.760]  we can get a really bad jobs number for november they can revise down the october number so a lot
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:35.680]  can happen between now and then but if everything happens perfectly it is possible especially since
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.800]  they've come out now and said look if we do move in december it's going to be a long time before we
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:45.920]  do it again and we're not going to raise rates very much even when we're finished so they're
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:51.360]  trying to take this thing out of the rate hike by promising not to do very much but look if the if
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:56.960]  the fed had confidence in our economy why would they be worried about raising a rate interest rates
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:02.400]  to a quarter of a percent why would they have to reassure everybody that that's all it's going to be
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:06.640]  and that we don't have to worry about rates ever getting all the way back up to two percent or three
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:12.320]  percent which would still be historically very low why does the fed have to assure us that's that
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:18.080]  that's not going to happen if the economy is as good as they say it is and the reason this is so
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:23.840]  important is if they do have a point high because they say you've gone over the problems there
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.080]  quarter point should don't understand i'm saying let's just say they did have a one point like
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  the media is talking about versus a quarter point versus not how do you see those three
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:36.640]  different scenarios affecting the economy well the media if they're talking about a full percentage
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:41.520]  point they're probably talking about over the next year or two nobody is predicting that the
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.400]  fed is going to raise rates by a full percentage point in december i haven't read anybody predict
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:50.960]  that but yes there are people who think over the course of the next year or two will eventually
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:56.800]  get rates all the way back up to one percent which was the lowest that they got under greenspan
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:01.680]  that's where greenspan stopped and that's what gave us the housing bubble in the financial crisis
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:08.080]  and now you know we'd have to raise rates four times basically to get back to that that one percent
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:13.280]  but i think long before the fed gets to one percent if they actually start in december
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:18.160]  we're going to be back in our official recession or close enough to it that the fed is going to
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:24.880]  have to stimulate and if you think about it this way we've just had the weakest economic recovery
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:31.440]  ever and it's been seven years and the typical recovery lasts maybe five or six years so this
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:37.200]  is already a longer recovery than normal despite the fact that it's the weakest recovery ever
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.880]  and it's required the most amount of stimulus by a long shot we've never had so much stimulus
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:48.080]  to produce such so weak a recovery so if this recovery was so weak with zero percent interest
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.360]  rates imagine how quickly it's going to unravel if they start to raise rates and so when this
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:58.160]  recession resumes they're going to have to bring rates back down to zero they're going to have to
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:02.800]  do qe4 in fact they're going to have to get those helicopters out of the hangers because it's going
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:07.600]  to take a record amount of stimulus to try to breathe some more artificial life into what's
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:11.920]  going to be well that's what i was about to ask if they did do the point over the next few years
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:16.080]  incrementally and it didn't go the way they wanted and the stock market starts crashing
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:23.040]  then wouldn't confidence be even more lost and they can't go below zero or could they actually
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:27.360]  charge you to keep money in the bank well they don't charge you but they charge some of the
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:31.920]  the lending institutions like they're doing in europe right now you know they've actually got
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.880]  negative rates and in fact many of the government bonds now if you buy a government bond in the
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:42.560]  eurozone you're going to get back less than you pay i mean it's you know it really is a crazy thing
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:48.080]  that's gone on over there so i guess it can happen here too but that's one of the reasons that it is
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:53.920]  so dangerous from their perspective to raise rates because they look that much more foolish
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:58.320]  when they have to cut them but i do believe if they do raise rates slightly they're going to
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:04.240]  try to cover their tracks by leaving the the door open by saying look we just raised rates
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:09.200]  but we're still we can go either way with the next move we may hike or we may cut right depending
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.160]  on the data right they're going to stay data dependent which again i think is all just part
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:18.880]  of their show i think they're stalling because the data has been horrible ever since the fed has
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:24.640]  said their data dependent the data has been bad the data would argue for easier money not tighter
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:29.680]  money based on this data yet they're still pretending that the economy is getting better
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:36.880]  even though the data says that it's not wow well looking at this looking at the wide spectrum of
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:43.760]  data we know they cook joblessness numbers and you know they cook um you know things like inflation
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:47.760]  but looking at all the numbers yourself and what other experts are saying what is the state of the
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:54.080]  economy i think it's very weak i mean look since the last time you and i spoke we've had some horrible
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:17:00.240]  earnings at major retailers like macy's and Nordstrom's were sales have just really collapsed
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:05.760]  and that followed you know we had bad numbers earlier from the gap from walmart i mean if this
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:12.160]  is a recovery why aren't consumers shopping if we really are creating all these jobs why don't the
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:17.200]  unemployed need to spruce up their wardrobes for their new jobs i think the fact that spending
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:23.040]  is falling is a bad sign all the manufacturing numbers are horrible uh you've just got the
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:27.360]  housing numbers but you know they're starting to roll over we just got a housing number this week
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:32.720]  that showed the the fewest number of home starts in seven months so that's starting to turn down
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:37.520]  i think the data is starting to you know go the other direction yes we still have five percent
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:44.560]  unemployment but remember recessions always begin when unemployment is low unemployment is high when
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:50.960]  the recession ends but recessions don't start because of layoffs layoffs happen because of the
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  recession so you know when you're just looking at employment you're looking in in the rear view
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.440]  mirror it's and ignoring all the information in the windshield but you know when you talk about
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:04.960]  inflation look at the forest that's going on in europe dragi just came out this morning and he's
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:10.960]  saying look i'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure we have more inflation in the eurozone
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:16.320]  he look he's looking at consumer prices they're rising in europe they're just rising very slowly
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:22.400]  and he wants them to rise more rapidly but just not as fast as two percent but close to two percent
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:29.520]  he wants inflation to be like 1.8 or 1.9 and right now it's you know under one but think about this
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:38.240]  why would anybody say that what we need is higher prices for our consumers i mean dragi is specifically
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:44.880]  pointing to oil and saying these low oil prices are a problem why the european union or the eurozone
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:51.760]  they import oil they're not producing a lot of oil in the eurozone so why is it a bad thing
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:58.000]  if when a european pulls into a gas station that he spends fewer euros on gas why is it a bad thing
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.280]  if his if his electric bill is lower or you know or is he well that's all part of this carbon tax
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:09.120]  austerity where we're supposed to have less money to teach us to you know not consume too much this
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:14.320]  idea that it's good for us to be poor but the elites are all in giant jumbo jets with red carpets
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:20.480]  they're not saying that though he's dragi is somehow saying that price is not rising faster
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:25.360]  is somehow a threat to the european economy that somehow it's big and that's nonsense but you know
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:30.640]  what they really want to do in europe is they want to reduce debt and they want to lower wages
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:35.520]  because europeans have all sorts of things that artificially increase rages and the real reason
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:40.640]  they want inflation is to reduce people's real wages but dragi doesn't want to come out there and
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:45.840]  say that so he kind of makes up this nonsense about why he's going to have to make sure we have
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:49.520]  more inflation i know it's all about social engineering i want to ask you what would happen
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:54.160]  if bernie sanders got elected what you think he would do because he's out defending democratic
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:59.600]  socialism what a nightmare scenario that would be but so many well many people like him at 30 day

[02:24:54.640 --> 02:25:02.320]  front property in arizona as well he joins us from euro pack dot com peter schiff uh peter
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:07.920]  other predictions other other points you'd like to uh basically put out there as we go into this
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:12.160]  christmas holiday season with what's really happening with the economy you still say you've
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:15.840]  been at right so far you don't think they're going to raise rates because you think something
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:21.600]  might happen before now and later in december yeah well i still think the fed is more likely
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:25.360]  not to raise rates than do it but they probably it's probably a greater probability that they'll
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:29.520]  do it this time than at any point during the year but i do think if they do it it will be a one
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:35.520]  and done scenario and i do expect the dollar to sell off and goal to rise finally regardless
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:39.840]  of what they do which is why i think people should take advantage of this opportunity now to continue
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:43.600]  to move more money that's what we're doing with our clients to your pacific capital getting people
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:48.320]  out of the us dollar putting more money overseas into the countries that aren't making these mistakes
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:52.400]  putting more money into precious metals you mentioned before the break about bernie sanders
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:57.200]  and about his you know form of democratic uh socialism look just put in the word democratic
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:01.520]  in front of a bad word doesn't make the bad word good just because people vote for it i can
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:06.000]  say i'm for democratic slavery and that doesn't make slavery good but the problem is bernie
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.240]  sander democratic aids democratic syphilis democratic cancer yeah in his heart of hearts
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:17.120]  bernie sanders is a socialist he doesn't believe in the free enterprise system he doesn't believe
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:22.400]  in capitalism look at anything he used to write or stand for before he ran for president he does
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:27.680]  not believe in the principles that we fought the american revolution on he embraces the principles
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:31.840]  that they fought the russian revolution on but you know there's an argument to be made
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:36.960]  that maybe sanders could actually help because by having sanders as president he'll screw up the
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:42.480]  country so badly so quickly and it's already screwed up that he might hasten a real revolution
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:47.760]  towards free markets to abandon all its nonsense because all he wants to do is make the welfare
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:53.840]  state bigger he wants to expand yes the socialist programs from the new deal from the great society
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:58.400]  the stuff he wants to do would bankrupt the country a bankrupt america but the problem
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:04.240]  is we're already bankrupt uh so why not why not go all in on socialism so we know how bad it is
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:08.480]  so we can puke it all out and start over again i was about to say i've got red behind me on the
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:13.200]  tv screen because this country obviously is deeper and deeper in the red but so is the whole world
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:19.760]  in this race at the bottom but you've got a point i've been concerned of a rand paul or a donald
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:25.600]  trump got in and tried to free market fix things the congress the globalist the big corporations
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:32.480]  would sabotage it then they'd blame the collapse on capitalism but if we got a bernie sanders in
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:37.200]  it would wreck so horribly that maybe it would finally discredit socialism forever but i doubt
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:40.960]  yeah and i thought that was gonna happen that was one of the reasons i was thinking well
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:45.920]  let obama become president so it all falls apart on his watch but he looks like he's gonna get out
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.800]  of dodge you know this thing is going on longer than i thought but that is a fear that you get a
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:55.200]  rand paul in there and everything falls apart when he is there and it's how you see look what happens
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:01.200]  when we try capitalism or you know libertarianism so i really would like to see the collapse on
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:07.440]  a democrat watch especially one that embraces government so wholeheartedly as bernie sanders
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:12.480]  because if you thought jimmy carter was bad jimmy carter got us ronald reagan right he was the one
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:17.280]  decent president that we had and of course he could have been better if he hadn't made all those deals
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:22.480]  with with tip o'neill to increase spending but we never would have got ronald reagan if it hadn't
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.920]  been for the horror of jimmy carter well we can get something much worse and if it happens under
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:32.800]  bernie sanders watch we could really come out of something really good on the other side of that
[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:38.080]  sanders administration well we can really see the democrats pushing to have the implosion happen
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:42.960]  once they hand the baton to the republicans yeah although it looks like it looks like hillary still
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:48.400]  has a 25 point lead in front of in front of sanders but you know i don't understand why if i was a
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:53.120]  democrat i mean sanders is hitting on all their key issues because they all are socialists anyway
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:57.440]  so at least sanders admits it i don't know why they all like hillary what is the fascination
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:02.160]  with hillary clays a woman just that just the name just to you know well you know maybe she
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:09.680]  could be the vice president on the sanders ticket i don't know but i mean i sanders in a way again
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:15.200]  the democrats should should like him i mean i you know that he he he says everything he's a
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:20.320]  bumbling socialist kook they should love him who's never worked a day in his life outside the system
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:26.480]  he's a perfect space alien who just has no connection to reality yeah he's like he's a

[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:19.040]  and trying to influence our politics that's mainstream press releases from them yesterday
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:27.360]  and again our government gives our tax money to these foreign groups then they come in and lobby
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:32.800]  against our guns against free speech against the death penalty whether you love the death penalty
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:40.720]  or hate it that's our country's decision not the un involved in propaganda so that's all coming up
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:47.040]  but first off cutting to the situation room this is the war room this this tv slash radio studio
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:53.360]  is the war room i never really plugged it that's the name of these and then in the other studio
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:59.520]  is a situation where we cut to shorter interviews live breaking news and more and i've encouraged
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:08.640]  david night jacari jackson leon macadoo darin mcgreen rob do joe bigs kit daniels and on

[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:25.680]  working that in more and we have um who's hosting the fourth hour today i forgot david night is with
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:30.080]  a bunch of breaking news analysis because i'm on every three hours gas news breaking they get
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:35.200]  all warmed up focused with the latest breaking stuff things we didn't get to top stories we
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:39.200]  covered recapping the fourth hour we've added is really important sometimes i host it as well
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:47.360]  but first off let's go ahead and cut right now if he's ready to david night in the situation
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:53.920]  room and i'll be back thanks alex now i'm here with dr group and dr group i want to ask you
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:58.240]  why we should be worried i mean we're told that mercury and aluminum they're good for us i mean
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:04.400]  we've we've heard them actually say that mercury is good for us yeah well that's the diversion that
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:09.040]  these big companies take to sell more of their products and contaminate the earth and the food
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:14.960]  and the soil and contaminate our bodies but the fact is david we know now that chemicals are linked
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:19.760]  to every single type of mental illness we know they're linked to every different type of disease
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:26.240]  including cancer and the only solution is to cleanse your body and to eliminate your intake
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:31.840]  of these things you know try to breathe clean air try to drink clean water try to eat clean food
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:38.160]  and the more you can avoid these chemicals and toxic metals and all these other compounds that
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:42.240]  are surrounding us the better off you're going to be the smarter you're going to be the happier
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:46.800]  you're going to be certainly yeah we see these things in the water of course we try to filter
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:50.800]  our water as well but uh when you're traveling you don't have a filter with you i mean you're
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:54.160]  constantly exposed to these things you're exposed to them in the soil and the food and the water
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.440]  that you eat so what's the best way to cleanse these toxic metals and chemicals out of your body
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:07.040]  well it's a great question uh we've been working on that answer for 25 years and what we found is
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:12.400]  keeping your intestinal tract clean on a regular basis is step number one using an oxygen based
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:19.840]  cleanser such as oxy powder repairing the gut flora in your bowel using good probiotic formulas
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:26.480]  cleansing the liver and gallbladder the liver is the main organ that processes all these chemicals
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:32.400]  and toxins and we found that the majority of people out there have toxic fatty liver we're even
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:39.040]  seeing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children as young as nine so cleansing the liver
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:46.320]  also doing a harmful organism cleanse getting rid of all these pesky harmful organisms whether
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:53.440]  they're bacteria viruses worms fungus all these microbes that end up living in a toxic body because
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:38:00.000]  when your body is toxic your ph is acidic it invites all these organisms in that are dangerous
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:08.240]  and harmful to your system and then the last step is to eliminate or bond all the chemicals and toxic
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:14.640]  metals out of the system and that's where deep cleanse comes in and that's a spigirex type formula
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:22.080]  that took us uh over 20 years to develop which is designed to help the body eliminate some of
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:27.840]  these chemicals and toxic compounds from the system it's also a little bit about that technology
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:33.840]  because we see the description of deep cleanse it says it's proprietary spigirex process tell us a
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:40.800]  little bit about that the spigirex process is something that we developed for the extraction
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:46.720]  of herbs it's really a multi-step process where number one we choose the proper type of herbs
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:53.360]  that we want to use in the formula and look and find are those biodynamic certified which is
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:59.280]  the above level of organic if we can't find those biodynamic we look for organic if we
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:06.240]  can't find them organic then we look for wildcrafted but grown under organic conditions so that's the
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:12.240]  first step is choosing the right type of herb most people choose powdered herbs for their formulas
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:17.920]  that have sat in warehouses in china and japan for up to five or ten years and the therapeutic
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:24.320]  activity of the active ingredients has gone way down to practically zero so the first step is
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:31.600]  choosing the strength of the herb and the freshness of the herb and the spigirex process dates back to
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:39.680]  the 1600s when the great alchemists like paracelsus would take the plant and separate the components
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:47.040]  and then recombine those components together so we invented a whole new extraction technology
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:54.720]  a cold extraction technology that doesn't use heat which most liquid herbal formulas and
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:01.040]  extracts use alcohol which most of them are made with genetically modified corn
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:06.640]  and alcohol now is an endocrine disrupting chemical as well and anybody who has problem
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:12.480]  with alcoholism they do not want to take any type of product that has alcohol in it
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:21.120]  so we take a vegetable glycerin kosher certified vegan friendly and we take the herb and we take
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:27.760]  it through a seven step process to extract all of the components from that herb and then let
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:33.440]  it for goes through a fermentation cycle and then when it's pressed we take the residual
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:40.240]  herb material and we there's a special type of way to burn that and collect the ashes from that
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.200]  and then when it goes the ashes get purified so we're left with the pure salts of the plant
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:51.360]  which are the essence of the plant and then we add those back into the formula so that's what makes
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:58.000]  our formulas different and more effective than anybody else out there we use all glass vessels
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:05.280]  for processing every step of the way is done with quality with everybody's health as the
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:13.200]  number one priority and we continue to innovate and utilize any type of procedures or technologies
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:19.200]  that we can enhance the therapeutic benefits of the end product so you know there's many
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:25.920]  cleansing products out there there's different types of heavy metal cleansing products out there
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:31.680]  there's harmful organism cleansing products but ours are unique and they're different because of
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:38.160]  our quality and the amount of effort that we put into them and ensuring that we have those fresh
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:44.560]  products to start with that we can extract the highest level of therapeutic ingredients
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:48.400]  and the fact that we just don't use heat in any of our processing you know i'm looking at the
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:54.080]  description doctor group and and when it's vegan safe GMO free kosher and halal approved when it's
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:58.240]  all of those things off at the same time it's got to be a pretty clean process and also as you
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:03.280]  point out 100 alcohol free tell us about some of the specific ingredients in it and how they operate
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:10.160]  well what i love about deep cleanse is i took a combination of ingredients from all over the
[02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:16.640]  world that have been used for thousands of years to help detoxify and cleanse the body
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:23.600]  and support the body's natural detoxification processes one of the real great ingredients
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:29.600]  in deep cleanse is shilajit now that's an ancient ayurvedic secret that not too many people know
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:34.960]  about it's actually called blood of the mountain or rock sweat and the healing properties are
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:41.360]  incredible because shilajit is actually a black ooze that oozes out of the side of the mountains
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:48.480]  usually around the summertime when the snow melts and it's the decomposition of plant matter
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:55.680]  from over 7 000 different plants that takes years to decompose so it's a concentrated
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:04.720]  gel of vitamins minerals humic acid fulvic acid which are key components
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:10.000]  to grabbing some of these toxic compounds and and and letting the body secrete them naturally
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:16.960]  so it's harvested we yet we have a exclusive agreement with a company that actually goes up
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:24.640]  and hand harvests this stuff from the mountains and has specific areas where they go up they
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:30.800]  see it leaking out of the side of the mountain they harvest it by hand it's not uh heated up
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:36.640]  it's not pulverized it's not mixed with any type of chemicals like some of the other ones that are
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:43.680]  out there and so we get that shipped directly in and we can only do that once a year uh how they
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:49.040]  found out shilajit was so effective is because the native people years ago would watch the monkeys
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:54.320]  migrate at the beginning of the summer up to the Himalayan mountains and they followed them and they
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:44:01.360]  found that they consumed that special substance so there's a lot of information out there on
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:08.160]  that the russian olympic athletes used it as their secret muscle building compound and that's been
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:13.600]  given to their special forces for years that's interesting as it says that in the no-satuary
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:19.920]  semis they use that instead of steroids yes they did actually they did and back in the olympics
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:24.240]  and so that's one of the main most important ingredients that's in the deep cleanse and
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:30.160]  then you have the fulvic and humic acid which is another compound in shilajit but we wanted to
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:35.760]  increase the concentration of that which helps balance the cells in your body your cells need
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:41.120]  to detoxify too because really everybody has nothing more than a hundred trillion cells and
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:47.360]  they're very powerful free radical scavengers and antioxidants which go through the body and
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:53.600]  grab these things and provide essential nutrients and minerals yet at the same time helps the body
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:58.800]  release these toxic compounds and that's another reason why your bowel needs to be clean and your
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:04.800]  liver needs to be clean before you really move into cleansing the toxic compounds and chemicals
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:10.640]  out of your body so you can do it effectively and you don't go into some sort of a healing crisis
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:16.080]  and some of the other ingredients we chose for the formula are stuff like organic lavage root
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:22.800]  which is an extremely effective ancient detox remedy organic cleavers which is really effective
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:27.440]  on detoxifying and cleansing the lymphatic system which is extremely important now
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:34.400]  for a strong immune system tamarin fruit is also another ingredient we chose most of these are
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:40.560]  very rare but they're very effective at increasing the body's natural detoxification processes
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.880]  organic orange peel is another one organic cilantro which has been known to help bond to

[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:36.720]  the laugh stop that is the most preeminent comedy club in the world it launched Jerry Seinfeld
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:42.000]  basically you name it and when you go through the list of people

[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:54.560]  I was eating jalapenos

[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:05.920]  doctor group sometimes I'll have him on for five ten minute interview they do
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:12.880]  and then I'll try to eat lunch I ate some roasted chicken and delicious jalapenos
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:20.240]  and I can basically drink Tabasco sauce I can eat ghost peppers too but I don't like the flavor
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:26.880]  so I don't do it but tissues that can't handle it are the lungs and occasionally if I'm scarfing
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:33.600]  I'll drink water with the jalapenos I'm munching raw or pickled and then I will get a little
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:41.840]  piece of it down the lung and then it becomes a quite awakening could be the word it doesn't
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:48.400]  really hurt so much as you can't breathe and your eyes start watering so that's what I get
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:58.800]  eating raw jalapenos too quickly okay continuing it is outrageous to have facebook censoring people
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:04.080]  that criticize our open borders or europe's open borders it is outrageous to have school kids being
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:12.320]  told they can't write in an essay about guns period or just write the word gun you get kicked out
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:17.760]  this is about total control of language total dumbing down of society and I know
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:22.160]  that you all know that but I'm going to shoot a video today for the nightly news the article's

[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:33.760]  it's why we have the hillary for prison shirt because they were tearing those down in another
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:37.840]  state and saying they should be illegal so we would have to put a t-shirt out a limited edition

[02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:13.440]  we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the need for water
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:17.920]  but have you considered heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in the cold
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:23.040]  here are some things for you to consider how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are
[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:27.840]  firewood, coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:33.040]  take it with you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:38.640]  like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:45.360]  and less costly than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing.com again fortress clothing.com

[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:25.440]  article planned un hub in washington aims to influence us counterterrorism strategy
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:41.120]  and it's got just these jewels of a quote from the ohchr hub already has a warm advance welcome
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:47.920]  from the administration that also seems aimed at letting the new un outpost in dc arrive smoothly
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:57.520]  under washington's political radar and then it goes into it the fast-track human rights hub
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:05.040]  will lobby against the death penalty borders and other things seen as borders to national
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:12.400]  human rights institutions so basically it's it's it's police review boards it's the un saying
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:16.960]  we can't have a border same thing they do in europe it's just incredible and again this is from
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:22.640]  october 2nd remember obama administration the un announced global police force to fight extremism
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:28.800]  in us to go directly to the cities bypassing congress and legislatures with un money and
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:35.040]  influence bullying everyone and putting literal malice on police review boards i mean this is
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:43.280]  america being conquered and i shouldn't laugh about it it's just so crazy to actually see this
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:51.920]  going on here's another one new york joins terror busting network strong cities but then you read
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:55.600]  it and it's like we're gonna battle domestic extremists and then they adopt the southern
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:03.040]  barbie law center statements and i'm i'm on there ron paul's on there rand paul when you get the
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:09.520]  training manuals they put out it's literally my face at the top of it he hates minorities and
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:19.680]  wants terrorism this deeply racist hate bongers dedicated to evil i mean crazy bs but that's
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:25.680]  what they do so it really is unprecedented and boy has it arrived underneath the radar
[02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:33.440]  coming up day the night the fourth hour bureaucratic lies matter blm is headed again with multiple
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:38.000]  attacks on property rights and the constitution the funny thing happened to the way the fema camp
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:43.360]  clips of hillary comedy we're going to be breaking all that down as well and we're going to make a
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:48.080]  big deal out of hillary and there's going to be some funny videos all of our contests have been
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:52.480]  successful but some of them have videos that get seen millions of times and getting up being on
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:57.760]  national news and we're just going to make fun of hillary and i mean and then just point out
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:04.240]  there is a first amendment and we're not going to be stopped uh from doing it because we have free
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:09.040]  speech in this country and the first amendment doesn't give it to us it was already there but
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:14.160]  under this un system in germany they're arresting people that criticize the corrupt governments
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:19.120]  they know what they're doing and they're moving hard they're moving fast that's why
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:25.600]  people need to not take this broadcast other broadcasts for granted don't take any free speech
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:31.840]  for granted we've seen the persecutions of the irs of our religious speech of veterans groups
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:37.360]  of gun groups we've seen unprecedented persecution of filmmakers like the next to susa we've seen
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:44.000]  political corruption at all new heights as we really see what mafia scum we're dealing with
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:50.240]  and we see the intimidated bought and paid for republican leadership going along with it isn't
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:56.560]  strong enough being part of it at a fundamental level helping write obama care all these outrageous
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:03.360]  screw jobs this tyranny is being put in place to screw everybody over and make us poor and consolidate
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:08.400]  wealth and power and make us so ignorant and poor we could never struggle out of this new dark age
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:12.880]  they're trying to impose over the new renaissance because in a renaissance globe an renaissance
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:18.080]  universe the elites can't be in control and play god in a free will universe they have to compete
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:23.920]  in a level playing field of ideas and of science and of art and they can't win that's why they
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:30.560]  want to bully if they can bully the life's the the the the laugh stop they can bully anybody
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:35.280]  i can't believe in america we're actually having discussions about how they want to arrest global

[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:23.840]  welcome back to the alex jones radio show on this friday it is november 20th i have to thank
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:29.040]  for a moment this year is going by so quickly november 20th 2015 i'm david night your host in
[03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:33.840]  this fourth hour jacar jackson is going to be joining me in the next segment with a news
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:38.240]  outbreak we're going to be covering a lot of things one of them is going to be this as alex has
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:44.400]  been talking about this kickback from hillary clinton about the people who are making fun of
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:48.960]  her in a famous comedy club and of course she understands precisely what's going on with this
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:56.320]  she knows exactly what sal elinsky has talked about in his rules for radicals she did a thesis
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:02.480]  on it as a senior at wellesley college and she and bill clinton kept that secret kept that
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:09.600]  undercover until well after he had left office in 2001 we know what she knows about it we know
[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:15.360]  she's a great admirer of sal elinsky writing a 92 page thesis on that and of course his rule number
[03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:22.160]  five is ridicule is man's most potent weapon and so we're going to talk about what's behind
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:26.640]  her threats to a comedy club and we're going to play some of the excerpts from that comedy routine
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:32.640]  for you on the air also we've got some jupy candidates saying that they want equal airtime
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:37.200]  on saturday night live because donald trump hosted it he was on for 12 minutes and five
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:42.160]  seconds so his of his rivals want to get on people like uh john casick lindsay graham george
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:47.920]  pataki you know the people who are at zero and the polls so maybe what they should do
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:53.760]  is they should normalize the amount of time that uh donald trump got on the uh on saturday night
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:01:58.320]  live maybe they should normalize that to uh they're standing in the polls so you you know you
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:03.280]  multiply what fraction of support they have donald trump because they would all then zero out
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:09.040]  problem goes away you got lindsay graham john casick george pataki two of those guys couldn't
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:14.000]  even make the debates there uh their numbers were so low and of course john casick has pointed
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:20.640]  out that he's going to be the point man to come after donald trump uh it's clearly an act of
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:26.960]  desperation and of course john casick was also the point man for layman brothers when everything
[03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:33.040]  went belly up you know they were the first ones to implode and they began the kickoff of the
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:39.200]  implosion in 2008 when that was happening john casick made a half a million dollars bonus with
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:44.880]  layman brothers selling a junk to the pension plans in his state but you know he's he came out
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:50.880]  ahead and so as these guys run us many people say why are they still running they have absolutely
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:55.840]  no way to win here there's no path forward for lindsay graham or george pataki or john casick
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:02:59.920]  they're not going anywhere well they could be running because they want a position and somebody
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:05.920]  else's administration they could also be running because when you get campaign donations from people
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:11.120]  if you drop out of the race if you then retire when you retire whatever you got in your reelection
[03:03:11.120 --> 03:03:18.320]  campaigns that becomes your own personal booty so these guys can can run for office they can get
[03:03:18.320 --> 03:03:23.520]  millions of dollars of campaigns is one way at the end of their career that they can get paid off
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:27.680]  very easily they can launder all of that money for all those favors that they've done for people
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:33.520]  it gets a little bit sticky sometimes when you have billionaire casino owners giving you money
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:38.800]  like lindsay graham you know sheldon adelson's given him millions of dollars just as he did
[03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:44.240]  newt gingrich in the last election cycle for various favors you know he gives him
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:49.200]  a large amount of money and then lo and behold lindsay graham introduces a bill to do exactly
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:56.320]  what sheldon adelson wants get rid of online gaming so it's a little bit easier to get that
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:04:01.680]  money from people if you're going to say well that's a campaign contribution they just like me
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:07.520]  they just like me you know channel uh who is the uh the actress uh they like me they really like me
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:14.240]  even forgotten her name here nevertheless we also have uh one week after the attacks in paris
[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:18.320]  we now learn that a california middle school this on drudge report makes kids sing about
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:23.440]  spreading islam this is an orange county seventh graders were asked to sing a song about spreading
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:28.880]  islam in class here's some of the lyrics this is their fight song spread islam now song proved
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:34.080]  that they're right song some of the other things don't really care if no jews or christians believe
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:41.360]  islam is all and all is on the way outright indoctrination and you should be aware of the fact
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:46.960]  as we've uh pointed out in an interview about a week and a half ago the gullin schools run by a
[03:04:46.960 --> 03:04:53.440]  turkish imam who wanted to set up a transnational uh islamic state is here in america has the
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:56.960]  largest network of charter schools that's where they're going stay with us we'll be right back
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:05:01.600]  with jakari jackson and the second democrat debate this last weekend there was a last minute
[03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:07.200]  change the day before to talk about foreign policy because of the terrorist attacks the sanders campaign
[03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:12.880]  was furious bernie wasn't ready to talk about terrorism the moderator asked him if he still
[03:05:12.880 --> 03:05:17.680]  thought the greatest threat to national security was climate change absolutely in fact climate
[03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:21.680]  change is directly related to the growth of terrorism you understand what sanders is saying
[03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:27.680]  climate change is directly related to terrorism terrorism has nothing to do with wars for oil
[03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:33.040]  and power it's not about a clash of cultures and as every liberal will tell you it has nothing to do
[03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:40.080]  with islam so it must be climate change bernie al qaeda and isis were not created to fight climate
[03:05:40.080 --> 03:05:45.920]  change but there is an indirect link bernie sanders won't tell you however if he even sees it al qaeda
[03:05:45.920 --> 03:05:50.720]  and isis are a creation of the same governments and multinational corporations that are trying to
[03:05:50.720 --> 03:05:56.720]  create a global government using terrorism and climate change as an excuse for for wars dot com

[03:08:18.480 --> 03:08:24.880]  friday november 20th 2015 jacari jackson is with me in the studio he's going to break down some
[03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:27.920]  breaking news i'll tell you what we're going to be talking about in detail later in the hour we're
[03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:32.960]  going to be talking about the back and forth between comedians we've got multiple comedians
[03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:37.280]  talking about how nobody has a sense of humor anymore everybody's just too serious jacari
[03:08:37.280 --> 03:08:42.160]  about political correctness nobody can laugh at themselves they can't we can't laugh at anybody
[03:08:42.160 --> 03:08:48.560]  else uh everybody has lost their sense of humor because of this um the political correctness
[03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:53.040]  yeah held it right there i think it really started to ratchet up when obama became president
[03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:56.640]  yeah because before that you know they used to always make fun of the politicians on the
[03:08:56.640 --> 03:09:01.040]  late night shows on the saturday night lives and then once he got in it's like oh you can't
[03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:05.520]  criticize him because he's black which is completely ridiculous they've been it's not because he's
[03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:09.200]  black it's because he's a public figure he's a politician this is the same thing with hillary
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:14.160]  clinton all my life i've seen people ripping politicians up one side and down the other
[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:19.760]  making fun of them just leave for what they're doing but also just having fun at their personal
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:24.160]  idiosyncrasies you know the way they comb their hair the way they talk their mannerisms that sort
[03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:29.200]  of thing i mean comedians have made a living out of doing that with every every political party
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:34.080]  every president going on it's something that's happened uh throughout our history of course
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:38.960]  they used to be really tough back in the days of the founding fathers i mean they made up really
[03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:45.200]  slanderous stuff about each other and they had very partisan newspapers they didn't even pretend to
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:51.440]  have any objective objectivity or any reality in what they're reporting but now it's gotten to the
[03:09:51.440 --> 03:09:55.600]  point where everyone wants to control everybody else's speech and this is something that i've seen
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:10:00.320]  happening my entire life in colleges and now it is going on steroids so we're going to talk a little
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:05.840]  bit about that we're going to play some clips from the comedy club we're also going to talk about the
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:13.840]  blm uh you know bureaucratic lies matter and it was a blm story that they had the other day
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:17.680]  that was actually about black lives matters the way they titled it and we all looked at that we
[03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:22.720]  thought what the blm is taking over a highway now and we're going to tell you what they're trying
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:27.600]  to take over but that in that particular case our writers had used blm to talk about black lives
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:34.160]  matter but it applies to the bureau of land management because it's really about bureaucratic
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:39.280]  lies and those things do matter we're going to talk to you about the story that don selazar had
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:44.560]  earlier in this week about what's going on here in texas as well as a new incident yet another one
[03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:50.640]  going on out west but jacari tell us what's breaking here in the news well rob do handed this to me
[03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:55.680]  he's our news director and it's a story that takes place in arlington texas north of here
[03:10:55.680 --> 03:11:01.280]  and basically a undercover police officer was you know sneaking around at about six in the morning
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:06.800]  trying to put a gps beeper on somebody's car and a concerned neighbor walks outside sees this action
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:10.480]  this guy's dressed all in black and messing around with the car he's like hey man what are you doing
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:15.360]  over there and then the undercover cop responds basically he had dropped something and then they
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:20.480]  get into a verbal exchange and eventually the neighbor pulls out a firearm and opens fire on
[03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:25.920]  the officer not knowing that he's the officer and it's bringing up some questions of whether he was
[03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:32.480]  in his legal right to do so now in texas you can defend your property with uh with a firearm in the
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:37.760]  case of a burglary but the issue came about when the officer got into a not to a police vehicle
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:43.600]  unmarked vehicle and drove away in the uh the neighbor shot the vehicle 16 times as he was fleeing
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:48.560]  so now people are wondering was he in his legal right to do so i think shooting a fleeing vehicle
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:53.600]  16 times is a bit of a stretch yeah i would say that that's uh in my opinion that would not be
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:56.880]  justified because there's no threat to you but we see the police doing that all the time that's
[03:11:56.880 --> 03:12:02.000]  exactly what the air said he's like he's acting like a cop yeah exactly exactly and so you know
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:07.600]  in a sense it has kind of come back to um to hit them because if you're going to establish
[03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:12.640]  that police can shoot people who are fleeing and and representing no danger to them or anyone else
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:17.760]  then it blurs those lines that we've all been told when we go to take our concealed carry classes
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:22.400]  that uh you know if somebody is coming at you and you believe they're a threat then you can shoot
[03:12:22.400 --> 03:12:26.880]  them but if they're running away from you even if they got your television set under their arm you
[03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:31.200]  don't uh you don't shoot them just to recover that property right but of course it also brings
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:37.440]  up the issues of the other non-police like activity this guy is doing there under the car
[03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:41.680]  certainly i wonder if he had a search warrant for the gps thing or if this is some kind of a uh
[03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:47.440]  well the details are still emerging but you know i wouldn't be surprised if he did well you know yeah
[03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:51.440]  when i go back and think about michael hastings when you're talking about that he was very concerned
[03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:55.600]  that people were messing with his car i don't know if he saw people out there why he was concerned
[03:12:55.600 --> 03:13:01.120]  about but he had asked people about that if they had seen people around his car before he died in
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:06.480]  that car accident uh there's a lot of things that the police are doing now they've completely changed
[03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:10.960]  the way they interact with everybody we've talked about this uh many many times and that's one of
[03:13:10.960 --> 03:13:16.080]  the things that really concerns people absolutely and uh as we're talking about these police officers
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:20.160]  you know we all know about the big m-rap vehicles and military vehicles that are coming back and
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:25.120]  police departments are getting them now there's a story that one has actually been seized in alabama
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:30.960]  and i believe these are the 1033 vehicles somebody sees an m-rap well not maybe it wasn't stolen i
[03:13:30.960 --> 03:13:35.200]  guess it's stolen that's that forfeiture from another police department well the obama administration
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:39.600]  you know after ferguson and all the hubbub all this stuff people started to talk about it so now
[03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:43.920]  they went into this police department and they took the vehicle back and it wasn't one of the newer
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:48.080]  ones you know one of the slick ones but you know it's a vehicle nonetheless a heavy armored vehicle
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:53.520]  and uh it doesn't hurt my feelings that's one of the things people don't understand is that under
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:58.800]  this 1033 uh program uh these police departments for the most part do not own these things they
[03:13:58.800 --> 03:14:04.800]  are loaner vehicles to them and uh so they can take it back but they're kind of like white elephants
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:08.240]  these things are extremely expensive to maintain that's one of the reasons that they're putting
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:12.640]  them out there and we've talked about this before i think they're pre-positioning these things uh the
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:18.160]  federal government is and having the local government uh local police force pay for maintaining
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:22.000]  these things and keeping them operating and then when something happens just as you're saying right
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:26.640]  here the federal government will come in and say well that's ours so get out of the way we're we're
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:31.040]  going to use it for whatever we feel like using it mm-hmm yeah that's like i always say you know you
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:35.600]  can't drive these things down to jiffy lube you have to have specialized tools specialized training
[03:14:35.600 --> 03:14:40.240]  to maintain them so they're really not cost efficient unless you live in just in a shy rack i
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:44.960]  guess yeah they were rushed to market uh because they wanted to have this protection uh when they
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:49.440]  were in iraq they really uh they were getting hit with hit with all these improvised explosives on the
[03:14:49.440 --> 03:14:54.000]  roadside so they rushed these things to market they didn't have a lot of testing uh and they are
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:59.680]  incredibly unreliable incredibly expensive to maintain and you know jacari as they were ramping
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:04.720]  this up and putting these things and all these small police departments they had suspended they
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:10.880]  were suspending at the same time a program giving surplus equipment to fire departments small fire
[03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:18.000]  departments that have been in place for over 60 years and when they pulled that back these people
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:23.840]  were saying wait a minute these these small fire departments are having to deal with fires on
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:28.800]  government land where they have very little they have a small population base to pull from to fund
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:33.600]  their department many of them are volunteer fire departments and they have to cover large amounts
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:38.560]  of wildfire on public land so they really do need that help they pulled it back and they
[03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:42.880]  they stopped that program for about a month the firemen were very active they got involved with
[03:15:42.880 --> 03:15:47.920]  their senators who contacted the department of defense and got that program restarted but that
[03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:52.160]  had been there for 60 years and it really was something that the communities needed they really
[03:15:52.160 --> 03:15:57.760]  did need that surplus older equipment uh to be able to get to the fires quickly uh back in the
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:02.480]  you know the wildfires that are back into the uh forest but they pulled that back so they could
[03:16:02.480 --> 03:16:08.240]  put more equipment preposition it with police departments absolutely absolutely now they would
[03:16:08.240 --> 03:16:14.320]  have a different topic here we have the house passes a bill to overhaul the fed and you know
[03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:19.120]  it was really interesting to me form bill f orm yeah this is a federal reserve would be subject
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:25.200]  to a controversial public audit under legislation passed by the house on thursday and let's see here
[03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:30.880]  that's great i talked about that earlier in the week yeah passed 241 to 185 it would not only
[03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:37.840]  audit them but it would also come up with a formula that would set the interest rates based on certain
[03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:42.560]  econometric uh things that they though measure and they had a problem with that they said no
[03:16:42.560 --> 03:16:46.720]  you're politicizing things it's like no you're politicizing them when you can arbitrarily raise
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:51.440]  the rates or lower the rates at will at your whim and not be answerable to anybody not show us what
[03:16:51.440 --> 03:16:55.920]  your decision-making process is you won't talk to anybody about it you just arbitrarily raise or
[03:16:55.920 --> 03:16:59.920]  lower the rates you've got inside information you can play the market just like a congressman you
[03:16:59.920 --> 03:17:04.480]  know they made it legal for uh congress people to use inside oh yeah they did a big thing about that
[03:17:04.480 --> 03:17:08.720]  i believe on 60 minutes so the fed really hates this and they passed it yesterday that's great
[03:17:08.720 --> 03:17:12.080]  yeah and the thing about it was i thought was very interesting there are so many people
[03:17:12.800 --> 03:17:17.360]  and you know and spin off sites you have their own angle on it talking about how it's ridiculous to
[03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:23.280]  audit the fed how it's ridiculous for them to have any type of accountability really yeah and i it was
[03:17:23.280 --> 03:17:28.480]  amazing to me so you just want to give these guys a blank check a closed door to go do whatever they
[03:17:28.480 --> 03:17:33.840]  want to do yeah and meanwhile we're always talking about taxes raising this and lowering that but you
[03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:38.240]  don't want to hold this institution accountable for anything it was very bizarre to me and it's a
[03:17:38.240 --> 03:17:43.200]  private institution it's a private institution that has destroyed 99 percent of the value of our
[03:17:43.200 --> 03:17:49.600]  money it was sold to us on the basis that it was going to level out the boom and bust cycles and yet
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:54.240]  they created we've seen the biggest boom and bust cycles in our history since the federal reserve
[03:17:54.240 --> 03:17:57.840]  was created they were created before the great depression they didn't do anything to help that
[03:17:57.840 --> 03:18:04.880]  many people say that they directly caused it or exacerbated it okay even Ben Bernanke said okay we
[03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:09.440]  cause the great depression we won't do it again okay even he admitted it they form ahead of the
[03:18:09.440 --> 03:18:14.880]  federal reserve so you know when you look at this you have to ask yourself why are we doing this why
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:18.800]  are we still doing this it's absolutely amazing but of course there are a lot of people who have
[03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:25.280]  a vested interest in the Fed we've got Ben Carson who was asked about Janet Yellen he says no i think
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:30.880]  janet's great you know just just leave everything the way it is you know i wouldn't get rid of the
[03:18:30.880 --> 03:18:35.520]  federal reserve i would just leave everything exactly the way that it is because he knows
[03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:40.800]  Janet Yellen from Yale and that's the whole point about all this this is an insider game
[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:45.120]  uh it was talked about when they created the federal reserve we had senators who said this
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:49.520]  is going to be used to enrich insiders and that's precisely what it's done over the last hundred
[03:18:49.520 --> 03:18:54.480]  years yes yes and now we're talking a lot about in the last couple days about domestic issues who
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:19:00.640]  can enter and leave the country and we have article americans pay your taxes or lose your passport so
[03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:06.880]  basically u.s government will be able to deny new passports or revoke ones held by people with serious
[03:19:06.880 --> 03:19:12.880]  tax debts what do you think about that well you know they've also passed a highway bill and as part
[03:19:12.880 --> 03:19:18.720]  of that highway bill they are going to privatize debt collection uh from the irs and i'm reminded
[03:19:18.720 --> 03:19:24.000]  that uh during biblical times they had these people called publicans and jesus and the rest of
[03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:28.880]  people at that time didn't have much good to say about publicans the publicans would go out there
[03:19:28.880 --> 03:19:34.720]  and they would they that was part of the privatizing of collecting taxes by the roman empire and it's
[03:19:34.720 --> 03:19:39.760]  the g.o.p that is actually pushing this and this is an industry that has more consumer complaints
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:44.400]  by far than any other industry the debt collection industry when you go out and you give people a
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:49.840]  profit motive they're going to be even worse than the irs agents are today it's a very dangerous thing
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:53.360]  and if the republicans are going to do this i think we should call them instead of publicans
[03:19:53.360 --> 03:19:58.480]  we should call them republicans these people are going to be down your neck thank you so much

[03:25:21.680 --> 03:25:27.200]  layout. Now this article going back to June and it's interesting to go back and take a look at
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:31.840]  this because of what just happened with Hillary Clinton and the threats that she made to a comedy
[03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:38.880]  club there. This is a BAFTA award-winning comedian Stephen Merchant who was co-writer co-director
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:43.280]  of the British sitcom The Office which they also did a version of here in the United States.
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:48.240]  He said perpetually offended Twitter outrage mobs have made public figures petrified to speak
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:52.400]  candidly said people are being leapt on because they happen to use the wrong terminology about
[03:25:52.400 --> 03:25:58.240]  Bruce Jenner or Caitlyn Jenner or whatever his name is now her name I call him Bruce gender
[03:25:58.240 --> 03:26:02.000]  I think that's probably the best way to refer to him. There I am making mistakes I'm probably
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:06.320]  getting in trouble for that he says and of course similar sentiments were expressed by Jerry Seinfeld
[03:26:06.320 --> 03:26:11.920]  he talks about how his daughter thinks that just innocent statements that his wife made about
[03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:17.120]  well you're 14 you're going to be paying attention to boys now I guess and she says that's sexist
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:23.840]  they say Salon has a list of 10 popular comedians who all think that PC is killing satire names that
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:29.840]  include Chris Rock John Cleese Dennis Miller and many others but there are some humorless politicians
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:37.200]  like Hillary Clinton who want to kill the comedians here's that report a funny thing happened on the
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:44.000]  way to the FEMA camp it seems some comedians focused on Hillary one night something peculiar
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:51.920]  something for everyone a comedy tonight hello Hillary it's nice to see you you look great
[03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:57.600]  nothing like a uh there's nothing like a skirt suit with shoulder pads to say I'm all woman
[03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:01.680]  she looks like she's playing linebacker for tj max
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:08.560]  it's kind of outfit that you see who wore it better Caitlyn Jenner or Hillary Clinton
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:15.840]  and her majesty was not amused with jokes aimed at her Jamie Misata who opened the famous laugh
[03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:19.920]  factory in LA over 30 years ago told judicial watch that the Clinton campaign demanded the
[03:27:19.920 --> 03:27:26.640]  comedy video be taken down yes the whole night demanded the personal contact information of
[03:27:26.640 --> 03:27:31.440]  the comedians and threatened to put him out of business if he didn't take down the video
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:39.040]  Hillary's deadly serious she's well acquainted with Saul Alinsky's 12 rules for radicals as a
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:45.360]  college senior she wrote a 92 page thesis on it which the Clintons kept blocked from 1993 through
[03:27:45.360 --> 03:27:53.760]  2001 and rule number five is ridicule is man's most potent weapon so she had no trouble showing her
[03:27:53.760 --> 03:27:59.200]  Machiavellian dictatorship side today she came after the comedians but many still love her
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:04.160]  nevertheless because she's a woman Trump also said he really he actually said that he doesn't
[03:28:04.160 --> 03:28:09.200]  know about Hillary because we shouldn't have a woman in office because what about when they
[03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:17.840]  get their period she's 69 years old she hasn't had a period since the 20th century some say she
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:24.560]  loves women I like how you didn't trip off uh bill in uh Monica Lewinsky and stuff I feel like you
[03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:30.560]  were putting that too on the side they probably best the friends because you know they both like
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:35.680]  the same thing what I would love Hillary I was thinking about it and I would love if you become
[03:28:35.680 --> 03:28:50.240]  president then you divorce bill and then you marry a bitch is Hillary an advocate for women or will
[03:28:50.240 --> 03:28:55.360]  she destroy any woman who gets in the way of her power is this the kind of person we want as president
[03:28:56.080 --> 03:29:01.440]  so tonight she comes after the comedians we'll see the tragedy of her tyranny tomorrow
[03:29:11.920 --> 03:29:16.720]  yeah that's that uh Hillary will be coming it'll be a tragedy when we get the tyranny tomorrow
[03:29:16.720 --> 03:29:21.120]  because she's coming after the comedians tonight and we need to understand what's really going on
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:27.520]  with political correctness we have a whole generation of kids who have absolutely no respect
[03:29:27.520 --> 03:29:31.360]  for free speech stay with us when we come back we're going to talk about the bureau of land
[03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:37.040]  management who has no respect for private property rights another atrocity in addition to the one in
[03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:54.240]  Texas we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[03:29:54.240 --> 03:30:04.800]  network islamic extremists armed with guns and throwing grenades stormed a luxury hotel in molly
[03:30:04.800 --> 03:30:11.360]  friday morning hostages were taken and at least 27 people have been killed senior officials say the

[03:30:17.280 --> 03:30:23.280]  after reciting verses from the quran fears remain that the attack in bemaco may be linked or inspired
[03:30:23.280 --> 03:30:28.240]  by the paris attack where french nationals were targeted for the government's decision to carry

[03:32:57.920 --> 03:33:16.800]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night your host i want to get into something
[03:33:16.800 --> 03:33:24.160]  serious now we talked about comedy and the humorless reaction to it by people in college and the
[03:33:24.160 --> 03:33:29.680]  punitive reaction to it by hillary clinton but the blm has been involved in many different
[03:33:29.680 --> 03:33:36.000]  instances of taking people's property they're at it again of course we've followed the minors out
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:42.000]  in oregon after the bundy ranch and many other cases so we had a story earlier this week drudge
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:47.600]  picked it up from adan salazar talking about the situation here in texas and it's not only
[03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:53.040]  texas ranchers that are upset with what the blm is doing there's several counties are suing the
[03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:57.600]  federal government over the blm's land grab and let me read you this story for context first this
[03:33:57.600 --> 03:34:03.360]  was uh just a couple of days ago adan salazar's story he says the u.s bureau of land management
[03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:08.240]  is violating citizens fourth and fifth amendments infringing on the sovereignty of local county
[03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:13.360]  governments quote unquote from a lawsuit that was filed in district court by nine private land
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:18.720]  owners including one county sheriff in addition to three counties which are which are clay and
[03:34:18.720 --> 03:34:24.320]  will barger counties seeking to end a dispute and of course this is over 90 000 acres that are
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:31.360]  in and around the border of texas close to the red river the blm is asserting that the
[03:34:31.360 --> 03:34:37.520]  boundary extends well past the riverbed into texas and in many instances more than a mile
[03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:43.520]  outside of its lawful territory they're essentially moving the boundary lines we've talked about this
[03:34:43.520 --> 03:34:50.160]  before they filed a lawsuit one rancher in particular who's had his ranch there since 1941
[03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:56.240]  he's got a deed for it he bought it it was recorded by the state of texas he had 1200 acres
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:35:01.600]  and they're going to take half of that as well as his home because his home is on part of the acres
[03:35:01.600 --> 03:35:06.240]  that they're going to confiscate other ranchers including the lawsuit say the blm is targeting
[03:35:06.240 --> 03:35:10.880]  more than half of their land they're unaware of the exact acreage being claimed by the agency
[03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:14.880]  because you know this is a blm this is a federal government they don't even have to tell you any
[03:35:14.880 --> 03:35:20.640]  anything right that's the arrogance of the federal government the things that they do they could they
[03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:26.800]  won't even explain and so we've got three counties nine ranchers and the counties are saying that
[03:35:26.800 --> 03:35:31.280]  blm's claim interferes with their ability to regulate and provide services for the health
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:35.760]  benefit and the welfare of their citizens so understand we've got private individuals who
[03:35:35.760 --> 03:35:41.520]  are having their property that they've been paying taxes on for decades the state of texas and
[03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:46.720]  everybody has always thought that it was part of the state of texas and now the blm is deciding no
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:51.520]  i think you're going to change the boundaries here so you've got individual private citizens
[03:35:51.520 --> 03:35:57.600]  joining with county governments joining with the state of texas because governor abbott has sent
[03:35:57.600 --> 03:36:04.400]  the blm letters he clashed with them as attorney general and the state of texas before he became
[03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:10.400]  governor pushing back against this but there's yet another one and this is a case of a family
[03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:19.120]  by the name of hamond and they're in oregon and they have had property there since 1964
[03:36:19.120 --> 03:36:24.720]  just as we saw we covered the miners that were out in oregon they'd had mineral rights to the mines
[03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:31.760]  that they were going through since the 1870s see this is how the federal government is completely
[03:36:31.760 --> 03:36:37.600]  overturning not only the rule of law but all of the boundaries all the property rights that we
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:42.080]  have they're taking everything we have understand that all of your rights are property understand
[03:36:42.080 --> 03:36:49.200]  your first amendment rights are essentially your property your your right to have firearms on the
[03:36:49.200 --> 03:36:53.840]  second amendment that is a right that is your property your rights are part of your property
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:57.360]  but these are specific property rights and understand that when we're talking about a lot of these
[03:36:57.360 --> 03:37:04.560]  ranchers or miners it's not the land per se that they say that they have a right to these are massive
[03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:10.160]  amounts of area that were never turned over to the states and that's a problem right there we could
[03:37:10.160 --> 03:37:15.680]  talk about that we could spend an entire program on that issue and we have in the past talked about
[03:37:15.680 --> 03:37:22.160]  that for an entire hour with the guests but this is saying that these are lands that are being
[03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:26.800]  managed by the federal government instead the federal government is trying to push everybody
[03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:31.120]  off of these take property rights that people have had for many decades and understand that
[03:37:31.120 --> 03:37:35.360]  your property rights are not just the kind of rights that you have if you have a home in the
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:42.000]  suburbs you can have surface rights you can have rights to grays you can have rights to the water
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:48.800]  you can have rights to the minerals if you're a miner so these are these can all exist concurrently
[03:37:49.440 --> 03:37:54.880]  all can exist concurrently and so the federal government is coming in and willy-nilly taking
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:38:00.480]  individual rights so this is a family that was there since 1964 they didn't have any conflict
[03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:06.640]  with the government until the 1990s at that point they filed on a livestock water source they got a
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:10.880]  deed for the water right from the state of Oregon but when the BLM and the Fish and Wildlife
[03:38:10.880 --> 03:38:15.760]  Service found out about it that they had gotten new rights in addition to the ones that they already
[03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:24.240]  had they tried to take these rights away they took them to court and they won and so the BLM
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:30.240]  as appears has had a personal vendetta for them ever since and understand this so this might be
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:35.600]  something these ranchers need to be concerned about even if they went in court the BLM may come
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:41.360]  against them in a personal vendetta we believe from testimony that we heard their allegations from
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:46.080]  the people out in Oregon the miners that there was a personal vendetta involved and that move
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:51.200]  against them to take away property that they'd had not property but the mineral rights that
[03:38:51.200 --> 03:38:57.680]  had since the 1870s what happened in the Hammond case is that these things escalated there were
[03:38:57.680 --> 03:39:03.280]  continuing fights over water sources and just as we saw with a family who was recently evicted from
[03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:08.720]  a longtime ranch they had adjacent to area 51 the BLM started doing the same tactics that the
[03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:13.840]  Department of Defense did to that family out there putting up blockades and keeping them from
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:19.280]  having access to their own land making it incredibly difficult for them so this started in the mid 90s
[03:39:19.280 --> 03:39:24.320]  the BLM after they lost in court started blocking access to these people then they went in and
[03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:31.200]  tried to arbitrarily revoke their grazing permits that got revoked but then what happened was there
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:37.440]  were a couple of fires in 2001 there was a backfire which is something that has always been done it's
[03:39:37.440 --> 03:39:44.800]  done by the BLM to maintain the land in a healthy productive state it's been done by Native Americans
[03:39:44.800 --> 03:39:51.920]  it's been done by ranchers and this burnout they had a fire got a little out of hand and burned 127
[03:39:51.920 --> 03:39:57.760]  acres of public land but they didn't hear anything about that what happened was in 2006 there was a
[03:39:57.760 --> 03:40:02.480]  wildfire on government land that was heading towards their property they set a backfire at that point
[03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:08.720]  and successfully dealt with it and as they pointed out the backfire worked perfectly said the mother
[03:40:08.720 --> 03:40:12.880]  of one of the people involved here put out the fire it saved the range and possibly our home
[03:40:12.880 --> 03:40:20.240]  a few days later they were contacted by a BLM officer who asked if the son would meet them
[03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:24.800]  in town a grown son and meet them in town for coffee when he went there he was arrested
[03:40:25.360 --> 03:40:29.920]  and they told him he had to go back and get his father and bring him in they booked both of them
[03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:36.160]  the US Attorney's Office under arson and terrorism arson and terrorism this is under the federal
[03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:43.120]  anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 and what they did was they came after them
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:48.080]  calling them arsonists calling them terrorists they were able to get a conviction the jury didn't
[03:40:48.080 --> 03:40:53.920]  understand what property rights were just as I was trying to tell you many people don't understand
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:41:01.760]  the rights that ranchers and minors and others have on public lands they sentenced them to 12 months
[03:41:01.760 --> 03:41:08.000]  in federal prison they gave them a fine they had the the sentence was reduced by the judge
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:13.600]  because they thought it was outrageous and now they are coming back and trying to sentence them
[03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:18.560]  again one of the individuals is in his mid 70s they want to send him to jail for I think it's
[03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:25.280]  10 years if they do that that is an effective death sentence for him it'll be a life sentence
[03:41:25.280 --> 03:41:30.480]  this is the over the top way in which the BLM operates and there's one other thing which I
[03:41:30.480 --> 03:41:35.840]  failed to mention and I want to mention this too because after they were sentenced they had a story
[03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:42.000]  to build public opinion in support of the sentencing and they had in the local paper a person who
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:47.200]  identified himself as Greg Allam had three comments on an article talking about the sentencing he
[03:41:47.200 --> 03:41:51.920]  called the ranchers clowns who endangered firefighters and other people in the area while
[03:41:51.920 --> 03:41:57.840]  burning valuable rangeland now there was a Greg Allam of the same spelling and everything who
[03:41:57.840 --> 03:42:02.960]  did work for the BLM he was retired he'd been a heavy equipment operator and he called the local
[03:42:02.960 --> 03:42:07.920]  paper to complain that he had not made those comments and to request that they had been taken
[03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:12.880]  that they would be taken down from the website so this is the kind of stuff that we have seen
[03:42:12.880 --> 03:42:19.280]  with the BLM is a very long story I found out about this through the Bundy family and this
[03:42:19.280 --> 03:42:23.840]  is something we should all look at look if there was a fire that got out of control and burned
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:32.080]  small amount 127 acres that is not anywhere near what the Department of Interior with the EPA did
[03:42:32.080 --> 03:42:38.480]  in that that mistake that they made at the gold mine and many people question even whether or
[03:42:38.480 --> 03:42:44.000]  not that was a stake remember that back in August that was the animus river there was a gold mine
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:50.480]  in Colorado and they were doing something to the gold mine there was a retired mining engineer
[03:42:50.480 --> 03:42:54.400]  who said in the paper what they are planning to do is going to backfire it's going to be a
[03:42:54.400 --> 03:42:59.040]  catastrophic explosion it is going to pollute the river and then they're going to use that as an
[03:42:59.040 --> 03:43:04.960]  excuse to grow the EPA bureaucracy he predicted all of that he predicted all that but it was
[03:43:04.960 --> 03:43:12.000]  much bigger than he had predicted this spill went into the river way it dumped toxic metals from
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  the mine into the river the animus river and it polluted and that went into three different
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:24.960]  states this is massive and they were warned beforehand not to do it so is the EPA a terrorist
[03:43:24.960 --> 03:43:30.240]  organization I mean what they did had far greater consequences than what these ranchers did we see
[03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:34.640]  them doing this type of thing all the time remember the horses that they rounded up and
[03:43:34.640 --> 03:43:40.640]  sold by the thousands to a guy who made a tremendous amount of money off of these horses they did
[03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:45.840]  not even make it they sold it to him at such a low price that they didn't even pay for the
[03:43:45.840 --> 03:43:51.520]  transportation of the horses to this rancher and it was against the law for the BLM to sell
[03:43:51.520 --> 03:43:56.000]  horses to someone who was going to turn around and slaughter them that was not what the program
[03:43:56.000 --> 03:44:01.600]  was for so they violated their own rules they sold it at a ridiculous price so much so that
[03:44:01.600 --> 03:44:06.560]  people are wondering if there was something criminal or corrupt about this transaction
[03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:12.560]  and even when they were warned by people that he was going to turn around and sell these horses
[03:44:12.560 --> 03:44:20.000]  for slaughter they continued the sailing process how do we get control of these criminal organizations
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:24.160]  how do we get control of these bureaucracies there's no one controlling them they're created by
[03:44:24.160 --> 03:44:30.960]  the congress they will give them a area a jurisdictional area tell them to go out and
[03:44:30.960 --> 03:44:56.960]  you know manage the lands of the public lands or manage the environment protect the environment they start writing their own laws they have their own courts they have their own police enforcers this is treated as civil law just like civil asset forfeiture so you are guilty until you prove that you were innocent in many cases but in some cases they try to set people up criminally as they have the Hammond family in Oregon.
[03:44:56.960 --> 03:45:16.960]  I really don't know what we do we have to get some congressmen who have the backbone to stand up and to do what they are what they have the duty and the obligation and the right to do barring that and I don't think we're going to see it actually happen in Washington I think it's going to require the type of thing that we're seeing here in Texas.
[03:45:16.960 --> 03:45:32.960]  You're going to have to have state local government as well as jurors who know what's going on the jurors in this area where the Hammond's are in Oregon if they were informed jurors they could have looked at this and said well we don't really care what the facts of the case are.
[03:45:32.960 --> 03:45:48.960]  We're going to look at the fact that you're trying to put these guys away for terrorism and they're clearly not terrorists so I nullify your law all it takes is one juror to hang tough and to not tell him that he's doing jury nullification just say I disagree with you on the facts because every judge will lie to you.
[03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:58.960]  We'll tell you that you have to you can't judge the law you have to stick strictly to the facts of the case as he allows you to see them and make your decision.
[03:45:58.960 --> 03:46:13.960]  That was never what juries were for juries were one of the most important things that the founders gave us when they set up the form of government that we have and they were important because it was the ultimate power of the community to block this kind of
[03:46:13.960 --> 03:46:27.960]  tyranny whether it's coming from a federal government or a state government or a local out of control government one juror out of 12 can stop this and say I'm not going to let you railroad these people and send them to prison.
[03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:45.960]  I think it's very important for conservatives also we talked about this last night on the nightly news with Darren McBreen how the right wing press is now trying to and joining with a left wing press trying to get people afraid of use the terrorism attacks in
[03:46:45.960 --> 03:46:59.960]  Paris to leverage that into gun control. Now remember it was a week ago we had the attacks in Paris and then over the weekend the GAO put together an update on a report that they had put out four years ago.
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:06.960]  And in that report they had talked about the number of people who were on watch lists buying guns.
[03:47:06.960 --> 03:47:21.960]  And that was a report that was put out in 2010 but now we have somehow magically over the weekend they updated it to 2014 numbers they gave it to the Washington Post the Washington Post ran with a story on Monday and then it turned into an echo machine.
[03:47:21.960 --> 03:47:28.960]  All the press was talking about how outrageous this is especially especially being led by Fox News.
[03:47:28.960 --> 03:47:41.960]  I walked into the the break room we've got the multiple news channels going and and I saw the Fox five talking about this I think this is outrageous I looked at it began I could see that Gretchen Carlson had had covered it as well.
[03:47:41.960 --> 03:47:55.960]  Totally freaked out about this and they had alert alert you know and she had a guy from Homeland Security who's a retired deputy talking about how horrible this is well think about this here's a headline from the Washington Post from 2004 to 2014.
[03:47:55.960 --> 03:48:01.960]  Over 2000 terror suspects legally purchased guns in the United States.
[03:48:01.960 --> 03:48:03.960]  Okay well think about that for a moment.
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:11.960]  If you've got 2000 terror suspects that purchased guns and none of them use them to create a terror event.
[03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:14.960]  Maybe they didn't belong on that list.
[03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:16.960]  How did they get on the list?
[03:48:16.960 --> 03:48:18.960]  Who puts them on there?
[03:48:18.960 --> 03:48:20.960]  Does anybody know if they're on a list?
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:34.960]  One of the first stories I covered when I came here to Info Wars was about a guy who got stranded in Hawaii got on a plane to go see his wife who was in the service in Hawaii had to stop over and sorry she was in Japan he stopped in Hawaii to catch the next leg of the flight.
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:40.960]  And they wouldn't let him leave from Hawaii because at that point they didn't then discovered that he was on a no fly list.
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:42.960]  He couldn't find out how he got on the no fly list.
[03:48:42.960 --> 03:48:45.960]  He couldn't do anything to get off of the no fly list.
[03:48:45.960 --> 03:48:49.960]  You understand this is why we have the sixth amendment.
[03:48:49.960 --> 03:48:54.960]  People in England were well aware of the star chamber proceedings in England.
[03:48:54.960 --> 03:48:59.960]  In that you could go in the star chamber and they called it the star chamber because of the drawings that were on the ceiling.
[03:48:59.960 --> 03:49:10.960]  In this secretive meeting they could accuse you, they could indict you, they could convict you without you even knowing that anybody had charged you with anything.
[03:49:10.960 --> 03:49:19.960]  That's why it's laid out in detail in the sixth amendment that you will have a public trial by a jury. You will be confronted with your accusers.
[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:23.960]  You will have representation in court. There's a process for all of this.
[03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:30.960]  And as a national review the only people to really push back against this said this is absolutely insane.
[03:49:30.960 --> 03:49:37.960]  People should be upset about the fact that we've got this list that they're advocating using this for criminal purposes.
[03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:40.960]  Now I want you to understand who is pushing this forward now.
[03:49:40.960 --> 03:49:43.960]  This is something that started under George Bush's administration in 2007.
[03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:46.960]  His Attorney General put this through.
[03:49:46.960 --> 03:49:49.960]  But now it's being brought back by Peter King.
[03:49:49.960 --> 03:49:58.960]  The neocon status authoritarian who loves every war, who loves every surveillance state movement, every police state movement.
[03:49:58.960 --> 03:50:00.960]  And he's working with Dianne Feinstein.
[03:50:00.960 --> 03:50:12.960]  So this Republican from New York Peter King is working with Dianne Feinstein and they want to make sure that anybody that the government arbitrarily secretly without due process puts on a list.
[03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:16.960]  Anybody who's on a list cannot buy a gun.
[03:50:16.960 --> 03:50:22.960]  You immediately have your rights taken just like the BLM is taking people's property rights.
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:24.960]  These are your rights as well.
[03:50:24.960 --> 03:50:25.960]  These are your property.
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:30.960]  There's a full blown media campaign to scare people to say we've got to take this away.
[03:50:30.960 --> 03:50:32.960]  We've got the daily news leading this.
[03:50:32.960 --> 03:50:40.960]  They've got Wayne LaPierre from the NRA pictures of him saying he's the craziest man on earth calling the NRA jihadis.
[03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:43.960]  Yeah, it's not a problem with the Islamists in Paris.
[03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:47.960]  No, it's the NRAs of membership who are jihadis.
[03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:49.960]  This we have to be very afraid of.
[03:50:49.960 --> 03:50:58.960]  And conservatives need to understand how they're being played by the conservative media, by the people like Fox News, by the Republicans who are putting this forward.
[03:50:58.960 --> 03:50:59.960]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[03:50:59.960 --> 03:51:00.960]  Don't take your older flu lying down.

[03:54:55.960 --> 03:55:02.960]  This is by H. Hernandez said, I felt like I was sleeping on clouds the next day. It was the best skateboarding session I ever had.
[03:55:02.960 --> 03:55:11.960]  Well, skateboarding. Did not create a bad habit. Good after a long working night shift and have to sleep during PM hours. It just works.
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:20.960]  Well, I've never used it to have a skateboarding session the next day, but I can tell you that I have used it and it works very well for me personally.

[03:55:28.960 --> 03:55:31.960]  Well, Leanne, tell us what's coming up on the nightly news tonight.
[03:55:31.960 --> 03:55:39.960]  Well, David, in addition to playing a report that we've got coming out of Rhode Island where the residents there are actively now pushing back against this refugee resettlement,
[03:55:39.960 --> 03:55:48.960]  we're also going to talk about the fact that the DHS says that they're not going to track this missing Syrian refugee because of his constitutional rights.
[03:55:48.960 --> 03:55:52.960]  Now, you'll recall earlier in the week, we reported how there was a missing Syrian refugee.
[03:55:52.960 --> 03:55:57.960]  Wait a minute. They tracked every American here. I mean, we have turned our government so far upside down.
[03:55:57.960 --> 03:56:06.960]  We have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was put in place after the church commission to say you're only going to do surveillance on people who are foreigners.
[03:56:06.960 --> 03:56:10.960]  And you have to go to this court and specify because it's going to be a secret process.
[03:56:10.960 --> 03:56:17.960]  And now we've gotten into the star chamber situation. And as Rand Paul has pointed out, they go in and they get these blanket warrants and say,
[03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:24.960]  I want to look at Mr. and Mrs. Verizon and they get one warrant for all of Verizon, another one for all of AT&T, and they spy on everybody in the world.
[03:56:24.960 --> 03:56:27.960]  And now they're telling us that they can't spy on foreigners.
[03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:31.960]  Right, on this one that's here because of his constitutional rights. He's not an American citizen.
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:39.960]  That's the excuse they use for being able to spy on people out there, out in the world, because they don't have constitutional rights.
[03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:43.960]  Well, you know, they do look at rights for foreigners that are superior to us.
[03:56:43.960 --> 03:56:51.960]  For example, if you come here as an illegal immigrant, you can get in-state college tuition at any state in the country as a dreamer,
[03:56:51.960 --> 03:56:57.960]  but you can't do that as a citizen. So this is another example of how foreigners get superior rights to citizens.
[03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:04.960]  They're second-class citizens. Yeah, and it's another example of how the Obama administration says that their problems are contained.
[03:57:04.960 --> 03:57:09.960]  But here, this Syrian refugee, they still don't know where he is. He still hasn't checked in with the authorities,
[03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:14.960]  although they think he is on his way to Washington, D.C., but they don't know because no one's tracking him.
[03:57:14.960 --> 03:57:19.960]  He hasn't checked in. But you know what, the problems contained, the vetting process is secure.
[03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:22.960]  We don't know who these people are. We don't know where they are.
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:28.960]  We're told that we have to have this massive surveillance state for security, for national security.
[03:57:28.960 --> 03:57:32.960]  And yet, they fly people in, and it isn't as if they need to be flown in.
[03:57:32.960 --> 03:57:35.960]  We've got all those reports of them coming in through Central and South America,
[03:57:35.960 --> 03:57:41.960]  being caught at the borders of various Central and South American states, as well as the Texas border,
[03:57:41.960 --> 03:57:45.960]  people coming from Syria, from Afghanistan, from all these Middle Eastern countries,
[03:57:45.960 --> 03:57:50.960]  where we have gone in and created wars and we have created terrorists, as well as refugees.
[03:57:50.960 --> 03:57:55.960]  These people are coming through the border without any challenge, and we're flying them in,
[03:57:55.960 --> 03:57:58.960]  and then we're saying we can't really follow them.
[03:57:58.960 --> 03:58:02.960]  Right, and I agree with Watson. Of course, they're not all criminals,
[03:58:02.960 --> 03:58:05.960]  but not everyone's a burglar, but you still lock your doors at night.
[03:58:05.960 --> 03:58:09.960]  Absolutely. It is absolutely insane. But of course, there is a reason for it.
[03:58:09.960 --> 03:58:11.960]  It isn't incompetence. We know what this is for.
[03:58:11.960 --> 03:58:17.960]  This is to take down the country because we can't afford this, as well as to create conflict,
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:20.960]  even with the people who are coming here that are not terrorists.
[03:58:20.960 --> 03:58:25.960]  They want to try to create the kind of multiculturalism, political correctness to pit one group against another.
[03:58:25.960 --> 03:58:26.960]  Well, that's it for today's broadcast.
[03:58:26.960 --> 03:58:29.960]  Join us for the Info Wars Nightly News with Leanne McAdoo tonight.
[03:58:29.960 --> 03:58:48.960]  7 Central, 8 PM Eastern.
