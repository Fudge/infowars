[00:00.000 --> 00:10.040]  Seriously, do I have a First Amendment because there are, you know about authoritarian regimes,
[00:10.040 --> 00:12.160]  they're lying about me and they're trying to de-platform me.
[00:12.160 --> 00:17.040]  26 companies working at concert, violating Sherman and Ettrust Act, and now Senator Warner
[00:17.040 --> 00:21.200]  and Senator Wyden have said, quote, there's thousands of sides worse than Alex Jones.
[00:21.200 --> 00:24.440]  So we're becoming like Cuba, we're becoming like Vietnam, we're becoming like China.
[00:24.440 --> 00:29.120]  So regardless of what we'll think about me or the straw men, should I have a First Amendment
[00:29.120 --> 00:33.000]  or should these companies be able to violate the whole Safe Arbor Act and all that and
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.480]  then ban conservatives en masse?
[00:34.480 --> 00:37.440]  I don't know anything about your site, man.
[00:37.440 --> 00:41.160]  The employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:41.160 --> 00:44.400]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:44.400 --> 00:45.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:45.400 --> 00:46.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:46.400 --> 00:47.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:47.400 --> 00:48.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:48.400 --> 00:49.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:49.400 --> 00:50.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:50.400 --> 00:51.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:51.400 --> 00:52.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:52.400 --> 00:53.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:53.400 --> 00:54.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:54.400 --> 00:55.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:55.400 --> 00:56.400]  Alex Jones.
[00:56.400 --> 00:57.400]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[00:57.400 --> 01:02.440]  I don't know that these are legitimate news organizations, and at that point somebody
[01:02.440 --> 01:07.200]  decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, while they were looking
[01:07.200 --> 01:10.200]  for him to be able to talk about that even though he's not my answer to this question.
[01:10.200 --> 01:12.200]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:12.200 --> 01:13.200]  His name is Alex Jones.
[01:13.200 --> 01:14.200]  Alex Jones.
[01:14.200 --> 01:18.200]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:18.200 --> 01:20.200]  Time to stop submitting in this charity.
[01:20.200 --> 01:22.200]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[01:22.200 --> 01:24.320]  I heard that on Alex Jones.
[01:24.320 --> 01:26.000]  Info wars went even further.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  Info wars.
[01:27.000 --> 01:28.000]  Info wars.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.000]  Info wars.
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.000]  Info wars.
[01:30.000 --> 01:31.000]  Info wars.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.000]  Info wars.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  Info wars.
[01:33.000 --> 01:34.000]  Info wars.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  Info wars.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  Info wars.
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  Info wars.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  Info wars.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  I got a chair going.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  Info wars.
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.000]  Info wars.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  Info wars.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Info wars.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  Info wars.
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  Info wars.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  Info wars.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.000]  Info wars.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  Info war wars.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.000]  I got a chair going.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  Info wars.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  Info wars.
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.000]  Info wars.
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.000]  Info wars.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  Info wars.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  Info wars.
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.000]  Info wars.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.500]  Infowars, infowars.com
[01:58.500 --> 01:59.500]  I want freedom!
[01:59.500 --> 02:00.500]  That's what I want!
[02:00.500 --> 02:03.500]  And that's what you should want!
[02:03.500 --> 02:05.500]  Hello, this is Hank Hill
[02:05.500 --> 02:09.500]  and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.500]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:14.500 --> 02:32.500]  you are the resistance.
[02:32.500 --> 02:34.500]  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:34.500 --> 02:37.000]  I was already excited we were going to have a good day today
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  and then Trump out of the blue
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  finally delivered on one of his big promises
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  to fight back against censorship
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  and is threatening to pull
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  tens of billions of dollars of federal funding
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  from public institutions of so-called higher learning
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  if they continue to resemble
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  North Korean re-education camps
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  or Maoist youth brigade re-education centers.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  Literally, that's the model they operate on, they say.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  I'm not just saying they operate like Maoist Red Guard,
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  that's the model.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  You cannot make it up.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  It's the operating system of Antifa,
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  the George Soros method army.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  And so, just an hour ago or so,
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  President Trump signed the executive order.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  This is devastating to the globalist,
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  it is beautiful, it's going to get challenged,
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  but you can't be a public higher education facility.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  We're supposed to have free open debate of ideas
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  and they're calling for book burning,
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  they're banning people coming and speaking.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  I probably should have taken the offer years ago in Cambridge
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  and others invited me to go speak to their famous forum
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  and I just, I didn't do it.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  There was also another invitation hidden under it.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  There was another ploy if I would have gone,
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  so I didn't want to meet with that branch of the Illuminati.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  This is the Alex Jones show, folks,
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  and though it sounds insane, but that's the level
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  and the fight we've gotten to.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  But now, Jordan Peterson's banned from speaking there
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  and now they're banning his books.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  I mean, it's on, folks, these people mean business
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  and the head of YouTube bragged how she banned me last year
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  because she didn't like me
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  and now she wants to ban Ben Shapiro.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  We played that clip yesterday.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  This is unbelievable.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  And then they go to Congress and say,
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  we're not censoring anybody and then they're on television
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  and on podcast and on congressional hearings
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  bragging how they're censoring us.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  And Democrats say they want more censorship.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  It's just the most flagrant,
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  like, if you're watching me on TV and I say I'm wearing a white shirt,
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  you're like, no, you're not, you're wearing a black shirt.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  This is a white coffee cup.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  It says dredgereport.com on it.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  It's not a black coffee cup.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  It doesn't say New York Times on it.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  It says dredge report, it's a white coffee cup.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  They tell you, though, don't believe you're lying eyes.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  Oh, I got another big announcement, too, when we come back in 60 seconds.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  And now, through the end of March,
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  we are running the biggest special of this year.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  Free shipping storewide.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  That's free shipping storewide.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  Free shipping storewide.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  50% off all the supplements.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  A bunch of other great deals as well.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Double Patriot points instead of 5% on each order.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Towards your next order, you get 10% right there in your profile.
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  Sign up for auto-ship, cancel any time for free.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Get an additional 10% off on your next order.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  That's 20% off.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  You add that to 50% off and storewide free shipping.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  Most of these products are lost leaders.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the InfoWare.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  I want to encourage you today to get great products
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  in the 360WIN InfoWareStore.com.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  Voting with our feet, voting with our dollars,
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  voting with our mouths, voting with our speech,
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  voting with our action.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  Free shipping storewide.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  That's free shipping storewide.
[05:57.000 --> 06:06.000]  InfoWareStore.com
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[06:09.000 --> 06:21.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  It's March 22nd, 2019.
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  We are smack dab in the middle of the emergency.
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  50-hour global transmission.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  We'll be live until 10 a.m. tomorrow.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  And the name of the emergency broadcast is,
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  hashtag, stop the bias,
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  save the First Amendment,
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  stop big tech censorship.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  And we have been on Trump's tail
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  to make the racketeering,
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  to make the cartels
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  that are bragging on TV and on podcast,
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  the heads of Google, the heads of Twitter,
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  the heads of Facebook, the head of YouTube,
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  that, oh, we're going to censor everybody.
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  We're going to shut people up.
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  We don't want our 13-year-old sons,
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  you know, listening to Alex Jones or Ben Shapiro.
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  These are quotes.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  Played them yesterday.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  And they go, a lot of Congress.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  Well, Trump just did it.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  He's done so much good trying to get us out of these wars,
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  pulling back 90%.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  He's gotten thousands of factories back in the country,
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  thousands of companies back.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  Major tax cuts that help poor people,
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  actually raised taxes on middle class and rich people,
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  to try to pay some of the debts.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Very Kennedy-esque.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  Got us out of the TPP.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  He's going after the private Federal Reserve,
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  trying to secure our border,
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  while the globalists try to break our border.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  Listening to good things are good,
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  but if he doesn't defend free speech,
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  it doesn't matter.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  It's like if a submarine had 10 bulkheads on it,
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  and you close nine of them but leave one open,
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  the sub's going to flood.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  Well, guess what?
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  He had dangled last year that he was going to
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  do a bunch of antitrust actions
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  against the big tech companies that's already begun.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  Against Facebook.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  That was the only action so far,
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  kind of the ganging up on Facebook,
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  which I'm not defending Facebook,
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  but it's nothing compared to Google and Apple,
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  and the true human rights abuses.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  So, a few days ago,
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  he tweeted out Laura Loomer's hashtag,
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  stop the bias,
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  and today he signed an executive order
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  to pull tens of billions of dollars from colleges,
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  where the arrogant deans
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  and the frothing fascista,
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  so-called students and antifa professors,
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  say we're not allowing free speech on our campuses.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  These are the places where it's supposedly
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  the most protected.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  These are the places where
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  speech is absolutism,
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  but now they've turned it totally on its head,
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  and so the free speech clinic at Georgetown
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  is suing myself,
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  and getting ready to sue Google,
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  demanding more censorship,
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  they've announced.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  So, that's what universities of free speech are now,
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  is systems of destroying free speech.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  It'd be like saying a nanny for your baby,
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  their job is strangling your child.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  No, the nanny's job is to take care of the child lovingly.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  So, it's a total inversion of reality.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  Big tech, the failed college professors,
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  dying corporate media,
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  with a Democratic party,
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  with an acquiescent Republican party,
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  working in tandem to completely overthrow
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  free speech as we know it.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  And they've gone a long way,
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  they've gotten away with a hell of a lot.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  Creating total anti-free speech zones in the colleges,
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  in the corporate workplaces,
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  and now they're expanding it into every aspect of our lives,
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  with millions of tech employees
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  able to dial in and look at your photos,
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  read what you're saying,
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  see what you're reading in live time,
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  and put up messages saying,
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  you better watch what you're looking at.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  It's all happening.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  They're just racing, like a fish on a line,
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  and the reel's going out,
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  and when are we going to plant the hook,
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  and try to stop this and reel this thing back in,
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  before they break the line?
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  And it's all concerted worldwide.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  And they're using the tragic events
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  in New Zealand, at Christchurch,
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  to openly demonize America and our speech as well,
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  and the global Islamic groups are calling
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  for an end to free speech.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.000]  Wow, big surprise.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  Islam's not for free speech.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  And every time it comes into your country,
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  then when there's a clash with it,
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  because 100 to 1, they kill us,
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  if you don't comply to them, it's your fault.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  And that's in the news.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  So here's the president doing the right thing,
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  a big, strong salvo right at the heart
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  of the anti-American authoritarianism
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  that would make Mao Zedong blush.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  Here's the president just a little while ago at the White House.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  To every student and young American here today,
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  don't let anyone stop you from doing what you know is right,
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  from asking questions, from challenging the powerful,
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  or from speaking your mind.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  And that's the primary reason we're here right now.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  You're going to speak your mind.
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  You're going to be fair.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  You're going to be reasonable.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  You're going to do it well.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  And you're going to speak your mind.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  Never, ever quit.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  Never give in.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  And never back down.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  Keep standing up for your values,
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  for your classmates and for your country.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  And you can be certain that every day of my presidency,
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  we will always support your rights and your freedoms
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  and your future.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  Thank you all for being here.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  There's a great honor for me.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  I've been watching this for too long.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  I've been watching things that are unwatchable,
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  and I don't like it.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  But we're going to do something about it.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  See, we like to act as opposed to just watching and saying,
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  oh, isn't that a shame?
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.000]  We don't say that.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  We don't say that.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  So proud of Trump.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  Yes, I knew I'd bet on a live horse.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  And I want to congratulate everybody, everybody for being here.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  So I leave these people around and say well,
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  we're going to have a tremendous future ahead of you.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  This is literally the cavalry, folks, coming over the hill.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  You get a point of view across.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  And listen to the other part of you.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  Maybe you can be changed.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  And maybe not, I doubt it.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  But maybe.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  You never know.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  And you know what, if you can, that's OK.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  And you'll change them too.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  You're going to change them, too.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  But ultimately, it brings people together.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  So congratulations.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.040]  Again, it pulls funding.
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.600]  Some estimates are up to $40 billion of federal money
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.440]  from these so-called colleges that are brainwashing camps.
[13:12.440 --> 13:15.000]  It's beautiful.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.880]  The anti-free speech monsters.
[13:17.880 --> 13:19.800]  All right, we've got more of this than some of the students
[13:19.800 --> 13:22.520]  coming up and what they've been through in the incredible persecution,
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.000]  physical assaults, being kicked out of college, having grades taken away,
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.960]  and the professors are so arrogant, they admit it all.
[13:29.960 --> 13:34.120]  By the way, all these lawsuits against us, they keep trying to get discovery
[13:34.120 --> 13:37.160]  and ask for my communications with the president
[13:37.160 --> 13:40.120]  or with non-governmental organizations or with the Pentagon
[13:40.120 --> 13:43.320]  because they keep going, how does Jones sync with the president?
[13:43.320 --> 13:46.360]  He launches a free speech, 50-hour broadcast,
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.320]  and then the president suddenly out of the blue acts.
[13:49.320 --> 13:51.320]  It's spiritual. It's synced up.
[13:51.320 --> 13:53.960]  And they keep wondering how I said what Trump would say
[13:53.960 --> 13:56.920]  in his inaugural speech, and then he said exactly what I said.
[13:56.920 --> 14:00.200]  The New York Times came up shaking with anger going,
[14:00.200 --> 14:02.200]  how did you know that?
[14:02.200 --> 14:04.200]  Because they've been reading my tweets that day and in videos.
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.200]  And I said, I just knew because it's a spirit.
[14:08.200 --> 14:12.200]  And it's very, very exciting, ladies and gentlemen, okay.
[14:12.200 --> 14:14.200]  And you're the reason we're here.
[14:14.200 --> 14:16.200]  We're all synced up, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:16.200 --> 14:18.200]  50-hour broadcast going.
[14:18.200 --> 14:20.200]  Joe Rogan is scheduled to be in studio today.
[14:20.200 --> 14:22.200]  His plane doesn't get in on time.
[14:22.200 --> 14:24.200]  It'll be taped.
[14:24.200 --> 14:26.200]  But Joe Rogan is going to be here just a few hours.
[14:26.200 --> 14:29.160]  He's also planning to be here to just magically work,
[14:29.160 --> 14:31.160]  to speak about free speech and how important that is.
[14:31.160 --> 14:33.160]  That's the synchronicity.
[14:33.160 --> 14:35.160]  Talk to him this morning. That's what he wants to get into.
[14:35.160 --> 14:37.160]  Very interesting.
[14:37.160 --> 14:39.160]  So we'll talk about it all.
[14:39.160 --> 14:41.160]  Please don't forget, this is a fundraiser
[14:41.160 --> 14:43.160]  to fight the globalists and win
[14:43.160 --> 14:45.160]  and keep this amazing command base, this outpost,
[14:45.160 --> 14:47.160]  this fire base against the enemy in place
[14:47.160 --> 14:49.160]  and we're completely surrounded by the enemy,
[14:49.160 --> 14:51.160]  which is perfect because that lets us target the enemy
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.160]  politically and stay inside their zone
[14:55.160 --> 14:57.160]  so that we get a 360 view of their operations.
[14:57.160 --> 14:59.160]  It's like sending a probe into the sun or something.
[14:59.160 --> 15:01.160]  But we're here. We're doing it.
[15:01.160 --> 15:03.160]  Free shipping, store-wide.
[15:03.160 --> 15:05.160]  50% off all the supplements.
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.160]  But every hour we go up to 55 or 60% off
[15:11.160 --> 15:13.160]  on a particular item for that hour.
[15:13.160 --> 15:15.160]  Survival Shield X2 this hour,
[15:15.160 --> 15:17.160]  the Deep Earth Crystal Source we sold out for months,
[15:17.160 --> 15:19.160]  we were able to actually get it again
[15:19.160 --> 15:21.160]  from the original manufacturer at the highest quality,
[15:21.160 --> 15:23.160]  original formula.
[15:23.160 --> 15:25.160]  So it's back.
[15:25.160 --> 15:27.160]  55% off and free shipping.
[15:27.160 --> 15:29.160]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[15:29.160 --> 15:31.160]  And you can cancel anytime with an additional 10% off.

[15:35.160 --> 15:37.160]  A bunch of other big specials
[15:37.160 --> 15:39.160]  on Brain Force Plus,
[15:39.160 --> 15:41.160]  on the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste,

[15:45.160 --> 15:47.160]  that nobody else has anything like it.
[15:47.160 --> 15:49.160]  Such an exciting time to be alive.
[15:49.160 --> 15:51.160]  Yes!
[15:51.160 --> 15:53.160]  Trump is coming through!
[15:53.160 --> 15:55.160]  Ha!
[15:55.160 --> 16:23.160]  I love it!
[16:23.160 --> 16:25.160]  I love it!
[16:25.160 --> 16:27.160]  I love it!
[16:27.160 --> 16:29.160]  I love it!
[16:29.160 --> 16:57.160]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US.
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.160]  I was 35 with two beautiful children
[16:59.160 --> 17:01.160]  when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[17:01.160 --> 17:03.160]  After my divorce,
[17:03.160 --> 17:05.160]  I went into a depression cycle
[17:05.160 --> 17:07.160]  and started drinking more often
[17:07.160 --> 17:09.160]  and using prescription drugs.
[17:09.160 --> 17:11.160]  After my second DWI and arrest,
[17:11.160 --> 17:13.160]  my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[17:13.160 --> 17:15.160]  I was 17 when I became addicted
[17:15.160 --> 17:17.160]  to heroin and meth.
[17:17.160 --> 17:19.160]  I thought I could quit on my own,
[17:19.160 --> 17:21.160]  but I couldn't do it.
[17:21.160 --> 17:23.160]  I was 17 when I became addicted
[17:23.160 --> 17:25.160]  to heroin and meth.
[17:25.160 --> 17:27.160]  I thought I could quit on my own,
[17:27.160 --> 17:29.160]  but I couldn't.
[17:29.160 --> 17:58.160]  I was 18 when I was arrested.
[18:00.160 --> 18:02.160]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough
[18:02.160 --> 18:03.160]  in modern medicine,
[18:03.160 --> 18:05.160]  introducing pollen block.
[18:05.160 --> 18:07.160]  We have found an extraordinary new,
[18:07.160 --> 18:09.160]  natural way to alleviate
[18:09.160 --> 18:11.160]  seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.160 --> 18:13.160]  including promoting clear nasal
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.160]  and sinus passageways,
[18:15.160 --> 18:17.160]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.160 --> 18:19.160]  In the 1960s,
[18:19.160 --> 18:21.160]  researchers in France noticed that
[18:21.160 --> 18:23.160]  people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:23.160 --> 18:25.160]  experienced less seasonal immune
[18:25.160 --> 18:27.160]  and inflammatory responses.
[18:27.160 --> 18:29.160]  We began studying this effect in published trials,
[18:29.160 --> 18:31.160]  and decades later,
[18:31.160 --> 18:33.160]  we now have the fruit of this research,
[18:33.160 --> 18:35.160]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[18:35.160 --> 18:37.160]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.160 --> 18:39.160]  Pollen block is natural
[18:39.160 --> 18:41.160]  and effective.
[18:41.160 --> 18:43.160]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:43.160 --> 18:45.160]  In fact, current research has found
[18:45.160 --> 18:47.160]  that it actually acts by blocking
[18:47.160 --> 18:49.160]  the activity of triptase,
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.160]  which is an enzyme that amplifies
[18:51.160 --> 18:53.160]  immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:53.160 --> 18:55.160]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.160 --> 18:57.160]  www.infowarslife.com
[18:57.160 --> 18:59.160]  and grab a pack of our pollen block
[18:59.160 --> 19:01.160]  chewable tablets.
[19:01.160 --> 19:03.160]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[19:03.160 --> 19:05.160]  There is no set stasis.
[19:05.160 --> 19:07.160]  There is no managed system.
[19:07.160 --> 19:09.160]  There is no uncontenual.
[19:09.160 --> 19:11.160]  The continuum is always launching forward
[19:11.160 --> 19:13.160]  in the future.
[19:13.160 --> 19:15.160]  So, you support us and get creative
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.160]  and get fired up.
[19:17.160 --> 19:19.160]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[19:19.160 --> 19:21.160]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[19:21.160 --> 19:23.160]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases
[19:23.160 --> 19:25.160]  struggled here, we made it.
[19:25.160 --> 19:27.160]  That's really where this goes.
[19:27.160 --> 19:29.160]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[19:29.160 --> 19:31.160]  If you can't face George Soros
[19:31.160 --> 19:33.160]  and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.160]  and Mao Zedong, are you going to be able
[19:35.160 --> 19:37.160]  to face the other stuff?
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.160]  God wants warriors that are smart
[19:39.160 --> 19:41.160]  and are ready to build things
[19:41.160 --> 19:43.160]  and are also ready to fight.
[19:43.160 --> 19:45.160]  You don't go to the next level without
[19:45.160 --> 19:47.160]  getting a big weight put on your back.
[19:47.160 --> 19:49.160]  I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[19:49.160 --> 19:51.160]  All I know is, I want to go with
[19:51.160 --> 19:53.160]  the spirit that I've experienced.
[19:53.160 --> 19:55.160]  Not these devil worshipers, they're cold
[19:55.160 --> 19:57.160]  and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[19:57.160 --> 20:26.160]  I want life, I want Jesus.
[20:28.160 --> 20:31.160]  It's a reliable source of information.
[20:33.160 --> 20:36.160]  $50,000 a stopper for watts.
[20:42.160 --> 20:44.160]  So, ladies and gentlemen,
[20:45.160 --> 20:47.160]  if you go to infowars.com
[20:47.160 --> 20:49.160]  you see the headline, Finally!
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.160]  Trump Strikes Back Against
[20:53.160 --> 20:56.160]  Leftist Censorship
[20:56.160 --> 20:58.160]  in the United States.
[20:59.160 --> 21:01.160]  Think about that.
[21:01.160 --> 21:03.160]  That's exactly where you hit him.
[21:03.160 --> 21:05.160]  You want to hit George Soros?
[21:05.160 --> 21:07.160]  Remember what
[21:07.160 --> 21:09.160]  Lou Dobbs said
[21:09.160 --> 21:11.160]  back in December
[21:11.160 --> 21:13.160]  when we had giant caravan
[21:13.160 --> 21:15.160]  smashing in to the United States
[21:15.160 --> 21:17.160]  tens of thousands of people, they'd overrun the Mexicans.
[21:17.160 --> 21:20.160]  They had smuggled kidnapped kids, drugs.
[21:20.160 --> 21:22.160]  First they said there is no caravan.
[21:22.160 --> 21:25.160]  Then they said, oh, they're all women and children, let them in.
[21:25.160 --> 21:27.160]  Then they all had USAID bags,
[21:27.160 --> 21:30.160]  that's where our tax money goes to the State Department,
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.160]  to the UN and then to George Soros.
[21:32.160 --> 21:34.160]  He never spends his own money.
[21:34.160 --> 21:36.160]  He takes a cut of it.
[21:36.160 --> 21:38.160]  Then Lou Dobbs had judicial watch on
[21:38.160 --> 21:40.160]  with the documents.
[21:40.160 --> 21:42.160]  They had a judicial watch
[21:42.160 --> 21:44.160]  and it was Soros getting hundreds of millions of dollars
[21:44.160 --> 21:46.160]  the last few years
[21:46.160 --> 21:48.160]  and he's in visa commercials,
[21:48.160 --> 21:50.160]  getting visa to give the invaders
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.160]  multi-thousand dollar cards
[21:52.160 --> 21:55.160]  with no name on them, they just work.
[21:55.160 --> 21:58.160]  And the media said it was a conspiracy theory
[21:58.160 --> 22:01.160]  and didn't exist, even though it's official funding,
[22:01.160 --> 22:04.160]  even though it was NBC News, the Associated Press,
[22:04.160 --> 22:06.160]  praising George Soros
[22:06.160 --> 22:08.160]  for funding the migrants with our money.
[22:08.160 --> 22:11.160]  But then separately when judicial watch gets the documents
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.160]  that it's worse than we knew, it doesn't exist.
[22:14.160 --> 22:18.160]  And Fox reprimanded Lou Dobbs.
[22:18.160 --> 22:21.160]  Members suddenly he wasn't on for a couple days.
[22:21.160 --> 22:23.160]  They suspended him.
[22:23.160 --> 22:26.160]  And Fox announced that the head of judicial watch,
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.160]  highly respected, was never to be on Fox News again.
[22:31.160 --> 22:34.160]  Because he brought out
[22:34.160 --> 22:37.160]  the states, the holy water,
[22:37.160 --> 22:39.160]  the garlic,
[22:39.160 --> 22:41.160]  high noon.
[22:43.160 --> 22:44.160]  Think about that.
[22:44.160 --> 22:45.160]  There's the L.A. Times.
[22:45.160 --> 22:47.160]  Fox, Bands, Lou Dobbs tonight,
[22:47.160 --> 22:49.160]  guest over George Soros, comment.
[22:49.160 --> 22:51.160]  What's going to do with Trump finally coming through
[22:51.160 --> 22:52.160]  on First Amendment?
[22:52.160 --> 22:57.160]  He's going to cut the tens of billions of dollars
[22:57.160 --> 23:00.160]  from any public college that bans speech
[23:00.160 --> 23:02.160]  and restricts it.
[23:02.160 --> 23:04.160]  Of course you should take their money.
[23:04.160 --> 23:06.160]  These are criminal organizations.
[23:06.160 --> 23:08.160]  Let them learn why they're publicly funded
[23:08.160 --> 23:10.160]  and why we believe in higher education.
[23:10.160 --> 23:12.160]  They have inverted higher education.
[23:12.160 --> 23:15.160]  They are monsters.
[23:15.160 --> 23:18.160]  And they've gotten so arrogant, the head of YouTube,
[23:18.160 --> 23:21.160]  gone to the biggest podcast
[23:21.160 --> 23:25.160]  at the Lesbians in Tech Convention in San Francisco.
[23:25.160 --> 23:28.160]  And they're all giggling and laughing and saying,
[23:28.160 --> 23:30.160]  we took Alex Jones off.
[23:30.160 --> 23:31.160]  We want Ben Shapiro off.
[23:31.160 --> 23:33.160]  And she goes, well, I'm trying.
[23:33.160 --> 23:34.160]  I agree.
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.160]  We want him off.
[23:35.160 --> 23:37.160]  Ben Shapiro's a neocon milk toast.
[23:37.160 --> 23:38.160]  He makes a lot of good points.
[23:38.160 --> 23:40.160]  I remember about 80% of what he says.
[23:40.160 --> 23:43.160]  But my God, he's the darling of the neocons.
[23:43.160 --> 23:47.160]  Even a neocon apprentice,
[23:47.160 --> 23:50.160]  the darling golden boy is not good enough.
[23:50.160 --> 23:52.160]  They want it all gone.
[23:52.160 --> 23:53.160]  And why?
[23:53.160 --> 24:00.160]  Because she doesn't like her son having access to it.
[24:00.160 --> 24:07.160]  They're in public saying they want to control everything.
[24:07.160 --> 24:12.160]  And so you cut the money.
[24:12.160 --> 24:17.160]  George Soros, conservatively,
[24:17.160 --> 24:21.160]  has gotten about, from the numbers we've seen,
[24:21.160 --> 24:24.160]  about $150 billion from the State Department
[24:24.160 --> 24:27.160]  in the last 30 years.
[24:27.160 --> 24:30.160]  And I'll give Soros this.
[24:30.160 --> 24:32.160]  He's an intelligence operative of the highest levels,
[24:32.160 --> 24:34.160]  above CIA, all that.
[24:34.160 --> 24:36.160]  He worked for the U.S. government.
[24:36.160 --> 24:38.160]  George Soros helped take down the USSR.
[24:38.160 --> 24:41.160]  I know people that work with him.
[24:41.160 --> 24:43.160]  The point is, he's using all that now on us,
[24:43.160 --> 24:45.160]  like America's the USSR,
[24:45.160 --> 24:48.160]  and like mom and apple pie is, and it isn't.
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.160]  We're facing the CIA, the NSA,
[24:51.160 --> 24:53.160]  the criminal elements of it,
[24:53.160 --> 24:55.160]  that are rolling out this civil emergency
[24:55.160 --> 24:57.160]  that Brett Hume talked about last week.
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.160]  He said the Democrats declared a secret emergency,
[25:00.160 --> 25:02.160]  and there's an emergency in the government against Trump.
[25:02.160 --> 25:04.160]  That's the truth.
[25:04.160 --> 25:05.160]  Now, I know you heard that here years ago,
[25:05.160 --> 25:07.160]  because it's in the executive orders of Obama,
[25:07.160 --> 25:09.160]  but that's a big deal.
[25:09.160 --> 25:11.160]  He cut the funding, Mr. President,
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.160]  of the Countering Foreign Intelligence and Disinformation Act.
[25:14.160 --> 25:17.160]  It doesn't counter foreign intelligence and disinformation.
[25:17.160 --> 25:19.160]  It targets you.
[25:19.160 --> 25:23.160]  It targets me, publicly, in the damn hearings,
[25:23.160 --> 25:25.160]  saying I'm anti-American.
[25:25.160 --> 25:27.160]  No, I'm not Google helping build
[25:27.160 --> 25:29.160]  autonomous AI,
[25:29.160 --> 25:31.160]  hunter-killer robots and drones,
[25:31.160 --> 25:34.160]  and telling the Pentagon go fly a kite.
[25:34.160 --> 25:37.160]  I'm an American, period, and everybody knows it.
[25:37.160 --> 25:39.160]  It's all going to come out.
[25:39.160 --> 25:43.160]  So, George Soros wants to work with the U.N.
[25:43.160 --> 25:45.160]  the State Department to crush our borders,
[25:45.160 --> 25:48.160]  overwhelm our judges and courts and jails,
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.160]  cut his funding, jerking.
[25:51.160 --> 25:53.160]  When you see when they freak out,
[25:53.160 --> 25:56.160]  you know what hurts them, cutting their funding,
[25:56.160 --> 25:58.160]  how they're using our money against us,
[25:58.160 --> 26:00.160]  any type of criticism of pedophilia,
[26:00.160 --> 26:02.160]  and the left grooming your kids,
[26:02.160 --> 26:05.160]  that's their big sacrament, that's their biggest no-no.
[26:05.160 --> 26:07.160]  You don't talk about that.
[26:07.160 --> 26:09.160]  No, no, no, that's their religion,
[26:09.160 --> 26:11.160]  is screwing your kids up.
[26:11.160 --> 26:15.160]  Vampiric, true vampirism, spiritual, energy.
[26:18.160 --> 26:21.160]  And they don't like open borders
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.160]  and the Islamic invasion being taken over,
[26:23.160 --> 26:25.160]  because they're going to bring the Muslims in,
[26:25.160 --> 26:27.160]  it's not compatible with the West,
[26:27.160 --> 26:29.160]  and then we'll have to get rid of free speech and everything
[26:29.160 --> 26:31.160]  to be compatible for them,
[26:31.160 --> 26:33.160]  and now the global Islamic councils,
[26:33.160 --> 26:35.160]  the West and the police are putting a jibs on in Europe
[26:35.160 --> 26:37.160]  and New Zealand in solidarity.
[26:37.160 --> 26:40.160]  Hey, will the Muslims go put crosses on in solidarity
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.160]  the next time a church gets blown up?
[26:45.160 --> 26:47.160]  They've had NBC news, media matters,
[26:47.160 --> 26:49.160]  Southern Prairie Law Center,
[26:49.160 --> 26:50.160]  all of them come out and say,
[26:50.160 --> 26:52.160]  Jones is a liar.
[26:52.160 --> 26:55.160]  He says Muslims target churches
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.160]  on Easter and Palm Sunday.
[26:57.160 --> 26:59.160]  What hundreds of churches
[26:59.160 --> 27:01.160]  have been blown up the last few years
[27:01.160 --> 27:05.160]  in Egypt alone on Easter, Christmas and Palm Sunday?
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.160]  It's like Jones claims that in Indianapolis
[27:09.160 --> 27:11.160]  they have a race called the 500.
[27:11.160 --> 27:13.160]  Jones claims the New England Patriots
[27:13.160 --> 27:17.160]  are based in New England and have won six Super Bowls.
[27:17.160 --> 27:20.160]  Jones claims, again, two plus two equals four,
[27:20.160 --> 27:22.160]  and they just state like,
[27:22.160 --> 27:25.160]  Jones wrongly claims there's only two genders.
[27:25.160 --> 27:27.160]  Jones claims water's wet.
[27:27.160 --> 27:30.160]  Again, it's an assault on reality.
[27:33.160 --> 27:35.160]  And so I feel bad for these Muslims,
[27:35.160 --> 27:37.160]  even though local newspapers reported
[27:37.160 --> 27:39.160]  that there was radicalization of people
[27:39.160 --> 27:41.160]  that ended up getting captured and killed
[27:41.160 --> 27:43.160]  in Syria from that mosque.
[27:43.160 --> 27:45.160]  You know, still,
[27:45.160 --> 27:47.160]  it's a terrible thing that happened to those poor people.
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.160]  But you know what?
[27:49.160 --> 27:51.160]  Let's humanize some Christians.
[27:51.160 --> 27:53.160]  Let's humanize some Christians.
[27:53.160 --> 27:55.160]  Let's humanize some Christians.
[27:55.160 --> 27:57.160]  Because Christians are being driven out of their lands
[27:57.160 --> 28:00.160]  all over the world, and the Islamic caliphate
[28:00.160 --> 28:06.160]  is expanding like a lymph node cancer,
[28:06.160 --> 28:09.160]  racing throughout the body.
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.160]  And the biggest killer of Muslims is other Muslims.
[28:12.160 --> 28:17.160]  We need a reparation, a reformation in Islam.
[28:17.160 --> 28:25.160]  We need to come out of this mass Stockholm syndrome.
[28:27.160 --> 28:30.160]  We need to understand the reality of how we're being conditioned,
[28:30.160 --> 28:32.160]  and they're trying to break our will.
[28:32.160 --> 28:34.160]  They think we're stupid. They think we're saps.
[28:34.160 --> 28:36.160]  They think we're followers, and there are a lot of people that are.
[28:36.160 --> 28:38.160]  But a bunch of us aren't.
[28:38.160 --> 28:40.160]  And it's not going to work.
[28:40.160 --> 28:42.160]  In the middle of the 50-hour global transmission,
[28:42.160 --> 28:45.160]  to save the First Amendment, to stop NIC Tech censorship,
[28:45.160 --> 28:49.160]  and now Trump is fired right at the heart
[28:49.160 --> 28:52.160]  of the spider's nest of censorship.
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.160]  The once great university is now dins of hardcore brainwashing,
[28:56.160 --> 29:19.160]  cutting their funding of the engage in criminal activity.
[29:26.160 --> 29:29.160]  Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?

[30:00.160 --> 30:02.160]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents,
[30:02.160 --> 30:05.160]  knew that they canned food during the fall,
[30:05.160 --> 30:07.160]  so they'd have it during the winter.

[46:17.800 --> 46:25.160]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost

[46:58.760 --> 47:09.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:09.040 --> 47:27.840]  You are listening to an info wars dot-com frontline report it's Alex Jones
[47:27.840 --> 47:41.000]  Well, we're in the middle of a 50-hour global broadcast
[47:42.320 --> 47:44.640]  You've got every day
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.240]  Ten hours of live broadcasting on am and FM and TV stations
[47:51.400 --> 47:57.160]  Well, I just during the break. I walked back during the Phillip relations area and there were four or five new radio stations
[47:57.160 --> 48:00.600]  But there were a couple of new big TV stations
[48:01.120 --> 48:05.440]  I'm gonna be announcing the next week, but but a couple of them are like the big stations and in big cities
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.440]  All the stations are precious, but a lot of exciting things happening
[48:09.800 --> 48:13.600]  That's what the globalist were working around the clock to shut us down misrepresenting that we are
[48:14.200 --> 48:16.280]  Trying to sue us into oblivion real rotas
[48:16.880 --> 48:19.160]  But God keeps coming through and you keep coming through
[48:19.680 --> 48:21.680]  We have the save the First Amendment
[48:22.320 --> 48:25.160]  Massive specials the biggest we've ever done. I mean they match
[48:25.160 --> 48:31.600]  The specials from Christmas that were our biggest ever and then with this new deal where for an hour each day
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.680]  One of the items that's 50% off is 55 to 60% off
[48:35.680 --> 48:41.960]  It's it's a little bit bigger discount with double Patriot points on your next order with your profile and for store com
[48:42.920 --> 48:49.000]  Instead of getting five cents on the next dollar for every dollar you spend we get five cents on the next purchase you get 10 cents
[48:49.000 --> 48:54.480]  You add to that signing up for auto ship on things like wake up America coffee or the fish oil or the protein bars
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.720]  Or or the super blue toothpaste you can do it every 15 days every month every two months every three months

[49:12.240 --> 49:16.600]  You get great coffee. You get great fish oil. You get amazing protein bars
[49:16.600 --> 49:21.400]  Amazing protein bars. Those are about to sell out. So we had to end the special on those and you get
[49:22.040 --> 49:26.400]  To fund the revolution against the globalists. It's a win-win. They fear this model of
[49:27.160 --> 49:29.800]  Direct sale to fund media. They always use boycotts
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.920]  to terrorize and control people and that's why this model we've built is the maverick
[49:34.920 --> 49:40.720]  It is the winner and you are the reason we're here. So again, I don't just say that to pat you on the head. You're it
[49:41.560 --> 49:43.560]  You're the oxygen I breathe. You're the
[49:43.560 --> 49:45.560]  The
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.320]  Ground under my feet and the sky above my head. I mean, we're all in this together
[49:50.200 --> 49:52.600]  It's when I thank you. I mean it. Thank you
[49:53.400 --> 49:55.160]  infoworkstore.com
[49:55.160 --> 49:57.160]  But you may not have it done
[49:57.640 --> 50:01.640]  You're just as important as bill gates because you can spread the word and take action
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.840]  You have a connection to god well back to Clyde Lewis big syndicated host with ground zero weeknights on over
[50:06.840 --> 50:10.920]  What is it 500 stations across the country right before George Norrie and coast to coast a.m?
[50:10.920 --> 50:15.800]  Round zero media. You were getting into trump and then I mean I like this new movies taken
[50:16.520 --> 50:20.680]  Some of the things I don't like like big tech immunity in the new
[50:21.320 --> 50:24.120]  North American union renegotiation, but I think they'll get taken out in congress
[50:24.120 --> 50:27.000]  But getting back into trump. I don't want to ask you you're a smart guy
[50:28.280 --> 50:33.640]  Clyde Lewis, where do you see all this going because the elite basically stay in their own white papers as you know
[50:33.720 --> 50:37.720]  They believe civilization is going to collapse. So they're just helping it along
[50:37.720 --> 50:40.280]  And and they want to have a controlled collapse
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.280]  A controlled demolition. Well, I don't want them to control my destiny
[50:44.680 --> 50:47.480]  And so far a lot of their plans have not been carried out the way they thought
[50:48.040 --> 50:51.320]  But they're still I would say impartial control. Do you disagree with that? You agree
[50:52.040 --> 50:56.840]  I would say that if you take a look at how old the united states is what 241 years old
[50:57.080 --> 50:59.800]  And you look at the roman empire last about 300 some odd years
[50:59.800 --> 51:05.160]  I mean that doesn't mean that our empire and our government is going to last that long either and we have a lot of people pushing
[51:05.160 --> 51:10.120]  A new government that is un-american and we allow it to happen. I mean I
[51:10.920 --> 51:12.760]  Just to cite my source. I was talking about earlier
[51:12.760 --> 51:16.280]  It was a volume of the american political science review in 1950
[51:16.360 --> 51:18.920]  It was called toward a more responsible two-party system
[51:19.480 --> 51:25.560]  And it was recommended back then that there would be the either has to be the centralization
[51:25.640 --> 51:28.520]  Of the two parties mean there has to be this middle ground somewhere
[51:28.920 --> 51:33.960]  Someone has to speak true to power in the middle ground because if we look at policy alternatives
[51:33.960 --> 51:35.960]  If we don't allow
[51:36.200 --> 51:43.080]  You know alternative programs alternative thought process to be executed in the parties or or with politics
[51:43.400 --> 51:47.080]  You would see the voters frustration and you'd see all the mounting ambiguities
[51:47.560 --> 51:53.320]  The you know the lies the impunity and we would see everything go towards extreme tennis
[51:53.320 --> 51:58.680]  And then the left and right orthodoxies just like islam only gets more extreme the left only gets more extreme
[51:58.680 --> 52:05.080]  Yeah, they become sectarian and extreme and this would basically represent a condition which neither our political institutions
[52:05.080 --> 52:07.400]  Nor a civic habits would be adapted and we would see the
[52:08.360 --> 52:10.360]  destabilization process you would see
[52:11.160 --> 52:18.280]  The the party systems clashing with the constitutional republic because you know what they would do would be first of all
[52:18.600 --> 52:24.520]  Ideas and then the other would be unconstitutional and it would create this deep political divide and clad don't you agree?
[52:24.520 --> 52:29.400]  It's in wiki leaks too that the globalists are destabilizing on purpose. They're trying to sabotage
[52:29.800 --> 52:35.160]  Our system by playing it off against each other to bring in the corporate fascist technocracy model
[52:35.880 --> 52:38.840]  Well, of course, uh, it's the chinese model is what it is
[52:38.840 --> 52:41.240]  They've been they've been wanting the chinese model for some time
[52:41.320 --> 52:47.000]  They probably won't get it until 2030 because that would take time to create the frustration division needed
[52:47.560 --> 52:50.600]  To create the schism and that would breed extremism and radicalism
[52:50.600 --> 52:54.840]  That's why we're seeing radicalism and extremism being focused upon the system has gone rogue
[52:55.160 --> 53:00.520]  The two-party system is fragmenting to the point that those who see the extremism with their own political parties are bowing
[53:00.520 --> 53:04.440]  Now they're saying I didn't sign up for this. I didn't sign up for new korean deal
[53:04.440 --> 53:07.640]  I didn't I didn't sign up for this. I didn't sign up for these other
[53:08.440 --> 53:11.960]  You know ideas that are extreme and it's uncomfortable to hear this
[53:11.960 --> 53:18.920]  But it's becoming apparent that the two-party system can no longer be efficient because there's this massive split decision attitude with everything
[53:18.920 --> 53:23.080]  We want to get rid of the electoral college. Oh, wow. We want the 16 year old vote
[53:23.240 --> 53:29.720]  Think of these extreme ideas within the parties and no one can no longer agree with every radical leader that is expressed for the established agenda
[53:29.720 --> 53:37.080]  So it's impossible to identify or support every issue that's being drummed up or presented within the party because your morals won't allow it
[53:37.720 --> 53:40.280]  And you can't say you're morally straight
[53:40.760 --> 53:46.120]  If you're basically going after all these extreme views, it's like how many people in the on the left
[53:46.120 --> 53:51.080]  Have to support this new abortion law in new york. And if you do, are you sick?
[53:51.560 --> 53:56.440]  I mean, look, I've always been like you say. I mean, I've been pretty fair with how I feel and I've always said
[53:56.520 --> 54:00.200]  Well, it's not my decision to tell a woman what to do with her body. I'm not going to do that
[54:00.440 --> 54:03.880]  But then when they talk about how on the day of birth they can kill a kid
[54:04.200 --> 54:10.040]  Come on. Can you really with a moral with moral values support some exactly they're now taking the
[54:10.040 --> 54:16.680]  The the the woman's right and extending it after birth in a new sick right and beat over orc and all the people agree with it
[54:16.840 --> 54:18.840]  And the and the democrats all
[54:18.840 --> 54:22.600]  Gleefully clapped their hands. They've now right been put into a position of
[54:23.160 --> 54:28.440]  Like jim jones cult now now we're having a debate. Let's not kill viable born babies
[54:29.080 --> 54:30.840]  right and can you really
[54:30.840 --> 54:37.320]  Support lgbtq if all of the members there think the 11 year olds can dance and strip clubs and drag
[54:37.320 --> 54:43.080]  Give me a break. This is something that you know immediately the extremes are taking over and if you say anything
[54:43.080 --> 54:46.840]  They'll say well, you know, I'm a liberal so therefore I have to stick with this
[54:47.080 --> 54:52.680]  No, you don't exactly let me ask this question because it's only whoever leads your cult or your group
[54:52.920 --> 54:56.920]  They define what you've now got to follow and it just gets more crazy by the minute
[54:57.720 --> 55:02.760]  Well, it got me feeling a little weird when I saw these kids who were striking and sitting out of classes saying they're all
[55:02.760 --> 55:08.920]  Going to die in 12 years. We don't come back climate change. Are you kidding me? That's an extreme view presented by a casio-cortez
[55:09.080 --> 55:14.280]  And it's almost like all those children and it was like all those children were parroting extremism
[55:14.440 --> 55:19.400]  It's like back when those kids went and visited diane feinstein and they said the same thing to her
[55:19.400 --> 55:23.480]  And she says, you know what I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.360]  You guys don't know what you're doing and people are going gosh you treated those kids poorly. No, she told the truth
[55:28.360 --> 55:33.720]  She's not going to be on board with some extremes to viewpoint because there's old school democrat
[55:33.880 --> 55:39.000]  There's old school republican, but we have neoliberals and neocons that are basically trying to take over the system
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.400]  And they're destabilizing the system and like I said, it will clash with our constitutional republic
[55:44.600 --> 55:45.720]  well
[55:45.720 --> 55:49.640]  When you get into the wiki leaks of their docs you must keep going back to wiki leaks because it's their admissions
[55:49.720 --> 55:52.520]  They want a civil war that they control
[55:52.520 --> 55:58.040]  And then they claim that I want one when it's the opposite and then they misrepresent what I've said
[55:58.440 --> 56:02.440]  So even though I'm not the extremist they claim I am they build a straw man
[56:03.000 --> 56:10.760]  And put that out so that they can make their side more extreme by using me as the symbol of extremism to then actually radicalize their own people
[56:11.400 --> 56:13.720]  Oh, exactly. I mean they'll use their own straw man
[56:13.720 --> 56:20.120]  And they'll say like you're the extremist side of of of conservatism while they'll have their extreme sides and get away with it
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.120]  I mean there was a time when our two-party system
[56:24.840 --> 56:31.080]  Was praised for how it was moderate unlike you see dogmen other dogmatic ideological parties in europe
[56:31.480 --> 56:37.880]  But now we have this winner take all attitude where we say well, we'd rather see the vote go
[56:38.200 --> 56:44.040]  Younger and we'd rather see electoral college go away. Why well that gives us an advantage because we want to be able to
[56:44.040 --> 56:50.920]  To I mean look no party can convincingly win a majority by putting forward extremist anti system candidates far outside the mainstream
[56:50.920 --> 56:55.240]  But this is changing this is bucking the trend because something has gone wrong instead of being
[56:55.560 --> 56:58.360]  You know rejected and saying no no no no
[56:58.360 --> 57:03.960]  We're not going to allow the commentary about handing over our constitution to the united united nations body
[57:04.280 --> 57:07.880]  And have them try and combat the weather. This is insanity. I mean
[57:07.880 --> 57:13.240]  I don't know. Clive Lewis hold on there. Hold on because I want to come back to you for five more minutes

[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.400]  Because we know what happens once you go down that path
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.840]  It brings things out in people that create dark ages
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:16.040]  But the democrats particularly now and leftists all over the world are defending radical islam
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.360]  Even though it's the antithetical of their leftist views. They're they're they're they're cheating in elections
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.560]  They're stealing their anti free speech. They're they're lying about people
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.280]  Alexandria Cortez came out and said oh
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.440]  Laura Ingram says, you know, basically i'm a dumb dumb latino woman
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.240]  Where's the clip? She didn't say it. You're the liar. You're the racist creating that
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.040]  And so when there's no bottom
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.480]  These people think oh, I just took the bottom out from you but more often than not when you take away
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.120]  The guardrails in society that were put there by experience
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.360]  You now go off the edge of the cliff not your enemy and I see this all the time where people throw caution to the wind
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.200]  They don't care. There's like they don't understand Clyde. I think that's what you just hit
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.880]  How would you quantify that just a recklessness only thinking one dimensionally?
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.600]  Uh, because I see more and more people aren't
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.480]  Thinking five six seven steps out
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.440]  I think it's it's it's the pyramid. It's been upside down
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.360]  It's all players are supporting the same policies of centralization
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.320]  And many of them say okay. We'll just give you elites the power to basically make positions for me
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.760]  But here we are at the bottom of the pyramid and many people are the bottom of the pyramid
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.400]  And there are numerous legitimate divides among common citizens so the divides are real. They're not false
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:40.440]  And these divides that uh, that we're having right now the elites seek to exploit in order to destabilize this country
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:47.720]  And here's the thing. I I know why you're the scapegoat Alex and this is why because we have one divide that we have here
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.560]  Uh, we hear a lot about it. It's the the cycle divide between old school democrats and the new green deal
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.400]  Okay, those are the socialist communists and they're the ones that are basically saying oh, we're being put upon a pep dawn
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:05.000]  And they had me because what they're doing they're proposing something. It's anti-american. So and then we have another
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.160]  The vitriolic divide and that one is between common sense conservatives
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.600]  And the double down socialist cult within the republican party
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.720]  It's the double down socialist cult within the republican party conservatives and liberals that are using you as a scapegoat
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.440]  Because uh, there's this cobert divide and it's created
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.920]  Uh, but another breed of conservatives. There are neocons and there are other conservatives
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.160]  There are classic liberals and classic conservatives, but the pattern is usually observed
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.320]  And and when anyone says well, I'm one of those people that's in the middle
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:41.560]  And I want to bow out they say well, that's conspiracy theory. You're a conspiracy theorist. You're a you're a radical
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.280]  Exactly if you don't buy into whatever the left or right orthodoxy is and you're asking questions
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.840]  Well, you're the devil and that's why we have q. That's why we have you that's why we have me
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.560]  I mean you more than me because I'm I mean
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.080]  Uh, you get out there in the trenches and you basically expose yourself
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.160]  So, uh, you know, we have these sovereignty activists that say well
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.480]  That's unseemly the system and put in people that are outsiders. And that's why we got trump
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.000]  Well, then the democrats took a cue for that. So, well, why don't we unseat the the old school and put in these young
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:18.760]  vibrant people who say things that uh are no one and improve like, you know, anti-semitism on one side and
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:24.680]  Uh, the latina who speaks about socialism communism on the other and while these other old school
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.240]  Democrats are going well, we don't necessarily support this, but they won't say it because I'm well, you're right
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.920]  It's all getting more

[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.040]  Jack besovic is an american news correspondent
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.320]  for one american news network at twitter
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.760]  At jack besovic oan in dot com
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.960]  i've got some exciting news that jack brought to my attention
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.520]  cloud tv
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.160]  Is one of those big fast growing systems like rocu?
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.560]  And it's got hundreds and hundreds of channels and info wars
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.160]  Is top rated on cloud tv?
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:11.080]  It is now the top rated one. They only post on there a few months ago outranking the blaze and newsmax
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:17.800]  cloud tv dot com great system i've replaced rocu at my house since they took me off
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.080]  The sandy hook family lawyers went on
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.680]  The news and said jones is sending people to our houses on
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.920]  On there right now taking them off here. None of that was even true never sent anybody to their houses
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:33.480]  They were back on mpr last weekend saying it's clear and present danger like i'm big bad wolf
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.320]  Uh, but that's that's how they operate the cloud tv has stood up against that
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.200]  And you learned why?
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.480]  We're being taken down because we're number one just like when we were number one on news
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.440]  We just happened to launch our app two weeks before the big banning last august
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.600]  And uh, we were already in the top 50 and we shot to number one in news
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.920]  So they delisted it and then removed it. You can still get it on android. I want to talk about myself, but
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.560]  this was pointed out
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.440]  by
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.440]  Uh, jack bassobix. I appreciate him joining us jack bassobix of course has run one of the biggest grassroots probe
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.000]  trump sites
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.400]  Uh, originally from the Philadelphia area jack has worked for four presidential campaigns for those numerous candidates for senate congress and governor
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:21.320]  He's a veteran of the u.s navy with multiple deployments overseas. He's fluent in mandarin chinese because that's why i wanted to get him on
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.240]  Weeks ago was about china
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.200]  He was too busy
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.680]  But now trump signed this order to go after the universities violating free speech. That's so
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:35.240]  Smart best place to hit. He controls that funding via the executive order. There'll be a battle, but still it points out what's happening
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.880]  This is the cavalry coming over the hill. I'm gonna take on that
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.000]  And then general dumford the chairman saying look google and others have just basically moved to china
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:48.040]  It's beyond china stealing our stuff. They're just taking over our darpa infrastructure
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.320]  obama set this in motion and jack's worked in china
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.560]  That doesn't work there obviously uh classified work other things you can't get into but jack
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.720]  It's good to have you here with us and uh, it's great to see your shining face there
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.360]  Give us your take on either one of these issues first and then whatever else is on your radar screen
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.840]  Well, alex appreciate being on thanks for having me as always and appreciate you
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.280]  Standing up of course for freedom standing up for the first amendment
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.720]  We're seeing it now on the college campuses and it's fantastic
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:22.360]  So much of the territory there so much of what's going on on college campuses is uh is a travesty
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:27.960]  And i've actually been something this is something that I fought um all the way going back to my own college days over a decade ago
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:34.520]  I actually brought uh, david harwitz and the david harwitz freedom center on the campus with me temple university 2006
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:41.480]  We sued we actually sued our our school over academic freedom because we received public funding a little bit of public funding
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:46.520]  And so uh, you can go back and look at this. It's all the news and local in philadelphia. We sued through brought in state
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  legislators we did um
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.320]  All sorts of hearings on this and we had students myself included give testimony
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.680]  Over the bias of these professors talking about what they were talking about
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.280]  Pushing their politics in a classroom where you shouldn't be pushing politics at all and uh back then 2006
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.800]  I was right when the global warming stuff was really really kicking off. So that was a huge topic
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.280]  But I think it's today it's and it's great. The president is doing this on campuses
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:15.240]  But we also need to look to the social media censorship and one thing
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:21.720]  That I've actually been in discussions with with ron colman who's a free speech lawyer and others about is
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.320]  Not necessarily about what can be done at the federal level
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.840]  But what's very interesting is he started to think about it in a different way
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:35.960]  He said what about if we looked at this from a state by state basis and actually used state legislation
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.000]  In some cases to make it possible
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.720]  to bring legal action
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:48.200]  Against these corporations for shutting people down and here's the specific language that he was using
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.880]  shutting them down
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:54.200]  Without breaking their actual terms of service. So here's how it would go
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.560]  And anyway, it's just really something that we're brainstorming right now
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.160]  But it's it would basically be a consumer protection act
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.360]  It would be a consumer protection of digital rights and essentially it holds them to their own standards
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:12.920]  It says if you have terms of service on your service right on your platform, but they call them edge providers
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.840]  so facebook twitter google etc youtube and
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.600]  This person has not broken that terms of service
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.920]  Or you cannot provide any explanation as to why they actually
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.120]  Or have been banned or have been shut down without providing a specific break
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:36.680]  And if you're not applying that across the board to all pushers and all users of your content
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.400]  Of people who put their content on these platforms
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:46.760]  Then it would create a mechanism by which people who have been wrongfully treated and essentially what because of what it is
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.600]  It's discrimination against political orientation, right? We have gender discrimination
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:55.400]  We have religious discrimination, but we don't have protection for political orientation yet
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:59.720]  We don't have protection for political ideology yet in this country and that's what this would set up
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:06.120]  You'd be able to then bring forward a legal case on a state-by-state basis. Sure. We see we see Louisiana now moving in that direction
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.520]  Right. And so we're looking at Louisiana
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.400]  We're looking at florida other possible test states for this to be
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.920]  Inactive and and move forward and then we're also going to be working with people who are big on those states
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.040]  And hopefully trying to find people that have been banned in those states
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:24.840]  Donald trump jr. Has been really big on this pushing this fight back because uh, and and
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.240]  And we think if we do it on a state-by-state level, obviously, it's going to be the more conservative states
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.320]  Conservative ag's are going to be on board with this
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]  But then the other ones will have to
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.120]  We'll have to join in and if we can get enough support behind it
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.680]  If we can get enough backing behind it that it's going to end up being national anyway because no
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.240]  I agree with you
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.640]  Looks out going to sit there and try to figure out one set of laws or 50 sets of laws for each 50 to each of the 50 states
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:54.040]  No, they're going to go with one standard and they're going to use whatever the strongest standard is
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.360]  So we set the standard with this legislation
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.560]  Well for 30 years big tech has been treated like royalty. They can do whatever they want that honeymoon is over
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.440]  And their abuse of the people and all the things they've done
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.360]  Has now left them open. So there's going to be a fight between the left the right and everybody else
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:13.000]  over the new architecture and I just think the left and the universities
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.560]  Creating the propagandists to then people the big tech are just racing for the finish line
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.920]  But I think at an instinctive and also historical level and a gut level
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.760]  It's going to boomerang around and backfire on them in a big way
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:34.920]  And I think Trump going after the money to really the incubation center of the censorship and the tyranny the universities
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.360]  Is is a giant opening salvo. What do you have to say about that? And what's the word in dc jack?
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.600]  I completely agree on that and this is something in dc where it really caught them by surprise
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:53.960]  They didn't see Trump moving on this front and that's been something that the president has always been very careful to do
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.280]  And always been very smart to do is that he doesn't
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.880]  Approach these systems and he doesn't approach these
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.360]  These issues the way they assume he will so he doesn't attack things directly
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.840]  Right people don't realize and as you've said they don't realize that the universities are a pathway
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.920]  To silicon valley because so much of silicon valley is in bed with these universities
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:18.520]  They don't realize that what he's doing is essentially it's like it's like when you're when you're up against the enemy force
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.280]  And you're attacking their supply chains
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.680]  He's going into the back end figuring out how they work figuring out where their weak spots are
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:31.160]  And then using that against them instead of attacking them directly on the front. Sure. It's like blowing up nazi tank factories
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.920]  But instead he's going to go in and say the brainwashing stops you're going to quit it
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.240]  Or i'm going to take your money and again just like the cia, which is the same thing as google
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.200]  Uh recruits out of the universities. That's what they're doing and they use it as an incubation center to teach them
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.960]  There's no free speech to teach them to censor then they take them out of that cloistered
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.520]  Group and put them in a command position as a censor as a surveyor
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:58.440]  Uh, it's it's really outrageous. They've built their own private intelligence agencies with sjw's within big tech
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:06.040]  Yeah, we're actually seeing a lot of this um in in terms of what they're doing is they use they call them off-site
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.480]  Um contractors third-party contractors
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:16.600]  Uh jack dorsi referred to them as off-site laboratories, which I thought was actually interesting and it was something that he mentioned
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.280]  Uh on a podcast recently he talked about off-site laboratories the specific phrase they used
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:28.120]  Um that that are being used to monitor this content. So because so much of this is done outside of house
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.360]  We don't have the same protection the same insight and it gives him plausible deniability
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:38.040]  And next up we know where a lot of it's being tested china where they can get away with it completely with dragonfly and more
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:45.080]  We'll talk about that with a china expert jack besobic and our final segment with him really appreciate him joining us again folks cloud tv

[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:03.880]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.880]  So
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.800]  So susan was in ski
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:34.280]  The head of youtube was on with cara swisher at the lesbians in tech event in san francisco
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.560]  and
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.280]  Swisher said my adopted 13 year old son
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.800]  You know likes been superior
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.560]  And I want him banned in the youtube lady says yeah, I want to ban him too
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:54.200]  They go, yeah, we banned alex jones. Why can't you ban him? She says I told you to ban him and you did
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.680]  So they're out of the open. I didn't violate their terms. I didn't beat up a kid on a video
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:04.040]  They just made that up and there's this arrogance of these people and now they're working with china
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.080]  youtube's parent company
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.400]  That they're lying to congress about it
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.560]  And now general dumpford has come out the joint chiefs of staff chairman
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.160]  I said they're really concerned because they won't even work with the pentagon
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:24.840]  And I've learned what's happening at google in places their employees will even rebel against the owners and the managers and then she would ever they want and
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.040]  It's literally this rogue out of control group
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.080]  It's one thing if they don't want to work at the pentagon when they were set up by the pentagon
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:32.360]  Set up by darpa
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.240]  But it's a whole other thing when they then run to china who holds the world record in tyranny jack besobic
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.000]  I know you got a lot of inside baseball on this and lived in china and but enable intelligence
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:46.520]  What what's coming out of this? What's your take and what needs to be done because it's like an outrageous crime
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.840]  Like google moving to china and helping impress their people helping build systems to censor us here
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.640]  It's so big. It's almost like too evil to fail
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.280]  Because something I mean something should have already been done jack
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.240]  alex what
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.760]  To take this to a higher level and to get at what I think general dunford was talking about
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:10.760]  And also what we're looking at a macro level and I appreciate that you do look at this in terms of a macro level
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160]  China has a 100 year outlook
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:21.000]  Look on their their program right now. They're pushing forward towards 2049 2049 is going to be the 100 years of their
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.520]  Since they founded the communists
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.960]  Republic people's republic of china and so for them
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.600]  It's they want to take
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:39.640]  All of the power the social political and economic and military power of the world and shift that balance of power
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:46.600]  To china because in their mind they're shifting it back to china because china at one point was the leader of all of asia
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.520]  And so for them to do that what they're actually doing is
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.360]  They're pushing forward and you can see this is in all the academic journals. Everybody. They're they're very old
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:01.880]  The chinese century are so-called elite hates america. They've wedded this and the pentagon needs to know
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.840]  It's their job a to stop this b. It's congress's job
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:09.080]  They they disrespect america. They've used our open society against us
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.720]  And and and so if our government doesn't stop this they're aiding and abetting it in my view
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.720]  But you're absolutely right jack. Please continue
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:21.160]  Yes, so the you're you're looking at it in terms of the investors you're looking at in terms of social media
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.680]  Hollywood you can already see is completely bought out by china
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.560]  It's it's basically run by china at this point half of california is run by china at this point
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.320]  and so for
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:38.360]  For the chinese they view it as their insert their upsurge their upswing in the world in terms of geopolitics
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.360]  And it's also seen that way
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.960]  In by the elites and by the investor class and by the ruling class
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.160]  So they want to be in bed with china because they know that
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:50.520]  They have decided essentially that china is going to be the future
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.520]  They've decided that china is the market to be in and for various reasons
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.120]  They they basically see america as in downfall america is in decline
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:04.200]  barack obama used to say this publicly that that america is in decline and you hear this around dc all the time that
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.880]  america's decline
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.640]  Just needs a soft landing america just needs to be you know a failed experiment
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.240]  And we can go back to where the things used to be before 1776
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:22.680]  This is the type of discussion that people used to make before trump came around before our freedom fighters like yourself
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:29.320]  Like one american news and others came around they thought that america was going to fall and that china was going to be the next future
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.000]  Well, unfortunately, even though america is having its resurgence
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.200]  The capital the money markets everything else is still moving in terms of china
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.120]  Still pushing in terms of china being that winner because even though
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.120]  Trump is doing so much and we're doing so much to fight what's happening
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:49.400]  They still have that hundred year outlook that has not changed
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.920]  I've never heard a better breakdown of this and the cfr all of them
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:59.240]  Set up china gave them all our industry propped them up because our corrupt elites wanted to work with an authoritarian system
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.240]  Unencumbered by our republic by our courts by our rules
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.360]  And so that's why they've made the deal because the globalists are authoritarian
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.560]  And they believe china is the model that leverage out everybody else
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.920]  But if we stop them in the middle of the process, they're very very weak
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.760]  You've lived over there. You know that they're teetering because of their oppression of their people of the corrupt party system
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.640]  So the elite over here are trying to export
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.080]  The chinese social score here as fast as possible and kind of line up with china
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.840]  Before we take the country back and take europe back
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.640]  And and defeat them
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.640]  So i want to ask you how do we accelerate that? How do we make sure that happens?
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:46.280]  And how do they ever put the genie back in the bottle now that america understands that this double cross happened because they fought so hard to suppress this
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.480]  Understand it but once this understanding is there and now it's front and center. Isn't it really game over?
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:26:00.680]  One of the biggest things that president trump has done that actually affects this in terms of the macro level is actually his tariff scheme
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:06.840]  His tariff agenda by putting tariffs on those companies and on their supply chains
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.640]  That they had already set up look these companies go global because they're looking for cheaper markets
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.840]  They're looking for cheap labor. They're looking for lax environmental standards
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.040]  They're looking for being able to get the biggest bang for their buck and they don't care who gets exploited by it
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.360]  That's what goes on throughout throughout
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.080]  Asia and specifically china because they have this massive labor pool of of people that in some cases
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:33.160]  It's it's little more than slavery or a endangered servitude in terms of what they receive
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.680]  And so that's where our you know, that's where all of the tech is being made
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.120]  And so with trump putting tariffs on that with trump putting tariffs on those supply chains
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:50.040]  He's directly impacting the bottom line their bottom line and by directly impacting their bottom line in every step along the process
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.160]  He's not it's you know, you hear this this like
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:27:00.280]  Ridiculous argument that it's a tax on consumers that it's a tax. No, it's changing the supply lines
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:05.560]  China has an unfair trade advantage set up deliberately to transfer our infrastructure
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:11.320]  Which is a national security issue over there and trump understands that my issue is it's a one-way street with china
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.640]  They're giving companies zero tax if they move there. It's beyond a clear and present danger
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.520]  And until that regime has changed we need to stop thinking about our own elites taking it over
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.480]  It's never going to happen. We have to cut them off bring them
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.440]  You know to heal and then try to bring in a
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.040]  Unauthoritarian system there or we can't merge with something that's as bad as Hitler or worse in my view
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.840]  And I don't think dumpford talking to google is enough. This is outrageous espionage
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:40.920]  Outrageous criminal activity. They've all lied to congress and I'm not an authoritarian

[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.680]  I've been watching things that are unwatchable and I don't like it
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.360]  But we're going to do something about it. See we like to act as opposed to just watching and saying oh isn't that a shame
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:37.240]  We don't say that we don't say that

[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:14.920]  You're going to change them to waging war on corruption

[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.880]  And here's jeff landry the attorney general
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:29.320]  of louisiana with the big state attack that's about to pop up i'm told in over 30 states
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:35.720]  We're going to be filing suit and taking action in the next month. So people get the tech censorship with the chai comms
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.960]  Is the literal takeover of this country?
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.640]  And now suddenly everything you heard on the show a couple years ago is coming out of the joint chief's staff's mouth
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:45.960]  It's coming out of the president's mouth
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.480]  because
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.000]  We're here covering what's really going on
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.280]  But we make it safe for everybody else to come out and say it later
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.040]  We hit the bar bar drill salinity joins us for the next 45 minutes or so
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:02.600]  I'm going to go to my good friend here in a moment, but first since I mentioned jeff landry. Here is the attorney general making the announcement
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:09.080]  We've seen what what makes america great is the fact that no one is bigger than the people, right?
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:17.400]  No one is truly bigger than the government, which of course is a government of the people and when corporations
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:23.000]  historically in this country in our free market economy have
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.400]  Have a mass monopolistic power and the power to basically control the economy
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.360]  Then the people are stood up and said, you know what enough is enough something must be done
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.200]  and look there's been a lot of positive that has come out of
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.040]  You know of of of government taking action in this type of matter
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.800]  So what type of action is on the table?
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.760]  Well, I think that all action is on top of the table in in a couple of weeks in fact
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.760]  Um, I think it's uh next week on the 25th
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:03.560]  There is a round table being conducted by attorney generals in front of the fdc to discuss this to discuss
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:11.720]  You know the harm that it's placing on consumers whether or not it's gonna it would lead to antitrust action against the companies
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:19.960]  Uh, or whether or not we should be looking more carefully on any mergers or consolidations or buyouts by these tech companies
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.680]  It's on ladies and gentlemen
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.960]  People are waking up all over the world doesn't mean it's fun for those of us that have to spare
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:45.880]  Gerald Salente has been on Oprah Winfrey's been on every show out there best selling offer since the 80s
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.800]  He was trending higher than I was just a few years ago on google
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.880]  But they just censored and shadow banned him didn't matter. He just keeps beavering away
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:57.480]  And that's what we do
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.720]  Because when you're censored and you're blocked, that's the mark of your accuracy
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.120]  We're gonna talk to Gerald Salente at trendsresearch.com. She's still on twitter
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.920]  I had to Gerald Salente
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.040]  We're going to moment. Please don't forget. We're listed supported and I try to make it easy
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:18.440]  I go out and say what's the highest rated air filter that's at the lowest price and I get it
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:21.560]  And I'm kind of the biggest seller of it. So I get even bigger discounts
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.200]  And pass that on to you
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.280]  We go out and find out what's the best fish oil from the top maker that's certified organic
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.440]  Been tested because I know they're gonna test it. I wanted to work good for you
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.640]  But I know where we're gonna be a target
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.480]  So I go out and get whatever's the cleanest and best already because I know I'm a target anyways
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.480]  Plus I want you to love the product
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:45.640]  Uh, and it's the same for our turmeric our bodies or our our our happy formula the natural herbs to help calm and give focus
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.520]  More survival shield x2 that I thought we couldn't get more of the pure iodine the good halogen the x2 it's back and stop
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.600]  Knock out the great sleep aid, you know, I talked to some of the developers about five years ago
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.200]  And I said, you know, it's 1995 for a bottle of melatonin
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.160]  How much melatonin does it actually cost in that bottle? They said probably a dollar
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.720]  And they sell it for 9.95. I said, well, will it go good with
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:15.800]  All these other things like eltrip to fan and valerian root and chamomile and lemon balm and and they go
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.400]  Oh, yeah, that all works synergistically together. Well, I'll just put all that in there
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440]  And then I'll sell it for 9.95
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.560]  And sure it'll cost me five six times more, but that's still like six dollars or something and we sell it for 20
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.040]  60% off right now. So it's even lower than that. It's 1198
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.760]  so
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.880]  That's my philosophy and it works really really good. It's organic
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:44.280]  Sometimes the batches are so strong one pill will knock you out. Sometimes it takes two. This is organic. This is not a drug
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.360]  It's not a chemical. It's for mother nature

[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.320]  Gerald, you know, I could always ask a bunch of questions of you, but you've always got a lot on your radar screen
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.360]  Uh, but I do want to get to your report card on trump, which I think went up a notch with him going after
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.840]  these anti-free speech
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:19.240]  Bastions that are called universities now the supposed place of free speech has become the inverse
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.120]  And also trump trying to pull out of these wars and put the government deep state trying to block him
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440]  Mueller's report about to come out
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.680]  Uh, the the trump going after the federal reserve pointing out they're the ones trying to stagnate the economy
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.440]  There's so many things to get to here the culture clash even bloomberg michael bloomberg said
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.360]  What's all this thing that white men are inherently evil the democrats have gone crazy?
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.840]  I mean this is getting when bloomberg saying that's insane
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.320]  We'll probably see the southern property law center call him a nazi next. It's just a crazy world
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.320]  What would you as a historian
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.480]  Call this period we're in right now. Joe salenta
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:57.560]  Well, when I was a kid they used to have a thing called the ringling brothers and bottom and Bailey circus
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.120]  It was the greatest show on earth
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.840]  Now the ringling brothers and bottom and Bailey
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:09.080]  Circus is out of business because it's been taken over by the greatest freak show on earth
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.520]  Name the country look what's going on around it. I've never seen anything like it
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:22.520]  And you know the big issue one of the very big issues and and trump what I was just listening to is on censorship
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.520]  I mean, this is supposed to be the country of freedom of speech
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.480]  one of our top trends alex
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  the 2019
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.600]  It's right here in your trends journal
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.960]  censorship
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.960]  2019
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.600]  Freedom of speech freedom of expression
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:46.600]  Forget about it from the united states to china
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.480]  from new zealand
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.480]  to napal
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.800]  Censorship is a mega trend
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.480]  Now remember we wrote this in december
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.360]  What did they just do now?
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.600]  In new zealand
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.520]  You're not allowed to put up anything the government doesn't want you to put up
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.320]  And in one day zam boom
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:15.080]  Bring in all your arms that we don't want you to have and now they're banning jordan peterson books
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:24.440]  That's what i'm saying. It's getting worse everywhere and in the united states. Oh, you know, I mean here
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.720]  Facebook curbs anti vaccine posts. Oh, I wanted to go there. Oh stay there. We can write back and have the floor
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:36.200]  If you even try to show an insert to a vaccine saying it can kill you because the insert says it
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.360]  They will take down videos of inserts
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:44.760]  They're incredible talk about that with gerald salente the medical tyranny think of all the stuff medical stuff's done in drug companies
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.960]  Now they're saying you don't criticize them or you're shut down. Wow

[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.920]  Warning though, it's very very strong. It lasts 10 hours
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:53.560]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive

[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:20.680]  But I thought add the other two types of iodine the scientists that do that
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.160]  It sold a lot that people want original x2
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.800]  Like I was resigned the fact we didn't have x2, but it came through about a month ago

[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:40.680]  So Gerald Salente friends forecaster best-selling author
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:47.480]  Predicted last year it's only gonna get worse this year on a global scale and it has
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.440]  And then every time a precedent set
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.360]  YouTube does some strikes takes some of my videos down for false reason that then becomes
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:48:00.440]  Jones is banned from the internet and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and thousands of publications then ask other
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.080]  Platforms well, why is he on he's banned
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.600]  And so now the head of youtube said
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.760]  Oh, I I agree. We took alex jones down. We'd like to take down
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:16.280]  In Shapiro i'm gonna play that clip in a few minutes. Gerald Salente's won 15 minutes with us in the next hour
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.600]  And i've gotten so punch-drunk to all this
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.120]  I saw this article
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:24.120]  Last night
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.920]  And I never even remembered it this morning
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:31.880]  righty on Mike Adams runs that
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.200]  carries our show
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.640]  They were threatened with criminal action by the Australian government if they didn't take everything down not that we're gonna block your
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:44.920]  Web address like they've done to zero hedge and others in New Zealand just we're gonna come after you quote at gunpoint
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.400]  With with international force
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:53.960]  Now remember they said they took some of our fan channels down because we showed the video we did to show the video
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:56.760]  of them in the building we showed
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:00.920]  Him walking around with a gun and what it said on it and him in his car, which the other media did
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.880]  So as Gerald said we just suddenly have gone to the point now. You can see there's a brooder film
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:11.080]  You can see nazi's killing jews who wants to but you know, it's historical. It's on pbs to now. You can't see this
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.520]  and
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520]  Susan
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.280]  What jinsky today's their name everybody else is like yeah, we're gonna do it
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.600]  So Gerald it's like the floor fell out get into this and where you think this is going
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.480]  Well, you know go back
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.760]  that all
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.160]  Those of us who are old enough to remember
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:37.560]  And when the internet really became the internet, this was going to be the place for free speech
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.280]  Everybody was applauding it
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:46.680]  And now of course they're closing it down and we were just talking about how you can't run facebook
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.960]  curbs anti vaccine posts
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.880]  Pinterest is blocking search results about vaccines
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:06.040]  To protest users from misinformation. So they're deciding it. But how about this story? Alex just came out yesterday
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:09.480]  Medical news today reports
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:17.800]  That in 2011 doctors wrote 402 million prescriptions for drugs in america
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:22.680]  In the u.s. There are 36 million serious
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.560]  Adverse reactions to medical drugs per year
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.960]  Over two million serious side effects
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:40.200]  On and on and on and on but you're not allowed to say any of this talk about being banned
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.600]  When we put up our trends in the news videos or our
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:51.800]  Transvision 2020 podcasts they get flagged by google because i called beto
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:56.120]  Oroch the white obama can't say that
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.760]  I can't say economic
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.600]  9 11
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.600]  Can't say that
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.840]  Everything is being censored
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:11.160]  This is it's a fascism has taken over and by the way, you're right. Beto Oroch is literally
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:13.640]  Comes from nowhere
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:20.920]  Synthetic talks in a fake voice powered by the same people, but you mentioned it for the break the vaccines the inserts of every vaccine
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.280]  No matter what it is says can kill you can give you cancer can cause neurological disorders can cause seizures
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:30.360]  And what do they ban they go? Oh, you're giving out fake medical stuff
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:36.440]  Meanwhile, as you said the oxy cotton company said we're going to addict everybody and then have a bunch of slaves
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:41.160]  We control and then you've got all these other bear knowingly putting hiv in the factor rate
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:45.800]  All the nightmares of all these companies and all the recalls and they're telling consumers
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:50.280]  People who've had their kids die. You can't go on facebook and say your kid died
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:53.080]  You can't go on facebook and say you had a bad reaction
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:59.640]  And your daughter got paralyzed from Gardasil or showing local news article for the doctors admitted. No, we call that fake news
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.720]  This is crazy
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:08.520]  Again, it's to take over what was supposed to be the free internet by the monopolies as that louisiana the
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:13.560]  Louisiana was saying and by the way, I just want to say that in these times
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:18.600]  Where people are being censored like this do what you can to support info wars
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:23.480]  Because everyone listening out there because if you don't or you're going to be
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.360]  Getting is propaganda
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:30.680]  Because that's all they're feeding us. Let's expand on that. You never you never put my money
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:34.840]  You never put yourself where my mouth is because I love
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:38.360]  uh, the products that info wars and
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:42.520]  Has and whether it's the the filters for water
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.560]  My one of my favorites, of course is supermail vitality keeps me going
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.560]  But people have to support
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:56.840]  Those of us that are putting the truth out there that we can't be bought out and sold out
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:01.560]  It's only going to get worse. It's happening around the world again
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:08.280]  We didn't put it up as one of our top trends the 2019 by mistake and it's not only the right
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.560]  You look what happened during the midterm elections
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:14.280]  It's not this is a conspiracy theory
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:22.280]  Google took down a facebook took down over 800 sites and you know what they were things about police brutality
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:29.560]  Things about government that they didn't like they didn't want to hear you mentioned what's going on in australia with zero heads and others
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.560]  It's one after another
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:40.600]  And then you look at google they were behind hillary clinton's campaign. I'm not making that up. I'm not that's not a conspiracy theory
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:48.200]  They were doing the algorithms for her. They were feeding of the information that guy. Who was the ceo that left?
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.560]  Well, he didn't really he heads up alphabet
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.040]  Uh, and that of course is eric schmidt
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:55.800]  schmidt
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:00.760]  Of course out of his mouth and and meeting with the with the clinton people when they were in brookland
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:06.280]  Well, he said we will deliver the election to the one who deserves it and who has the superior leadership
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:12.520]  President clinton he called her president clinton and then they looked bad when they're cheating and their meddling didn't work
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:16.520]  So they had to call an american grassroots movement russian, which is asinine
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.920]  Yeah, and and i think you're spelled schmidt wrong
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:28.600]  When you said it wrong because this has an s h and you can get rid of some of those other letters in the middle
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.000]  Because that's all they are
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:37.080]  You know what google did to me you remember when i had to take them to the new york the federal district court in new york
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.680]  It became a federal case because there were fake gerald selenti
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:47.240]  Websites out there that they wouldn't take down cost me over a hundred almost 150 thousand dollars
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:49.240]  Guess what?
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:53.880]  There are new fake gerald selenti websites out there. I won the case
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.320]  It was a federal district court case. It's there for everybody to look at
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.480]  They refuse to take the new fake sites down
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.600]  They won't take them down
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:10.120]  It's because of the same reason that they do to you
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:16.360]  They censor me they put fake selenti information up there so people could attack me
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:21.960]  And after taking them to court winning it they refuse to take it down
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.640]  Gerald looking at all the trends
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:31.560]  What do you expect to happen now because the so-called left worldwide is quarterbacking all this authoritarianism
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.720]  Populist and nationalist are trying to resist it trump's starting to do something but
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:41.880]  It's just they're so arrogant. They're so entitled. I want to come back. I'm gonna play this clip of
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.280]  the ceo of
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:50.120]  YouTube admitting that she wants to ban basically even mainline conservatives. I mean this is just open authoritarianism
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:56.680]  It is and again, you know, it's been coming along. We've been seeing it and talking about it
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:01.320]  And and you look again, that's why I'm saying to people do what you can

[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:20.040]  I've been on Alex a long time. I say what I want to say. I agree with a lot of what he says
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.240]  We don't have to do agree on everything. We doesn't have to agree with me
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:25.560]  It's freedom of speech
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:31.240]  We're not the cult and I love how everybody tries to police everybody and tell them who to talk to and what to do
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:36.760]  Exactly. These are busy bodies. They're sick. They're they're out of control. By the way, you never plug yourself
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:42.440]  The power of people physically getting your magazine and after they read it leaving at the dental office or at the library

[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:03.720]  That's what the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down. I didn't invent all this
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:10.040]  I went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.480]  And lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:20.440]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night

[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:16.200]  I'm a friend of thunder friend. Is it any wonder a lightning strikes me?
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  I fought with the devil
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:24.520]  I fought with the devil. I got down on his level
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:28.280]  But I never gave in so he gave up on me
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:34.040]  Yeah, I'm no stranger to the rain. I'm no stranger to the rain
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:36.040]  I
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:38.600]  Can spot man with
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:41.080]  jones lives are guys with two more segments
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:48.440]  I've got some other news after he leaves us or maybe do it while he's with us that is just so insane and we knew it was coming
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.280]  But but it's here
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:51.720]  foreign governments
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:53.000]  ordering
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.760]  Content taken down here and saying we're working with your government to shut you down if you don't
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:00.680]  And then meanwhile they can show it on mainstream news, but you can't
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:05.240]  It's the total death of any due process anything. Here is susan
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:08.840]  Vojcicki if i'm pronouncing that right the ceo of youtube
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.640]  with cara swisher at the
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:15.000]  lesbians in tech conferences in francisco
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:18.680]  And here she is and they're talking about hey my son's looking at this video
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:24.120]  I don't like him being able to see these people. We took alex jones off take em off. She's like well. I'd really like to
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.760]  So they're admitting if they did that they disagree with our politics. It's not about whatever
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:34.600]  The reason they make up like that. I beat up a kid and then it's not even true. That's how youtube took me down
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:40.040]  It's just the arrogance that they just it's like royalty up in the cloud city. Here it is
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:47.480]  My son who's uh 13 years old. Um started watching ben Shapiro videos and he's like the gateway drug
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:52.360]  To the next group and then it goes right to jordan peterson then it goes down and in three clicks
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:53.880]  He was at neo nazi stuff
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.600]  It was like astonishing and then I had to listen to it at dinner
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:59.640]  And I was sort of like I'm gonna kill susan majesty first
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:01.640]  Okay, well
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:05.400]  But it was sort of like I was sort of like is there anything like
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.160]  It feels like as I said, I think you've heard me say this it feels like
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.640]  All u-tech companies have built cities these beautiful cities
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.000]  But you decided not to initially put in police fire
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.720]  Garbage streets
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:27.720]  Um and stuff like that and and her brain damage behind the nazi stuff are probably clips of tucker carlson or pewdie pie
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:31.720]  And then I've got like this kid who's like well ben Shapiro is sort of smart. I'm like no, he's not
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:37.880]  He's clever, but he's an idiot and anyway, he just like it's exhausting
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:40.040]  But it has like a huge effect on them
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:45.720]  Do you feel like the people that on a bigger thing and it's not your total responsibility susan
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:51.080]  But it's do you feel like the people is looking on they have a sense of this of the impact they have
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:53.320]  So getting getting to your son
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:57.480]  I'm lost. Um, no we can we can we can work on your son here
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:01.400]  I have a son too and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:08.040]  I mean so she just said that her 13 year old son was lost because he's not a social justice warrior
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:16.760]  And he's looking up conservative videos on youtube and maybe looking at jordan peterson as a father figure because he's being raised by two lesbians
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:20.200]  And again, they go on to say that's not the exact clip
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:23.320]  I wanted to play but you know, they say we got alex jones off
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:28.120]  Why can't we get him off and she says well, I'd like to well we got part of that in there
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.520]  These are just outrageous statements jerald
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.040]  They are in the arrogance. Oh you built the cities
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:42.520]  You know, san francisco wasn't there before tech came there. No, I they just found it. They just built it
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:48.280]  You know what the arrogance of these people are that they accept the lies and bs
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.840]  From the political whores
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:57.960]  That they believe in and I bring that into men and women to make it really clear
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.520]  Hey, you know, I'm gonna tell you something alex
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:02.120]  that
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:06.520]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and he has to go
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:10.680]  I got to tell you something alex. I'm barack bs
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:15.880]  Nobel piece of crap prize winner that Assad has to go
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:20.600]  We're gonna destroy the richest country in africa. We're gonna
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.840]  Kill and give the weaponry to the shii
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.440]  Isis that are destroying so much
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:33.400]  But obama says it it's cool with these hypocrites
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:38.760]  But when you come out against it, you're a conspiracy theorist
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.800]  They gobble up conspiracy
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:46.120]  It's crazy stay there jerald salante back in 60 seconds
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:50.920]  We're gonna get into the hypocrisy straight ahead and then i'm gonna play the whole mark nice piece with with the whole thing
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:52.920]  In context, we're just gonna play the whole thing
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:05:00.040]  The globalist the eugenicists are always talking down to us
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:04.600]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.200]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:12.680]  So you can make your own decisions
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:15.320]  They want you to believe you're powerless
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:19.640]  But the truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:25.640]  And and what we say and what we do that changes the world. We are the power structure
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:30.280]  We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers and the globalists
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:34.040]  Understand that and they understand
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:38.920]  That they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:43.880]  Now to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:49.880]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of march
[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:55.400]  We're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50 off info store.com. Something everybody should take advantage of
[02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:06.120]  Waging war on corruption
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.440]  It's alex jones
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:14.280]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:20.440]  I want something to sink in out there
[02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:24.040]  Think about how corporate media always frames it
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:27.800]  If you question the chemical attacks
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:30.040]  in syria
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:32.200]  Where even the un and our own government admits
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  three of the four attacks were staged
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  By isis to try to bring the u.s. Into the war to overturn Assad funny. They had the motive. They had the chemicals and they're so lazy
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.480]  Not even lazy they shot videos of themselves
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:53.080]  Launching the attack screaming a la akbar because that makes some rock stars in the middle east in the islamic world
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:56.840]  And then when ron paul
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:01.560]  Came out against it a few years ago and said it was fake and mentioned the un report in our own report
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:05.640]  They called him a russian agent in a congressional report along with me
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:08.280]  They said well russian
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:10.280]  operatives like
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:13.240]  Ron paul and alex jones they get their marching orders from the krim one
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:17.160]  I had jack besovak who's not just your average intelligence guy
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:22.520]  He's been deep in china deep in all over the place heavily hooked up with the white house did a great analysis of this
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:24.840]  last hour
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:28.760]  And he said china has a thousand times the infiltration russia does
[02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:34.760]  Russia is the biggest country in the world. They don't have electricity in many areas. They don't have
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:37.720]  It's not that they're bad people. It's that it's so big
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:43.080]  It's so gigantic imagine if the u.s. Was three times the size it was
[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:46.360]  There's most areas of the west we haven't developed yet
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:50.920]  Russia's almost what is it almost four times bigger
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:55.240]  They think they're trying to
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:59.000]  They're super rich with their resources and everything but they are not expansionist
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:04.280]  When the american globalists left took over russia they used it as an expansionist system
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:07.960]  It's not under that i'm not defending russia the point is is that
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:11.960]  Are a leader ally with china they're censoring the hell out of us
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.000]  And then
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  It's consumers rights
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:21.480]  To say i took a vaccine and it hurt me or my kid took it and got sick they have a vaccine damage fund
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:27.400]  They admitted it's on the inserts or you have a right to say i had a bad interaction, but if you go complain on facebook or twitter
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:31.480]  You say hey look out my 18 month old son got his third round of shots
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:34.840]  He quit talking and now sits in the corner crapping all over himself
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:41.480]  You talk about autism one from one in 35 000 to one in 58 in the last 30 years. They shut your ass down
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:48.760]  Because we're reaching a critical mass. They're saying you don't have a right to have consumer reports. You don't have a right to comment
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:52.680]  You don't have a right to say what you think whether you're right or wrong
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:56.600]  Then they misconstrued who you are and what you're saying
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:02.280]  Their latest thing is they have troll bots go and harass moms whose kids have gotten sick from vaccines and then say that
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:07.400]  Anti-vaxxers are saying it i'm not anti science except these companies have liability protection
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:11.160]  They're talking about giving it to all the drug companies now
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:16.600]  And that's something trump's doing that's good. Gerald you tried to get into this earlier and you mentioned it
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:19.320]  We kind of got out of it, but all over the news here
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:26.520]  They're just banning criticizing vaccines period like you said if people thought the censorship was bad. We went off some cliff
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:29.240]  So i want you to get into that and give us your expert view
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:35.800]  Where use the the possible futures and what what we should do to counter it because I mean it's going so headlong so fast
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:41.080]  Is this ahead of some new war or some big event or trump's assassination because you're as you said
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:46.040]  There is no bottom now the censorship. It's just it's it's now gone to light speed
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:51.000]  You know they call the people uh socialists
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:57.000]  And the democratic party that are all in favor of more of this and have made it happen
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.080]  How about calling them fascists because that's what this is
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:03.800]  This is fascism that's taking over
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:09.720]  You know when you think of the word politically correct, I tell people to look up the definition of a politician
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:12.600]  Someone that's manipulative and devious
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:15.960]  Typically to gain advancement within an organization
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:21.560]  You mentioned about what was going on in syria with the phony chemical attacks
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:26.920]  There was a reporter. I believe it was either the bbc or the the guardian
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:29.880]  That has proof it was bow that it was
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.640]  The white helmets that pull that stunt off
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:40.040]  Get not in the news that arrogant woman that you played that clip from before
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:47.080]  Telling you know that that what great people the geeks are and all that the geeks have given us
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:54.440]  These passionate little people the suckerbergs, you know from suckerberg to the jobs
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:59.080]  You look at these guys not an ounce of boogie not a drop of jive
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:04.280]  The only thing that changed is the color of their t-shirts from black to blue
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:11.960]  And you can't say anything about them. The geeks are going to tell you what to think. So let's go back
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:15.720]  Let's go back to what you said
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:18.840]  We have to believe a lemon
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:23.480]  We have to believe a little andison cooper
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.640]  a nobody
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:28.920]  If his mama wasn't gloria vanderbilt
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:31.240]  Hey, how about
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:33.240]  arrogant little quomo
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:37.560]  Another guy like his brother over there andy
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:43.240]  That thought they hit a home run because they were born on third base
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:48.680]  Guys that would be nowhere. We got to listen to them
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:54.680]  Yeah, you got to listen to the sellouts the suck ups and the
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:12:02.840]  Prestitudes the people that get paid to put out by their corporate johns and their washington
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:05.400]  Whore masters. Oh, by the way
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:10.360]  I'm sorry for raising my voice and feeling my passion
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:16.840]  But I also have to blame you alex jones and info wars because I took a shot of male
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:22.440]  Like a super male vitality. It got me. Oh, you're nice to say that because you you you were a lobbyist
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:28.600]  You were best-selling author. You had a long career and you're also an expert in marshal arts. Why don't you
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:31.240]  Aren't you also an expert in herbs or something?
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:36.920]  Is me and ronald reagan over here. I'm 30 years old. I was living for an hour and a half
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:41.960]  I picked them up at the hilton hotel when I used to work for the chemical industry
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:47.160]  There's a speaker at the chicago hilton. I picked them up. We're going to know you've been around the block
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:50.520]  But don't you also have a degree or something? You're like an you're like an herb expert, right?
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:57.960]  Well, well, I have a uh honorary master honorary doctoral law from the national university health sciences
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:02.680]  So the work I've done in complimentary and integrated means a lot to me that you like our supplements
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.840]  But but that's what we go. Yeah
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:10.280]  Alex the first book I worked on was a big water book natural healing
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:16.520]  So I know about this stuff. You know, I'm 72 years old. I stay in shade. You don't look like you're 70
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.280]  I need to do what you're doing
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:23.800]  But again, so I that's why I support your products because of what they do and how they help me
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:28.280]  Yeah, I wouldn't say this if I didn't know I totally understand and we really appreciate that
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:31.720]  Uh, Gerald, I want to play this clips that you mentioned we played a different part earlier
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:37.000]  But here's the clips where she specifically saying I called for Alex Jones to be banned and you did now ban
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.360]  Ben Shapiro and again, Ben has his own problems. He could be a good guy or bad guy
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:44.520]  He is mainline. So they just want everybody they don't like off the air
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:47.560]  Here's the ceo of youtube
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:53.320]  To look there's a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines Ben Shapiro is going to meet the community guidelines
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:58.440]  So I don't think you're suggesting that we remove him from the platform. Are you I would but I can't no
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:03.320]  Okay, you know, I but no, you know, like last time I saw you I was like get Alex Jones off that platform
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:08.280]  And you're like, well the community guidelines and then you got him now. He's on the platform. I know so I was right
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.360]  But that's that's
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.760]  So she's on a stage in front of a bunch of women
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:16.360]  Laughing and giggling about taking me off the air Gerald
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:23.480]  I mean if they don't like it, I'll listen to you. This is supposed to be the internet. This was supposed to be free
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:25.560]  I'm telling you the people that are our
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:31.240]  People that remember that were old enough when the whole internet revolution began
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:39.160]  The purpose of it was that you could see and hear what you wanted to and no one would censor you and now
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:41.240]  It's total censorship
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:44.440]  The fascist own it the monopolies
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:49.000]  Googles the facebook's the twitter's
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:57.800]  All of them we are controlled by fascist monopolies that are telling us how to live what to do and to obey
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:14:58.760]  audience
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:02.680]  What would you say in closing? Is it the internet's not just been neutered?
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:05.080]  It's being butchered and dismembered and harvested
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:10.520]  And it's turning into a glorified netflix in front of our own eyeballs. I mean, what would you call this the death?
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.920]  Not just a free speech, but of the real internet
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:16.680]  Oh, it is it's it's all i'm telling you what's happening to me
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:24.360]  I can't say anything bad. I again, I call I call the white obama white obama and i'm not allowed to say that
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:28.920]  What do I got some little clown telling me what I can say and what I can't?
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:33.720]  That they're deciding for me how I should have freedom of this of speech
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.760]  And that's the big issue. A lot of people when you lose when you lose freedom of speech
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:41.160]  You lose your right to be an american
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:44.760]  No, you're right. I mean there's just a lot of people fought and died for these rights
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:50.280]  They're just being pissed away. Gerald. I salute you god bless. You're amazing at general salente on twitter. We'll talk to you

[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:03.800]  So
[02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:23.640]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:26.280]  It's alex jones
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:33.320]  Life from austin texas broadcasting worldwide from the info wars.com studios
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:41.720]  I was going about 180 miles an hour listening to this song by myself
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.520]  I'm a very lonely stretchy highway
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:47.880]  I drove the whole song about 180 crank it up
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:51.480]  And I never used to see the kids with their eyes
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:53.800]  The figures from memory
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:56.920]  I'm just trying to act cool. I didn't really do that. I don't do anything extreme
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:03.480]  I'm stuffed though in those telephone poles or one
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:09.480]  Crank it up
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:11.480]  Condemned the hell
[02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:13.480]  Oh
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:18.760]  I'm gonna serious get back to the broadcast
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:25.880]  I'm gonna say this right now to not brag about the show but to quantify something so that people really get this and I know you get it
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:33.240]  But we went to number one in news and we're gonna go total number number one in a few months of all apple apps
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:35.880]  And they just banned us
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:42.840]  And it's happened everywhere else this broadcast is not perfect. People are hungry for the truth though. It shows freedom is popular
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:45.160]  The show is just a gauge
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:52.120]  Because you're this show you're more this show than almost anything else out there. This is what you want. This is what you are
[02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:54.200]  I'm just like you
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:57.880]  And so they put us on cloud tv a few months ago
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:02.200]  It's been around for years for one of the bigger services. It's a good service. They correct me. They've got
[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:05.080]  hundreds of channels
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:07.080]  thousands of programs
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:09.320]  And we're number one
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.600]  Because you took acts because you're number one and it's the same thing over and over again
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:20.280]  So that's why we got trump elected. You got trump elected. We're having all these victories. They can't let us celebrate that
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:24.680]  That's why they got to make us the bad guys or the racist or all this crap
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.960]  Because the truth is we just want to live in peace
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:32.120]  Everybody loves red blooded americans. We've all got red blood no matter where we're from around the planet
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:34.120]  And the globalists are a joke
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:40.920]  They have to pay to put cnn on in the hotels and the bars. They have to pay to put it in the public schools
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:45.960]  It's a joke and they're all a bunch of rich billionaire kids who want to be somebody
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:48.520]  It's a joke
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:51.560]  Now I don't want to ever play a report twice in two days
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:54.040]  rarely
[02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:56.040]  but this mark dice piece is incredible because
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  this is the top silicon valley reporter
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.520]  Kara swisher with the ceo of youtube
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:08.440]  Admitting their censoring everybody because they don't like their views and then a lot of congress. This is bomb shell
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:10.760]  Let's play the report
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:17.320]  First they came for alex jones and a lot of people thought he's said some crazy things and he's kind of on the fringe
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:21.160]  They certainly won't censor any mainstream conservatives
[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:28.200]  Well, I've been trying to tell you that he was just the beginning youtube ceo susan majiski recently sat down for an interview with
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:33.160]  Kara swisher if you're not familiar with her name, I'm sure that you've seen some of her interviews
[02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:40.680]  She was the one who did that interview with mark zuckerberg when he was sweating profusely when she brought up some of the privacy concerns
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:47.640]  She also scored that historic interview with steve jobs and bill gates and has interviewed all of the big names in tech
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:52.200]  And at this year's lesbians who tech conference in san francisco
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:57.240]  Kara swisher pressured youtube ceo to ban bench apparel
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:03.000]  A conservative commentator perhaps best known for giving lectures on college campuses
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:08.520]  Kara swisher who as you may have guessed as a lesbian had served being at the lesbians who tech conference
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:18.040]  Adopted a poor child along with her wife who is now 13 years old and is watching bench apparel videos on youtube
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:22.040]  I'll get some recommendations. I have a personal beef with you about that. Okay
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.840]  I can't wait to hear
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:29.720]  My son who's uh 13 years old. Um started watching bench apparel videos
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:34.440]  And he's like the gateway drug to the next group and then it goes right to jordan peterson
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:37.240]  Then it goes down and in three clicks. He was at neo nazi stuff
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:40.280]  It was like astonishing and then I had to listen to it at dinner
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:43.240]  And I was sort of like i'm gonna kill susan majiski first
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:49.080]  But it was sort of like I was sort of like is there anything like
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:52.840]  It feels like as I said, I think you've heard me say this it feels like
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:25:00.760]  All u-tech companies have built cities these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police fire
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  garbage street signs
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:11.320]  And stuff like that and and her brain damage mind the nazi stuff are probably clips of tucker carlsson or pewdiepie
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:15.400]  And then I've got like this kid who's like well bench apparel is sort of smart. I'm like no, he's not
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:17.960]  not even slightly
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:20.200]  He's clever, but he's an idiot and anyway
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:23.640]  It's just like it's exhausting, but it has like a huge effect on them
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:29.320]  Do you feel like the the people like on a bigger thing and it's not your total responsibility susan
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:34.760]  But it's do you feel like the people's looking on they have a sense of this of the impact they have
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  So getting getting to your son
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.160]  Um, I'm lost. Um, no we can we can we can work on your son here
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:45.080]  I have a son too and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:51.720]  I mean so she just said that her 13 year old son was lost because he's not a social justice warrior
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:58.920]  And he's looking up conservative videos on youtube and maybe looking at jordan peterson as a father figure because he's being
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:04.600]  Raised by two lesbians. Maybe the poor kids should be put into a foster home consisting of a normal family
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.440]  You know a husband and a wife
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:08.520]  I think what you're describing is
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:13.240]  And the way we think about it too. Look, there's a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.320]  Ben Shapiro is going to meet the community guidelines
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:20.440]  So I don't think you're suggesting that we remove him from the platform. Are you I would but I can't no
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:25.400]  Okay, you know, but no, you know, like last time I saw you I was like get alex jones off that platform
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:31.080]  And you're like well the community guidelines and then you got now he's on the platform. I know so I was right but that's that's
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:34.840]  She literally said if it was up to her
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:39.560]  She would ban ben Shapiro for the same reasons that she wanted alex jones
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:43.240]  All right, the full report is at mark dice.com and info wars.com and
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:46.360]  This is what we're dealing with
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:52.760]  And remember youtube took me down. It's not about me. It's about you and what they think you're allowed to see
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:56.040]  Because despite the shadow ban
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:01.560]  We were getting on the main channel 10 million views a week
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:07.720]  Before they had a shadow ban, it was like, you know 100 million a week
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:15.320]  And then of course I go on Joe Rogan's podcast and it's the second largest he's ever done the third largest is the one before that
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:21.560]  And in a few weeks or so it'll be the biggest
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:25.960]  Because it's it's because the Elon Musk is the biggest it's about to overtake Elon Musk
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:29.640]  An interview from a year ago and I'm not bragging. I'm saying folks
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.080]  Common sense is popular
[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:38.440]  And these people are a bunch of cackling witches
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:45.160]  And it's not because she likes girls that I don't like her. It's because you don't like free speech in America. You damn witch
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:50.440]  You thin-skinned monster. You said on top the third biggest corporation in the world
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  pissing down on us
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.840]  And then you took me down saying I beat up a kid. There's no video with that you lying serpent
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:05.000]  I mean, it's always based on lies. It's who these people are
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.480]  It's like how far does it go with you people? You can't compete with us
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:12.200]  We don't want your crap

[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:25.000]  Trying to undermine the very free society in western culture that puts women on a pedestal and then you worship islam
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:33.560]  And crap all over your forefathers and some weird twisted man-hating crap when you do work for an evil man eric schmitt
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.560]  So whatever

[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:26.520]  Now you're sitting in the sun tonight
[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:31.160]  You better love me somewhere
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:35.480]  All right, I got a bunch of new breaking news I want to hit
[02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:41.560]  During this 50 hour broadcast and I appreciate you all tuning in and spreading the word
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:47.080]  But instead of me just giving commentary on all these clips. How about we just play some of these back-to-back because
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:56.120]  Whether it's the sun online reporter for the sun news or whether it's nbc or they all go. Oh, it's facebook. Oh or iPhones
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:34:03.000]  Oh is google listening to you and people then talk in front of their computer or their phone and then minutes later those ads pop up
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:09.000]  It's in the patents. They admit they're doing it when you first wrote about it in 2004
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:13.000]  It's in the terms of service now with smart TVs
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.200]  Which is all the TVs you can buy
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:20.520]  So that's why I mean, I know it sounds crazy
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:23.480]  That this is going on
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:26.200]  But it is so I'm not the crazy one for pointing it out
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:32.200]  I want to play that clip then tucker reacts to female deadlifting record the guy's obviously a dude
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:35.880]  Prime minister didn't y'all deeply grateful the us support
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:38.920]  And then trump visits a tank factory
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:43.320]  And there's a report I want to describe here, but he's a Jewish Australian
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:47.160]  Who wanted to be interviewed by this big international TV host?
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:50.200]  But they wanted to interview him
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:52.920]  and then
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:55.480]  He said okay, but I'm not gonna be on there with any neo-nazis
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:58.440]  Because you know what they were gonna try to do because the guy's anti-radical Islam
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:00.760]  He wanted to compare the two and say oh look jews are with nazis
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:04.520]  And the video has gone viral since it went up two days ago
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:08.360]  And he did what I wish I'd have done not sort of just audio
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:15.800]  He had video of the guy interviewing and say completely different things that edited his answers together to make it sound like he was saying all this horrible stuff
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:18.200]  I mean, you have to experience
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.640]  Mainstream media they're there to murder the truth
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:24.920]  So that video is up on info wars.com and full but we're gonna get to that
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.440]  And then there's gonna be the ongoing broadcast throughout the night. We'll be having a bunch of calls a bunch of other big guests
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:32.920]  Tommy Robinson's coming on Joe Rogan
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:37.560]  You got to love how planes only get delayed when it's for a live show
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:42.520]  But he'll be in later today. We're gonna tape something and I'm gonna air part of it tonight and then air the full interview
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:45.560]  Uh, we're gonna do a pretty good size interview
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:51.960]  Uh, uh on monday. Maybe I'll even air it sunday, but uh, I'll normally hype interviews up. It'll be pretty big interview
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:55.640]  How about some big subjects? Uh, so let's go ahead and just back to back
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:58.360]  You know what? Let's go to avi
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:00.440]  Yamini
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:02.440]  exposes jim jeffreys
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:05.240]  with hidden camera and again radio luster should go to info wars.com and see it but
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:11.000]  You'll hear the audio, but he just totally edits different conversations together to deceive. Here's that report
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:18.200]  So a few months ago jim jeffreys producer contacted me and asked me to come on as a guest to his show
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:21.640]  Now I agreed with two conditions one
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:25.640]  There'll be no neo nazi or nazi sympathizers on the same segment
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:31.480]  Because I don't want to be aligned to him and I don't want to give him any legitimacy or anything like that common sense
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:36.520]  The second one was that they don't cut my answers from one question and put it to another
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:42.600]  Now to my horror, but not my surprise. They did exactly both
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:45.960]  Both those things, but they went even further
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:48.680]  They connected me
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:55.880]  To the christ church killer to the terrorist the new zealand shooter left behind a detailed record of his anti-immigrant
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:57.720]  anti-muslim rhetoric
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:03.720]  And unfortunately these days this kind of intolerance is being tolerated in more places than you might think
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.360]  So it's important to remember that this was filmed a few months ago
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:14.040]  And not in response to the christ church massacre as they seem to be alluding here
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:22.360]  I was shocked to hear that the prick allegedly behind the christ church new zealand mass shootings is a white supremacist who grew up and was radicalized
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  in australia
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:30.040]  So what is the situation down there? And what are the people who may radicalized him saying?
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:33.160]  white people like myself feel happy and safe
[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:35.960]  around my culture my people
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:41.800]  Sherman to nazi you broke rule one in 20 seconds
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:46.760]  And this anti-immigration fervor is uniting some strange groups
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:53.000]  It turns out that the one thing that can bring together the alt-right and a jew is their shared hatred of muslims
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:38:00.360]  Me jewish activists rvm me a good australian name. Luckily i'm not an idiot, and i knew what their plan was
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.440]  all
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:07.560]  What they flew me to singapore put me in a hotel for a couple of days there
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  What was i to expect it was a sell
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:13.480]  So what i did was
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:16.280]  I got there and i secretly put my phones down
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.520]  to record
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:20.520]  the entire segment
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:23.720]  Now over the next few days i'm going to release a bunch of little
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.840]  Clips that are important that he specifically didn't add to the piece we filmed for about an hour
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:32.360]  And there's about three or four minutes
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:34.440]  where he's included
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:36.040]  little snippets
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:40.280]  So the next few days i'm going to release little bits that are important that i think everyone needs to see
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:42.520]  But if you're on my patreon
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:45.160]  You can see the entire hour i'll upload it within the next week
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:51.720]  Islamic immigration cut it now what makes rv suddenly feel so comfortable saying this out loud
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:55.960]  I always stand by my words and i say it publicly loudly and proudly
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:01.080]  I won't say in private something different than what i'll say in public
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.920]  And if i get it wrong which i have at times
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:09.640]  And i feel necessary to apologize i've done it and i will do it
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:17.000]  I might sound like a hippie saying this what gives anyone the right to tell anyone where they can and can't live
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:19.720]  When you import this culture, what do you think is going to happen?
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:23.240]  Australia's going to end up the same all that they came from that they were escaping
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:25.880]  watch how
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:30.280]  Jim Jeffries has edited this last clip to make me look like an ass
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:38.280]  See what i really said what gives anyone the right to tell anyone where they can and can't live
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:43.720]  I know borders, but wouldn't it just be nice if
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:51.400]  If we got to a place in society where we had to do well, this is utopia where we all just
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:53.880]  I
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:56.600]  On a level like we may say i'm a dreamer
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:04.120]  I think most most people most you know sensible people would agree with your theory. Yeah, but in practice
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:07.560]  It's not it's it goes against human nature. It just doesn't work
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:11.160]  You bloody scumbag Jim
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:16.920]  You see those rubbish edits through the entire segment. I don't even need to show you you get my point
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:20.280]  They put one answer to a different question
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.160]  but today what I really want to show you
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:28.280]  Is how Jim Jeffries speaks about Islam
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:31.080]  about their prophet Muhammad
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:33.720]  And about Muslims themselves
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:39.160]  When he thinks the cameras aren't rolling or when he knows he can cut it out
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:45.560]  So Muhammad isn't considered the perfect man, right? Yes. Okay. You can't draw a picture. No. Don't you dare. Don't you dare?
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.920]  I've got enough death threats on me brother. There he is. Jesus Christ. There he is. He looks like a wobbly ghost
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:54.040]  He's finally gonna understand this one
[02:40:54.040 --> 02:41:00.440]  That's what you do Jimmy when you think no one's going to see it
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:03.640]  Now I don't actually have a problem if you draw Muhammad to be honest
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:09.960]  That's that's me but people like you call me an Islamophobe because that rolls up that upsets that
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:12.840]  in your words
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:14.920]  triggers the muslim
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:16.920]  into violence
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:21.880]  Now I wonder when this goes far and wide and help it share it around let the world see
[02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:24.760]  I want to see if the leftists condemn
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:28.920]  Jim and even more so what I'm interested to see
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:37.240]  Is the people that he is hell-bent on protecting the people that he is fighting so hard to let into Australia
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:39.560]  and the US
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:43.960]  Let's see how they react when they see him mock their prophet
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:47.080]  You know what the punishment for?
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:49.560]  Blast for me is Jim
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:51.720]  I wish you luck brother
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:53.720]  But it gets worse
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:55.960]  Watch what he says
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:58.680]  When the cameras aren't rolling
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:04.120]  A big fan of Islam I think that wearing a burqa is stupid and demeaning and all these things
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:06.120]  Islam or Dingo?
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:08.120]  Dingo Sneaky?
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:10.120]  Probably right
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:12.120]  Dangerous?
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:16.680]  Let's stop right there
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:18.680]  The full reports up on infowars.com
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:21.960]  And you see him over and over again set him up
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:27.960]  And then he says something very reasonable and then he tricks him in conversations and say something else to sandwich together
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:33.080]  And they'll cut from in front and from back. So you don't know it's called fraud
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:39.320]  It's called fraud and I'm telling you you talk to any mainstream media. They all do it now
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:45.400]  There is no bottom. I told Megan Kelly. Sandy Hook happened. She added it where I said it didn't happen
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:50.680]  She is a criminal a fraud a demonic vampire a pig creature
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:53.000]  God she makes me sick. You're right back
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.880]  Frank in North Carolina. Thanks for holding so long. Go ahead. Yeah, I just have to say something man
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:03.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast you're bragging
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:06.920]  It just gets old man. I'm gonna shut you down right now. Okay
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:13.960]  We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:16.520]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:22.200]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it gonna take us being shut down?
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:24.920]  Is that what you want Frank? You know what Alex?
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:30.840]  Hey, I put him on pause again. Hey Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:34.360]  We're under attack. We need your help as much begging as I do
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:37.160]  We can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this
[02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:42.280]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards. You understand. I need your help Frank
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:44.520]  I need your help Frank

[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:58.760]  The globalist the eugenicists are always talking down to us
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:03.320]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant
[02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:08.920]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information

[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:14.520]  They want you to believe you're powerless

[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:24.360]  And and what we say and what we do that changes the world. We are the power structure
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:29.000]  We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers and the globalists
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:32.760]  Understand that and they understand
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:37.560]  That they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:42.520]  Now to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists

[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:05.720]  So
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:18.840]  Again
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:22.200]  A few weeks ago. We decided to have a save the first amendment
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:25.000]  stop big tech censorship 50 hour broadcast
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:31.320]  And trump with another beautiful sneak attack against the globalist this morning signed an executive order
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:36.600]  Where they pull federal funding from any university that bans free speech and engages in
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:41.560]  Basically malice style brainwashing. That's actually the model they use you can't make that up
[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:44.680]  Even obama member in the defense department
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:48.760]  Changed it where they said that will have reeducation camps
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:51.320]  And that's the soviet term
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:56.200]  Reeducation camps and it's not that our military is bad that obama in control of it was bad
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:48:01.880]  So they're they're following classic models because they've worked before you can't make this up
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:08.920]  And there's so many big articles on this front breaking so if we don't have speech
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:13.320]  We don't have
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:14.680]  anything
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:17.640]  So these are real authoritarians real tyrants
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:24.040]  I want to hit some other news. I haven't gotten to lot breaking on info wars.com and news wars.com at first
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:31.240]  When I explain and show you the statistics where we're number one here. We're number one there and then then we get band band band band
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:36.120]  It's because they understand freedom is popular. It's not
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:39.480]  That hard to understand
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:44.120]  And the people trying to keep me from that are horrible and they're dangerous
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:48.600]  And if they'll work with communist china that's killed more people than hitler ever thought about
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  They'll do some bad stuff to you. It shows
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:54.440]  They have no bottom
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:58.680]  Joe rogan just texted me. He's on the ground. He's coming over here right now
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:02.040]  tom pappard says to the fourth hour
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:04.040]  I was gonna have joe on this hour
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:09.880]  It'll be better taping it. It'll be no then I can hear it sunday or monday. Maybe I'll hear it tonight. Who knows?
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:13.160]  But that should be good because he's got some big topics that we're gonna discuss
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:15.160]  We'll see how that goes, but
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.280]  50 hour broadcast will roll on with a bunch of big guests. I haven't even mentioned
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:23.160]  It's probably put on screen some of the tommy robinson coming up tonight
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:29.080]  So many others throughout the evening or so and shroyer and others that are going to be hosting
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:32.760]  The crew is pointing out to me
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:37.880]  That hey, this is kind of a fundraiser soros is fun and all these deals to shut you down
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:44.520]  You might want to actually plug something and that's a good point. Um, we have store-wide free shipping
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:51.400]  50% off all the supplements a bunch of other big sales double patriot points. That's 10% off your next order
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:54.680]  Uh, additional 10% off when you sign a for auto ship
[02:49:56.280 --> 02:50:01.240]  This is undoubtedly the biggest sale ever. We just keep accelerating because people love them and
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:05.720]  Every hour there's a different item that's
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:10.440]  Even more 60% off this hour colloidal silver
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:14.840]  highest quality colloidal silver private labeled same stuff they sell in Whole Foods
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:17.400]  Click that for folks, please
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:21.240]  And you know, it's a good deal for $25 and that's just regular prices. We sell it for Whole Foods
[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:29.080]  But we're selling it for a lot lower than that 1198. You're never going to get a big bottle of high quality 30 parts per million colloidal silver
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:32.040]  Anywhere near this and look
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:34.520]  They've got smaller parts per million
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:37.720]  But those have been found in the balance to be toxic
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:44.200]  Obviously if something's going to kill bacterium viruses, it's it's it's pretty pretty tough
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:50.280]  Uh, so everything's a cost-benefit analysis and 30 parts is what's recognized to be the safest
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:54.120]  You know, some people of their, you know, got to go thermal nuclear
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:58.200]  They do even stronger silver and we sell topical silver that's way stronger
[02:50:58.200 --> 02:51:04.600]  The only FDA approved over the counter where the only group has been able to private label it and it's our wound gel
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:08.920]  Unbelievable, but you would never want to ingest it
[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:18.120]  Topical only it's the strongest stuff on the market in the United States
[02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:21.880]  It's $22
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:25.720]  In fact, I guess they did all the supplements and all the health stuff at 50 off
[02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:28.760]  We can't even do it for that. That's what we pay for it
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:31.560]  See, there's a few snafus here
[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:36.120]  Oh, yeah, just the approval for them to get this through cost them unbelievable amounts of money
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:42.200]  So that's why they sell it in stores for 40 bucks. We usually talk for like 30 dollars, but I guess they did do it for
[02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:45.240]  1795 Wow
[02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:48.680]  Well, if you wanted super silver wound gel
[02:51:50.520 --> 02:51:54.280]  I just give orders I go everything for two percent off and I'm not thinking some stuff
[02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:56.280]  Is only marked up a hundred percent
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:52:01.000]  So that's something you definitely want info or store.com
[02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:04.920]  Or triple a two five three three one three nine
[02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:14.520]  You know being the most outlawed country for real being the big fat black sheep in the establishment has its benefits
[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:19.240]  Because we reached out to the top company sold, you know, and it's in hospitals
[02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:21.400]  It's in it's it's sold at all the big drug stores
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:28.040]  For 40 dollars on sale, maybe you know 35 because it's very expensive to make and again the FDA approval process
[02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:33.240]  And they're like huge fans and they're like, well, no one's whenever let anybody private label that we're gonna let you
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:36.840]  So, you know that there's some there's some fringe benefits out there
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:42.520]  Uh to being persecuted you see a hundred percent reviews on super silver
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:47.240]  100 percent reviews. It's just uncanny tiny little speck on your hands
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:52.280]  They're cut up or whatever and and I will do it as a precautionary
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  And again ladies and gentlemen
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:01.960]  I'm gonna tell you do not ever take it internally because it would be real bad for you
[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:05.880]  I'm just saying silver is powerful
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:09.080]  But it's like anything that's gonna kill stuff
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:12.680]  By the way, this is one of the things we can say kills a bunch of stuff that nothing else does
[02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:16.600]  You got to go read about the wound gel. Some of these products are so powerful
[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:18.600]  I never even really talk about how good they are because
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:22.520]  There's all these FDA stuff where you're not supposed to ever talk about something except
[02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:28.600]  DNA force has the studies and we've got the patented stuff. I'm actually allowed to say regrows nerves
[02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:33.080]  Does all this makes telomeres not shrink as fast, which is the same thing's making them grow
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:39.400]  It's it's just crazy
[02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:41.960]  That we're allowed to talk about
[02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:44.760]  the silver wound gel
[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:46.760]  Because it's approved
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:52.200]  And so remind me guys to cut an end for the wound gel and DNA force because I tell that I've intimidated by the system
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:55.480]  I just know our listeners are smart and they can figure out what tumor it does
[02:53:55.480 --> 02:53:57.480]  They can figure out what these things do
[02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:00.360]  But what pure iodine does and I just say hey you look into it
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:04.200]  This is really the best stuff out there people find out how great it is and that it's the best out there
[02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:06.600]  But a lot of our products now
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:07.960]  are actually
[02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:10.680]  Things that have got all the studies and have done the approvals and all that
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:15.560]  Uh, because a lot of them are just private labeled the top-end stuff. By the way
[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:21.160]  I'm working with four medical doctors one of them owns one of the largest, uh
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:24.920]  regenerative and health clinics in texas
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:28.280]  And uh, these are MD doctors
[02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:31.160]  some of them like two or three MDs
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:32.840]  and
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:34.280]  they've got
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:38.040]  Pharmaceutical grade supplements and a lot of ours were what you'd call that it's a certain grade
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:44.200]  But that we're going to bring to market as well not through the m4s label, but through the medical doctors labels
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:46.760]  Uh, because they're that exciting
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.160]  So there's just a lot of good doors are opening
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:51.720]  Thanks to your prayers and support
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:56.200]  I'm never arrogant about it. Never say oh, I'm so smart while we're beating the enemy and have gone through all this
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:01.400]  No, it's because of prayer and you supporting us and I'm just kind of the crazy clown
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:04.520]  God's used to put up here at the front line
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:07.560]  and god loves
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:09.880]  Children drunks in the United States of America
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:15.080]  And I've been a child. I'm from the United States and I've been a drunk before
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:18.600]  So I'm just I was von Bismarck said that god loves
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:21.720]  What's up, darry?
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:28.120]  Oh, thank you. Oh, they're reminding me. I should have actually done the plug
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:35.160]  Oh, so that ours is in and we've now got bodies 60% off ultimate turmeric formula 95 percent of cumanoid
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:38.520]  Okay, you don't know about turmeric and you don't know about curcuminoid levels
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:42.360]  We're probably we can't say it for sure. We believe we're the only
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:47.400]  Company that has a 95 percent curcuminoid. I wonder the top developers and I said, what's your
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:54.040]  Who makes it for more than a dozen companies and what's your top product? They go. It's about 90 curcuminoid
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:57.800]  But that's just ridiculous. There's no need to do that. It's too expensive
[02:55:57.960 --> 02:56:01.800]  I said, what's the strongest you can do with the patented concentration process?
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:09.000]  They got back with us. They said 95 it's like 96 but they round down and supplements. They got something. It's 95 plus
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:14.440]  I said, okay, I'll take that and they go well that costs like twice as much as to mr. Tells you to do that. I said, I'm doing it
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:17.480]  to see
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:22.040]  I want to be the guy that's on the opposite end these guys want to put a bunch of filler these other fly by night companies
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:23.240]  They want to have a bunch of hype about it
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.400]  I want to be the guy that doesn't hype it up and just gives you the best because that's what I want
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:35.080]  I give these products to myself and my children shave the first amendment stop big tech censorship 50 hour broadcast special

[03:00:06.440 --> 03:00:10.440]  Welcome back to the alex jones show. This is the fourth hour
[03:00:10.440 --> 03:00:19.800]  I am tom papper facebook's god emperor trump guest hosting filling in for alex jones during this behemoth monumental 50 hour live
[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:26.360]  Broadcast to stop big set big tech censorship tongue twister there and protect the first amendment
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:30.040]  I've got a lot. I want to talk about today. Thank you to info wars. Thank you to alex jones
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:35.160]  And thank you to the info warriors out there in the audience for tuning in during this fourth hour
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:41.080]  So I am just as disappointed as everybody else that joe rogan his flight was apparently delayed
[03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:45.800]  And he was not able to get there in time to be on the show during the live broadcast today, but
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:50.760]  There's some interesting joe rogan news that I want to discuss
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:56.680]  Of course, everybody remembers that he had a little bit of an argument with alex jones over these past couple months
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:04.280]  He went on alex went on the joe rogan experience podcast to bury the hatchet joe rogan appeared on info wars and
[03:01:04.280 --> 03:01:07.960]  And now because of this friendship because that
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:11.960]  Joe rogan is not completely thrown alex under the bus
[03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:18.440]  We're seeing the left turn on their favorite podcaster joe rogan
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:25.240]  There's a new article up on slate.com as of yesterday joe rogan's galaxy brain
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:31.000]  And they make fun of him. They trash him. They tie him to the spooky scary
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:38.840]  Intellectual dark web and say that essentially the case being made here is that because joe rogan will have people like tim pool
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:43.400]  And alex jones and jack dorsi and because he will facilitate these discussions
[03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:51.240]  He pedals fear and he must be removed from the internet now as well. So this article is absolutely
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:57.640]  Comical it's about four thousand words. I think somebody one of these learn to code journalists over a slate
[03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:02.920]  I think they accidentally doubled up on their adhd and betta means one morning when they wrote this but
[03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:05.800]  I'm gonna break it down. I've got a couple little
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:08.520]  Clips here that I want to read
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:15.800]  And here's how it starts how the former fear factor host podcast became an essential platform for quote
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:18.680]  Free thinkers who hate the left?
[03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:23.720]  This is already just absolutely comical to me. I mean, I am no enemy of joe rogan
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:28.280]  I think that he does a wonderful job hosting the podcast and I love that he's had alex jones on twice
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:35.160]  And alex jones if you add the two podcasts together, he's probably the number one guest in any podcast in the history of podcasting
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:36.760]  but
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:41.320]  They're making joe rogan out to be some kind of alt right edgy
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:45.960]  Evil person and it's just the furthest thing from the truth. The guy smokes
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:52.840]  Medical grade tobacco and enjoys adult beverages while on the podcast. That's his whole shtick
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:58.760]  He is a fun guy you go and you deliver whatever your belief system is for between two and four hours
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:04.360]  That's his shtick. He gives people a platform left right center a political
[03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:11.400]  He had andrew yang on the democrat candidate. He wants to give everybody a hundred thousand dollars a month to exist or something like that
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:18.120]  He's clearly non-partisan. He's clearly a free thinker, which of course slate makes out to be a bad thing
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:24.760]  But this is how the article then goes on on february 7th the 1241st episode of the podcast
[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:33.400]  Comedian joe rogan kicked off a discussion of one of the single injustices of our time the de-platforming of jerks on the internet
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:38.360]  See you can already see the propaganda rabbit hole that this article is about to go down
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:46.920]  You see this isn't big tech censorship. This isn't demolishing and making light of and utterly destroying the first amendment
[03:03:46.920 --> 03:03:50.760]  This isn't five or ten people in silicon valley
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:56.280]  Determining what everybody in the world gets to see no no no no no
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:04:02.520]  We're just doing this 50 hour broadcast because of the de-platforming of jerks on the internet
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:08.680]  And joe rogan is now one of these jerks. I honestly I do wonder what does joe rogan know this is going to happen?
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:15.480]  Surely he did surely that was why he was kind of backing away from his association with alex jones over these past few months
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:19.400]  And I have to commend him. He is taking a serious risk here
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:28.040]  He is being a true alpha male by standing by alex jones and standing by infowars and not even saying he implicitly agrees with everything alex says
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:31.560]  But just giving him a platform. This is such a tremendous risk
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:37.400]  And here is the article that is the first real hit piece i've ever read on joe rogan
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:42.200]  Somebody who the left typically loves and with good reason. He is a classical liberal
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:46.680]  He is somebody that we should all kind of admire in that regard when we come back
[03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:52.840]  I'm going to keep breaking it down and talk about this next wave of censorship. You're watching the alex jones show. I'm tom papper
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:57.800]  Infowars store.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:05:06.840]  You don't need you don't want the air and the average american home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city
[03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:12.120]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that problem?
[03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:17.640]  So we have air filters at infowars store.com the alexa pure breeze which is right now
[03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:20.840]  50 dollars off
[03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:25.800]  The alexa pure breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology
[03:05:26.120 --> 03:05:29.080]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:32.760]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul
[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:38.680]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself. I've got two in my home
[03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:44.520]  You will notice the difference ladies and gentlemen with the alexa pure breeze in your house
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:46.600]  Don't live
[03:05:46.600 --> 03:05:52.600]  In a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air go to infowars store.com
[03:05:52.600 --> 03:06:08.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:18.600]  Welcome back to the alex jones show. This is the fourth hour. I am tom pamphlet facebook's god emperor trump
[03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:25.720]  I helped run one of infowars tv's affiliates here in wichita, kansas. I also write at big league politics dot com
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:33.240]  I'm just as disappointed as I said in the last segment as everyone else the joe rogan's flight was delayed and he's not in studio yet
[03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:39.160]  But there's lots of joe rogan news going on the left has started its smear campaign
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:45.400]  Against him and it came to us from slate with the article titled joe rogan's galaxy brain
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:50.840]  Again now joe rogan is one of these intellectual dark web people who is evil and must be stopped
[03:06:50.920 --> 03:06:56.840]  He pedals hate and fear because he has people like alex jones on the joe rogan experience podcast
[03:06:56.920 --> 03:07:01.640]  So let's continue picking out some gems from this four or five thousand word article
[03:07:01.800 --> 03:07:07.800]  I just printed out here about a thousand words of it and it's still two pages. This is just all the relevant spicy parts
[03:07:07.880 --> 03:07:13.000]  I honestly can't imagine anybody reads this drivel except now the right wing will because we're going to be shocked
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:19.480]  That just by having an association with alex jones. You can now be essentially taken off of the internet
[03:07:19.480 --> 03:07:24.440]  I mean, that's what they want from this. It's very clear by the end of the article. That's their entire goal
[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:31.000]  So we left off with the deplatforming of jerks on the internet. They say that's all we're mad about
[03:07:31.080 --> 03:07:36.920]  That's the reason for this 50 hour broadcast not to save the constitution to save the first amendment
[03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:41.640]  To prevent an unelected group of lunatics and silicon valley from determining
[03:07:41.640 --> 03:07:47.000]  What people can see what people can read what people can learn about the knowledge that we get to obtain
[03:07:47.160 --> 03:07:48.360]  No, we're not upset about that
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:54.120]  We're upset because some bad people got deplatformed and that makes us bad people as well
[03:07:54.120 --> 03:07:58.040]  The propaganda is so comical on this left wing website slate
[03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:01.400]  So rogan, of course was against the deplatformization
[03:08:01.720 --> 03:08:08.040]  The article continues as was his guest the author and podcaster sam harris who urged rogan's listeners
[03:08:08.040 --> 03:08:13.720]  To consider the plight of all the witty provocateurs who have lately begun to suffer real life
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:19.160]  Consequences for their trollish online banter. So you see this is just so comical
[03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:22.120]  It is such an on-the-face joke again
[03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:24.760]  We're not upset because people are being taken down
[03:08:24.920 --> 03:08:32.600]  Laura loomer has the audacity to call out ilano mar as somebody who may have illegally married her brother to smuggle him into the country
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:39.160]  As a rampant anti-semite who says that americans who say anything nice about israel are controlled by them
[03:08:39.480 --> 03:08:45.160]  She goes as far as just a couple days after a terrorist attack. She was posting a la walk bar on twitter
[03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:51.560]  That is just laura loomer being a trollish banter person and she deserves to be banned
[03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:56.520]  About the only one who falls into this is milo yinopoulos who was being a journalist
[03:08:56.680 --> 03:09:01.000]  Of course, everybody saw that discussion on the joe rogan experience podcast
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:04.520]  And that's part of the reason why they want him gone
[03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:12.280]  So the article goes on the proximate causes harris's smarm was neither a teenager nor a twitter troll
[03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:17.400]  But an actor who had made it rather old-fashioned staying they talk about liam nison
[03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:24.200]  That people wanted blood after liam nison recalled being a teenager and wanting to hurt a black person on the street
[03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:30.680]  People go out for blood for this and they say imagine what if lian nison had been totally taken down and to slate that would be a good thing
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:37.560]  They want him excommunicated from society. He spoke wrong thing. He told a an anecdote from when he was a child
[03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:39.960]  He must go
[03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:46.120]  Then the article begins to get to really the meat and potatoes of why people hate alex jones
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:49.320]  Why now they hate joe rogan why they hate info wars?
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:55.880]  Oh and shroyer david knight and it's because of something called authenticity. None of this is fake
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:01.240]  I've been to the info wars studio before I didn't see a teleprompter in the entire facility
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:06.360]  I don't think they own them. I don't think anybody there knows how to run one, which is a phenomenal thing
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:11.720]  Nobody there gets talking points. You don't have george soros telling alex jones
[03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:17.400]  What to say every morning when he gets into the studio, which the left does have they have media matters talking points
[03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:22.760]  That's where they get their prescribed beliefs coming straight from the former nazi himself
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:29.400]  So this is quoted from the article. This is something that tim pool said to joe rogan on his recent appearance
[03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:31.560]  He said I think a lot of people look at you
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:36.600]  You're like a real dude the independent journalist tim pool told rogan to ring a recent podcast
[03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:38.920]  You know your conversations are real
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:45.320]  You're not one of these fake news journalists that people are very critical of that they feel are biased or have an agenda
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:49.080]  And that's what slate hates
[03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:56.840]  They really dislike that joe rogan gets on there possibly inebriated who am I to judge and just speaks his mind
[03:10:57.080 --> 03:11:03.240]  And he allows his guests to speak their mind and there is no censorship. There's no you can't talk about that topic
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:10.680]  There's none of that you go on and you see alex jones talk about everything from trans dimensional pedophiles to big tech
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:15.640]  Censorship that's who alex jones is and that's why he was on the podcast
[03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:20.600]  But they don't like that so the article continues pools assertion is half correct
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:25.400]  Rogan is not a journalist and he does not claim to be one but rogan's agenda
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:31.080]  Nevertheless is very clear. You see they make it out. So joe rogan. They see this is where it starts
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:37.240]  He's some kind of nazi. He's some kind of vile right wing suit white supremacists. He must be stopped
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:43.640]  Rogan's podcast has become an important node. The article continues in the intellectual dark web
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:46.200]  Which is by the way, one of the laziest
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:54.120]  Terms i've ever heard created the intellectual dark web is jordan peterson tim pool these
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:57.000]  Really middle of the road mainstream
[03:11:58.120 --> 03:12:03.160]  Sounding voices that would have been five years ago completely within the box
[03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:08.520]  The problem is the left has moved the overton window so far into the radical leftist direction
[03:12:08.680 --> 03:12:13.880]  That a guy telling teenagers to clean their room is now part of this spooky scary
[03:12:14.680 --> 03:12:21.400]  Intellectual dark web that the google ceo says we must clamp down on and we would love to get rid of ben Shapiro and jordan peterson
[03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:25.560]  We just are waiting eagerly for them to break the community guidelines
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:32.600]  So this loose network, they say of quote classical liberals writers scholars and speakers who claim to have been
[03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:37.720]  Marginalized by the elitist progressives intent on maintaining an identity and orthodoxy
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:45.960]  These people in bay against political correctness and identity politics and publications like quillettes and on youtube videos and one another's podcast
[03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:52.760]  Oh, you can't have that you can't have people talking to each other that would just be the worst thing that's ever happened
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:58.040]  They have no idea how ridiculous they sound how inside their own little world
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:06.360]  They are to seriously suggest that people talking on each other's shows is a bad thing as if that's not what every mainstream leftist network is
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:10.920]  The article goes on they claim to be personally liberal like rogan
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:16.360]  They mostly all claim to go left on everything even the article says as they profess
[03:13:16.360 --> 03:13:25.160]  Reactionary ideas they take the fact that their theories and opinions are unpopular among their peers in academia and the media as proof
[03:13:25.400 --> 03:13:27.400]  That their peers are suppressive
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:30.040]  No
[03:13:30.040 --> 03:13:35.400]  How do they get this so blatantly wrong? We don't look at that as proof that are that we are being censored
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:40.280]  We look at that as the obvious results people are afraid. I mean, I don't know
[03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:41.640]  I've never spoken to Joe rogan
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:46.920]  I think that there was a healthy amount of fear that an article like this would come out if he's so much as
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:51.960]  Touched the topic of big tech censorship with a 10 foot pole and look he was right
[03:13:52.120 --> 03:13:55.960]  He had the audacity to defend alex jones not even full-throatedly
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:13:59.720]  But just say hey, maybe alex jones isn't such a bad guy now
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:08.440]  He is part of the intellectual dark web who was afraid of academia and afraid of the media because they're the ones telling the truth
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:15.080]  And and if you disagree with the media then you must be a liar and misinformed and stupid
[03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:19.160]  So let's fast forward a bit in the article because they bury it
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:25.320]  But I honestly believe this article was written because of alex jones appearance on the joe rogan experience
[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:31.960]  A recent interview with alex jones the article continues showcase the show's charms and frustrations
[03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:38.120]  Jones had come on the podcast to bury the hatchet with rogan with whom he had been feuding over jones previous
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:41.240]  This is where i'm gonna get red in the face angry
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:46.760]  Jones previous assertions that the sandy hook school shooting may not have actually happened
[03:14:47.080 --> 03:14:52.440]  Nobody can provide clips by the way of alex jones ever saying that didn't happen. There may have been some guests
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:54.520]  There may have been some collars that type of thing
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:15:00.440]  But nobody has ever been able to sit down and show me where alex jones said these things and now of course for the past
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:07.160]  What is this 2019 for the past how many years has alex jones said? Yes, it was a tragedy. It was horrifying
[03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:09.880]  It was terrible kids died. I wish it would stop happening
[03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:16.520]  I wish the media would stop bringing it up making these parents relive the terror and the horror every single time
[03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:23.320]  But that is what the article says that the media was doing their job by lying about alex jones and putting words in his
[03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:31.960]  Mouth and that joe rogan was doing a horrible disservice to the media to real real intellectuals all across the country by having
[03:15:32.040 --> 03:15:36.200]  The audacity to let alex jones explain that he has been framed for saying something
[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:40.440]  He never said and they've used that as an excuse to purge him off the internet
[03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:45.160]  And so now joe rogan must go that is where they're at
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:49.240]  We're gonna be back in just a minute. You're watching the fourth hour of the alex jones show

[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:33.960]  I sued the IRS and won I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[03:17:33.960 --> 03:17:37.640]  And I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems. They thought might never be solved
[03:17:37.800 --> 03:17:43.880]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:51.640]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website danpilla.com. That's Danpilla.com Danpilla.com
[03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:58.520]  I've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube censorship
[03:17:59.080 --> 03:18:02.200]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video
[03:18:02.760 --> 03:18:06.600]  That is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed
[03:18:07.640 --> 03:18:13.480]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[03:18:14.040 --> 03:18:18.840]  Leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won
[03:18:18.840 --> 03:18:24.760]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did
[03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:29.880]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in fours down
[03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:36.680]  This is a fight about taking your speech away. Not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:38.840]  This country is in a war
[03:18:39.160 --> 03:18:41.240]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:46.200]  But I want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great products
[03:18:46.200 --> 03:18:52.840]  We have and fund us and the 360 win. We're dead in the water. I'm in your hands. You're in my hands infowarstore.com
[03:18:53.160 --> 03:18:54.040]  Thank you
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:56.600]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day
[03:18:56.920 --> 03:19:02.360]  To still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk
[03:19:02.520 --> 03:19:08.200]  Believe me. I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day
[03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:13.720]  But thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com. I still have that energy
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:19.800]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water
[03:19:19.960 --> 03:19:24.280]  To fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours
[03:19:24.520 --> 03:19:29.320]  To still have the stamina and endurance energy and drive to get to the gym
[03:19:29.480 --> 03:19:34.120]  Get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health
[03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:38.280]  So go to infowarstore.com and get supermail vitality before it's gone
[03:19:38.440 --> 03:19:42.040]  This is actually our last run of supermail vitality
[03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:46.680]  So I want you to experience supermail vitality before it's too late
[03:19:47.160 --> 03:19:49.160]  Unleash the supermail in you
[03:19:49.880 --> 03:19:51.880]  supermail vitality
[03:19:51.880 --> 03:20:16.840]  To still get to the gym or to go for a run or a walk or a walk
[03:20:16.840 --> 03:20:29.320]  So we've been talking about the left's now attempt to get rid of Joe Rogan.
[03:20:29.320 --> 03:20:31.840]  He's friends with Alex Jones, so he has to go.
[03:20:31.840 --> 03:20:36.740]  And the big tech censorship has been ongoing now for two years, nonstop, nobody is really
[03:20:36.740 --> 03:20:37.740]  standing in the way.
[03:20:37.740 --> 03:20:40.440]  The president appears that he finally may act.
[03:20:40.440 --> 03:20:46.600]  Don Jr, of course, is writing off as condemning it, but what will happen is what I want to
[03:20:46.600 --> 03:20:49.360]  know if they're successful, if they get rid of everybody.
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:54.840]  You heard on the Alex Jones show earlier today, CEO of Google laughs about the idea of getting
[03:20:54.840 --> 03:21:01.680]  rid of Ben Shapiro, who as middle of the road, he was a neocon never Trump loser.
[03:21:01.680 --> 03:21:03.880]  And I mean, he still is half the time.
[03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:07.720]  Every other day, he's disappointed in Trump, but even he has to go.
[03:21:07.720 --> 03:21:13.320]  Even he is too far to the right for the big tech overlord.
[03:21:13.320 --> 03:21:17.120]  So what happens in a world where they get their way?
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:18.120]  What do we have left?
[03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:19.440]  We have Fox News.
[03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:20.940]  We have Fox Business.
[03:21:20.940 --> 03:21:23.480]  I guess we're going to have to resort to smoke signals.
[03:21:23.480 --> 03:21:26.280]  Maybe Elizabeth Warren can help us out with that.
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:28.960]  And let's look at the character of Fox News, shall we?
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:32.960]  The people who, of course, Judge Jeanine Perot has been suspended down.
[03:21:32.960 --> 03:21:35.760]  I think she's under second or third week of suspension.
[03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:37.440]  There's no real end date in sight.
[03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:40.360]  They claim she'll be back, but nobody is convinced.
[03:21:40.360 --> 03:21:44.480]  Tucker Carlson, of course, is we're all living in fear that he's going to be thrown under
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:50.440]  the bus by his own network because of remarks he said 15 or 20 years ago on a comedy show
[03:21:50.440 --> 03:21:53.000]  on the radio.
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:22:00.640]  And meanwhile, we broke a story today at bigleaguepolitics.com that is downright disturbing.
[03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:04.640]  And what's even more disturbing is the Fox News has remained totally silent, as has the
[03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:06.440]  majority of the mainstream media.
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:14.120]  But in exclusive audio, Shepard Smith has a man who is accusing him of sexually attacking
[03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:20.000]  him in the middle of the night and says he kept going after he tried to push Shepard
[03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:22.000]  off.
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:25.320]  Fox News, again, has said nothing about this.
[03:22:25.320 --> 03:22:27.360]  They have not commented on it publicly.
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:30.960]  They will not respond to big league politics requests for comment.
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:34.040]  They are just hoping this does go away.
[03:22:34.040 --> 03:22:36.120]  And they don't have to worry about it.
[03:22:36.120 --> 03:22:42.600]  Again, Judge Jeanine points out that maybe you can't uphold Sharia law and follow the
[03:22:42.600 --> 03:22:44.280]  Constitution at the same time.
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:45.800]  Oh, she's got to go.
[03:22:45.800 --> 03:22:46.800]  She's in trouble.
[03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:47.800]  She needs to apologize.
[03:22:47.800 --> 03:22:51.280]  The network needs to condemn her statement.
[03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:56.520]  Tucker Carlson makes some funny jokes on a radio show, and the network is just conspicuously
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:22:57.520]  silent.
[03:22:57.520 --> 03:23:00.880]  Tucker hasn't tweeted in days.
[03:23:00.880 --> 03:23:06.680]  A man comes forward saying that their host sexually assaulted him allegedly.
[03:23:06.680 --> 03:23:09.680]  No comment, nothing, bury the story.
[03:23:09.680 --> 03:23:11.160]  So let's read a little bit from this.
[03:23:11.160 --> 03:23:16.480]  A man told his story to big league politics about an encounter with Fox News host Shep
[03:23:16.480 --> 03:23:19.400]  Smith in 2004 in New York City.
[03:23:19.400 --> 03:23:24.840]  The man describes how he woke up with Smith on top of him with his tongue down his throat,
[03:23:24.840 --> 03:23:26.880]  how he tried to push the Fox hosts off him.
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:32.640]  Now Smith lunged at him three or four more times while continuing to force the unwanted
[03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:35.600]  physical encounter.
[03:23:35.600 --> 03:23:38.960]  And we could play the audio, but it's frankly a little bit disturbing and I don't think
[03:23:38.960 --> 03:23:44.240]  it's appropriate for a family broadcast, but I'll read some of the less incendiary quotes.
[03:23:44.240 --> 03:23:49.680]  John Doe number one says he met up with Smith at the now defunct nation bar in Manhattan.
[03:23:49.680 --> 03:23:54.880]  A spot Smith used to frequent to play golden tea and hang out when he was not on the Fox
[03:23:54.880 --> 03:23:55.880]  airwaves.
[03:23:55.880 --> 03:23:56.880]  Right.
[03:23:56.880 --> 03:24:02.120]  This alleged attack happened when Shepard Smith was already employed at Fox News.
[03:24:02.120 --> 03:24:07.760]  You can't even play the game that there are with Tucker where CNN says, well, he wasn't
[03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:10.720]  really, he wasn't, he wasn't doing that on our time.
[03:24:10.720 --> 03:24:13.640]  And then Fox News says, well, that was before we ever even met Tucker.
[03:24:13.640 --> 03:24:14.640]  So it's okay.
[03:24:14.640 --> 03:24:18.440]  No, this happened on Fox News's watch.
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:23.800]  He said this, I wake up and Shepard is on top of me like in a towel or a bathrobe and
[03:24:23.800 --> 03:24:27.920]  he's got his tongue down my throat and his hands all over me, completely uninvited.
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:29.600]  I mean, I gave him no signal.
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:31.600]  There was nothing.
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:34.560]  He continued, I had also volunteered to sleep in the spare.
[03:24:34.560 --> 03:24:37.720]  So it wasn't, I never invited myself to his bedroom.
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:38.720]  I pushed him off.
[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:40.720]  I was like, dude, what are you doing?
[03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:45.440]  And Shepard responded, what, you don't like it?
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:53.160]  And then he kept going three or four more times, groping allegedly this guy.
[03:24:53.160 --> 03:24:55.480]  That is absolutely sickening.
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.880]  And again, just think of what happened with Kavanaugh.
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:01.480]  The woman refused to come forward.
[03:25:01.480 --> 03:25:04.320]  She finally did, but only under certain circumstances.
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:06.840]  The left wing just sat there and coddled her.
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:14.440]  But then with Shepard Smith, we break this insane story that if true is repugnant and
[03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:16.400]  everybody is silence about it.
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:17.400]  Everybody is ignoring it.
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:21.040]  Again, I have to thank the Infowars team for allowing me to come on and talk about it today
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:24.560]  because it is disgusting.
[03:25:24.560 --> 03:25:28.880]  He continues, there was this like kind of no, and he kept going.
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:32.920]  He kept pushing, like pushing his hands in all these spots.
[03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:35.400]  He was just on top of me.
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:40.000]  He said the experience was definitely shocking and noted that he finally stopped, but it
[03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  took a lot.
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:44.720]  It wasn't an immediate no, then everything was like, oh, sorry.
[03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:48.480]  He said that again, three or four times he lunged at him.
[03:25:48.480 --> 03:25:52.440]  And then finally, allegedly, Shepard Smith left him alone.
[03:25:52.440 --> 03:25:56.000]  The next morning he wakes up at around six in the morning and he's just trying to get
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  out of the apartment.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:02.840]  Shepard Smith corners him in the kitchen drinking a beer, again.
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:07.160]  This is the story that was relayed to big league politics.
[03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:13.440]  So he corners him in the kitchen drinking a beer, six in the morning, says, no, no, no,
[03:26:13.440 --> 03:26:14.600]  don't leave.
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:15.960]  Go with me.
[03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:17.280]  Drive to the airport with me.
[03:26:17.280 --> 03:26:23.120]  Then my Fox News paid for a driver, I'm sure, will drive you home so we can spend more time
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:24.120]  together.
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:28.040]  And the guy is freaked out, but he didn't feel physically threatened at the time.
[03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:29.840]  So he said, okay, I'll ride with you.
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:35.680]  And then Shepard allegedly forced himself on this guy again and kissed him again and
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:39.360]  put his tongue down his throat again.
[03:26:39.360 --> 03:26:40.980]  Where is the outrage?
[03:26:40.980 --> 03:26:46.100]  Is it because Shepard Smith is one of Fox News Never Trump cohorts?
[03:26:46.100 --> 03:26:49.960]  Is it because this is from big league politics?
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:55.440]  The same people who broke the Ralph Northam KKK blackface scandal?
[03:26:55.440 --> 03:26:56.560]  Where is the outrage?
[03:26:56.560 --> 03:27:01.320]  Why is everybody not beating down the door of Rupert Murdoch, or I'm sorry, his son
[03:27:01.320 --> 03:27:02.320]  now?
[03:27:02.320 --> 03:27:06.160]  And of course, I mean that not literally, but politically.
[03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:10.920]  Why are people not banging down the doors of Fox News trying to get answers, trying
[03:27:10.920 --> 03:27:12.200]  to get a statement?
[03:27:12.200 --> 03:27:16.360]  Where are the calls for Shepard Smith to be fired or at least investigated over these
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:17.360]  claims?
[03:27:17.360 --> 03:27:19.880]  What if there are other victims over the years?
[03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:23.680]  What if there are other accusers that want to step forward but feel that they won't have
[03:27:23.680 --> 03:27:25.600]  an audience?
[03:27:25.600 --> 03:27:26.920]  Nobody wants to talk about this.
[03:27:26.920 --> 03:27:31.440]  And I find that utterly disturbing that the network who will basically can, one of their
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:39.200]  longest hosts, a kind lady, Judge Jeanine, has a show one day a week and she pointed
[03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:46.160]  out that, hey, maybe it's not very possible to keep Sharia law at the same time you want
[03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:47.480]  to uphold the Constitution.
[03:27:47.480 --> 03:27:49.160]  Maybe that's a contradiction.
[03:27:49.160 --> 03:27:50.320]  Maybe you need to choose one.
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:51.480]  Oh, that's terrible.
[03:27:51.480 --> 03:27:52.480]  She needs to go.
[03:27:52.480 --> 03:27:53.480]  She's in big trouble.
[03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:55.560]  She's in big, big trouble.
[03:27:55.560 --> 03:27:58.720]  You've got Lindsey Graham on Sean Hannity almost every night.
[03:27:58.720 --> 03:28:03.400]  I'm ready to just call it the Lindsey Graham Hour with occasional guest host Sean Hannity.
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:07.720]  You've got Laura Ingram, who has been forced to apologize and had advertisers drop her
[03:28:07.720 --> 03:28:12.640]  show after maybe suggesting David Hogg was not the most honest person in the world.
[03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:14.760]  God forbid.
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:16.720]  Now we have a real scandal.
[03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:22.000]  The first real scandal to hit Fox News and I don't know when.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:23.200]  And what is the response?
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:24.640]  Again, it's crickets.
[03:28:24.640 --> 03:28:25.920]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[03:28:25.920 --> 03:28:31.440]  Shepard Smith allegedly forcing himself on a younger man who weighed 35 pounds less than
[03:28:31.440 --> 03:28:32.600]  him.
[03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:34.080]  The story sounds credible.
[03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:37.520]  The audio is up at bigleaguepolitics.com.
[03:28:37.520 --> 03:28:39.280]  You can evaluate for yourself.
[03:28:39.280 --> 03:28:40.280]  But it was disgusting.
[03:28:40.280 --> 03:28:44.480]  I felt my stomach churn as I listened to the man relay this incident.
[03:28:44.480 --> 03:28:45.920]  You're watching the Alex Jones show.
[03:28:45.920 --> 03:28:51.640]  We'll be right back after this with more coverage on Fox News and what the future without Alex
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:53.360]  Jones, without any real pain.
[03:28:53.360 --> 03:28:57.080]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:29:00.160]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:02.480]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:29:02.480 --> 03:29:04.480]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[03:29:54.400 --> 03:29:58.280]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, they canned food during the fall so they'd
[03:29:58.280 --> 03:29:59.280]  have it during the winter.
[03:29:59.280 --> 03:30:03.440]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com.
[03:30:03.440 --> 03:30:09.520]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriots supply on the top, most respected
[03:30:09.520 --> 03:30:10.520]  companies out there.
[03:30:10.520 --> 03:30:16.120]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:18.200]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:30:18.200 --> 03:30:22.480]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have swarable food so it's a total
[03:30:22.480 --> 03:30:23.480]  win-win.

[03:30:37.600 --> 03:30:38.600]  supply.

[03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:43.120]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:30:43.120 --> 03:30:48.040]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[03:30:48.040 --> 03:30:53.920]  M4STour.com and M4 Select, high-quality swarble foods, powered by my Patriots supply.
[03:30:53.920 --> 03:30:56.040]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:30:56.040 --> 03:30:57.040]  Go ahead.
[03:30:57.040 --> 03:31:01.360]  Look, I just have to say something, man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[03:31:01.360 --> 03:31:02.360]  you're bragging.
[03:31:02.360 --> 03:31:03.360]  It just gets old, man.
[03:31:03.360 --> 03:31:06.640]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:31:06.640 --> 03:31:08.880]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:31:08.880 --> 03:31:13.040]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:15.560]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:18.800]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:31:18.800 --> 03:31:21.360]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:31:21.360 --> 03:31:22.360]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:31:22.360 --> 03:31:23.360]  Yeah, you know what, Alex?
[03:31:23.360 --> 03:31:24.360]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:31:24.360 --> 03:31:25.360]  Hey, Frank!
[03:31:25.360 --> 03:31:30.840]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack,
[03:31:30.840 --> 03:31:31.840]  we need your help.
[03:31:31.840 --> 03:31:36.120]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:31:36.120 --> 03:31:39.120]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:31:39.120 --> 03:31:40.120]  Do you understand?
[03:31:40.120 --> 03:31:41.360]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:31:41.360 --> 03:31:43.640]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:31:43.640 --> 03:31:48.720]  Go to M4STour.com right now and help fund the M4.
[03:31:48.720 --> 03:31:49.960]  Do you understand?
[03:31:49.960 --> 03:31:51.640]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:31:51.640 --> 03:31:53.800]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[03:31:53.800 --> 03:31:58.840]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[03:31:58.840 --> 03:32:03.080]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done, so this is the best deal we've
[03:32:03.080 --> 03:32:04.480]  ever offered.
[03:32:04.480 --> 03:32:10.160]  Free shipping store-wide, that's free shipping store-wide, free shipping store-wide, 50% off
[03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:14.680]  all the supplements, a bunch of other great deals as well, double-patriot points instead

[03:32:31.160 --> 03:32:33.160]  Most of these products are lost leaders.
[03:32:33.160 --> 03:32:35.440]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the InfoWare.
[03:32:35.440 --> 03:32:40.680]  I want to encourage you today to get great products, the 360 Win, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:40.680 --> 03:32:45.680]  Voting with our feet, voting with our dollars, voting with our mouths, voting with our speech,
[03:32:45.680 --> 03:32:46.840]  voting with our action.
[03:32:46.840 --> 03:32:50.240]  Free shipping store-wide, that's free shipping store-wide.
[03:32:50.240 --> 03:32:51.240]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:51.240 --> 03:32:57.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:57.240 --> 03:33:13.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:25.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.080 --> 03:33:27.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.240 --> 03:33:32.920]  I am Tom Papper, filling in for Alex for the fourth hour here, during this monumental 50-hour
[03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:40.720]  live broadcast to stop big tech censorship and protect, to save, really, the First Amendment.
[03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:45.280]  So I want to remind everybody that the reason why we're all on the air, the reason why we
[03:33:45.280 --> 03:33:50.120]  can do this, me as my own independent person, Alex Jones and InfoWare, is because people
[03:33:50.120 --> 03:33:51.280]  support us.
[03:33:51.280 --> 03:33:54.620]  We don't get big checks from George Soros.
[03:33:54.620 --> 03:33:58.540]  We don't get dark money from the DNC.
[03:33:58.540 --> 03:34:00.840]  We don't get dark money from the RNC.
[03:34:00.840 --> 03:34:05.000]  There is no right-wing George Soros, and if there were, maybe there is.
[03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:06.760]  Maybe that's how Ben Shapiro stays afloat.
[03:34:06.760 --> 03:34:10.320]  But if there were, Alex Jones wouldn't want to take his money.
[03:34:10.320 --> 03:34:14.000]  He doesn't want to be shut up by anybody in the media.
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:15.640]  He doesn't want puppet masters.
[03:34:15.640 --> 03:34:19.640]  And that's why it's so important to go to InfoWareStore.com and take advantage of some
[03:34:19.640 --> 03:34:22.040]  of the insane deals going on right now.
[03:34:22.040 --> 03:34:23.680]  You can see I've got my alpha power here.
[03:34:23.680 --> 03:34:27.640]  I was just telling, in the break, I was telling some of the crew, I finally ran out of super
[03:34:27.640 --> 03:34:29.120]  male vitality.
[03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:32.720]  And if I were smart, I would go and get more while supplies still last.
[03:34:32.720 --> 03:34:35.960]  Because once it's gone, my understanding is it's gone.
[03:34:35.960 --> 03:34:41.220]  And you can go find video of me from when I was in the InfoWare Studio this last summer.
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:43.040]  And man, has it had an impact.
[03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:45.320]  It really does, as Owen and everyone else says.
[03:34:45.320 --> 03:34:50.000]  It gives you the extra energy, the extra drive, the extra fire you need every single day to
[03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:55.280]  make it to the gym, to work out, to go for a run, to go to the park, to get things done
[03:34:55.280 --> 03:34:56.800]  that you just don't have.
[03:34:56.800 --> 03:35:00.920]  And I mean, if you're like me, if you're like, I'm guessing Alex and Owen and everyone else,
[03:35:00.920 --> 03:35:05.360]  sleep is not necessarily the best thing, which is why you need knockout.
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:10.440]  And you finally are ready to shut off all the screens that program your brain that actually,
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:14.400]  when you stare at a computer screen all day, or you stare at these TV lights all day, that's
[03:35:14.400 --> 03:35:15.400]  what it's doing.
[03:35:15.400 --> 03:35:16.400]  It's programming your brain.
[03:35:16.400 --> 03:35:17.400]  It's daytime.
[03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:18.400]  It's light out.
[03:35:18.400 --> 03:35:19.400]  It's morning.
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:21.000]  Go out and work.
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:25.440]  And then when it comes time at 10 or 11 or 12 at night, when you've got to go get some
[03:35:25.440 --> 03:35:29.280]  sleep so you can be recharged for the next day, your brain can't do it.
[03:35:29.280 --> 03:35:31.000]  That's why knockout exists.
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:35.440]  That's why all of the infowars product exists because we need them to live in this horrible
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:38.240]  society that the globalist had created for us.
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:39.760]  You have to use this stuff.
[03:35:39.760 --> 03:35:45.280]  And I honestly cannot say enough good things about super male vitality, about alpha power,
[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:46.280]  about knockouts.
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:49.560]  I have an Alexa Pro Pure air filter in my apartment.
[03:35:49.560 --> 03:35:54.320]  I live in a 110 year old building and believe me, it's made a tremendous difference in my
[03:35:54.320 --> 03:35:55.320]  breathing.
[03:35:55.320 --> 03:35:59.880]  Can't say enough nice things about what is it here?
[03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:02.560]  I actually have it hidden behind me, believe it or not.
[03:36:02.560 --> 03:36:05.280]  More products hidden right here on the set.
[03:36:05.280 --> 03:36:11.520]  Survival Shield X2, which I understand is recently back in stock after the rare earth
[03:36:11.520 --> 03:36:13.880]  crystals became harder and harder to find.
[03:36:13.880 --> 03:36:18.120]  The oil companies hilariously had infowars over a barrel trying to get them to basically
[03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:20.520]  pay whatever they could get.
[03:36:20.520 --> 03:36:25.400]  And some heart negotiating, I guess Alex Jones has read the art of the deal once or twice.
[03:36:25.400 --> 03:36:28.800]  It looks like it's now back and at a reasonable price.
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:30.920]  Can't say enough nice things about all these products.
[03:36:30.920 --> 03:36:35.400]  Of course, the flagship product, Brainforce, is one of my alt times favorites.
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:39.440]  You don't get the shakes, you don't get jittery, you can think clearly, and you have all the
[03:36:39.440 --> 03:36:43.040]  wonderful effects of a new tropic.
[03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:45.920]  So I can't say enough nice things about InfowarsStore.com.
[03:36:45.920 --> 03:36:49.960]  It is tremendous, everything I've ever ordered, nothing has ever let me down.
[03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:53.760]  Occasionally you get some free stickers in the box, occasionally when it's Christmas time
[03:36:53.760 --> 03:36:56.360]  he'll give you a T-shirt as a gift.
[03:36:56.360 --> 03:37:01.520]  I have a wonderful T-shirt that's anti-gun control, it has Stalin and I think Jay and
[03:37:01.520 --> 03:37:06.840]  Hitler and it says they all took the guns from the iconic appearance on Piers Morgan's
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:08.480]  old CNN show.
[03:37:08.480 --> 03:37:11.640]  Cannot say enough nice things by the products.
[03:37:11.640 --> 03:37:12.920]  You know you need them.
[03:37:12.920 --> 03:37:18.120]  It supports the Infowar, it keeps Infowars expanding, it keeps them looking for affiliates
[03:37:18.120 --> 03:37:21.240]  like KCTU, TV5, and Wichita, Kansas.
[03:37:21.240 --> 03:37:24.040]  It keeps them machine growing.
[03:37:24.040 --> 03:37:26.240]  InfowarsStore.com.
[03:37:26.240 --> 03:37:33.000]  So we've been talking now about this horrifying world, what it would look like if we had no
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:38.800]  real conservatives talking on YouTube, in podcasts, on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram.
[03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:43.200]  What if everybody went down the memory hole along with Alex Jones?
[03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:47.600]  And of course, it's a bit of a joke to even suggest that because Alex Jones, he has millions
[03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:48.600]  of listeners.
[03:37:48.600 --> 03:37:50.600]  You guys out there listening, you're sitting there thinking, what are you talking about?
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:51.600]  I never stopped listening.
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:56.360]  I'm not going to listen to Mark Zuckerberg and Susan at Google and Jack Dorsey.
[03:37:56.360 --> 03:37:57.480]  These people can't tell me.
[03:37:57.480 --> 03:38:00.040]  Tim Cook can't tell me what information I will find.
[03:38:00.040 --> 03:38:03.640]  But it's now harder for Alex Jones to reach new people.
[03:38:03.640 --> 03:38:07.200]  It's now harder for more people to understand the importance of finding the Infowar and
[03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:09.080]  that's their real goal.
[03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:11.280]  They want to cut us off.
[03:38:11.280 --> 03:38:16.480]  If you go all the way back to 2015 or 2016 when Matt Drudge appeared on Infowars, this
[03:38:16.480 --> 03:38:18.960]  is precisely what he predicted would happen.
[03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:22.600]  We're going to have digital ghettos is what he said.
[03:38:22.600 --> 03:38:28.600]  You will be herded into a tiny and ever increasing or decreasing, I should say in size, digital
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:33.040]  ghetto and they've now placed Infowars and Alex Jones in the digital ghetto.
[03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:35.480]  You can still find their content if you know how.
[03:38:35.480 --> 03:38:39.160]  If you're plugged in, if you're an Infowarier, you can tell other people.
[03:38:39.160 --> 03:38:44.080]  You can still share their articles, though it will be de-boosted in the Facebook news
[03:38:44.080 --> 03:38:45.360]  feed.
[03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:47.720]  You can still download the app on Android.
[03:38:47.720 --> 03:38:51.320]  Those of us who were lucky enough to get it before it was kicked off can still see it
[03:38:51.320 --> 03:38:55.640]  on iOS, but they're limiting growth.
[03:38:55.640 --> 03:38:57.600]  Nobody wants to wander into the ghetto.
[03:38:57.600 --> 03:39:01.920]  As I talked about at the beginning of the fourth hour, even Joe Rogan, an absolute alpha
[03:39:01.920 --> 03:39:07.960]  male probably was a little bit hesitant to even put a toe in the ghetto because once you
[03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:12.560]  associate with somebody who has been ostracized, who has been put into this little containment
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:15.560]  zone, well then what happens?
[03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:20.120]  And I do have to commend Alex Jones for building InfowarsStore.com, for building Infowars, for
[03:39:20.120 --> 03:39:27.080]  building this massive machine that has taken 20 years to create because it is brilliant.
[03:39:27.080 --> 03:39:29.440]  They've done what everybody thought would never happen.
[03:39:29.440 --> 03:39:30.440]  They tried to kick him off.
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:31.600]  They tried to deperson him.
[03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:33.160]  They went after him with his family.
[03:39:33.160 --> 03:39:34.720]  They went after him with his money.
[03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:36.120]  They went after him with his livelihood.
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:37.280]  They went after him online.
[03:39:37.280 --> 03:39:40.040]  They're going after him in every single dimension that they can.
[03:39:40.040 --> 03:39:45.760]  It's a multi-fronted war against Infowars, and yet still he holds strong.
[03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:47.760]  Still he can do a 50-hour broadcast.
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:49.200]  Still he can do all these wonderful things.
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:55.400]  That's because, unlike me, he's not dependent on the big tech platforms.
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:39:59.640]  And those of us who are to reach people, to have an impact on the world, to move that
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:05.000]  needle an inch in the right direction, and we depend on Facebook and Google and Twitter,
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:07.520]  it's frankly horrifying.
[03:40:07.520 --> 03:40:13.760]  So my hat is off to Alex Jones and Infowars for having their own platform and for not
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:16.320]  using it to totally cave.
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:22.720]  How many times could Alex Jones have probably saved his head over the years, proverbially,
[03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:25.120]  if he would have just thrown Trump under the bus?
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:26.560]  Or if he would have just done this?
[03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:29.360]  Or if he would have just said, fluoride is good?
[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:31.320]  Or if he would have just said any number of things?
[03:40:31.320 --> 03:40:35.200]  I like the Drag Queen's story hour.
[03:40:35.200 --> 03:40:39.360]  If he would just say that today, maybe he could get back on Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[03:40:39.360 --> 03:40:40.360]  Who knows?
[03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:45.600]  Meanwhile, you have Fox News, which is supposed to be the conservative stalwart network.
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:48.640]  It's supposed to be protecting our interests, it's supposed to be giving the other side
[03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:49.640]  of America's opinions.
[03:40:49.640 --> 03:40:56.280]  It's supposed to be something that real, normal people can sit there and watch and enjoy.
[03:40:56.280 --> 03:41:04.120]  And then you have this morning, Maria Bartiromo, however she says her name, had this CNN tier
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:09.680]  interview with President Trump, in which she just repeatedly brings up John McCain.
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:13.680]  President Trump didn't want to mention John McCain, you can clearly tell in the video.
[03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:17.960]  But just over and over and over again, why did you attack John McCain?
[03:41:17.960 --> 03:41:19.720]  Don't you think he's a war hero?
[03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:21.640]  Why do you keep attacking the dead?
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:22.840]  Isn't that disrespectful?
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:23.840]  How dare you?
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:26.280]  Why don't you like John McCain?
[03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:32.240]  It's seriously something that two or three years ago, we would have seen on CNN or MSNBC.
[03:41:32.240 --> 03:41:38.560]  And now it's Fox News, the same network that put Paul Ryan, who is the reason why we didn't
[03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:44.760]  get a big, beautiful border wall much, much sooner, Paul Ryan is now on Fox Corp's board
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:45.760]  of directors.
[03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:51.600]  Because of course, after it split with the Disney acquisition, Fox News is still its
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:55.200]  own independent company under the umbrella of Fox Corp.
[03:41:55.200 --> 03:42:00.880]  Now Paul Ryan's involved, the same network that hired Donna Brazil, who dedicated her
[03:42:00.880 --> 03:42:09.280]  new book shockingly to Seth Rich, who gave Hillary Clinton the debate question so she
[03:42:09.280 --> 03:42:12.680]  could prepare and get an edge on the other Democrats.
[03:42:12.680 --> 03:42:18.080]  How anybody can support Fox News at this point is absolutely beyond me.
[03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:22.920]  When we get back, I want to talk about Sean Hannity sucking up and kissing up to this
[03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:28.840]  disgusting person, Donna Brazil, this unethical person who is so unethical and dishonest,
[03:42:28.840 --> 03:42:31.600]  CNN severed ties with her.
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:33.920]  She's now up at Fox News.
[03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:35.600]  Maybe that's a better home for her at this point.
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:39.920]  Maybe Fox News has been spending years and years and years becoming the quote unquote
[03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:44.680]  conservative network so they can one day turn around and stabb us in the back.
[03:42:44.680 --> 03:42:46.200]  I think that might be where we're going.
[03:42:46.200 --> 03:42:50.320]  So one more time, I want to remind everybody, InfowarsStore.com supports the Infowars.
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:52.160]  We'll be right back in just a minute.
[03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:53.160]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:57.040]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an
[03:42:57.040 --> 03:42:58.040]  alternative.
[03:42:58.040 --> 03:43:01.040]  InfowarsLife has the formula for you.
[03:43:01.040 --> 03:43:05.640]  Ultimate Crill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA and
[03:43:05.640 --> 03:43:10.080]  Omega-3 is found in our high quality, ultra-pure Crill Oil concentrate.
[03:43:10.080 --> 03:43:15.280]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as Azazanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Crill Oil can help you
[03:43:15.280 --> 03:43:20.120]  experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:43:20.120 --> 03:43:24.520]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health,
[03:43:24.520 --> 03:43:29.240]  joint health and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:31.120]  cognitive function and more.
[03:43:31.120 --> 03:43:35.800]  And while other Crill Oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the
[03:43:35.800 --> 03:43:41.000]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality Crill Oil concentrate
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.840]  paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately.
[03:43:43.840 --> 03:43:48.040]  It's time to see what Crill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil now available
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:55.040]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:44:18.040 --> 03:44:23.840]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[03:44:23.840 --> 03:44:28.920]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:34.800]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:40.360]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[03:44:40.360 --> 03:44:43.600]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[03:44:43.600 --> 03:44:49.840]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:44:49.840 --> 03:44:54.080]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:44:54.080 --> 03:44:56.380]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:44:56.380 --> 03:44:58.120]  There is no set stasis.
[03:44:58.120 --> 03:44:59.360]  There is no managed system.
[03:44:59.360 --> 03:45:00.920]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:04.200]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[03:45:04.200 --> 03:45:07.520]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:45:07.520 --> 03:45:10.240]  We won't just be here a hundred years, we'll be here forever, we'll turn the whole thing
[03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:15.080]  around, our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to
[03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:19.360]  look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it, and that's really where
[03:45:19.360 --> 03:45:20.360]  this goes.
[03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:22.280]  Okay, God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:45:22.280 --> 03:45:25.920]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao
[03:45:25.920 --> 03:45:29.280]  Seitang, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:45:29.280 --> 03:45:33.680]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:34.680]  ready to fight.
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:37.280]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:45:37.280 --> 03:45:39.280]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:45:39.280 --> 03:45:42.920]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master belt.
[03:45:42.920 --> 03:45:44.120]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:45:44.120 --> 03:45:48.720]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[03:45:48.720 --> 03:45:51.360]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:45:51.360 --> 03:45:52.480]  I want life.
[03:45:52.480 --> 03:46:03.280]  I want Jesus.
[03:46:03.280 --> 03:46:28.400]  My
[03:46:28.400 --> 03:46:33.800]  workout and beyond system in the world. There's nothing else like it, you must experience
[03:46:33.800 --> 03:46:38.720]  it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit
[03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:43.040]  juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts
[03:46:43.040 --> 03:46:47.520]  10 hours, so take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named
[03:46:47.520 --> 03:46:57.400]  TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive. TurboForce and m4slive.com.
[03:46:57.400 --> 03:47:04.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:04.400 --> 03:47:17.480]  Guess hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. Thank you so much for joining me
[03:47:17.480 --> 03:47:23.320]  for the Save the First Amendment Stop Big Tech Censorship. This has been a tremendous
[03:47:23.320 --> 03:47:26.880]  50-hour broadcast so far. I'm very honored that I could be a part of it. Thank you to
[03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:30.080]  Infowars. Thank you to Alex Jones for inviting me on.
[03:47:30.080 --> 03:47:34.720]  So we've been talking about what a world without Alex Jones, what a world without conservatives
[03:47:34.720 --> 03:47:38.400]  on the Internet, what that might look like. And again, as I said in the last segment,
[03:47:38.400 --> 03:47:42.840]  the number one way you can make sure that doesn't happen is call your representatives, make
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:48.600]  it clear to President Trump that he has to take action, but also support Alex Jones.
[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:54.800]  Support the Infowar, InfowarsStore.com. But I want to continue talking about Fox News
[03:47:54.800 --> 03:48:02.720]  newest darling. They've thrown Judge Jeanine to the wolves and now they've adopted Donna
[03:48:02.720 --> 03:48:08.400]  Brazil, a woman who was kicked off CNN after the WikiLeaks showed that she essentially
[03:48:08.400 --> 03:48:13.040]  colluded with the Hillary Clinton campaign and gave her the debate questions unethically
[03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:18.720]  as she could possibly be. In fact, the one called Jake Tapper, I mean, sorry, not Jake
[03:48:18.720 --> 03:48:23.480]  Tapper, Steltzer, Brian Steltzer over at CNN. Tucker affectionately refers to him as the
[03:48:23.480 --> 03:48:27.920]  eunuch. Alex Jones correctly points out that he could be a brother, cousin, perhaps even
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:33.200]  identical twin to the subway guy, Jared Fogel. Oh, they're putting him on screen right now.
[03:48:33.200 --> 03:48:40.000]  What is with that face? I know I have nothing to brag about, but my God. He correctly pointed
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:47.360]  out that his network severed ties with Donna Brazil when her unethical behavior became
[03:48:47.360 --> 03:48:55.000]  known. Meanwhile, Fox News hires Donna Brazil. So then Donna Brazil appears on Sean Hannity's
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:59.000]  podcast a couple of days or Sean, I wish if you had a podcast, it might be a lot better
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:04.720]  on his TV show a couple of days ago. And it was one of the most disturbing things I've
[03:49:04.720 --> 03:49:08.840]  ever seen on that network. Sean Hannity spent approximately the first three or four minutes
[03:49:08.840 --> 03:49:14.800]  of the segment just kissing up to her and ingratiating himself to her.
[03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:21.040]  One must wonder exactly how much power does this crooked witch have at Fox News? This
[03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:25.840]  is the type of things he said. He said, I've known you for years. We have a very friendly,
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:30.600]  I would say cordial relationship. We've met at a lot of debates. We've met at a lot of
[03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:36.520]  conventions. We always have a good time. And I must ask Sean Hannity, one of these debates
[03:49:36.520 --> 03:49:42.680]  you met at, would that be the debate when Donna Brazil gave Hillary Clinton the questions?
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:48.680]  This is something that puzzles me to know in Hannity hammers and hammers and hammers.
[03:49:48.680 --> 03:49:53.560]  Because this is such a terrible thing. CNN gave the debate questions to crooked Hillary.
[03:49:53.560 --> 03:49:59.080]  How could they do that? That's so unethical. But it wasn't just CNN. It was Donna Brazil.
[03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:03.560]  And this is what again, Brian Stelzer, this is what he pointed out on Twitter. It wasn't
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:08.480]  Brian Stelzer who did that. It was Donna Brazil who did that. And the network fired Donna
[03:50:08.480 --> 03:50:14.520]  Brazil. Now Donna Brazil goes on Hannity's show and everything is happy, happy in hugs
[03:50:14.520 --> 03:50:21.040]  and good times. And we're all friends now. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that progressive?
[03:50:21.040 --> 03:50:25.400]  Which is exactly what Hannity said. He said, well, welcome to the Fox News Channel. And
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:30.360]  for those who say we don't have varying opinions, I could go down the list. And if I do, I'll
[03:50:30.360 --> 03:50:36.720]  probably get in trouble. Pointing out that the network is host to how many anti-Trump
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:42.560]  people. We talked about Shepard Smith, who actually seems to hello the Sean Hannity.
[03:50:42.560 --> 03:50:46.640]  He said, I would never do an opinion show like that. I would never do what Sean Hannity
[03:50:46.640 --> 03:50:50.680]  does. I would quit my job if they asked me to do that. Well, that's all Shepard does,
[03:50:50.680 --> 03:50:55.000]  except he might as well be on MSNBC. He is one of those type of people. He's a leftist.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:59.640]  He can call himself a Republican if he wants. Maybe he's a Mitt Romney Republican. Could
[03:50:59.640 --> 03:51:07.560]  be. But now, Donna Brazil, this opens a entirely new facet. And I know that it's kind of a
[03:51:07.560 --> 03:51:11.200]  third rail subject, so I'm not going to speculate. I'm just going to stick to the facts. But
[03:51:11.200 --> 03:51:17.400]  Donna Brazil, big league politics has an ungood authority. She is a person of interest in
[03:51:17.400 --> 03:51:23.920]  the murder investigation regarding DNC staffer Seth Rich. Now, a lot of people online and
[03:51:23.920 --> 03:51:30.480]  in print and everywhere believe that Seth Rich may have been the source of the leaked emails.
[03:51:30.480 --> 03:51:36.320]  It wasn't a Russian. It wasn't Vladimir Putin. It wasn't the ghost of Stalin. It may have
[03:51:36.320 --> 03:51:42.840]  been this kid who was murdered at four in the morning shot. Nothing was taken from his
[03:51:42.840 --> 03:51:48.320]  person. He wasn't robbed. All of his valuables were left on him. And so this is an article
[03:51:48.320 --> 03:51:53.240]  we have up at big league politics. Fox News, Donna Brazil is person of interest in Seth
[03:51:53.240 --> 03:51:57.120]  Rich murder case, according to investigator. And I don't even want to get too into the
[03:51:57.120 --> 03:52:04.160]  weeds. I just want to point out that in 2016 and 17, Fox News was actually willing to talk
[03:52:04.160 --> 03:52:08.920]  about this mysterious unsolved murder, where the police have just essentially laid it all
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:14.440]  to bed and said, eh, guess we figured out everything we can figure out. Sorry, family.
[03:52:14.440 --> 03:52:22.680]  Sorry, nation of curious people. Our investigation is over. And now, Fox News, of course, they
[03:52:22.680 --> 03:52:28.280]  published articles about it and they had to retract them because legal teams came after
[03:52:28.280 --> 03:52:32.600]  them. How dare you talk about Seth Rich? How dare you discuss what a lot of people think
[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:38.600]  may have been the case? They must be taken down. That was in 2017, I believe. And now
[03:52:38.600 --> 03:52:46.520]  here we are a short two years later and they've hired a woman who says in her book that she
[03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:53.280]  dedicated it to Seth Rich. She dedicated her book to Seth Rich. Why does nobody else think
[03:52:53.280 --> 03:52:59.160]  this is strange but me? She also at one point asked Hillary Clinton if she would be willing
[03:52:59.160 --> 03:53:08.600]  to donate to a fund to find the killer, to fund the investigation. There's also been
[03:53:08.600 --> 03:53:13.480]  PIs who say that they heard from their police contacts that Donna Brazil was calling around
[03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:17.400]  asking questions, saying, why are you asking about Seth Rich? Why do you want to know about
[03:53:17.400 --> 03:53:23.040]  Seth Rich? And so this is the couple excerpts from Brazil's article, from the Big League
[03:53:23.040 --> 03:53:27.280]  Politics article. In Donna Brazil's new book, which again is dedicated to Seth Rich, she
[03:53:27.280 --> 03:53:32.000]  alleges that when she asked Hillary Clinton to contribute to a reward fund to find his
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:38.840]  murderer, the former first lady and failed presidential candidate abruptly ended the
[03:53:38.840 --> 03:53:43.120]  phone call. She said this, her new book is called Hacks, by the way. I guess she would
[03:53:43.120 --> 03:53:48.320]  know what it's like to be a hack. She said, I knew the campaign had over $3 million set
[03:53:48.320 --> 03:53:53.200]  aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don't forget the
[03:53:53.200 --> 03:53:58.760]  murder of Seth Rich, I told her. Did she want to contribute to Seth's reward fund? We still
[03:53:58.760 --> 03:54:04.640]  hadn't found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright young DNC staffer.
[03:54:04.640 --> 03:54:08.840]  According to Brazil, you're right, is what Hillary Clinton said. We're going to get
[03:54:08.840 --> 03:54:14.560]  to that. But then she really had to go. She had made the call and checked it off her list.
[03:54:14.560 --> 03:54:19.480]  And Donna Brazil says, I accept it after we set our goodbyes that I might never hear
[03:54:19.480 --> 03:54:25.280]  from her again. So the article, Big League Politics continues, the Democrat Party has
[03:54:25.280 --> 03:54:30.160]  been doing their best to gaslight anyone who has questions about Seth Rich mysterious
[03:54:30.160 --> 03:54:34.760]  death. Yet in Brazil's book, she explains her own fears after his death and claims that
[03:54:34.760 --> 03:54:39.480]  it still haunts her. Oddly, Brazil, who claims in her book that her theories about why he
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:45.440]  was killed are either that he was murdered for being white or by the Russians. He was
[03:54:45.440 --> 03:54:50.480]  killed by the Russians. Russian agents supporting President Trump killed a DNC staffer apparently.
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:56.000]  Okay. Brazil wrote this, I felt some responsibility for Seth Rich's death. I didn't bring him
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:01.520]  to the DNC, but I helped him keep him there by working on voting rights. With all I knew
[03:55:01.520 --> 03:55:06.040]  about the Russians hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in
[03:55:06.040 --> 03:55:10.760]  his unsolved murder. Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer and I worried
[03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:15.520]  that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town. My friend, Elaine, expressed
[03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:20.680]  doubts about that. And I heard her, the FBI said they did not see any Russian fingerprints
[03:55:20.680 --> 03:55:31.180]  there. This is so fanciful, so insane to me. Fox News has now hired a woman who is a conspiracy
[03:55:31.180 --> 03:55:36.280]  theorist. And I don't mean like an Alex Jones conspiracy theorist, where every single thing
[03:55:36.280 --> 03:55:40.600]  he says is backed up by facts. You can Google every word that comes out of the man's mouth
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:44.360]  and your job will just go lower and lower and lower as you realize he's right about almost
[03:55:44.360 --> 03:55:51.200]  every single thing in the world. This is a conspiracy. The Russians, which stole the
[03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:55.360]  election for President Trump through ways that we will never understand because we're
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:55:59.600]  just not smart enough, I guess. And Mueller's report is going to continue until everybody
[03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:04.560]  watching this broadcast is probably dead and in the ground. But the Russians hacked the
[03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:11.240]  election. They killed Seth Rich. They control the president. And they gave John McCain a
[03:56:11.240 --> 03:56:16.960]  dossier that says President Trump likes gold showers. None of this rings alarm bells to
[03:56:16.960 --> 03:56:21.640]  anybody at Fox News. None of this rings alarm bells that they're bringing on a literal conspiracy
[03:56:21.640 --> 03:56:27.920]  theorist to be one of their paid talking heads. This is the future without info wars. This
[03:56:27.920 --> 03:56:33.760]  is the best people we've got. You've got one or maybe two or maybe three hours on Fox News
[03:56:33.760 --> 03:56:38.520]  that are worth watching a day. You have an alleged sexual predator hosting one of the
[03:56:38.520 --> 03:56:44.320]  shows. You have Donna Brazil popping on throughout the day to give whatever hair brain crazy
[03:56:44.320 --> 03:56:48.800]  wackadoodle ideas she has come into her head like Seth Rich was killed by the Russians
[03:56:48.800 --> 03:56:54.440]  when literally every arm of law enforcement says that's not the case. You have Judge Jeanine
[03:56:54.440 --> 03:56:58.640]  Perot getting yanked off the air for having the audacity to say, hey, maybe Sharia law
[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:03.760]  isn't compatible with the United States. Oh, no, that's Islamophobic. Meanwhile, the network
[03:57:03.760 --> 03:57:10.200]  is essentially letting Ilhan Omar, because of their little Islamophobic mix up. Ilhan
[03:57:10.200 --> 03:57:15.720]  Omar now gets by with whatever she wants. In fact, Omar, the radical anti-Semite, actually
[03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:22.160]  thanked Fox News for censuring Judge Jeanine. It's truly not the network it was six months
[03:57:22.160 --> 03:57:25.800]  ago. It's not the network it was a year ago. There's a lot of speculation that they're
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:29.920]  trying to sell it. They don't want to have to worry about it anymore. It's too big for
[03:57:29.920 --> 03:57:36.680]  one company to have Fox Corp. And maybe that's the idea. Water it down, bring on hack CNN
[03:57:36.680 --> 03:57:41.560]  losers and sell the dang thing. You're watching the Alex Jones show. I'm Tom Pappert. Stay
[03:57:41.560 --> 03:57:43.560]  tuned. We'll be right back.
[03:57:43.560 --> 03:57:48.480]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[03:57:48.480 --> 03:57:53.520]  most of them are funded by the globalist. Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of
[03:57:53.520 --> 03:57:57.560]  the zeitgeist. That's what a globalist are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:57:57.560 --> 03:58:02.320]  I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really
[03:58:02.320 --> 03:58:06.640]  works for humanity. And I'm simply trying to bring it back. And lo and behold, it's
[03:58:06.640 --> 03:58:11.360]  super popular like it's always been. That's what the globalists are trying to shut it
[03:58:11.360 --> 03:58:16.600]  down so desperately, because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills
[03:58:16.600 --> 03:58:21.640]  up my spine. So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and info wars by buying
