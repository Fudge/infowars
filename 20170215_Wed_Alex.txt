[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.600 --> 00:18.400]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.400 --> 00:23.760]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23.760 --> 00:24.760]  Wow.
[00:24.760 --> 00:33.280]  I said it over and over and over again because it was common sense, it wasn't rocket science.
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.080]  People still wanted to celebrate and think everything was A-OK.
[00:36.080 --> 00:43.120]  I made the point that Trump's victory was just the real signal of the civil war in this
[00:43.120 --> 00:49.000]  country to try to restore the republic and pull us out of the global system that is absolute
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.440]  liquid tyranny.
[00:51.440 --> 00:55.840]  Real monopoly, total centralization of control, that is the globalist technocratic model in
[00:55.840 --> 00:57.120]  their own words.
[00:57.120 --> 01:00.160]  And now you're seeing all hell break loose.
[01:00.160 --> 01:08.040]  The FBI ordered all their different agents and minions because Obama ordered them to
[01:08.040 --> 01:15.120]  spy on everything that Trump's appointees in waiting were doing.
[01:15.120 --> 01:20.040]  And it's admitted that this is all normal standard transition stuff that went on, totally
[01:20.040 --> 01:24.760]  normal for the president, vice president and other people like the national security advisor
[01:24.760 --> 01:30.720]  as they are the interim period to be reaching out when the president is president-elect.
[01:30.720 --> 01:36.840]  The media knows this, but they are acting like it's a huge, giant, big deal.
[01:36.840 --> 01:37.840]  Think about it.
[01:37.840 --> 01:41.920]  Hillary met not once, but twice, secretly with Putin when she was at the State Department.
[01:41.920 --> 01:46.920]  While meeting with the Russian head of state secretly, well, quite frankly, the head of
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.840]  the State Department, if it's under the president's directive, can absolutely do that.
[01:51.840 --> 01:56.760]  The point is you can't just sit there then and project on to Trump that why he even wants
[01:56.760 --> 02:01.760]  to have a summit with the Russians, why the president even thinks he can talk to a foreign
[02:01.760 --> 02:04.520]  leader, well, that's never been done before.
[02:04.520 --> 02:09.280]  This is 100% standard and Flynn has done an interview, Daily Caller picked it up as he
[02:09.280 --> 02:13.880]  was outgoing saying, look, I apologize if I didn't remember every total thing when they
[02:13.880 --> 02:17.340]  said we want to talk about sanctions and I said, okay, we'll get it set up, but we didn't
[02:17.340 --> 02:18.580]  talk about sanctions.
[02:18.580 --> 02:24.360]  They said they wanted to talk to the president about sanctions and that's being recorded.
[02:24.360 --> 02:26.760]  That's totally and completely normal to do that.
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.160]  But again, the media, like when he fired the attorney general, the interim attorney general
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.960]  for insubordination, the media was like the Monday night massacre never before as a president
[02:37.960 --> 02:46.720]  done something like this, done, done, done, next Donald Trump breathes air into his lungs.
[02:46.720 --> 02:51.600]  And Michael Moore knows he has more on viewers and more on constituents.
[02:51.600 --> 02:58.760]  Michael Moore calls for Hillary to be installed as president once Trump arrested and that's
[02:58.760 --> 03:05.320]  basically the mouth of the Democratic Party right there, infowars.com, far left filmmaker
[03:05.320 --> 03:06.960]  in deranged Facebook rant.
[03:06.960 --> 03:08.440]  Well, that's his plan.
[03:08.440 --> 03:10.840]  Meanwhile, our Clifford Cunningham has an article about it.
[03:10.840 --> 03:16.880]  Michael Moore claims Trump is a Russian and he's, he tweets in Facebook's, I bet it was
[03:16.880 --> 03:23.160]  Trump told him, talk to the Russians, done, done, done, yes, on December 15th, Flynn made
[03:23.160 --> 03:28.160]  more than 30 phone calls to counterparts and head ambassadors to countries and talk to
[03:28.160 --> 03:33.360]  them like you're supposed to do getting lined up phone calls with the president elect, done,
[03:33.360 --> 03:38.560]  done, and then Trump would release transcripts of his phone calls with the other leaders,
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.520]  the prime ministers and others, done, done, done.
[03:42.520 --> 03:50.480]  Oh my gosh, when have you ever seen a president or a national security advisor on the phone
[03:50.480 --> 03:55.880]  with foreign diplomats talking about making deals?
[03:55.880 --> 04:01.440]  That is the 100% purview of a president, the president because we elected him could sign
[04:01.440 --> 04:10.360]  a treaty with Russia, basically doing anything, but Congress has to ratify it.
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.000]  I mean, that's how Obama did all these things like carbon tax treaties and open border treaties
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.960]  and TPP treaties and Trump got in and said, Congress ever ratified that?
[04:19.960 --> 04:21.880]  I'm shooting that baby down.
[04:21.880 --> 04:25.760]  Obama could meet dozens and dozens of times with foreign leaders in a treaty, Hillary
[04:25.760 --> 04:30.280]  helped secretly write, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and then the public and Congress
[04:30.280 --> 04:31.680]  couldn't even learn about it.
[04:31.680 --> 04:36.360]  There's the president's purview of the executive, you don't even have to know what the president
[04:36.360 --> 04:40.640]  said in all these secret meetings with foreign corporations because that's the executive
[04:40.640 --> 04:41.640]  purview.
[04:41.640 --> 04:45.480]  Okay, Congress, you can't even see it.
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.480]  Remember all that?
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.400]  Meanwhile, Trump goes, yeah, get calls going and talk to the Russians, yes, sir, oh my
[04:50.400 --> 04:55.800]  god, they talked to the Russians, we told you, they were Russian agents, oh, it's hard
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.160]  for them to take over, they're trying to make America great again.
[05:01.160 --> 05:06.640]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[05:06.640 --> 05:10.640]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.880]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[05:15.880 --> 05:21.560]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia
[05:21.560 --> 05:23.680]  hacked the US elections.
[05:23.680 --> 05:27.960]  They're also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is
[05:27.960 --> 05:30.120]  a violation of the Logan Act.
[05:30.120 --> 05:34.800]  But wait a minute, where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[05:34.800 --> 05:40.240]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.480]  meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[05:44.480 --> 05:50.080]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with
[05:50.080 --> 05:53.720]  compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[05:53.720 --> 05:56.720]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.

[07:01.400 --> 07:02.760]  This is Alex Jones.
[07:02.760 --> 07:07.120]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid
[07:07.120 --> 07:11.240]  products of 2017, and seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[07:11.240 --> 07:14.920]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System from our friends at Solutions from
[07:14.920 --> 07:17.160]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[07:17.160 --> 07:21.360]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[07:21.360 --> 07:26.160]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[07:26.160 --> 07:30.600]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[07:30.600 --> 07:31.600]  even airplanes.
[07:31.600 --> 07:35.840]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own
[07:35.840 --> 07:38.840]  private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[07:38.840 --> 07:43.680]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.

[07:59.280 --> 08:03.280]  We've got it, John.
[08:03.280 --> 08:08.680]  That grassman is coming to you.
[08:08.680 --> 08:10.680]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.080]  All right, you are a ghost.
[08:13.080 --> 08:21.080]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[08:21.080 --> 08:28.000]  Undoubtedly, my plate has never been fuller, and the news has never been more important.
[08:28.000 --> 08:36.000]  This country is in the middle of a developing civil war that is economic and political.
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.920]  There is a civil war going on within the intelligence agencies within the federal
[08:42.920 --> 08:47.800]  agencies, within the government in general, within corporations, and within our own neighborhoods
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.800]  and cities and states.
[08:53.800 --> 09:01.480]  All across the world, nationalist movements are all ahead in the polls in every major
[09:01.480 --> 09:04.920]  election to pull out of globalism.
[09:04.920 --> 09:12.600]  Those viceroids have been basically installed or force fed through the media into office,
[09:12.600 --> 09:20.640]  all over the globe, and the public is awakening in explosive fashion to this.
[09:20.640 --> 09:27.120]  The technocrats, the megabanks, the monopoly men are in full panic, but have decided with
[09:27.120 --> 09:38.400]  bravada and hutzpah and arrogance and complete hubris to intensify their operations.
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.400]  Something big happened today, and I'm going to be covering it at the bottom of the hour.
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.640]  It's huge.
[09:46.640 --> 09:50.040]  Remember a few years ago, we covered Jade Helm with the military openly admitted they
[09:50.040 --> 09:54.400]  were training to occupy and dominate, quote, the human domain overseas or here.
[09:54.400 --> 09:55.760]  I'm not against the military.
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.920]  I'm against our military being prepared for martial law while the Democratic Party tried
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.440]  to prepare the civil unrest that would bring in the martial law and then a suspension of
[10:05.440 --> 10:10.800]  our basic rights, a suspension of the free press, all of that since I first warned of
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.800]  Jade Helm two and a half years ago has now basically come to pass.
[10:15.800 --> 10:17.840]  They've admitted they want to censor the press.
[10:17.840 --> 10:20.280]  They admit they want an overthrow of our institutions.
[10:20.280 --> 10:27.880]  They admit they want a socialist, globalist reorganization or reconstruction or martial
[10:27.880 --> 10:35.520]  plan in the West to fully break our will and complete our journey into centralized technocracy,
[10:35.520 --> 10:40.800]  corporate fascism on the top, communism and socialism on the bottom to control us.
[10:40.800 --> 10:43.960]  That is the global model.
[10:43.960 --> 10:51.960]  And now the intercept and now Reuters and now Zero Hedge, why they all have gone and
[10:51.960 --> 10:57.400]  gotten the latest army documents that just got released from planning a year ago where
[10:57.400 --> 11:02.720]  the military's been told prepare to take over every town, every city and the entire culture
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.000]  because the United States is going to collapse.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.320]  Exactly what I told you the plan was precisely.
[11:10.320 --> 11:15.400]  Now the media got so freaked out Intel and globalist operators got upset because we had
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.200]  their plan decoded, reverse engineered, but they came out and said, oh, Jones says they're
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.680]  going to invade in August of 2015 and take over Texas and take your guns.
[11:24.680 --> 11:32.400]  I never said that, but to discredit us, they created the straw man, the straw man to then
[11:32.400 --> 11:35.440]  be able to say, oh, look, Alex said that Texas would be invaded.
[11:35.440 --> 11:37.600]  It never happened.
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.120]  Or Alex hates the military and says they want to kill their own citizens.
[11:42.120 --> 11:44.560]  I had some military people walk with me on the street and they go, Alex, I just really
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.600]  like you, but how dare you say we want to take the guns and kill everybody?
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.120]  And I said, are you not training for gun confiscation?
[11:51.120 --> 11:53.000]  Are you not being ordered these drills and maneuvers?
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.520]  Well, we just like to, you know, the training, well, we'll never follow those illegal orders.
[11:56.520 --> 11:59.880]  Oh, so I am right that you're being trained for that.
[11:59.880 --> 12:03.400]  Some of these were officers saying this to me when I was a colonel on the street.
[12:03.400 --> 12:05.560]  I said, listen, I'm not blaming you for any of this.
[12:05.560 --> 12:06.720]  I'm trying to stop it.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.720]  I'm a citizen.
[12:07.720 --> 12:08.720]  That's what I'm supposed to do.
[12:08.720 --> 12:10.960]  But that's how they spun it as a Psyop.
[12:10.960 --> 12:14.960]  Coming up later in the hour, I'm going to break it down because it's all come out now.
[12:14.960 --> 12:23.480]  Pentagon warns in their own reports of unfavorable dystopian future for world's biggest cities.
[12:23.480 --> 12:28.120]  Now, that's the intercepts angle.
[12:28.120 --> 12:31.880]  But when you read it, it's for total takeover of society to stop that coming soon to sitting
[12:31.880 --> 12:32.880]  near you.
[12:32.880 --> 12:36.920]  The military plans to take over America, that's what it says.
[12:36.920 --> 12:41.680]  I mean, Obama's rural commission said they're going to run, especially the small towns where
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.000]  they believe there's going to be resistors to done confiscation.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.800]  Oh, but that's just in the army videos, the army documents.
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.840]  I'm just the guy document him shot, please, for TV viewers that walked over to the shelf
[12:52.840 --> 12:54.600]  today and pulled this off the shelf.
[12:54.600 --> 13:00.960]  Oh, the Jade Helmfolder and everything we wrote, everything we said, all documented
[13:00.960 --> 13:02.080]  now being admitted.
[13:02.080 --> 13:03.080]  Why?
[13:03.080 --> 13:04.200]  Because we had it from leaks.
[13:04.200 --> 13:08.160]  We had it from pieces of documents, and we had it from our deep research.
[13:08.160 --> 13:14.640]  And now it's exactly what we said.
[13:14.640 --> 13:15.640]  The New York Times spun it.
[13:15.640 --> 13:21.200]  Oh, Jones said they were going to take over, but it didn't happen.
[13:21.200 --> 13:22.720]  See how they do it.
[13:22.720 --> 13:29.080]  And now a few years later, oh, Pentagon training videos, open admission.
[13:29.080 --> 13:30.080]  Society's going to collapse.
[13:30.080 --> 13:33.280]  The military is going to be in every town and city to make sure it doesn't.
[13:33.280 --> 13:36.160]  Now, if we had a real collapse or something, that'd be fine.
[13:36.160 --> 13:42.840]  The issue is it's being engineered to then bring in the military to the citizen's trust,
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.880]  to then establish the tyranny, and then the bureaucrats come behind them.
[13:47.880 --> 13:50.440]  That's how it always worked.
[13:50.440 --> 13:53.880]  When the communists took over Russia in 1917, took them two years to just get Moscow under
[13:53.880 --> 13:54.880]  full control.
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.200]  Then they ordered the military to go out and to have the local provincial leaders hand
[13:59.200 --> 14:03.760]  in their firearms and announce that they would serve under the Bolshevik Communist
[14:03.760 --> 14:04.760]  System.
[14:04.760 --> 14:07.400]  And because it was the military, everybody knew, and there was a lot of them or their
[14:07.400 --> 14:08.400]  families.
[14:08.400 --> 14:09.400]  They said, absolutely.
[14:09.400 --> 14:10.400]  They turned their guns in.
[14:10.400 --> 14:11.400]  The military went back.
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.760]  Tens of thousands of officers, more than 20,000 in one year, were all arrested, tortured,
[14:15.760 --> 14:16.760]  and executed.
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.720]  Now the Bolsheviks came back with the weapons, and the reign of terror began.
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.520]  This is a program, you have to understand, that the same big banks in New York and London
[14:28.520 --> 14:30.920]  ran that whole operation in Russia.
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.760]  That's a historical fact.
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.800]  That was even in the public affairs, Washington Post piece, about how the Kremlin is starting
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.880]  to worry about Trump, and it said in there, well, I bet Germany wishes it wouldn't let
[14:46.880 --> 14:50.800]  the Bolsheviks come through Germany into Russia, because when they overthrew that, the Bolsheviks
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.800]  tried to overthrow them, and this revolution is going to overthrow everything.
[14:54.800 --> 14:59.280]  So Trump's not a Bolshevik, he's a patriot, but we all need to stop him because this contagion
[14:59.280 --> 15:00.280]  is too dangerous.
[15:00.280 --> 15:04.440]  Wow, sophisticated, and what they're really saying is, we'll back off and pull our shadow
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.240]  armies out, our Soros operatives out, Russia, if you help us burn Trump, because he's a
[15:10.240 --> 15:14.440]  threat to us all.
[15:14.440 --> 15:20.000]  So the same globalist grandchildren, the grandchildren of the people that did this to Russia and
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.360]  Germany and other places are now set to carve this country up like a big old Christmas hog.
[15:26.360 --> 15:30.840]  And it's up to all of us to be smart and understand what's happening, but here it is, in all the
[15:30.840 --> 15:38.200]  big super-respected journals of the intercept, Greenwald, oh, the Guardian, all of them,
[15:38.200 --> 15:42.520]  but I mean, back at the time, it's like Obama Science Commission, rural affairs with a Pentagon
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.000]  over all the small towns, then I went and looked at the actual manuals, and then they
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.680]  leaked some of them, and the Pentagon said, yeah, those are real manuals that Alex Jones
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.960]  has, where it was talking about rounding us up with social security numbers and processing
[15:53.960 --> 15:57.560]  the men into one area and the kids into another and the women another and taking the troublemakers
[15:57.560 --> 16:03.760]  to re-education camps, and it used the term re-education camp, which is a Soviet term.
[16:03.760 --> 16:08.560]  And then the media said, Jones says we'll be in re-education camps this summer.
[16:08.560 --> 16:09.560]  I said, no, I didn't.
[16:09.560 --> 16:10.560]  No, I didn't.
[16:10.560 --> 16:14.160]  I said, here, see, that's, and you watch, they'll do it again today, probably.
[16:14.160 --> 16:16.560]  Jones says that we'll be under martial law.
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.280]  Well, actually, if Michael Moore has his way, we're about to be, oh, see how we're maneuvered
[16:20.280 --> 16:21.280]  into that.
[16:21.280 --> 16:25.760]  I've been warning the whole time to the military and the police and people, understand and
[16:25.760 --> 16:28.120]  are decompartmentalized to see the big picture.
[16:28.120 --> 16:29.920]  And yes, I know what I'm talking about.
[16:29.920 --> 16:36.760]  And yes, I don't just have my own research, I'll leave it at that.
[16:36.760 --> 16:42.040]  And a lot of good people in our government made the decision that they did not want to
[16:42.040 --> 16:47.080]  be part of completely destroying this country and then literally ending the free press as
[16:47.080 --> 16:50.880]  we know it and bringing in the long, dark night of tyranny.
[16:50.880 --> 16:55.200]  But that's where this country is, and that's why they had planned to get Hillary Clinton
[16:55.200 --> 16:56.200]  into power.
[16:56.200 --> 17:00.440]  They already put out a book that came out in January, already written in a year ago,
[17:00.440 --> 17:05.880]  about global government under Bill and Melinda Gates, led by Hillary Clinton, and you guessed
[17:05.880 --> 17:11.240]  it, Bill and Melinda Gates, for a world government to quote, promise free healthcare.
[17:11.240 --> 17:12.240]  That's right.
[17:12.240 --> 17:16.720]  World government's going to give you the promise of free Bill and Melinda Gates vaccines, always
[17:16.720 --> 17:17.720]  completely tainted.
[17:17.720 --> 17:20.520]  Here it is, governing global health.
[17:20.520 --> 17:24.840]  And the news is asking today, weeks after we covered it, why is no one covering this
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.040]  book about global government?
[17:28.040 --> 17:31.800]  Because they admit it failed.
[17:31.800 --> 17:35.400]  And now the whole plan to have Hillary and Oprah Winfrey and the Bill and Melinda Gates
[17:35.400 --> 17:42.880]  Foundation lead a worldwide plan for sterilization, force inoculation, you name it.
[17:42.880 --> 17:47.120]  But oh, we're not a military, even though we have guns, we're here to help, we're the
[17:47.120 --> 17:48.640]  new global health core.
[17:48.640 --> 17:51.280]  Oh, isn't that sweet?
[17:51.280 --> 17:54.120]  Tyranny coming to skies as doctors.
[17:54.120 --> 17:56.640]  Nobody's talking about Chelsea Clinton's new book, including Chelsea Clinton.
[17:56.640 --> 17:59.680]  The Heat Street asked, why is that?
[17:59.680 --> 18:01.400]  Because we blew their operation.
[18:01.400 --> 18:02.640]  And that's the good news.
[18:02.640 --> 18:08.280]  Trump has put them in such disarray and exposed them and derailed programs that are already
[18:08.280 --> 18:14.960]  in so much trouble that he's already a fabulous, giant, hero, and it's historic.
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.400]  And there's a lot of paradoxes in this because Goldman Sachs put every bit of money they
[18:19.400 --> 18:23.560]  had against him, but now their stocks at all time highs, just like a bunch of other stocks
[18:23.560 --> 18:29.480]  are, because so much prosperity is now seen and so many opportunities.
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.720]  But they wanted to manage economy where they made less money, but other people had less,
[18:33.720 --> 18:34.960]  so theirs was worth more.
[18:34.960 --> 18:35.960]  See, they want a monopoly.
[18:35.960 --> 18:39.080]  They don't want everybody to have a rising tide.
[18:39.080 --> 18:44.600]  So they're still working against him, even though the policies he's brought in created
[18:44.600 --> 18:48.960]  such a bump in the stock market that their ship got risen the most because they're already
[18:48.960 --> 18:52.560]  gaming it with high frequency trading and already skimming off the top.
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.400]  So the little guys all got something, but the big fat cat got even more, but it's all
[18:56.400 --> 19:00.560]  up there pissed with hundreds of billions of dollars they just made in the last few
[19:00.560 --> 19:01.560]  months.
[19:01.560 --> 19:06.280]  That's admitted Associated Press still gunning for Trump because see, they don't want you
[19:06.280 --> 19:13.240]  to have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of and let's keep this break.
[19:13.240 --> 19:15.880]  And they're all announcing they don't care.
[19:15.880 --> 19:18.400]  The federal agencies are in total revolt.
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.840]  The FCC, the State Department, they say we're still going to shut down the new press.
[19:22.840 --> 19:26.160]  Trump's Twitter has been hijacked where they only let negative comments at the top so he
[19:26.160 --> 19:30.760]  can't even see them and can't see your communication to him because he'll retweet it or he'll read
[19:30.760 --> 19:31.880]  and see what you said.
[19:31.880 --> 19:32.880]  They know he's looking at Twitter.
[19:32.880 --> 19:34.880]  I mean, they've got him so isolated, folks.
[19:34.880 --> 19:36.600]  It's not even a news item.
[19:36.600 --> 19:38.560]  I even run a little news operation.
[19:38.560 --> 19:39.560]  I can't get any of the crew.
[19:39.560 --> 19:42.920]  You know, they're aware of their great people to like make it a focus that the president's
[19:42.920 --> 19:45.960]  Twitter is being censored.
[19:45.960 --> 19:49.400]  There's a Trump Netanyahu press conference going on right now and I'm just not going
[19:49.400 --> 19:54.440]  to go to that because we know that he's pro-Israel and we know that that just means that we're
[19:54.440 --> 19:57.960]  not going to like the WikiLeaks showed with Soros overthrow Israel.
[19:57.960 --> 20:01.000]  So that's a good thing because Israel's got nuclear weapons that could cause World War
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.360]  III, but we'll play parts of that later.
[20:07.360 --> 20:09.680]  Let me just read you some of these headlines, okay?
[20:09.680 --> 20:12.160]  Because, as I said, later in the hour, our artists are getting into it.
[20:12.160 --> 20:15.600]  I'm going to get into Pentagon openly and make a plan to take over the United States.
[20:15.600 --> 20:16.840]  That doesn't mean they're coming next week.
[20:16.840 --> 20:17.840]  It doesn't mean they're bad.
[20:17.840 --> 20:19.320]  It doesn't mean they're going to slow our throats.
[20:19.320 --> 20:23.880]  They've been ordered to get ready for collapse as the good guys while the globalists create
[20:23.880 --> 20:24.880]  the collapse.
[20:24.880 --> 20:25.880]  You understand?
[20:25.880 --> 20:30.160]  Then once the military's come in and once that's been normalized, then all the spooks
[20:30.160 --> 20:34.800]  and all the control and all the rest of the garbage happens and I'm not stupid.
[20:34.800 --> 20:38.400]  I know why the military the last three years has been reaching out and wanting to come
[20:38.400 --> 20:41.600]  on and, oh, we're just patriots that just happened to show up where you're at.
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.760]  And I tell people, I know you've been encouraged to come and be friends with the show and I
[20:46.760 --> 20:47.760]  understand you are a friend.
[20:47.760 --> 20:48.760]  That's why you were chosen.
[20:48.760 --> 20:53.000]  And I don't mind having you guys, you know, close here with your CIA orders, but let's
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.000]  just be clear.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.800]  It's so I can tell you what's going on, not because I don't know what's going on.
[20:57.800 --> 21:02.520]  And it's happening because they had a press conference three years ago.
[21:02.520 --> 21:03.520]  We covered it.
[21:03.520 --> 21:07.560]  I'm going to get into that at the Pentagon saying we promised to stop lying.
[21:07.560 --> 21:08.680]  The public doesn't trust us.
[21:08.680 --> 21:12.440]  We've been ordered to lie, but we're going to stop now, but we are going to go and infiltrate.
[21:12.440 --> 21:17.320]  I mean, move into every local town, every media outlet to help work with America to stabilize
[21:17.320 --> 21:18.320]  it.
[21:18.320 --> 21:22.000]  And these guys all believe that side of their mission while the whole sorrow side is to
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.080]  undermine it and bring it all down.
[21:24.080 --> 21:28.920]  So it's a sophisticated situation, but don't think I don't see the whole thing.
[21:28.920 --> 21:34.480]  Okay, let's continue.
[21:34.480 --> 21:38.120]  Don't think I don't know that I have to worry about the globalist and Soros, but also have
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.840]  to worry about the RNC and the Republicans that know that info wars push Trump over the
[21:42.840 --> 21:47.040]  edge with populism here and that we're a powerful engine of resistance.
[21:47.040 --> 21:51.760]  So the main threat to my life is the Republican leadership.
[21:51.760 --> 21:57.160]  It's like Trump says at this time, there's going to use left cover with all the comedians
[21:57.160 --> 22:01.440]  and more and the rest of them saying kill Trump, kill Trump and organizing and organizing
[22:01.440 --> 22:03.240]  the overthrow.
[22:03.240 --> 22:07.360]  That's how crazy this whole situation is and how close to the edge we are.
[22:07.360 --> 22:11.240]  So if you don't want tax cuts, you don't want to secure our borders, you don't want to bring
[22:11.240 --> 22:14.440]  back a trillion dollars that's been in big mega banks.
[22:14.440 --> 22:15.440]  They won't bring in.
[22:15.440 --> 22:18.880]  If you don't want to kill NAFTA and get all these scams and one side of trade deals and
[22:18.880 --> 22:21.520]  if you want to have a weak military and you want to be pathetic and you want to have
[22:21.520 --> 22:24.280]  folks running the government that are absolutely out to get you and your family and dominate
[22:24.280 --> 22:26.320]  you and you don't want prosperity.
[22:26.320 --> 22:31.040]  If you want monopolies, then everybody who ever you're liberal or conservative, go ahead
[22:31.040 --> 22:35.440]  and get on board with that scumbag lunatic Michael Moore and Nancy Pelosi and the rest
[22:35.440 --> 22:42.000]  of them and all the media tarts that say they want to open the borders to radical Islam,
[22:42.000 --> 22:50.080]  but they don't ever want to go to Somalia and get gang raped or sold on a slave block.
[22:50.080 --> 22:55.720]  Michael Moore calls for Hillary to be installed, told you that was coming, oh, the conspiracy
[22:55.720 --> 22:59.360]  theorist is right again, not a conspiracy theorist, I'm on target.
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.720]  Michael Moore calls for Hillary to be installed as president once Trump arrested, told you
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.760]  they beat that drum months ago, I laid it all out and I said, if Trump ever bolts and
[23:08.760 --> 23:13.000]  ever cuts one of his people thinking they'll give him a sacrificial lamb, there'll be blood
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.720]  in the water and they'll sell everybody's a Russian and everybody's got to be arrested.
[23:16.720 --> 23:20.600]  We got to take over the media and shut down the free press because the Russians are everywhere
[23:20.600 --> 23:25.600]  and now in the Netherlands, Walders is in the lead and so they're saying he must be
[23:25.600 --> 23:28.840]  Russian, the nationalists for 20 years over there and the same thing with LePage, he's
[23:28.840 --> 23:32.880]  in the lead, the Muslims are burning cities down everywhere, they won't even call it Muslims,
[23:32.880 --> 23:38.680]  they say anti-police riots.
[23:38.680 --> 23:44.800]  So everywhere it's the Russians, the Italians want sovereignty, it's the Russians, the magical,
[23:44.800 --> 23:50.000]  you know, you don't find a leprechaun at the end of a rainbow and a pot of gold, you find
[23:50.000 --> 23:58.080]  the Russians, political solid gold, unstoppable, invincible, impenetrable, the Russians, ladies
[23:58.080 --> 24:03.040]  and gentlemen, cooked my eggs this morning, they cooked my bacon and it's embarrassing
[24:03.040 --> 24:09.200]  to say they held up my boots on, they helped me clean my nose and brush my teeth and wash
[24:09.200 --> 24:14.280]  my butt, I'm just going to be honest at this point, I have an American flag behind me because
[24:14.280 --> 24:16.680]  I'm actually a risky, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:16.680 --> 24:22.160]  Now let's continue here, Michael Moore, an admitted globalist agent, calls for Hillary
[24:22.160 --> 24:26.840]  to be installed as president once Trump arrested.
[24:26.840 --> 24:32.960]  Infowars.com, far left filmmaker in deranged Facebook rent.
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.640]  He goes on to say Flynn was told to talk to the Russians because he knows his viewers
[24:39.640 --> 24:46.080]  are complete idiots and they're like, the president, man, the national security advisor,
[24:46.080 --> 24:47.760]  talk to the Russians.
[24:47.760 --> 24:52.720]  Remember, Hillary went and negotiated TPP in secret, helped write it, gave speeches,
[24:52.720 --> 24:57.320]  wouldn't let Congress see it, and they said it's the executive purview of the president.
[24:57.320 --> 25:01.240]  The president could go meet with the Chinese president, the Russian president, if he could
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.400]  politically survive the heat, but under the law, for a week behind closed doors if they
[25:06.400 --> 25:07.400]  wanted to.
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.600]  Now you elect a head of state, but you can't even trust that commander in chief now, he's
[25:12.600 --> 25:13.600]  a Russian.
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.240]  There's the headline right here, Michael Moore claims Trump a Russian, well, if he is, we
[25:18.240 --> 25:19.240]  need more like him.
[25:19.240 --> 25:22.960]  Thank God the Russians want to make America right again.
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.800]  Now you think about that, now let me tell you what Trump needs to do right now.
[25:28.800 --> 25:32.800]  Trump's saying, hey, we need to arrest these leakers, what they did was illegal, what Flynn
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.440]  did wasn't illegal, but I'm getting rid of them for not remembering everything.
[25:36.440 --> 25:39.800]  Let me tell you, this is illegal, how we're being spied on and how it's being given to
[25:39.800 --> 25:44.040]  the media, and that's a felony, and Congress admits that.
[25:44.040 --> 25:46.280]  That's not strong enough, bro.
[25:46.280 --> 25:49.760]  We're putting on a report today that has all the mainstream articles, what were the Chinese
[25:49.760 --> 25:54.600]  government, the Saudi Arabians, the Pope, everybody, was there saying they were giving
[25:54.600 --> 26:00.280]  money to Hillary, they were against Hillary, I mean, against Trump, they were trying to
[26:00.280 --> 26:05.000]  prop her up, they were doing all this garbage a hundred times what the Russians could ever
[26:05.000 --> 26:12.400]  do and Saudi princes were bragging that they gave money, 20% to Hillary.
[26:12.400 --> 26:14.040]  Where is Trump on this?
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.880]  Where is Trump saying you Democrats are crazy?
[26:18.880 --> 26:21.240]  This is completely out of control.
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.120]  The leakers who exposed General Flynn, ladies and gentlemen, even left his publications
[26:25.120 --> 26:32.640]  are having to admit absolutely committed felony crimes, but now they're saying Flynn may
[26:32.640 --> 26:38.200]  face felony charges for lying to the FBI, because the FBI came to him, they were already
[26:38.200 --> 26:43.880]  recording him, had accessed the NSA, they said, you talk about sanctions, no, we talked
[26:43.880 --> 26:47.920]  about setting up a meeting with the president over the phone, but the Russians mentioned
[26:47.920 --> 26:53.120]  we want to talk about this on the agenda, and Flynn said I can't talk about that, but
[26:53.120 --> 26:56.160]  I'm sure the president wants a clean slate so that can be discussed.
[26:56.160 --> 26:59.440]  So technically he did, technically he didn't.
[26:59.440 --> 27:02.280]  Trump's commenting on Flynn leaks now, let's back this up, it's live right now, let's go
[27:02.280 --> 27:05.720]  to it, here it is.
[27:05.720 --> 27:10.560]  Michael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man, I think he's been treated very, very
[27:10.560 --> 27:18.880]  unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media in many cases, and I think it's really
[27:18.880 --> 27:21.600]  a sad thing that he was treated so badly.
[27:21.600 --> 27:30.360]  I think in addition to that, from intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,
[27:30.360 --> 27:36.760]  it's criminal action, criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time before me, but
[27:36.760 --> 27:44.560]  now it's really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats
[27:44.560 --> 27:47.320]  had under Hillary Clinton.
[27:47.320 --> 27:52.640]  I think it's very, very unfair what's happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated,
[27:52.640 --> 28:00.640]  the documents and papers that were illegally, I stress that, illegally leaked, very, very
[28:00.640 --> 28:01.640]  unfair.
[28:01.640 --> 28:05.960]  As far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit,
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.480]  we'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made, I think a deal will
[28:10.480 --> 28:15.360]  be made, I know that every president would like to, most of them have not started until
[28:15.360 --> 28:21.360]  late because they never thought it was possible, and it wasn't possible because they didn't
[28:21.360 --> 28:28.680]  do it, but Beebe and I have known each other a long time, a smart man, great negotiator,
[28:28.680 --> 28:31.880]  and I think we're going to make a deal, it might be a bigger and better deal than people
[28:31.880 --> 28:41.240]  in this room even understand, that's a possibility, so let's see what we do, that's right, doesn't
[28:41.240 --> 28:47.520]  sound too optimistic, but that's a good negotiator, that's the art of the deal, I also want to
[28:47.520 --> 28:53.520]  thank, I also want to thank Sarah, could you please stand up, you're so lovely and you've
[28:53.520 --> 29:00.040]  been so nice to Milani, I appreciate it very much.
[29:00.040 --> 29:04.920]  All about family to Trump, okay, this is, let's back this up, or was that from the start
[29:04.920 --> 29:05.920]  of the phlegm comment?
[29:05.920 --> 29:12.280]  Okay, so we caught up at the start, okay, good job guys, talk about, talk about on target,
[29:12.280 --> 29:14.360]  let's go back to the press conference as we go out to break.
[29:14.360 --> 29:19.840]  Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up
[29:19.840 --> 29:25.800]  of the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration, and will
[29:25.800 --> 29:30.560]  you be willing to hear different ideas from the prime ministers, as some of his partners
[29:30.560 --> 29:34.240]  are asking him to do, for example, an excitation of parts of the West Bank?
[29:34.240 --> 29:37.680]  Alright folks, we can pause it here and come back with the answer, but I'm going to get
[29:37.680 --> 29:40.800]  into the really big picture and write down exactly what's going on, there's a war to
[29:40.800 --> 29:44.320]  bring down Trump, you already know it, it's declared, I know how to stop it, we can stop
[29:44.320 --> 29:49.480]  it, Trump must go on the offensive big time, we're going to supply the ammo, stay with
[29:49.480 --> 29:50.480]  us.
[29:50.480 --> 30:01.040]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.040 --> 30:05.560]  We have the new product at m4slife.com, Biotru Selenium.
[30:05.560 --> 30:10.320]  We've had so many requests over the years for Selenium, and just recently we were able
[30:10.320 --> 30:16.320]  to source a certified organic bioavailable Selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[30:16.320 --> 30:21.160]  When you take Selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[30:21.160 --> 30:25.120]  body, it helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[30:25.120 --> 30:28.840]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[30:28.840 --> 30:32.800]  The highest concentration of Selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[30:32.800 --> 30:38.680]  all over the body, as a matter of fact there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent
[30:38.680 --> 30:45.200]  upon Selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[30:45.200 --> 30:51.200]  I'm taking it now, every day, this is so key, Biotru Selenium is the product, the best Selenium
[30:51.200 --> 30:52.200]  that we could bring you.
[30:52.200 --> 30:56.840]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price, exclusively available at m4slife.com
[30:56.840 --> 31:01.960]  or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[31:01.960 --> 31:02.960]  This is Dan Pilla.
[31:02.960 --> 31:04.520]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?

[32:00.720 --> 32:05.120]  What if Extendivite really works, but you find that hard to believe and you spend precious
[32:05.120 --> 32:08.560]  time looking for someone to say, just try it.
[32:08.560 --> 32:13.360]  I have my help today because of Extendivite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and

[32:25.640 --> 32:26.640]  for you.
[32:26.640 --> 32:31.360]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Extendivite working for you and
[32:31.360 --> 32:33.280]  will want to take another bottle.
[32:33.280 --> 32:36.720]  Life is too short, get your Extendivite today.

[33:11.720 --> 33:26.560]  It's time to escape from the New World Order.
[33:26.560 --> 33:31.440]  I'm going to get into Jade Helm here in about 10 minutes and I'm going to play a little
[33:31.440 --> 33:35.680]  piece we put together years ago just showing how the government is arming against the people
[33:35.680 --> 33:39.520]  training to take on gun owners, veterans, patriots.
[33:39.520 --> 33:43.880]  That's all the funding was for that, Trump ended with an executive order, the Extremism
[33:43.880 --> 33:47.280]  Project for anybody but radical Islam.
[33:47.280 --> 33:50.480]  He said no longer is this for the militias and the gun owners and the veterans and the
[33:50.480 --> 33:55.000]  Christians claiming they're the big threat in America, it's radical Islam, 100% of the
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.960]  extremist program in the federal government will now be targeting them.
[33:59.960 --> 34:02.040]  That was two weeks ago.
[34:02.040 --> 34:05.120]  Another one of the incredible things Trump's done, I'm always trying to list all the good
[34:05.120 --> 34:10.200]  things he's done just being in, what is it, three and a half weeks now or a month, it's
[34:10.200 --> 34:16.280]  just amazing, it really is that incredible and that's why the power structure is doing
[34:16.280 --> 34:19.840]  everything it can to stop him.
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.240]  So again, every time we expose that the military is training for collapse, the media says,
[34:24.240 --> 34:28.040]  oh you hate the military, oh you made it up and they never mentioned that we're showing
[34:28.040 --> 34:33.440]  you army.mil documents, declassified documents, leaked documents, you name it.
[34:33.440 --> 34:37.880]  But now that Trump's in, they've released a bunch of stuff that Obama was doing the
[34:37.880 --> 34:44.320]  last year and a half and it is really, really, really bad news, super bad news.
[34:44.320 --> 34:48.360]  And it's in the intercept and it's in other mainstream news because it's just documents
[34:48.360 --> 34:56.200]  they're linked to saying they're preparing for total collapse and believe that it is
[34:56.200 --> 35:02.080]  going to take place and that it is going to happen.
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.560]  We're not saying that and again, the globalists are bringing in policies for civil unrest
[35:06.560 --> 35:10.200]  and financial collapse, they were hoping to do it once Hillary got in and use the global
[35:10.200 --> 35:13.840]  crises and global health crises to bring in world government.
[35:13.840 --> 35:16.840]  Chelsea even wrote a book intending that her mother would win that she's not promoting
[35:16.840 --> 35:20.720]  now about how she would lead a global health initiative with the Bill and Melinda Gates
[35:20.720 --> 35:24.240]  Foundation to force all this tyranny on us.
[35:24.240 --> 35:30.160]  I told you about the book a few weeks ago, now it's in the news that she failed in her
[35:30.160 --> 35:32.960]  world government plan.
[35:32.960 --> 35:36.920]  The book's called Governing Global Health.
[35:36.920 --> 35:40.520]  So that's how big these stakes are.
[35:40.520 --> 35:43.840]  And some people, you know, send me articles, they go, well, look, Goldman Sachs stocks
[35:43.840 --> 35:49.520]  up 30-something percent this year since Trump got in and, you know, you say they're against
[35:49.520 --> 35:50.520]  him.
[35:50.520 --> 35:54.520]  Well, the whole stock market's up, two plus trillion dollars.
[35:54.520 --> 35:57.960]  They've made a couple hundred billion of that because they pretty much run Wall Street,
[35:57.960 --> 36:02.040]  but now little firms are making money and Trump's trying to get the Federal Reserve
[36:02.040 --> 36:06.560]  to make loans at almost zero percent interest to small businesses and Yellen's in the news.
[36:06.560 --> 36:08.920]  He's about to, you'll get rid of her the next week.
[36:08.920 --> 36:11.880]  That's why they're so pissed saying it's not wise to not raise interest rates.
[36:11.880 --> 36:13.200]  We need to raise them more.
[36:13.200 --> 36:17.360]  Oh, you wanted it at zero when the big banks were hoarding all the money for themselves
[36:17.360 --> 36:20.320]  and using it and then loaning it out at loan sharking rates.
[36:20.320 --> 36:22.000]  No, no, no cupcake.
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.360]  They're just going to send it out at zero percent interest or close to it.
[36:28.360 --> 36:33.520]  So again, Trump is so good for business that they are exploding and their stockholders are
[36:33.520 --> 36:35.920]  getting even richer, but that's not what they want.
[36:35.920 --> 36:38.520]  They want you in 200 square foot coffin apartments.
[36:38.520 --> 36:40.160]  They want you so poor they run your life.
[36:40.160 --> 36:42.440]  They do not want you to have the wealth.
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.520]  That's real wealth is when everybody else is poor and you've got the only wealth.
[36:46.520 --> 36:50.240]  That's the greatest form of wicked centralized wealth there is.
[36:50.240 --> 36:53.880]  It's evil wealth, monopoly wealth.
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.160]  Christ beat the money changers because they were priests who were really about money and
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.200]  they made you buy the sacrifice, whatever you're going to have sacrifice at the temple
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.080]  with a certain coin that was rare that only they controlled and they make you pay five,
[37:07.080 --> 37:11.600]  10 times what the coin was worth of silver to exchange it.
[37:11.600 --> 37:12.600]  It was money changing.
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.680]  It was money manipulation to be able to go in and have your sacrifice to God and he went
[37:17.680 --> 37:23.720]  in with a whip and overturned the tables and beat them can read the different versions
[37:23.720 --> 37:24.720]  of the gospel.
[37:24.720 --> 37:25.720]  They're all the same.
[37:25.720 --> 37:27.040]  He beat them up.
[37:27.040 --> 37:30.200]  He physically attacked them and kicked a bunch of their butts.
[37:30.200 --> 37:32.720]  Don't you know Christ could fight if you wanted to?
[37:32.720 --> 37:39.440]  He said, this is where I reserve physical attacks is for people that pull crap like this.
[37:39.440 --> 37:40.600]  You get all the money.
[37:40.600 --> 37:41.600]  Nobody else does.
[37:41.600 --> 37:42.600]  You get all the wealth.
[37:42.600 --> 37:43.600]  Nobody else does.
[37:43.600 --> 37:47.240]  And then you sit up there and play class envy and go, see that person making $250,000
[37:47.240 --> 37:48.240]  a year.
[37:48.240 --> 37:49.240]  They're in the 1%.
[37:49.240 --> 37:50.240]  Yeah.
[37:50.240 --> 37:53.280]  If you make a quarter million dollars a year here in the 1% folks, they say 1% has like
[37:53.280 --> 37:54.280]  60, 70% of the wealth.
[37:54.280 --> 37:58.560]  But now you look at it, some metrics that metrics are 80%.
[37:58.560 --> 37:59.560]  We've done the math.
[37:59.560 --> 38:00.560]  It's 11 zeros.
[38:00.560 --> 38:04.560]  And then what four to put it on how you do the equation.
[38:04.560 --> 38:10.320]  Yeah, there's less than 20 people in the world that have more than half the wealth.
[38:10.320 --> 38:11.320]  That's right.
[38:11.320 --> 38:15.000]  But all this 1% what those are the people that have a house in a pool.
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.200]  So you've got an entry level job to come clean the pool or so you can own a company that
[38:18.200 --> 38:24.120]  does clean pools or so you can have a company that cuts the grass or have a salon or have
[38:24.120 --> 38:25.120]  a restaurant.
[38:25.120 --> 38:26.280]  That's called an economy.
[38:26.280 --> 38:34.360]  You want a big, rich middle class, but no, we've got to raise taxes on the 1% because
[38:34.360 --> 38:37.000]  the globalist are offshore and tax exempt.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  They love it.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.240]  They want to get rid of the middle class and don't worry.
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.880]  30 plus percent of the middle class is gone in just the last 40 years and it's going away
[38:44.880 --> 38:45.880]  even faster.
[38:45.880 --> 38:47.880]  So don't worry.
[38:47.880 --> 38:53.800]  They'll probably have their way and bankrupt everybody except themselves.
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.560]  And I just love the middle midgets out there that he's got three members of Goldman Sachs
[38:58.560 --> 38:59.560]  in his deal.
[38:59.560 --> 39:00.560]  Absolutely.
[39:00.560 --> 39:02.800]  All of them fought after him, Gatt and globalism.
[39:02.800 --> 39:06.560]  All of them have fought against this whole operation and all of them have pointed out
[39:06.560 --> 39:09.680]  that zero money came from Goldman Sachs to Trump.
[39:09.680 --> 39:15.280]  It all went to Hitler because she was the one that was supposed to win and they did
[39:15.280 --> 39:16.280]  steal five states.
[39:16.280 --> 39:20.840]  They tried to steal six others, but the landslide was so big that all their fake polls and all
[39:20.840 --> 39:31.000]  their bull couldn't put their fraud back together again.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.840]  Remember I said, first it'll be, oh, we just want to see if the Russians were involved
[39:33.840 --> 39:36.920]  and oh, then the Russians were involved and oh, the American people didn't vote for Trump.
[39:36.920 --> 39:37.920]  It was the Russians.
[39:37.920 --> 39:41.000]  Oh, did you talk to the Russians during the campaign?
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.160]  Oh, did you talk to them during transition, which they admits all normal, then they call
[39:45.160 --> 39:48.960]  it espionage and call for everyone's arrest.
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.280]  And suddenly you see all the big neocon and rhino Republicans get up on Fox News all sticking
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.040]  their chest out going, Mr. Trump needs to come for us.
[39:57.040 --> 39:58.840]  We're going to find out.
[39:58.840 --> 40:00.480]  Lindsey Graham's going to run the show.
[40:00.480 --> 40:07.040]  So is John McCain, so we're not going to let Ruskies run America.
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.600]  The very Republicans that helped run the whole Islamic jihad with Obama the last six years
[40:11.600 --> 40:19.000]  turning North Africa, Eastern Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East over to radical Islam
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.640]  killing hundreds and hundreds of thousands in Syria alone.
[40:22.640 --> 40:30.080]  Millions total, Islam spreading everywhere, the borders open, mosque opening in places
[40:30.080 --> 40:34.040]  like Greece that haven't had mosque in hundreds of years because they were under the Ottomans
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.960]  for hundreds of years conquered by the Muslims.
[40:39.960 --> 40:43.720]  And then America decided to promote the West and not commit suicide and Europe struggles
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.320]  to not commit suicide politically, culturally, spiritually.
[40:49.320 --> 40:55.400]  And the globalists, Michael Moore's Nancy Pelosi's vaccine waters in the world, they
[40:55.400 --> 40:58.920]  just shit up there on arrogant power trips because they know the big banks are behind
[40:58.920 --> 40:59.920]  them.
[40:59.920 --> 41:03.360]  They know the big media is behind them and they're arrogant and they think they're unstoppable
[41:03.360 --> 41:08.040]  and they are just on a war path against the middle class and the bitter clingers and gun
[41:08.040 --> 41:10.680]  owners and Christians and veterans and everybody else.
[41:10.680 --> 41:14.080]  And they want to have a big civil war and a destabilization and then they want to have
[41:14.080 --> 41:15.080]  the military.
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.760]  They hate the most march in and have a big shooting war with gun owners and out of that
[41:19.760 --> 41:26.120]  civil war, they'll sit back and basically cook hot dogs and schmores and marshmallows
[41:26.120 --> 41:27.920]  over the fire of our republic.
[41:27.920 --> 41:29.560]  Well, I got news for you.
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.400]  I'm going to stop that fire from happening, but if it does, it's going to be you going
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.440]  into it, idiots.
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.600]  You might be able to assassinate Trump or start a civil war, but believe me, you're
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.520]  going to lose real fast within hours.
[41:46.520 --> 41:51.040]  The patriots in our government have made a list like Santa Claus does of who's naughty
[41:51.040 --> 41:52.440]  and who's nice.
[41:52.440 --> 41:53.920]  And so good luck.
[41:53.920 --> 42:00.360]  But I know Pelosi so dumb, she thinks Bush is still in office and Waters thinks that
[42:00.360 --> 42:07.120]  Russia invaded with Trump, with his support, Korea.
[42:07.120 --> 42:10.520]  And they're just so stupid.
[42:10.520 --> 42:13.960]  Just like Zuckerberg thought he could just take hundreds of acres of people's land bordering
[42:13.960 --> 42:19.160]  his in Hawaii, which was ancestral, richable land and people wouldn't blow up in his face.
[42:19.160 --> 42:20.160]  He's like, I'm a liberal.
[42:20.160 --> 42:21.160]  I'm a liberal.
[42:21.160 --> 42:24.240]  I fund cop-killing organizations like Black Lives Matter.
[42:24.240 --> 42:25.240]  Can I just have your property?
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.120]  I mean, oh my God, look at me.
[42:27.120 --> 42:33.280]  I'm a little know-it-all total sociopath, psychopath control freak bow down to me.
[42:33.280 --> 42:37.600]  It didn't work, did it?
[42:37.600 --> 42:41.320]  And must not know much about the Hawaiians at this point if he actually tries to take
[42:41.320 --> 42:47.720]  their land, how safe he'd be when he was in Kauai.
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.320]  He wants their actual 2,000-year-old ritual grounds.
[42:52.320 --> 42:55.800]  He's like, well, it's a beautiful plateau up here.
[42:55.800 --> 42:59.440]  Yeah, it sure is, bro.
[42:59.440 --> 43:02.000]  It shows the total error, the opposite of what you call liberal.
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.200]  It's like Apple with suicide nets around their factories, force-drugging all of it.
[43:06.200 --> 43:08.680]  The Chinese selling their political dissidents organs.
[43:08.680 --> 43:12.520]  And the liberals are like, I hope the Chinese communists can help stop Trump.
[43:12.520 --> 43:14.520]  And they're at Davos saying, we will stop Trump.
[43:14.520 --> 43:17.840]  And I'm going to say this to the president, and I'm getting to the other news.
[43:17.840 --> 43:21.800]  Mr. President and all his constituents have to get this message to Trump.
[43:21.800 --> 43:26.640]  The communist Chinese went to Davos, and the president, the elected president said, we're
[43:26.640 --> 43:29.760]  going to stop Trump, and we're going to stop America and the globalists.
[43:29.760 --> 43:31.440]  That's the espionage.
[43:31.440 --> 43:35.800]  And the governmental leaders from the Democrats that were there, they should all, you should
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.680]  all start calling for their investigation, and they all did it in public, and it guaranteed
[43:39.680 --> 43:40.680]  it's all recorded.
[43:40.680 --> 43:46.120]  Of course, I know Trump actually knows this, so they're kind of keeping this as a nuclear
[43:46.120 --> 43:47.120]  option.
[43:47.120 --> 43:48.120]  No.
[43:48.120 --> 43:50.080]  Hillary is a communist Chinese agent.
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.960]  She is an agent of the Saudis, and I'm done.
[43:54.960 --> 43:58.440]  These people were openly involved in our election, up one side and down the other, and then they
[43:58.440 --> 44:01.760]  want to tell all of us that want our Second Amendment and our property rights and our
[44:01.760 --> 44:04.800]  veterans taken care of, and we don't want to be under Obamacare, and we want to have
[44:04.800 --> 44:07.040]  our taxes cut, that I'm a Russian agent.
[44:07.040 --> 44:14.840]  You can go straight back to Hades where you came from, and then I'm getting angry.
[44:14.840 --> 44:21.040]  I'm going to cover it all, but I knew when I saw that yesterday that Spicer was going
[44:21.040 --> 44:26.360]  further than he was supposed to in knocking Flynn, and that's why he saw Trump come out
[44:26.360 --> 44:33.120]  and say how great Flynn is today, and that is Trump delegating to his politicos, and
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.040]  they stab him in the back every time.
[44:37.040 --> 44:40.680]  And it's been coming out in the news, Priebus is the one, one of the big leakers, there's
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.600]  an article on infowars.com, a doctor course that needs to go viral, and we've got a lot
[44:44.600 --> 44:48.760]  of exclusive sources of what's exactly going on in the White House, and the type of horrible
[44:48.760 --> 44:55.280]  ambassadorships that Priebus is handing out to people that will then be used to burn Trump,
[44:55.280 --> 44:57.960]  saying he's putting bad people in these positions.
[44:57.960 --> 45:08.840]  And again, the President has pardoning power, but he doesn't need to pardon himself or Flynn
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.560]  for communicating with the Russians, that's what the President does.
[45:12.560 --> 45:21.600]  Again, Hillary tried to negotiate TPP and did in secret over years, and it was totally
[45:21.600 --> 45:23.520]  secret from Congress, the American people.
[45:23.520 --> 45:27.000]  That violates the Logan Act, that's illegal, that's private corporate meetings.
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.080]  And if you don't think national security advisors talk to Russian ambassadors, what do you think
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.840]  security advisors and ambassadors do, it's called diplomacy, it's what they do.
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.880]  But the liberal constituency is so uneducated, so uninformed, so low information that they
[45:40.880 --> 45:44.320]  just are screaming and yelling about Russian plots.
[45:44.320 --> 45:49.080]  Meanwhile, we have footage on infowars.com of John Bowne of the local communist group
[45:49.080 --> 45:56.640]  protesting a cat shelter, that's been vandalized repeatedly, and telling people to eff off,
[45:56.640 --> 46:01.280]  and locals going, well, what's wrong with communists?
[46:01.280 --> 46:03.760]  They haven't ever done anything wrong.
[46:03.760 --> 46:05.560]  The communism is right here.
[46:05.560 --> 46:08.920]  The communism that took over Russia came from New York and London.
[46:08.920 --> 46:12.320]  That's the historical fact.
[46:12.320 --> 46:18.880]  It's John Bowne's report, I think we should rename it and put it back out as the most
[46:18.880 --> 46:25.360]  disgusting commies you've ever seen discovered, or, you know, commies besieging cat shelter,
[46:25.360 --> 46:29.960]  unbelievable video.
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.040]  Cat shelters had, the wind has knocked out, stuff spray painted, superglue put in the
[46:35.040 --> 46:39.280]  keyholes, and they're saying it's a gentrification because there's a cat shelter.
[46:39.280 --> 46:42.800]  Meanwhile, when South by Southwest comes in and they have big parties and bulldozed people's
[46:42.800 --> 46:46.360]  houses and whatever, they all love it because the red brigades run out of the University
[46:46.360 --> 46:47.360]  of Texas.
[46:47.360 --> 46:53.440]  Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable, because they want to divert everybody from the real gentrification
[46:53.440 --> 46:54.440]  stuff that's going on.
[46:54.440 --> 46:56.760]  I mean, you talk about the scum of the earth.
[46:56.760 --> 47:05.120]  These are people that literally attack women and people in wheelchairs, and they are just
[47:05.120 --> 47:16.640]  literally, I mean, imagine if you're such scum that you go out and you attack people's
[47:16.640 --> 47:17.640]  cat censures.
[47:17.640 --> 47:22.560]  And then the local liberals are so Stockholm center, we talked to them like, oh, I agree,
[47:22.560 --> 47:23.560]  yes, this is good.
[47:23.560 --> 47:29.440]  And then they walk over to a beautiful Hispanic, she looks Hispanic, it was like a model,
[47:29.440 --> 47:30.440]  and she's beautiful.
[47:30.440 --> 47:33.880]  So they tell her, get the hell out of here scum, because the thing is, they're mainly
[47:33.880 --> 47:34.880]  white kids.
[47:34.880 --> 47:37.480]  They don't like anybody that looks good or is successful.
[47:37.480 --> 47:39.120]  What it is is a loser club.
[47:39.120 --> 47:43.480]  We're losers, we're ugly, we're stupid, 90% of us live in our mother's basements.
[47:43.480 --> 47:44.480]  We are scum of the earth.
[47:44.480 --> 47:46.800]  Most of us are on heroin, they admit that.
[47:46.800 --> 47:48.760]  And so we're just totally unhappy people.
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.720]  So we go pick a cat sanctuary, because that sounds like what a low level demon would do.
[47:53.720 --> 47:57.760]  I'm going to come back with the big news straight ahead and more of what we need to do to stop
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.800]  all this, what's happening in the economy, and so much more.
[48:01.800 --> 48:07.000]  But before I do, I am now announcing undoubtedly what I believe will be the best selling product
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.760]  in infowars life history in our award winning, cutting edge, game changing supplements.
[48:13.760 --> 48:15.520]  And that's caveman.
[48:15.520 --> 48:23.240]  We've been using this already for months before it officially came out, and it is unbelievable.
[48:23.240 --> 48:28.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, they know for a fact that human CC size brain began to grow when
[48:28.960 --> 48:32.720]  humans began to scavenge bones and then cook them and eat the marrow and grind the bones
[48:32.720 --> 48:33.720]  down.
[48:33.720 --> 48:37.280]  At all ancient human sites, what you find is that humans were mainly scavengers for meat,
[48:37.280 --> 48:39.840]  hunter gatherers for berries and things like that.
[48:39.840 --> 48:45.320]  And then our brains grew and got larger, and we became more successful because of that.
[48:45.320 --> 48:47.480]  And I've got a whole stack of news right here.
[48:47.480 --> 48:50.720]  This is the Daily Mail, how modern humans have become weaklings compared with our ancient
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.320]  ancestors who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes.
[48:55.320 --> 49:03.240]  Just the average, the average, you know, Irish farmer or African farmer, they've done people
[49:03.240 --> 49:09.960]  up, was twice as strong 10,000 years ago as we are now.
[49:09.960 --> 49:10.960]  What happened?
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.280]  I mean, men just three generations ago, everybody knows, were more aggressive, were more virile,
[49:15.280 --> 49:19.720]  on average.
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.080]  So what's happening?
[49:23.080 --> 49:24.080]  What's unfolding here?
[49:24.080 --> 49:28.360]  Well, the big thing is, grandma always told you, if you want to be strong, you want to
[49:28.360 --> 49:30.480]  get better, have ox tail soup or bone soup.
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.240]  Everybody knows that, that's the big hot thing in the NFL for years, and power lifters, but
[49:34.240 --> 49:36.320]  I thought, why do that?
[49:36.320 --> 49:43.600]  Why not have the ultimate, this is the ultimate, there's nothing even close, of the condensed
[49:43.600 --> 49:48.240]  essence out of the bones and a whole bunch of other super foods and nutrients to totally
[49:48.240 --> 49:49.240]  turbo charge.
[49:49.240 --> 49:51.920]  We've given this to top athletes, top weight lifters that were going to have endorsing it
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.840]  soon, and they were just like, we've never had anything this good for joint pain, the
[49:57.840 --> 50:03.280]  tissues of the body, caveman is simply the absolute game changer.
[50:03.280 --> 50:10.080]  It's a giant container of it, 39.95, it's massive discount out of the gates, 33% off
[50:10.080 --> 50:14.800]  because I want everybody to try it, I want everybody to actually get it for themselves
[50:14.800 --> 50:21.480]  because there's nothing like caveman in my experience.
[50:21.480 --> 50:29.240]  And again, it's the essence of the bones, the bone marrow, all of it, it's got the collagen
[50:29.240 --> 50:33.720]  that is essential for ligaments, muscles, tendons, and I'm going to skip this break,
[50:33.720 --> 50:35.240]  I just have to tell you more about caveman.
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.000]  Let me just read to you from the write up about it.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.520]  Our modern society has lost virtually all of its ancient traditions and practices that
[50:43.520 --> 50:46.480]  our ancestors so greatly value for thousands of years.
[50:46.480 --> 50:50.720]  One such practice goes all the way back to the dawn of man cooking meat over a fire and
[50:50.720 --> 50:53.160]  simmering down the bones into the broth.
[50:53.160 --> 50:56.200]  Today we call it bone broth, for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed it in every
[50:56.200 --> 51:00.520]  culture its benefits before it became lost to our modern diet of processed junk, just
[51:00.520 --> 51:03.480]  like grinding up bones and then putting it in the bread.
[51:03.480 --> 51:09.240]  Fee-fie, foe-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, be he alive or be he dead, I'll
[51:09.240 --> 51:13.320]  grind his bones to make my bread, thus the 600 year old Jack in the Beanstalk, that
[51:13.320 --> 51:16.520]  was when it was first written down probably older.
[51:16.520 --> 51:20.320]  But again, then you'd also take the stuff in the hearth and burn was left for the bones
[51:20.320 --> 51:23.080]  in the hearth and the potash then use that on your crops.
[51:23.080 --> 51:31.080]  So this is next level with the vitamins, the nutrients, the trace elements, the minerals.
[51:31.080 --> 51:35.120]  Today we call it bone broth, but this is like bone broth to the next level, and for thousands
[51:35.120 --> 51:40.440]  of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost on modern diets and
[51:40.440 --> 51:42.640]  processed junk.
[51:42.640 --> 51:46.320]  Introducing caveman and forewars life, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone
[51:46.320 --> 51:54.320]  broth, turmeric root, everybody knows what that does, turmeric, chaga mushroom and seven
[51:54.320 --> 51:58.040]  total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[51:58.040 --> 52:02.960]  The unique formulation behind caveman combines cutting edge, nutraceutical science and ancient
[52:02.960 --> 52:07.040]  nutrition to increase potency and maximum benefits.
[52:07.040 --> 52:11.240]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active
[52:11.240 --> 52:16.040]  compounds and turmeric do battle at the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[52:16.040 --> 52:20.880]  Collagen works again to aid healthy tendons, ligaments and muscle tissue life essence.
[52:20.880 --> 52:26.240]  These are just a few of the superfood ingredients found in the new caveman, true paleo formula
[52:26.240 --> 52:29.280]  now exclusively available at mforewarslife.com.
[52:29.280 --> 52:34.480]  Find out what you've been missing and secure your supply of caveman at mforewarslife.com,
[52:34.480 --> 52:35.680]  that's mforewarslife.com.
[52:35.680 --> 52:42.320]  Why does a dog ignore the meat and go for the guts, the tendons and the bones?
[52:42.320 --> 52:46.800]  Well guts have the meal of whatever it was eating, and the guts have all the flora and
[52:46.800 --> 52:52.720]  the bacteria, it's kind of gross but it's like yogurt to them, okay but it's not quite
[52:52.720 --> 52:55.240]  the normal kind of yogurt we want.
[52:55.240 --> 52:59.880]  And then they start eating the meat after that, you know the red meat that tastes good
[52:59.880 --> 53:05.160]  that we all love, that's the least nutritious when it comes to just calories and everything
[53:05.160 --> 53:06.160]  else.
[53:06.160 --> 53:09.680]  They go for the fat, they go for the guts, they go for something else in the digestive
[53:09.680 --> 53:18.480]  tract because that's where it's all at, wolves, the big cats, bears, all of it, when they
[53:18.480 --> 53:20.680]  go for meat that's what they go for first.
[53:20.680 --> 53:24.280]  That's why a dog will sit there with a bone, they don't just like to chew it, they didn't
[53:24.280 --> 53:28.560]  just do it because it's fun, they're chewing in to eat the marrow, they want the marrow
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.560]  that grows the blood, that grows the white blood cells, that's got the op stem cells
[53:33.560 --> 53:34.560]  in it.
[53:34.560 --> 53:40.480]  Now this is all desiccated, but what we know is that that's what has the effect historically.
[53:40.480 --> 53:43.640]  And we went out and saw other formulas that were somewhat like this and it was just a
[53:43.640 --> 53:47.400]  couple of dollars of stuff, just grind up some bones, some fill or throw it in there,
[53:47.400 --> 53:48.560]  no, no, no, no.
[53:48.560 --> 53:52.920]  This cost us a lot to make, okay, a lot to make.
[53:52.920 --> 53:57.400]  But frankly, I'm like, man, this is expensive to make, we need to make some profits.
[53:57.400 --> 54:03.120]  But it's got markup in it as well due to a fund the operation.
[54:03.120 --> 54:11.040]  But you need to go check it out for yourself, infowarslife.com, that's infowarsstore.com
[54:11.040 --> 54:14.640]  or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[54:14.640 --> 54:18.200]  But whatever you do, don't just believe me.
[54:18.200 --> 54:23.800]  You know, a few months ago the new super blue toothpaste with colloidal silver and the Mason
[54:23.800 --> 54:27.280]  iodine came in that we have for the biggest manufacturer in the country of organic non
[54:27.280 --> 54:31.480]  fluoride toothpaste that we had private labeled for us, but to our own proprietary blend.
[54:31.480 --> 54:36.240]  And I took it home, a couple of tubes, used it a couple of months later.
[54:36.240 --> 54:39.400]  I'm like, why am I digging around for toothpaste to find an old tube of, you know, toms of
[54:39.400 --> 54:41.360]  Maine, which is doing great stuff.
[54:41.360 --> 54:46.760]  And I realized, oh, oh boy, yeah, I need to, I don't have a lot of ship because I bring
[54:46.760 --> 54:47.880]  it home.
[54:47.880 --> 54:51.720]  That's why everybody has to get on auto ship because you'll just forget and then you don't
[54:51.720 --> 54:54.520]  get the best toothpaste out there and you're not support the broadcast.
[54:54.520 --> 54:56.240]  It's a lose, lose folks.
[54:56.240 --> 54:57.240]  It's great toothpaste.
[54:57.240 --> 55:00.320]  And if you like it, then please sign up for auto shipping and cancel anytime.
[55:00.320 --> 55:02.960]  That way you keep supporting the broadcast and you get great toothpaste.
[55:02.960 --> 55:07.260]  It's a win, win, three, 60, win, but it's the same thing now.
[55:07.260 --> 55:10.120]  One of my concerns was I said, man, really concentrated bone broth, what's it's going
[55:10.120 --> 55:11.120]  to be like?
[55:11.120 --> 55:13.600]  Well, we have a natural way to make it really taste good.
[55:13.600 --> 55:16.700]  It goes really great with cocoa.
[55:16.700 --> 55:23.040]  And so it tastes delicious because I remember when we first got the first formula, it tasted,
[55:23.040 --> 55:28.480]  you know, like, like bones kind of tasted good, but I'm a guy, you know, I like to taste a
[55:28.480 --> 55:29.480]  pretty, pretty serious stuff.
[55:29.480 --> 55:30.680]  I like to taste the aged beef.
[55:30.680 --> 55:31.680]  You name it.
[55:31.680 --> 55:32.800]  You get older, you get a more complex palate.
[55:32.800 --> 55:33.800]  I wouldn't like that one.
[55:33.800 --> 55:35.560]  I was a kid and I said, we got to do something.
[55:35.560 --> 55:39.080]  So we worked for this for about another six months, formulators, and it works great with
[55:39.080 --> 55:42.320]  cocoa, which is also good for you in an antioxidant.
[55:42.320 --> 55:44.520]  So it's chocolate flavor.
[55:44.520 --> 55:47.040]  So ladies and gentlemen, get ready for this.
[55:47.040 --> 55:48.040]  Here it is right here.
[55:48.040 --> 55:49.200]  I personally like it over ice.
[55:49.200 --> 55:56.040]  They brought it to me without ice, but it's, it's incredible.
[55:56.040 --> 55:59.400]  It tastes like ovaltine, but not as sweet.
[55:59.400 --> 56:01.440]  And I'm not saying that because I want to make it sound good.
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.840]  I love ovaltine folks, but it's obviously 30 years ago, it was a good, you know, crappy
[56:05.840 --> 56:08.880]  thing for the kids that had a little bit of vitamins that I'm not knocking over.
[56:08.880 --> 56:13.240]  I still buy it occasionally, but I was like, this tastes like ovaltine, but not as sweet.
[56:13.240 --> 56:16.520]  If you put a little bit of honey in this or a little bit of sugar, it's ovaltine.
[56:16.520 --> 56:17.520]  I mean, it's incredible.
[56:17.520 --> 56:29.240]  So it's available right now in infowarsstore.com or call toll 3-888-253-339-338-253-339.
[56:29.240 --> 56:34.000]  Now before I go any further, I ran out of time to get into Jade Helm again, which is
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.520]  an entire lesson on how the globalists operate.
[56:37.520 --> 56:39.920]  We know there's military training, there's billions of bullets getting bought, the
[56:39.920 --> 56:43.600]  Justice Department and Mets are trained to take on gun owners, veterans, conservatives.
[56:43.600 --> 56:44.600]  That's in all their manuals.
[56:44.600 --> 56:47.360]  How's the media tap down this awakening?
[56:47.360 --> 56:50.840]  They go, Alex Jones says he hates the military and they're coming to take Texans guns and
[56:50.840 --> 56:51.840]  kill them.
[56:51.840 --> 56:52.840]  Never said that.
[56:52.840 --> 56:56.120]  They put it in thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of
[56:56.120 --> 56:57.120]  publications.
[56:57.120 --> 57:03.040]  I mean, sometimes it was thousands a week for years, went from 2014 right to 2015.
[57:03.040 --> 57:07.840]  So they spent years attacking me, misrepresenting so you'd accept the real takeover because
[57:07.840 --> 57:09.920]  they want to get our military to accept it.
[57:09.920 --> 57:13.760]  And under Obama, this has now come out and it's in mainstream news today that they have
[57:13.760 --> 57:16.440]  a plan to quote takeover the United States.
[57:16.440 --> 57:19.960]  Now our military doesn't want to be part of this, but the globalists are fomenting civil
[57:19.960 --> 57:23.280]  unrest and the overthrow of Trump to bring it in.
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.520]  They were already planning it with Hillary and the takeover of the press.
[57:27.520 --> 57:31.480]  But now it's in the news.
[57:31.480 --> 57:36.400]  Mainstream news, Pentagon warrants of unfavorable dystopian future for world's biggest cities.
[57:36.400 --> 57:40.160]  I believe they're going to have to occupy the United States.
[57:40.160 --> 57:44.280]  Coming soon to senior U.S. military's plan to take over America, zero hedge, and its
[57:44.280 --> 57:45.280]  direct quotes.
[57:45.280 --> 57:51.600]  Do you understand exactly what I told you?
[57:51.600 --> 57:54.760]  Back in the article, government promises to stop lying because of drudge report.
[57:54.760 --> 57:58.040]  In their own press release, they said the military will be in every city in the U.S.
[57:58.040 --> 58:00.640]  from July 28, 2013.
[58:00.640 --> 58:05.400]  They'll watch my breakdown of it and the State Department breakdown of it.
[58:05.400 --> 58:11.720]  It's three years ago, master the human domain, the domestic plan behind Jade Helm.
[58:11.720 --> 58:16.040]  And they admit in their own words, control everything, surveil everything for whoever's
[58:16.040 --> 58:17.040]  ordering them.
[58:17.040 --> 58:19.600]  And that would have been Hillary Clinton.
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.600]  Now they put this in and the State Department, other agencies are an open revolt against
[58:24.600 --> 58:25.600]  Trump.
[58:25.600 --> 58:26.600]  The military isn't.
[58:26.600 --> 58:27.600]  So there's a civil war in the country.
[58:27.600 --> 58:31.440]  Oh, here's another London Guardian, Revolution, flash mobs, brain chips, a grim future.
[58:31.440 --> 58:32.760]  That's their Ministry of Defense.
[58:32.760 --> 58:33.760]  You see?
[58:33.760 --> 58:35.160]  I told you.
[58:35.160 --> 58:36.240]  We don't lie, folks.
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.240]  We give you the absolute total truth as best we can give it to you as best we can find
[58:41.240 --> 58:42.240]  it.
[58:42.240 --> 58:43.240]  Are we perfect?
[58:43.240 --> 58:44.240]  No.
[58:44.240 --> 58:45.240]  I'll be honest.
[58:45.240 --> 58:46.240]  It's worse than I usually think.
[58:46.240 --> 58:49.600]  So I'm sorry that I don't say things are worse because I just can't even get my mind
[58:49.600 --> 58:51.200]  around it.
[58:51.200 --> 58:56.680]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[58:56.680 --> 59:00.680]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[59:00.680 --> 59:05.880]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[59:05.880 --> 59:11.600]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia
[59:11.600 --> 59:13.720]  hacked the US elections.
[59:13.720 --> 59:18.000]  They're also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.160]  a violation of the Logan Act.
[59:20.160 --> 59:21.240]  But wait a minute.
[59:21.240 --> 59:24.840]  Where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[59:24.840 --> 59:30.240]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately
[59:30.240 --> 59:34.480]  meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[59:34.480 --> 59:40.080]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with
[59:40.080 --> 59:43.760]  compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[59:43.760 --> 59:46.720]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.
[59:46.720 --> 1:00:12.720]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:28.040]  Okay, coming up, we have been totally verified, certified, proven absolutely on target again,
[1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:29.040]  just a fact.
[1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:35.520]  In fact, it's about 200% right because it's just way worse than we thought.
[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:38.920]  The Pentagon's openly announced that they've been ordered the last two years to prepare
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:43.080]  for total martial law, the takeover of every US city, for total dystopian collapse.
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:44.080]  That's a quote.
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:47.960]  We have the Pentagon's own promotional video about the coming dystopian collapse and preparation
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:49.520]  for it, not just here, but worldwide.
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:54.800]  We told you the globalists are engineering a financial worldwide meltdown when they're
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:55.800]  ready.
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:58.200]  That's why people in intelligence agencies and others have been trying to block this
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:00.760]  because it's so horrible.
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:04.400]  And now Michael Moore is running around calling for Hillary to be installed as president.
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:05.400]  And you know, my writers are great.
[1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:10.800]  I just said, it's always worse than I'm saying, here's an example, great writer Clifford
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:15.920]  Cuttingham wrote this, just came out infowars.com, White House fears sabotage by intelligence
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:16.920]  industrial complex.
[1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:19.120]  Well, no, he doesn't fear it.
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:23.360]  He's come out and said, these are intelligence agencies that are sabotaging.
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:29.880]  I mean, we had Nancy Pelosi, Chuckie Schumer, all the usual suspects, let's cue one up.
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:32.600]  Coming out threatening Trump, when he was president of the Lexing, you better watch
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:36.400]  out, the intelligence agencies you're criticizing can bring you down.
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:42.600]  He meant Brennan, the Wahhabi agent, openly threatening him.
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.000]  And then he goes back and says, how dare you tell me what to do as the president of like,
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.520]  they're like, we'll show you because they're belligerent.
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:49.520]  They're crazy.
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:54.920]  John McCain and the CIA leadership, at least at the time, are insane.
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:01:59.440]  The news thinks you're so dumb, they're like, the president isn't allowed to talk to Russians.
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:00.440]  Nobody else is.
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:04.720]  Plus, Hillary can meet with them in secret whenever she wants and take money.
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:11.280]  And then they, again, with people manipulating Trump in his own cabinet, sir, this is an
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:16.160]  issue and you just let the GOP know it's fine and, you know, say that we've had no contact.
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.080]  Yeah, but I told him to call.
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:21.400]  I don't know, but just say that you didn't discuss specific yourself because only you're
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.920]  allowed to do that, sir, which isn't even true.
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:26.920]  You find out what the Russians want and then, well, Flynn, as you talk about it, no, nothing
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:29.400]  substantive, just lining up to call for you.
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:32.000]  But oh, the Russians were saying, we want to talk about sanctions with the president.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Okay.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Well, yeah.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.760]  See, oh my gosh, but nobody cares about the president's new national security advisor being
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:44.040]  spied on by Obama in the final days when they're lame duck.
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:48.040]  I mean, this is so huge.
[1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:53.600]  That's why Michael Moore is so arrogant right now saying, remove him, install Hillary.
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:54.600]  That's, you know what?
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:57.800]  I almost wish they removed Trump and install that shaking, doddering.
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:03:01.480]  Did you see the photo of her wearing some weird Chinese outfit?
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:07.320]  I told you she keeps wearing Chinese classic communist era, 1960s dresses, the very dresses
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.120]  that Mao Zedong's wife wore.
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:12.520]  I screenshot it myself, I'm going to send it to you guys.
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:14.160]  It was, there it is.
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:15.160]  You found it.
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:20.160]  Clinton, Bill Clinton's wearing a weird leather jacket from the 70s or is that the 80s?
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:22.880]  About a 1982 design.
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:28.160]  And then Hillary is wearing a communist Chinese or maybe even Tibetan style.
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:30.640]  I mean, the point is, is just look at these loons.
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:35.840]  They think they're rock stars, billions of dollars stole of swindling Haiti, a meeting
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:39.960]  secretly with Putin, all their crimes, illegal servers, everything else.
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:46.760]  And when we come back, Roger Stone joins us from the road and our big exclusive, I see
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:54.000]  how much of this he's aware of, pre-bus next to go is Trump strikes back over Flynn.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.160]  And I'm telling Paul Watson here on air, I'm telling all my writers, all my people, because
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:01.640]  I mentioned this to him kind of week after week and everybody's kind of goes, yeah,
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:06.680]  I got great writers, but they just kind of go, okay, yeah, and then I mean, the communist
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:09.520]  Chinese are all of the news saying we're going to help take over our media and help censor
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:10.960]  Trump at the American people.
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:14.640]  The big media saying and the big tech companies saying they're going to censor Trump all during
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:16.840]  the election, they said they were involved in our election.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:21.080]  We've got to have master articles and master videos where all this is laid out showing
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:25.360]  it piece by piece, how would they accuse Trump of doing, they've done a trillion times, and
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.120]  then Trump has to go after them and get on the offensive.
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.280]  The pre-bus is like, sir, show the party that you're going to be against this and that you're
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:34.280]  not with the Russians.
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:38.520]  Show them you're not with the Russians, fire some people, okay.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:42.800]  And then now you see Trump today, oh, Flynn's wonderful, he didn't do anything wrong.
[1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:48.520]  He now knows it was a big mistake because they are gunning now, foaming at the mouth
[1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:53.160]  and more is screaming for, you know, the overthrow and the installation.
[1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.400]  They're all calling for Trump's assassination.
[1:04:55.400 --> 1:04:56.800]  And where are the arrests?
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:04:57.920]  Where are the arrests?
[1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:01.120]  Where are the arrests?
[1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:06.600]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:10.600]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:15.800]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:21.720]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:23.600]  hacked the US elections.
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:27.920]  They're also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:29.720]  a violation of the Logan Act.
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:34.720]  But wait a minute, where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:40.160]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:44.440]  meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:50.000]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.680]  compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:56.680]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.

[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:44.120]  of them speakers was solid contrago then I noticed the strange it was ghost white tear
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:50.880]  when he asked me for a light and I knew there was something strange about this ride.
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:57.880]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. we are here live broadcasting worldwide.
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:10.880]  Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside.
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:18.720]  All right, joining us is Roger Stone via the road he's a very very busy man to give us
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:23.720]  the latest from his sources on what's happening inside the Trump White House so Michael Moore
[1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:27.880]  and others admit it's an attempted coup they want him arrested they want Hillary installed
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:34.360]  they are calling everywhere so many Hollywood people entertainers comics are calling for
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:40.160]  his murder that I can't even keep track of it anymore they are Republicans are refusing
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:45.720]  to repeal Obamacare so he signed executive orders ordering the IRS not to find people
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:51.040]  so now the IRS is announced they will not take $5,000 out of your check he is just battling
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:55.960]  to restore the Republic battling to get big banks to loan to small businesses yelling
[1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:00.520]  is against him now and they want to raise interest rates so that it hurts the economy.
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:05.600]  This is just unprecedented and I told everybody I told Roger Stone on election night I said
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:09.200]  we can celebrate this a few days but I said the battle just begun this beachhead is so
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:15.560]  precious that you know now the war is just starting and they're trying to get rid of
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:20.560]  his security head that's in the news they are just you know they've taken out Flynn
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:29.120]  and the left's making him a victim now which I think he is a martyr and saying oh Trump
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:33.360]  ordered him to do it and it's Trump and Michael Moore is like yeah Trump ordered him of course
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:37.520]  the incoming president told his national security advisor they set up calls with the Russians
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:42.960]  that's totally normal I mean Hillary went negotiated with Obama secret TPP deals with
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:46.840]  private corporations and claimed it was the president's power which it's not but you can
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:53.200]  talk to world leaders so I think Trump needs to get on the offensive now and I put together
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:56.720]  all the mainstream articles admitting the Chinese funded Hillary the Saudi Arabians
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:03.320]  brag they funded her 20% foreign governments involved trying to stop Trump when he was
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:08.840]  a candidate so this thing about the national security advisor talked about setting a call
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:12.400]  up with the president and they wanted to discuss sanctions with the president well of course
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:16.480]  they did that's what presidents do this is like saying they're going to arrest somebody
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:22.040]  for breathing this is unprecedented and the Republican establishment in my view Roger
[1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:27.840]  Stone is the real threat we have Dr. Jerome Corsi's article on info wars dot com right
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:32.800]  now that says that previous next to go as Trump strikes back over Flynn Trump rightfully
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:36.920]  says the leakers of committed felonies and it's felonies recording the president's people
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:42.080]  so that's certainly true but you're not one of my sources on this course he has his I
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:46.400]  have mine I sent you the article this morning I don't know if you've read it but can you
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:50.800]  tell me how accurate this is from from because I know you don't want to lose your sources
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:54.240]  by even putting stuff out so many times you tell me stuff in confidence and I can never
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:12:00.440]  tell it and it comes true but you've not been part of this story Roger no first of all I
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:06.840]  would have to congratulate Dr. Corsi because he is right on the money he of course reported
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:13.920]  that despite the fact that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had a commitment from the White
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:20.680]  House personnel office that he would be able to interview the candidates for ambassadorships
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:27.240]  in the top 10 most crucial and most sensitive nations we learned that right previous the
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:33.640]  White House Chief of Staff took a list of 15 to the president two weeks ago unbeknownst
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:41.160]  to anyone and running state got the president to sign off and the background checks of those
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:48.040]  would be ambassadors have begun to a man that none of them are early Trump supporters they
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:56.680]  appear to all be heavy Republican National Committee donors I also think Dr. Corsi is
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:04.600]  absolutely right about the ouster of Mike Flynn being the Pearl Harbor for Trump associates
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:10.560]  make no mistake about this Alex first it's Flynn then it's Stephen Miller then Steve
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:17.360]  Bannon those are the targets for rights previous and the establishment Republican and notice
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:21.320]  there synced up with Michael Moore who listed that exact list of people and said then we're
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:26.040]  going to get Trump so if Trump can I mean I guarantee you know previous in them advised
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:29.920]  him to cut Flynn loose that he's been gunning for Flynn I mean from the beginning I even
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:33.040]  know that directly and I know you know that as well and that was been happening since
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:37.920]  day one and so now they're after banning there after everybody else but regardless look at
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:42.520]  how the media is turning Flynn into a martyr now saying he didn't really do anything wrong
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:48.080]  so so boy they're setting it up to go after Trump right now but let's talk about state
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:52.320]  departments this is where we have previous absolutely dead to rights it's supposed to
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:56.760]  be the secretary of state that vets this and does this with the president but previous
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:01.040]  as usual is running the whole show trying to try to fire people who aren't really fired
[1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:06.240]  the rest of it and so concurring with this analysis then he's putting people in that
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:11.840]  aren't qualified or have bad past that could again burn Trump so this looks like intentional
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:16.400]  sabotage but regardless we have the State Department open revolt pushing that they want
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:21.320]  to stop Lapin and stop Wilder claiming they're Russian agents because they're nationalist
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:26.200]  this is insane and going after Trump more so clearly we've got a lot of insurrection
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:30.720]  here Doug what does Trump need to do right now he's the clean house both at the White
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:36.080]  House and in his department the problem we have here Alex is that 80% of the people making
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:42.240]  decisions on a policy level are still Obama holdovers we still have not fleshed out our
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:48.400]  own people in the crucial departments and when I say our own people I'm talking about
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:56.560]  highly qualified Trump loyalists not Republican apparatus checks whose loyalty is to the Republican
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:02.880]  National Committee or to the party but people who are loyal to the president let me give
[1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:11.280]  you a perfect example Ed Martin former chief of staff to the governor of Missouri counsel
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:21.280]  to Pope John counsel to the archdiocese of St. Louis former chairman of the St. Louis
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:29.080]  election board former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party speaks six languages including
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:35.960]  Indonesian Republican candidate for attorney general he is an exceptionally able man who
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:42.080]  was a very very early and pivotal supporter of Donald Trump you've had him here on info
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:48.120]  wars this is someone who should have been chief of staff more than capable of it instead
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:55.200]  we have the party operatives like rice previous whose loyalty is not to the president but
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:59.480]  to the party let's be clear let's be clear then let's be clear about the president needs
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:04.440]  to do here's the bottom line Trump is delivering on his promises to try to cut taxes stop Obama
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:11.160]  care secure the borders go after ISIS get rid of NAFTA get you'll kill TPP that's all
[1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:17.280]  fabulous accomplishments so he's delivering but his minions the party apparatchniks like
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:24.280]  previous his total minion as we all know a grim of the stool for for Paul Ryan are openly
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:29.760]  sabotaging him and surely the president understands that previous follows him around everywhere
[1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:34.040]  and he has to throw him out of meetings because the guys at literal Republican Party operative
[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:37.800]  and I know that Trump tried to work with the Republican establishment but to hopefully
[1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:43.000]  fix America they're not gonna do it this is his message you know he didn't co-opt them
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:49.480]  they're trying to co-opt him he needs to throw them overboard now I couldn't agree more you
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:56.880]  have a situation in which the White House is leaking like a sieve now I've been active
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:02.000]  in American politics for 40 years Alice I understand the value of the strategic week
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.360]  and there are many times when it's legitimate political tool but when you are leaking to
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:12.040]  aggrandize yourself and to suck up to a reporter and when you are leaking and you're making
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:17.320]  your boss in this case the president of the United States look terrible you're doing an
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:21.520]  enormous disservice to your principal let me tell you let me tell you how they're acting
[1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:24.640]  Roger they're acting like they think he's gonna be gone soon and they're just sucking
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:31.640]  up to the establishment they act like conscious saboteurs it could not be more brazen and
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:38.640]  this was an overreaction when it comes to General Flynn General Flynn is broken no law
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:45.480]  he could have simply issued an apology to the president and moved on instead you know
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:50.800]  previous and the party types now have a doubt and their and their appetite for blood has
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:57.280]  been wasted now they are going to come back after Stephen Miller who is an incredibly
[1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:03.360]  capable individual who is merely working the president's will that's why they hated every
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:08.480]  time I see Miller I like who is this young guy he's on target it's Americana it sounds
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:13.200]  like Trump the only other person now that we ever see is is is is Miller and occasionally
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:18.040]  banned in an interview they're the only ones that sound like Trump now it's crazy and then
[1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:22.440]  anybody that sounds like Trump or is carrying out the will of the guy we elected is being
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:29.720]  slain overboard and what I think is particular entertaining is that you have previous and
[1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:35.720]  banning calling reporters yesterday together insisting that there is no discord you know
[1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:40.920]  like hostage video is what they're like sure they're gonna say that on the record with
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:46.280]  their minders watching them but in truth Steve Bannon is the only one with the assistant
[1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:51.400]  of Stephen Miller who was protecting the Trump flame who was protecting the Trump agenda
[1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:55.800]  who understands who elected Donald Trump and why I was I don't know I mean I don't know
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:00.200]  if you like you do Miller I whenever I see him it's like that guy is on target he's
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.560]  piercing he knows what he's talking about he's hard hitting and it sounds like Trump because
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:08.760]  he's actually doing what the president says I mean I watch Spicer the way he had viciously
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:12.880]  attacked Flynn and then I see the president the press conference say how great he is and
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:18.200]  it's not good cop bad cop it's clear Spicer is doing whatever he wants yeah well again
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:24.480]  this is the same Sean Spicer who undercut Donald Trump during the election the same
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:29.120]  Sean Spicer who told reporters in September if Trump didn't get his poll numbers up the
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:34.120]  Republican National Committee would have to suspend its financial support for the Trump
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:43.480]  candidacy we as Dr. Corsi reveals today we now know that ranked previous very carefully
[1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:52.680]  moved $750,000 in digital advertising from Donald Trump to Pat Toomey the senator in
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:20:03.200]  Pennsylvania in the closing days putting victory in Pennsylvania at real risk it's extraordinary
[1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:07.600]  the way it was rents previous running around saying that the popular vote doesn't matter
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:11.720]  and trying to stop Trump getting the nomination I think I think going mistake Trump is made
[1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:18.640]  is putting this guy in there an enormous mistake look better a stake in the grass than an ass
[1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:24.960]  in the puzzle yes absolutely good biblical saying you don't want to have a viper in
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:30.480]  your pants it's better to have them in the grass I agree and look it's very clear the
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:37.520]  president needs to clean house he needs a team of men and women who are dedicated Trump
[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:44.440]  bikes who are dedicated anti-globalists who see as a big picture the only two members
[1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:51.760]  of the White House staff putting aside clerical positions and advanced men advanced people
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:57.440]  the only identifiable Trump supporters in the White House staff are Steve Bannon and
[1:20:57.440 --> 1:21:05.080]  Steve Miller Kellyanne Conway who I have a high regard for originally was for Ted Cruz
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:09.800]  at least in her case she was for Donald Trump before the convention but notice because she's
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:16.040]  a genuine person they're gunning for her now saying she's committed crimes this is ridiculous
[1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:22.960]  she says something nice about Ivanka yeah no they're trying to boycott everything we
[1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:27.960]  stand for to bankrupt Americans that are patriots they're in an economic war with us and so
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:32.080]  yeah we've got to boost each other and shop with each other and help each other that's
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:38.320]  our power I mean I'm back in the Clinton Foundation days at their presidential foundation they
[1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:43.040]  said we've got to stop conservatives or libertarians or Christians ever creating their own economy
[1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:48.680]  or they'll defeat us they want to starve us out sorry go ahead that's exactly right so
[1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:58.000]  Kellyanne Conway makes a friend a friendly comment about Ivanka Trump's line of makeup
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:03.640]  and you would think that this was Armageddon you would think this was a you know a massive
[1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:10.880]  bank robbery this is a third the idea that she would be punished for that or held accountable
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:19.080]  for that this was a warm comment of ten seconds not exactly heavy marketing it's an absurdity
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:26.040]  but there is as you point out Alex a double standard the Clintons can loot and they can
[1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:33.040]  pillage and they can steal literally hundreds of millions and there are no consequences
[1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:39.600]  Kellyanne Conway says something nice on television about Ivanka's makeup line and we act like
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:44.560]  it's a capital crime well at the time we've got is about six seven minutes left with you
[1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:48.880]  Roger Stone former head of the Trump campaign let's talk about where we are right now I'm
[1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:52.960]  not in some panic mode other than the fact that the left and the right wingers are openly
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:56.400]  saying they want to kill Trump they want overthrowing they want him out of office and this is the
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:01.720]  mouth of Democratic Party Michael Moore saying this they're completely out of their minds
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:07.200]  again Maxine Waters thinks that thinks that Putin has invaded Korea the same press conference
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:12.880]  Pelosi thinks that thinks that Bush is is still in office George W so it's very dangerous
[1:23:12.880 --> 1:23:17.440]  there they're arrogance and then I see Trump trying to get his agenda through and the Republicans
[1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:23.360]  trying to block it if I was the president I come out say you know something and I would
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:26.920]  have exhibits and I would show where the communist Chinese the Saudi Arabians gave all this money
[1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:32.000]  to Hillary and how she met with Putin secretly twice and all the stuff that's come out and
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:36.440]  then say and then Flynn is on the phone setting up phone calls for me and they're recording
[1:23:36.440 --> 1:23:41.160]  him trying to act like that's dirty the president and his people talk to the Russians that's
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:46.160]  what we do that's why we have a red phone this is insane Hillary and Obama negotiated
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:51.680]  PPP in secret with foreign corporations probably not legal my experts tell me but that's all
[1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:56.560]  bygones I killed that thing you know the idea that I'm a Russian spy or all of this is a
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:24:00.960]  way to make it sound like you didn't elect me these people are dangerous and so that's
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:04.960]  it you want the gloves off I'm gonna have sessions and everybody else start investigating
[1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:09.560]  all these reports where the Saudis bragged that they put Hillary you know in the campaign
[1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:13.120]  and all this you know you want to fight you've got one your criminals I think he needs to
[1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:17.960]  absolutely get up on his hind legs because it's ridiculous he's fighting a group of
[1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:23.120]  criminals openly trying to organize his murder or impeachment and shutting down the free
[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:29.080]  press and killing our recovery and putting the screw job Obamacare on us Rodgers well
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:33.480]  listen Alex there's nothing like waking up in the morning as I did this morning and
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:38.680]  reading on the front page of the New York Times yet again that the Central Intelligence
[1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:46.760]  Agency has has uncovered communications between Paul Manafort Roger Stone and Carter Page
[1:24:46.760 --> 1:24:54.280]  and the Russian this story is a total complete recycle of the exact same story that they
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:25:02.320]  ran on January 20th it was false then it is categorically false now let's be clear let's
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:05.120]  be clear about this I should have brought this up first they're saying is all the news
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:09.200]  that you and Manafort and your former business partner all these other people or literally
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:13.680]  working with the Russians when he Manafort had elected Ukraine moving into the EU it's
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:18.680]  laughable meanwhile if they had the communications they would release them unless they're claiming
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:23.400]  someone you talked to that you didn't know could be a Russian asset was one but then
[1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:27.760]  that's not illegal plus talking to someone's not illegal you're a member of the press but
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:32.080]  the point is no one's ever said you're some Ruski but now they're saying and as you said
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:40.520]  totally recycled what does this signify well they say that they have email transmissions
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:50.000]  and and documenting financial transaction this is really simple put up or shut up we've seen
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.800]  no proof of this they're just recycling allegations you've been saying say it again you want to
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:59.160]  go to Congress you want to testify they said they would before but you didn't die with
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:02.840]  the Polonium attack unfortunately so now that I guess they don't want to have you before
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:06.720]  them do they know in fact they don't even want to have public hearings because I think they
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:12.480]  know that that I would decimate them in public hearings so with Paul Manafort I spoke to
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:17.840]  Manafort late last night I read his statement in the New York Times he is confounded he
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:24.520]  also categorically denies that he's boggled he's boggled he's boggled because this is
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:29.280]  not made up whole cloth now let's get to the more important point John Brennan the former
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:35.360]  CIA director is the source of these stories I think the wrong person is being investigated
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:40.480]  here if somebody's being investigated it should be Mr. Brennan why is Brennan so incredibly
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:47.760]  arrogant well because I think he actually thought he would be reappointed to the CIA
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:53.960]  position by Donald Trump after all he came in under George Bush he was retained by Barack
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:27:00.760]  Obama how did this man who refused to be sworn on a Bible when he became CIA director who
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:06.000]  admits a long time involvement in the U.S. Communist Party and support for their candidate
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:12.120]  or president how did this man ever get confirmed by the U.S. Senate and now he's so delusional
[1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:16.640]  like like so many employees are they finally think that they're your boss this is total
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:20.640]  mental illness I mean I've never seen a CIA director go anywhere near this telling a president
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:25.800]  you watch yourself what the hell he actually said the president better watch his mouth
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:31.260]  that's the arrogance now watch your mouth it's even worse right so I mean look the real
[1:27:31.260 --> 1:27:37.440]  person the Attorney General session should be opening an inquiry to is Mr. Brennan it's
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:43.040]  time to really expose I agree so time to take the gloves off a criminal investigation of
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.960]  Brennan grab these leakers all of them and it's time it's time for them to be indicted
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:55.320]  they've committed crimes it's admitted absolutely true what else can Trump do because I mean
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:58.360]  they really think they're going to get him on this Russian stuff I mean Brennan really
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:03.880]  thinks he's the president of the United States the president should launch his own investigation
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:10.160]  could have to point the appropriate law enforcement officials in his administration I assume that
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:16.600]  that's justice to get to the bottom of this if justice cannot find any proof of the CIA
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:24.120]  claims then they should say so and put an end to this tedious nonsense but at the same
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:32.280]  time here's the real irony all of this leaking is illegal all of the spying on Trump officials
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:38.000]  is illegal this reminds me of the entire offensive of the Clinton people they didn't
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:43.200]  want to focus on the substance of the WikiLeaks they were wanted to focus or distract people
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:46.720]  to where those leaks came from that's right let me ask you this the time we have it's
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:50.640]  immaterial it's immaterial the leaks showed that they were criminals let me ask you this
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:54.440]  I mean just in your gut I talked to you days before you said Flynn's gone he's gone even
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:59.440]  though you think it's wrong and it was mis you know exaggeration I mean you'd tell me off
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:03.080]  record I'd say it on air before that yeah no Flynn's toast was your quote what do you
[1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:09.240]  think about Priebus how long can he hang on well I think he is going to be fairly entrenched
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:15.520]  here for a little bit I think he will ultimately go he seems to have the support of the president's
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:22.360]  son-in-law Jared Kushner but he's a liability they need somebody who's not in over his head
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:28.560]  and who's first and only loyalty is to the president you see the game here Alex is Brian's
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:35.480]  Priebus would like to limit the access anybody who has an independent line of communications
[1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:39.920]  to the president that's right he's clearly been meeting with Twitter and they blocked
[1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:46.160]  the public you understand that he insists on the vote amazing Roger we're going to have

[1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:05.120]  What conspiracy theories are running wild tonight about the Army's plan for a multi-state
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:10.640]  training exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15 well the military says it's just training
[1:33:10.640 --> 1:33:15.600]  soldiers for the realities of war critics say the army is preparing for modern day martial
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:21.880]  law we really didn't have the the violence that we see today the weaponry is totally
[1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:27.240]  different now than it wasn't in the beginning of my career plus you have a lot of people
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:31.160]  that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:53.800]  IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques I refuse to recognize you guys
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:34:22.000]  So I'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in Iraq but we're what kind of a situation
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:25.520]  in the U.S. would you see that happening I mean we've got a lot of Constitution lists
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:31.440]  and a lot of people that it's like power weapons a lot of a lot of I mean we've got a lot
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:35.760]  of Constitution lists and a lot of people that it's like power weapons a lot of a lot
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:41.440]  of ammunition they have and they have no weapons here locally so what happens at the PLR
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:48.560]  take off country run by terrorists ain't good bro America was founded by terrorists or terrorists
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:55.200]  what do you think the revolutionary war was history is determined by the victim how did
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:34:59.200]  you even get into the Marines who was the first service organization in the United States
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:25.160]  they tried to intimidate the British and they tried to they used that to violent your father
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:34.280]  jade helm troops who operate undetected amongst civilian population and of course the military
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:37.520]  people and the vets are not buying any of they're not stupid you can read about how
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:41.560]  it's to get the hearts and minds and how to get the public used to working and the local
[1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:46.360]  police working with the military I mean everybody's been in the military knows about the secret
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:51.920]  EOD program going on for 18 years their whole ordinance disposal you know quote the army
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:56.880]  is going to show up to defuse a bomb but then you get the internal agreements it's for everything
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:04.160]  from warrants service to checkpoints with military personnel in nondescript blue jumpsuits
[1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:09.040]  just like the army ranger called in and said they were wearing EPA blue jumpsuits it's
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:16.960]  always blue or tan jumpsuits and it might say EPA it might say police it might say
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:22.640]  park sirks training with the police training with locals in plain clothes quote doing suspicious
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:27.360]  activities is to train the police to work with the military and covert operations and
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:31.120]  to condition the military to accept it and to condition the public to accept it and then
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:37.160]  when we cover it and talk about it they practice the scyop in real time putting out this information
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:43.560]  I can see the script from army times to military dot com the stars and stripes to glimburg to
[1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:52.040]  daily beast to vice to the houston chronicle and no exaggeration today you go search jade
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:59.480]  helm there are now hundreds of articles and in almost all of them yours truly is being
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:05.960]  demonized jones is warned of an imminent takeover for decades keeps claiming it's going to happen
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:14.280]  but of course it never does no it never does checkpoints tsa open spine highway dividers
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:19.320]  being put up nationwide open manuals that the number one enemies veterans and gun owners
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:28.400]  and christians I mean come on this is the scyop all right that's from a couple years
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:33.120]  ago now it's been released by the pentagon in official videos and documents that they
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:38.360]  intend to occupy the united states that was the orders under obama for a collapse while
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:45.920]  the obama globalist forces have moved to create civil unrest and a dystopian atmosphere
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:50.440]  I'm not against the military I'm against it being used against the american people when
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:56.120]  the globalist trigger this collapse type scenario so after rob dude leaves us here in a moment
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:05.560]  I am going to get more into this ahead of our next guest joining us because again I cannot
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:11.960]  stress to you how incendiary how explosive how serious this time frame is we're all living
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:18.480]  and what we do is totally critical they didn't want a national debate about how the pentagons
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:22.680]  openly training to take over the united states under federal orders and to merge us with
[1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:28.400]  the UN and the globalist they don't want it known that China is openly announcing like
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:32.000]  we're idiots that they're going to help censor the web and work with zuckerberg and google
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:36.840]  and others it's all there it's in pc world but when we go oh look you're rolling it out
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:40.240]  see when they roll it out all positive they admit it we say hey we don't like that they
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:45.560]  go you're you're insane the military didn't invade texas in 2015 we never said that we
[1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:52.160]  said you're training to invade so see they changed the subject but now it's in the intercept
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:56.480]  it's in zero hedge because it's just links the army's own website they're announcing
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:01.880]  everything we told you from jade helm and they're pushing to get it out now that trumps
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:06.320]  in because they want to have a debate about this it's great to have the military for floods
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:10.600]  or fires or any type of disasters like that but to culturally run our society because
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:15.640]  it's collapsing we don't need that and it's not constitutional we need to restore power
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:19.040]  to the states and the people and we can take care of ourselves and the military can protect
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:23.040]  our borders and against foreign threats but this was the globalist model and it's happening
[1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:29.040]  all over the world just like the EU said two years ago now officially we will put EU troops
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:33.640]  inside every country take over your military or you're not allowed to leave because we're
[1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:37.720]  going to have insurrection because they bring in all the muslims they bring in the destabilization
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:44.800]  force and then this whole thing unfolds now just because I've learned how the media works
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:47.440]  and I want to take a story that's important but make it even more important I'm going
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:53.320]  to give you some insight baseball we get contacted by the vaccine group that is putting on the
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:58.720]  Robert De Niro Robert F. Kennedy vaccine event and they want us to come and be part
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:02.640]  of it and then they want to give us an exclusive interview with Robert De Niro my audience doesn't
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:06.000]  care about Robert De Niro I don't care about Robert De Niro he's in some movies he's a
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:14.760]  good actor big deal we're post celebrity culture I never liked it but our audience finally
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:22.760]  hates it thank God we're here and everybody gets this I was on a big TV show yesterday
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:26.400]  and and they're like absolutely we don't call anybody celebrities everybody hates that term
[1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:31.720]  but I told you I said it's a learning experience you can go to this because you want to go
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:33.760]  and then I said you're not going to get the Robert De Niro interview and I said they'll
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:36.840]  tell you you're going to get one and they're not going to get it they're just having you
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:41.680]  come to cover it because this is the culture in America manipulate everybody this is what
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:46.680]  Hollywood folks do when they do an event it's all about gaming everyone and manipulating
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:51.160]  the crew and who comes it's a Machiavellian thing it's like a snake biting you it can't
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:55.800]  help it well Eliza Scorpion you know attack the toad but but the reason I said do this
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:41:02.240]  is it's good that Trump is bringing in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I've had on the show who's
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:05.800]  right about vaccines being you know being dangerous and and and they're being serious
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:10.320]  problems and De Niro's had one of his kids hurt by this so you know he's a good guy on
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:14.520]  that front but I said Trump's the one actually travel in the country just yesterday calling
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:18.600]  for vaccines to be investigated and setting up a commission to bring attention to it and
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:22.880]  presidential support to go after Big Pharma and the crimes it's committed and the fact
[1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:26.320]  that they're giving liability protection and I said I want you to bring that up to him
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:29.040]  and he did and De Niro said I want to make this about Trump but if he does something
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:35.360]  good that's fine yeah something really good for real kids right De Niro because he really
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:41.200]  cares he's real he really wants to help people and so they got that question you know what
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:47.520]  it's not even worth playing Robert De Niro is that boring I've pissed on Robert De Niro
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:52.080]  hey Robert De Niro I go on Joe Rogan's podcast one of the biggest in the world and it becomes
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:56.360]  the biggest in world history brother I don't want to be a star I want to be free you're
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:42:00.880]  a joke that reads off teleprompters you really care about your kid and other people's kids
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:04.360]  you'd admit Trump was right but you don't do it because you're a coward that goes on
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:08.080]  shows and talks about punching people on the nose because you act like a tough guy in
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:12.800]  the movies you ever really beat somebody's brains up De Niro I bet you haven't no because
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:16.560]  I read about you and your dad the artists and all the rest of it I don't care your dad
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:20.920]  was gay no tip on the shoulder there but you were brought up a little candy-ass artist
[1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:29.760]  so stop acting like you're a tough guy and stop running our military down he's a crap
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:34.560]  so do is now on he can tell you how right I was everything I said happened exactly as
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:39.520]  I said and the only reason I say that is not from arrogance but so you know I know what
[1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:48.080]  I'm talking about because scum operates the same every time here's the thing I don't care
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:53.280]  about Robert De Niro I sent our crew to DC because I wanted to draw attention to the
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:58.760]  fact that people are trying to do something about vaccines and the good side of De Niro
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:03.960]  got intimidated into not showing on the film festivals a film about vaccines being dangerous
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:08.840]  but just everybody fluttering around trying to get Jenny McCarthy and people she's pretty
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:14.480]  nice to get behind exposing vaccines for you you need to do it yourself at city council
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:18.000]  you need to do it by showing people what's on the insert you're more important than the
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:23.800]  celebrities people don't want to hear what the damn celebrities have to say this whole
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:32.000]  broadcast is about not being in that orbit we're about changing the world bringing the
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:39.800]  power structures out of LA out of New York and returning it back to the people the globalist
[1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:43.880]  control everybody by these big images and then you got to go through them and you're
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:47.440]  nobody because you're not Robert De Niro or you're not any of these people Trump said
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:51.320]  in the speech it's about you and the power going back to you and what you do you're the
[1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:56.840]  rock stars you're the power start acting like it instead of being demoralized TV heads that
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:03.960]  walk around drooling all day it's a total luxury to just care less about status and
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:07.360]  care less about what your dumb neighbors that are in the status thing you want to drive
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:10.520]  a nice car because it's reliable and fun to drive you want to pool because it's fun for
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:15.080]  your kids to swim in you want to you know fly first class is your back's hurt that's fine
[1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:20.960]  but it's not about being a peacock up in a tree it's not about flapping your feathers
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:24.800]  around all day it's about what you actually stand for so I find it disgusting he goes
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:27.760]  on all these shows and calls for violence against Trump because he wants to punch him
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:34.080]  in the nose over and over again you're a coward you're a whip Robert De Niro you're such a
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:42.680]  piece of crap filth anyways go ahead you know because he's sick why don't you stand up for
[1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:47.600]  the kids that is just running your mouth go ahead do that did everything go according
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:52.520]  to how I said it would go well let me tell you what happened well once we got our questions

[1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:06.800]  why is my show even talking about Robert De Niro God every time people want to go cover
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:10.920]  celebrities it's pointless unless it's like somebody because they're interesting and smart
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:17.560]  like I don't know somebody like Ted Nugent or somebody like Jesse James anyways I'm so
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:22.480]  sorry go ahead Rob he said it was echoing he didn't want to hear it it's fine yeah it

[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:42.560]  the broadcast anymore just thinking about that little wimp Robert De Niro hopping around
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:49.800]  acting tough all day and just over and over again nobody listens to me nobody ever cares
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:56.240]  what I would say it's just unbelievable all these traders and all these enemies and all
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:06.920]  the scum everywhere I am just so sick of it oh god the sooner hollywood completely collapses
[1:46:06.920 --> 1:46:12.840]  and that whole pedophile palace goes down the better I just don't get how they'll have
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:15.840]  echo audio and then they can't even hear me when I'm talking to them get them back on
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:18.920]  I want I want everybody to hear what I told you was gonna happen what it up happens it's
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:26.680]  fun it's educational I'm not mad at dude folks I'm not mad at anybody I just this is just
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:31.400]  real this is a teleprompter this isn't a game I mean you know it's just I'm so sick of it
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:36.760]  all can you hear me now dude yes I can hear you fine okay tell us what I told you was
[1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:41.560]  gonna happen and what happened well you said that he probably will not give you an interview
[1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:46.640]  and what happened was after the press conference ended I actually talked to as one of his media
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:52.000]  guys they ushered him out he did two sound bites and left and I talked to when I was
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.880]  talking to Robert Kennedy we did get a sit down with him and then they stalled you and
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:57.760]  said don't worry we'll give you one later no I told you specifically they'll tell you
[1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:01.160]  they're gonna give you one later because they have no respect for you just so he'd get out
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:05.560]  of there and it's what's good things like we're like running after a dog turd like it's God
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:11.880]  that's what I can't stand you understand sure yeah go ahead and and but what what Robert
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:15.360]  Kennedy said is the media that was there and there wasn't a lot but there was some media
[1:47:15.360 --> 1:47:19.200]  there they probably none of them would have shown up had Robert De Niro not been there
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:23.520]  to be with it but then all they do is distort all of it I don't even care you understand
[1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:30.400]  how much I hate celebrities right oh no I know it's almost my religion but just go ahead
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:35.560]  right right well anyway beyond that the press conference I think was pretty powerful there
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:39.560]  were some impassioned people that spoke about this he's basically putting out a hundred
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:43.960]  thousand dollar award Robert Kennedy is along with Robert De Niro for anybody who can prove
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:48.680]  that mercury does not cause damage to little kids and we do have the neuron footage of
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:52.680]  how it destroys the neurons one of the most destructive things electrochemically in the
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:56.760]  brain everybody knows it right and and then he went and showed the studies he showed the
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:00.680]  studies that show it is toxic and bad for you and then he showed the studies that prove
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:04.840]  it's that how it's bad in vaccines and then he went showed the studies that shows how
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:08.840]  it's safe and there are none there are literally no studies and then he showed some manufactured
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:13.760]  studies that was even a smaller pile that they kind of put together the CDC and the
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:18.240]  medical community to say that oh it's safe enough for vaccines essentially so he went
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:23.520]  through the hoax he was a very impassioned speaker when De Niro got up he talked for
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:28.360]  literally 40 seconds he said I agree pretty much everything with Robert said and sat back
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:34.720]  down but there were other speakers there there's the DA of Bexar County or Bayer County and
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:38.520]  San Antonio was here he spoke out he's got two kids vaccine damage so there are a lot
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:43.400]  of people speaking out about this even one of minister Lewis Farrakhan's people was here
[1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:48.920]  and this guy's traveling all around the world and the country showing movies to people and
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:52.800]  these and these ladies they don't know he said these poor black ladies they don't know
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:55.560]  what's wrong with their kids and they see this movie and they put two and two together
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:48:59.280]  they're picking people up that are feigning they're having to you know pick people up
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:02.560]  off the floor because they knew something was wrong they knew it was the vaccines and
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:07.680]  they were told over and over again no it's not the vaccines yeah and I apologize for
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:11.560]  getting mad at the whole Robert De Niro thing it's not even the vaccine thing or him I'm
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:16.240]  glad that the good side of him is exposing this is one of his kids got hurt and then
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:19.880]  that's admirable but then saying he wants basically to overthrow Trump and punch him
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:23.800]  in the nose and physically attacking and all that I'm just mad at Michael Moore I'm mad
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:27.640]  at the whole thing and I'm sick of the Hollywood celebrity culture so I'm glad you went it
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:31.640]  was a good idea to go but as I said to interview the activists and the people that are there
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:37.280]  to care not about Robert De Niro I like the fact that Robert Kennedy Jr. goes around for
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:42.120]  like you know fighting this because he really cares my issue is is that I'm just so sick
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:46.080]  of chasing after Hollywood stuff it makes me physically sick that's all I'm saying so
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:50.040]  I have a little bit of repulsion sorry about blue it wasn't about you do no no it's fine
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:53.240]  I understand your passion too this is an issue that we've been talking about for years in
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:58.720]  info wars it's a it's an issue that we both have because we both have children and you
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:03.240]  know anytime you have children in the game it changes the dynamic it changes the perspective
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:08.840]  I was talking to the DA Niko Lahood he's got four kids two of his are vaccine damaged
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:13.200]  and two of them he didn't give vaccines oh yeah I've been wanting to get Niko Lahood
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:18.920]  on was he there in Washington yeah well he did he had a really great speech we we talked
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:23.240]  to him actually did another interview with him well good job good job getting Robert
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:27.760]  Kennedy Jr. good job getting Niko Lahood and good job and I'm glad you did get the thing
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:33.280]  into him about Trump and so make you believe all this jade helm martial law stuff and just
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:38.760]  and more saying install Hillary arrest Trump is getting crazy now there's a lot going on
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:44.800]  and so we all have to be vigilant we all have to do our part this is Robby reporting for
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:45.800]  info wars dot com on location in Washington DC all right great job buddy can't wait to
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:50.160]  see all those hd interviews that you and Zimmerman got to know we'll be we'll be back as I get
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:55.040]  into the open for preparation for total military takeover and the media I'll just say I made
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:58.040]  that up take that out of context and I'll show you the mainstream is I'm about to show
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:06.040]  you when we come back hi there dick Hall guyer here I was a mainstream television news reporter
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:12.840]  for over three decades I normally never do commercial endorsements I'm very skeptical
[1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:17.640]  of health supplements but a friend of mine told me about his experience with synergy
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:22.960]  one so I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now I
[1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:28.640]  very much dislike so-called energy boosters those little energy drinks that have caffeine
[1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:33.720]  and Gerona and other things that make your heart race this is not that my experience
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:39.720]  with synergy one has been great my mood is better my joints feel better I have more vigor

[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:42.280]  I told they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them and we
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:46.960]  need the intelligence community we don't know what's look at the Russian hacking without
[1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:51.800]  the intelligence community we wouldn't have discovered it look at that creepy enemy of
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:58.520]  this country I mean Schumer is just the worst what a slimy piece of crap God I'm so sick

[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:07.000]  for it I probably said too much about the narrow he's not that bad he just does some
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:13.680]  stupid cowardly stuff he does some good stuff as well so I apologize I'm in here with literally
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:18.600]  hundreds of government documents today admitting the collapse of America is planned martial
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:24.680]  law taking our guns it's all admitted it's now in mainstream news and do I get any you
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:29.040]  know thanks that I was right and expose in vaccines exactly what they're doing with them
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:34.200]  for 20 years and then you know the nearest people don't want to talk to us oh that's
[1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:38.640]  simple wars when it's his people that invited us to the damn thing that using us is what
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:43.360]  makes me mad that's where I got mad that fact I had to think back why I got mad I just started
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:47.040]  getting mad because I realized I don't like being used and I knew we're going to be used
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:52.800]  but here's the thing dummy we didn't come there to film you I want those activists I want
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:56.920]  those real people taking action I told do you're not going to get to the narrow interview
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:55:59.520]  then early as well now they're giving it to us too I said that they're gonna you're gonna
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:04.080]  hear he left they're just set you up that's a classic tactic and I'm right again and I'm
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:10.080]  not mad at do I'm mad at them because they're so stupid I think we like worship Robert DeNiro's
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:18.000]  here oh my gosh and all this other crap meanwhile I'm getting mad again excuse me meanwhile they're
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.480]  putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and all sorts of chemicals that are causing massive
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:28.400]  brain damage and the inserts say it the inserts of the flu vaccine I showed it says it can
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:33.040]  give you type 1 diabetes they go what do you mean that's genetic yeah if I shoot you in
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:39.320]  the head to your blade to death it's genetic you died yeah it eats your pancreas burns
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:46.240]  it out and autoimmune result every year people I know like oh my kid suddenly got type 1 nobody
[1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:50.280]  had the family we healthy what's going on did you take a vaccine they had a big fever
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:53.960]  and stuff funny that happened a few weeks before and then they were real sick and their
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:57:02.680]  sugar was young and I knew that 10 years ago now diabetes linked to the flu but it's
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:11.000]  the flu vaccine and it's on the insert but I'm a big evil conspiracy theorist by the
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:15.200]  way earlier I said hey guys I'm gonna drink some of it on air we make me some of the new
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:20.120]  caveman formula that's gonna be the total game changer at m4slife.com it's made just
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:23.000]  kind of put a scoop and it started up a little bit I look that doesn't taste as good as it
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:27.600]  usually does it was only like a half scoop you're supposed to shake it up in one of
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:33.600]  those little plastic shakers that you get for you know energy drinks or protein drinks
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:36.800]  and here's a little protein shaker of your TV viewer you pour that in on a couple ice
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:42.680]  cubes and folks it tastes when it's creamy and thick I think better than oval team and
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:48.520]  it is got all the bone broth and so much more this is why the ancients they believe were
[1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:51.720]  that such better bones were so much healthier you can look it up people they've dug up from
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:56.240]  10,000 years ago were twice as strong as we are here's Daily Mail how modern humans have
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:01.760]  become weaklings compared to our ancient ancestors who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:05.560]  here's another one human intelligence peak thousands of years ago we've been an intellectual
[1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:09.840]  and emotional decline ever since why are we getting so weak prehistoric humans were far
[1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:15.840]  smarter than previously assumed modern men are wimps according to new book and it goes
[1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:21.720]  on and on and on think fast we are really getting dumber forbs people getting dumber
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:25.640]  and that they figured out one of the big keys is we're indoors all day we're not outside
[1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:30.480]  that's basic but we're not competing and we're not getting what humans always thought was
[1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:36.920]  key the bone broth well now it's the next level of that it's caveman the ultimate paleo at
[1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:48.520]  info wars life dot com it's better than oval team it's like I never had a mix of that good
[1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:55.720]  this is like a chocolate shake the military industrial complex is trying to sabotage donald
[1:58:55.720 --> 1:59:01.080]  trump last night national security advisor michael flinn officially resigned this following
[1:59:01.080 --> 1:59:07.160]  reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with russia meanwhile the establishment
[1:59:07.160 --> 1:59:13.440]  media says this validates their conspiracy theory that russia hacked the u.s. elections
[1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:17.880]  they're also claiming that general flinn's conversation with the russian ambassador is
[1:59:17.880 --> 1:59:22.920]  a violation of the logan act but wait a minute where was the mainstream media during the
[1:59:22.920 --> 1:59:28.640]  builder bird conferences you know the secret group of global elitist ignored by the mainstream
[1:59:28.640 --> 1:59:35.080]  media as they privately meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy look the
[1:59:35.080 --> 1:59:41.560]  establishment wants to purge the trump administration and replace them with compromised washington
[1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:47.240]  insiders and globalists in other words they are trying to refill the swamp and you can
[1:59:47.240 --> 2:00:12.480]  learn more right now at info wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:21.280]  you found the front lines of the human awakening it's the info war and now alex jones there
[2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:26.200]  must be some kind of way now the info war changed the world okay buckley in about 80 seconds
[2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:29.400]  since the last break came out of his office they set a chair up he came in here he's on
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:34.960]  here my cousin and uh i said hey i need a glass of caveman because i'm gonna you know
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:38.800]  take it on here or a product and i'm not knocking who did it somebody's gonna put like a tiny
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:45.080]  scoop it was kind of some half warm water and i said oh no i like it on ice but i never
[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:51.920]  thought to put it because in in one of these protein shake shakers that buckley has and
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:55.080]  so he shook it up and gave me one he said try this because i said it tastes like oval
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:01:03.640]  team and is really good and it's the bone broth formula and more and then he shook it
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:07.440]  up the way that he did it with this this you could freeze this and this is we better than
[2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:16.440]  like bluebell chocolate ice cream hmm it's all natural it's unbelievable and i haven't
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:22.320]  even really rolled this out yet folks that the ancients cook the bones they were obsessed
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:27.360]  with the bones the broth they busted up they ate the uh marrow it was urban to a french
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:31.800]  steak house you know the marrow and it's open so delicious yes that's what this has and
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:36.480]  and caveman is just over the top what it does for your stamina your bones your ligaments
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:42.200]  it's got the collagen it's got everything in it the true life essence and it's got on
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:48.360]  top of that the turmeric root it's the ultimate antioxidant and seven other primal superfoods
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:55.320]  like the uh changa mushroom but again this thing doesn't have added as it doesn't have
[2:01:55.320 --> 2:02:03.400]  flavoring it's just unbelievable how this all comes together and taste so sweet and
[2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:11.240]  so good but i guess i guess the chicken broth and the multi-collagen complex blend um and
[2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:16.240]  the stevia and the alfalfa herb and the uh the stevia is all the sweetening the mushroom
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:21.320]  powder the bee pollen the turmeric uh and so many other things in here it's just the
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:24.920]  most delicious thing i've ever tasted and and and i'm honest like with the fruit punch
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:28.480]  i go yeah i kind of like this flavor better than that you know it's not perfect but it's
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:34.880]  really good for you with this this is literally better than like a wendy's frosty which is
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:39.600]  one of my favorites total junk food this tastes like a wendy's frosty what in the world so
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:43.840]  so how so folks know this tastes pretty good the way i stir it up how does it taste so good
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:47.920]  here because it's been shaken up with oxygen or what's going on i'm not sure i mean i've
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:51.920]  been i've been taking the bone broth the caveman bone broth formula for about a month and a
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:56.320]  half now because we got some before we ordered the big batch that we were testing a bunch
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:00.240]  of different versions of it everybody ran off with it q said it's the best thing ever
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:03.840]  everybody's trying it we try i try it and like it but the way you do it with ice is
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:09.440]  we tried some different flavors and uh basically what i do is i try to mix it with milk um and
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:13.520]  i just mix it really really hard and kind of foams up and it almost tastes like a milkshake
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:16.720]  i mean it really is oh wait that's why this tastes so much better than when i do it at
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:21.280]  home this has milk in it it does have milk okay well then great that's the no it's it's
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:26.960]  fine i mean literally this is teleprompter free i was like whoa it tastes like oval teen like good
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:31.600]  before but you still kind of taste the minerals and stuff but now with the milk that's why it
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:35.280]  tastes like the best milkshake ever okay there you go yeah absolutely it has that's the way
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:39.840]  i make it is with with milk and let me tell you i've you know i'm 42 years old i'm you know almost
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:44.960]  a year younger than alex and um i've been trying to stay healthy and try to work out as much as i
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:49.280]  can and these days i i try to hit the gym if i can like five times a week and i do some pretty
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:56.240]  brutal workouts and what k-man has done for me is that beyond the soreness that i feel in my muscles
[2:03:56.240 --> 2:04:00.960]  i always feel this soreness in my joints after i lift i have that now too something intense
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:04.640]  and when i was like 22 i could sit there and bench press you know 330 pounds
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:09.360]  and now i can still do it but it hurts too bad exactly k-man's been helping me it does the k-man
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:13.200]  alleviates that i think it has something to do with it i i'm not i'm not a scientist so i don't
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:17.280]  sure let's be clear we literally i was like man this tastes so good how'd you mix it now i know
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:21.280]  it's the milk but that's a great we should add a recipe deal that it tastes even better with milk
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:25.520]  but it already tastes great like oval team like this it tastes like a chocolate malt yeah absolutely
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:29.600]  i mean even even even if you mix it with water it's really palatable it's not that's good and in
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:34.160]  fact i have tried when we first got this stuff and we first got the the formulations they were
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:39.280]  sending over they were wretched and i know people that that like bone broth but they say i can't
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:43.840]  take that stuff because all the stuff that's on amazon and elsewhere it has it has a really
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:48.960]  tasty whatever reason the way we mix it with herbs and the cocoa tastes good absolutely this is the
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:53.280]  this is i can say without a doubt at least in my experience that this is literally this is a super

[2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:31.040]  because i just see open trees and everywhere i see the media calling for trumps overthrow his
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:39.040]  death i see the self-propelled tyrant michael moore calls for hillary to be installed as president
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:45.280]  once trump arrested michael moore now claims trump is a russian not just a russian agent he's actually
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:53.040]  a russian i know one thing you're an anti-american piece of garbage and a hypocrite white house is
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:56.960]  being sabotaged by intelligence industrial complex that's the leaders of the intelligence
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:02.320]  agencies the pentagon comes out and admits that obama had a plan for them to take over the united
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:06.320]  states during a collapse that's even being covered by the intercept now we're totally
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:13.760]  vindicated in triplicate in giant spades china is openly trying to manipulate the downfall of trump
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:18.240]  but the media just loves it and openly reports it like it's a good thing but then says the the russians
[2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:25.120]  though they're they're running everything too and so they have to be destroyed and meanwhile on every
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:33.440]  front the republicans are trying to block trump doubts grow that g.o.p
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:42.000]  can repeal obama care handing the democrats a big victory because the republicans helped
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:46.720]  write the bill and they helped pass it it's a big screw job but that's what trump does oh sorry
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:53.120]  executive order telling the irs not to put the fines on people that don't have obama cares is
[2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:56.720]  their private medical material they don't have to sit there and put it on the form so he just killed
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:04.240]  the fines from the irs right there and the media won't even tell you that i mean even the libertarians
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:08.880]  when they put out a milk toast are we go oh he he dealt a blow to uh they're not going to take
[2:10:08.880 --> 2:10:14.720]  the money from you know he just killed the penalty so now it's not forced so see that's
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:17.440]  why they're wanting dead that's why they got the cia trying to overthrow him at the top
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:23.120]  oh but the trump's the establishment and the liberals all want the the cia they now love
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:30.480]  so much to overthrow him what a group of horrible people now and beb Lindsey Graham and john mccain
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:37.200]  boy you people are just just so unintellectual so stupid again nobody's talking about chelsea's new
[2:10:37.200 --> 2:10:41.360]  book that calls for a global government to be run by the bill emily negates foundation with her at
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:46.320]  the head of it because the book was intended to be written and is when she won hillary was supposed
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:51.040]  to win and then uh again this is mainstream news reporting what we told you last week that she won't
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:55.920]  be getting to run the world government now for bill emily negates i got more medical news coming
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:01.040]  up gene editing now allowing specific circumstances oh they've been doing it a long time but now it's
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:08.480]  being announced that it's that it's happening now trump comes out and says flin's a great guy
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:13.360]  and the whole thing's very very sad but he wasn't specific that they mentioned it but he didn't
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:16.400]  talk about sanctions the russian said we'd like to talk to the president about sanctions that's
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:20.240]  totally normal to ask an incoming national security advisor the calls were set up were
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:29.360]  known to the president he made hundreds of calls and now they're saying he needs to be indicted
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:33.120]  but hillary she can have the secret server and do whatever she wants she can meet with putin
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:40.240]  secretly it's truly truly amazing meanwhile china warns us against fresh naval patrols in the south
[2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:52.960]  china sea now joining us is leo homan he's a writer with worldnet daily dot com he's an award
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:56.800]  winning investigative journalist who spent 28 years of his career at daily and weekly newspapers
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:01.200]  he is also managing editor of the triangle business journal in rollin with carolina
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:10.240]  and uh he has put out a new book and reports dealing with the invasion that is currently
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:16.800]  taking place in this country stealth invasion i'd say it's pretty open now that trump's in there
[2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:21.200]  but notice the state department's just ignoring trump and claiming you know he's a russian agent
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:24.960]  and the courts are ignoring him and they're just saying oh the president has got the power to
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:29.680]  control our borders even though it's written there in plain black and white we're seeing open
[2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:33.120]  rebellion you saw the american people rebel against the washington beltway and the corruption
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:38.080]  now they're saying we don't care we're gonna say you're all russians it is an america wants lower
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:42.720]  taxes and controlled borders it is an america that wants to be great again with low taxes no it's
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:47.440]  the russians well then if that was true which it isn't then i guess i'm for the russians then
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:51.600]  yes they're better than the scum in washington but no that's not what's happening and michael more
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:56.800]  again says he wants trump overthrown hillary installed we knew that was coming and they are
[2:12:56.800 --> 2:13:02.400]  organizing to make a real run at us and zucker berger and others are meeting with china and the
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:08.480]  washington post says china's scary lesson of the world since their internet works china weighs
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:14.800]  into our election so the arabia does but that's okay when they do it it's okay but it's amazing
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:20.960]  all right let's go to our guests uh and the book stealth invasion which again is from i believe it's
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:28.080]  published by world daily uh wnd.com uh uh mr uh ohman thank you so much uh for coming on the
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:32.800]  broadcast where should we start just to give people a breakdown a boil down of i mean what's
[2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:36.880]  really happening you're an expert on this all i know is i see articles every day where a rapist
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:41.280]  or a child rapist or an alleged rapist is being released or about to be released whether they're
[2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:45.600]  from mexico or iran wherever it is they seem to have more rights than i do i mean i wouldn't be
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:51.120]  raping a child but if i you know did i wouldn't be released i'm just told to go free i'm gonna show
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:55.920]  some articles in a moment what in the world's going on here from your research absolutely thanks
[2:13:55.920 --> 2:14:01.840]  for having me on today alex you bet uh yeah i started researching this back in the summer of
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:09.920]  2014 uh for world net daily and uh if you recall back then alex the big story in the news uh at
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:16.160]  that time was the central american children who were massing at our border the us mexican border
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:24.400]  and uh illegal asylum seekers uh massing at the border getting aid in shelter from a lot of religious
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:29.280]  institutions and left-wing community organizing groups it was a public attempt to collapse our
[2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:36.640]  border and only 70 were actually kids absolutely and so i started peeling back the layers on that
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:43.120]  and it led me to uh uh some other challenges uh that was illegal immigration but i started
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:49.760]  looking at a larger segment of the pie uh that nobody was talking about in the conservative
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:57.120]  liberal or or establishment media and that is the the bigger piece being legal immigration
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:03.760]  and i start as i started peeling back the layers of our legal immigration system uh i was finding
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:12.000]  that uh we're issuing 1.3 million green cards every year uh about 130 000 of those are coming
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  from nations that hate us and absolutely despise our values uh that's what phil haney talks about
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:23.120]  he watches people come in get the cards go back to pakistan back to saudi arabia and then come back
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:29.280]  and then watches them leave and blow stuff up exactly it's crazy and uh and that's just the
[2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:36.320]  permanent uh lawful residents green card holders 130 000 a year then i started looking at visas and
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:42.800]  our myriad visa programs and i found we had all kinds of avenues for more people to come in from
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:47.920]  middle eastern and north african countries that hate us they can come in on fiance visas they
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:53.520]  can come in on various types of work visas they can come in on entrepreneurial visas and run your
[2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:59.920]  local convenience store they can come in on preacher visas you know the r1 religious visa in
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:06.000]  which we invite uh thousands every year to come join us here in america from some of the most
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:12.720]  dastardly places on earth for uh radical islam people who have been uh who obtained their degrees
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:20.160]  in sharia law from al azar university in kairu or some other university in saudi arabia they have
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:25.040]  no respect or inkling about what american values stand for the first amendment freedom of speech
[2:16:25.040 --> 2:16:30.160]  freedom of religion what's that we're used to sharia law and these are the type of people
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:34.160]  we're inviting in what do you think the master plan is with the government covering up the
[2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:38.400]  stealth invasion and then acting like trump's insane because he doesn't want to commit suicide i
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:43.280]  mean i saw a big poll two out of three germans hate merkel but she's able to manipulate things
[2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:49.200]  and stay in office as she floods them with three million jihadis 80 military aged men so many
[2:16:49.200 --> 2:16:53.360]  rape stories a day and then they just they'll let them off for raping six-year-old kids
[2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:58.240]  with like a week in jail i mean it's like what is this worship of the most unwashed
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:04.160]  out of control barbarous people i mean i talked about jailo wanting open borders at the uh you
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:08.880]  know uh grammys and i said lady go to somalia for five minutes you're going to be gang raped
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:13.280]  the media said that i wanted her gang rape no i didn't i said go to somalia where women are
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:18.000]  sold on slave blocks one of the like three or four muslim countries still still sell women
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:24.400]  slaves right i mean i know isis is selling female slaves oh yeah and uh and and you mentioned europe
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:31.040]  i have a whole chapter in my book stealth invasion on europe and how and the basic premises here we
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:37.600]  have a model a real living model of our future right before us in the news every day if you
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:44.000]  want to find out what's going on read about germany read about france belgium sweden you
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:48.720]  know sweden was the world's most peaceful country a couple of decades ago now it's
[2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:53.680]  the rape capital of europe and it's number two worldwide in rapes per capita and why is that
[2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:58.240]  because in because in these orthodox as long countries a woman can be raped if she's unattended
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:03.760]  or not covered up and then she's the one that gets charged for the sexual crime that's the point
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:09.360]  alex these refugees are coming here and we're so called screening them if you listen to the
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:14.640]  talking points of the u.s. state department john carrey president obama and all of the hacks in
[2:18:14.640 --> 2:18:20.800]  between their talking points are very consistent they always say that these are the most vetted
[2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:27.200]  most scrutinized individuals of all immigrant types coming into the united states hogwash but i do
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:31.840]  give them credit for consistency in sticking to their talking points the truth is these folks
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:35.920]  are coming here with a lot of baggage sure i mean what about coming i'm not gonna put the
[2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:40.720]  whole clip again he love more hating he at least did tell the truth and say we're not vetting anything
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:46.080]  there's no vetting he did he came out and said there's nothing to vet against people in samalia the
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:49.680]  government of samalia the government they just issue stuff you can get in the cracker jack box
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:55.360]  exactly we don't even know who these people are who say they're syrians you can buy a syrian
[2:18:55.360 --> 2:19:00.720]  passport on the black market for a hundred dollars uh and same with samalia these are broken countries
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:06.640]  they have no law enforcement data against which we can vet uh and komie said this and guess what
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:11.600]  i had an article just last week about a state department insider who just retired a couple
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:16.400]  of months ago 25 years in the state department the majority of those years she served as a
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:22.960]  refugee coordinator on the ground in the middle east europe russia kyro and uh she visited these
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:27.920]  un refugee camps and by the way the un picks all of our refugees that were that's right that's why
[2:19:27.920 --> 2:19:32.560]  your book is so important you document that it's the it's the un picks who we then accept putting
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:36.960]  us under un control i'm gonna come back and talk about that have you on for full hour in the
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:42.800]  near future because this is so important of the book uh is absolutely critical people understand
[2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:46.400]  and i've even got mainstream news clips admitting i mean we could play some of those i guess we come
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:51.920]  back but everybody knows it uh that it's it's just all lies they're not vetting they've got fake
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:56.960]  passports so someone asked when we come back what do you think the plan is what are they gonna do

[2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:26.000]  dr. steven schenick on to get his take on the open spy war civil war going on in our country to
[2:24:26.640 --> 2:24:31.520]  say trump's a russian spy because his national security advisor talked to the russians on the
[2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:35.920]  phone that's what they do but then he didn't tell them all of it so he's gone i think that's
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:42.400]  blood in the water but uh stealth invasions on it's being exposed now they now see the president
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:46.960]  doesn't have the power to even control anybody just come on in from somalia which i mean you
[2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:52.960]  literally get kidnapped in five minutes if you're there but jaylo says bring people there i just
[2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:56.720]  said she should go there and enjoy it for herself i mean i hope she doesn't she would be kidnapped
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:01.600]  absolutely she'd probably be gang ripped and the media then acts like i'm attacking a woman they
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:06.000]  just love islam so let me ask you a question where do you think this is going i know you've
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:11.200]  documented it all in your book and it's it's it's it i know it's frustrating you being informed seeing
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:15.200]  the media lying about what's really happening some people should you know research the information
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:20.320]  but looking at the end game why would the globalists that already run this country in the west
[2:25:20.320 --> 2:25:27.440]  want to bring in a bunch of incompatible crazy people that's a great question alex in my opinion
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:35.520]  what we see is an unholy alliance between the secular globalist left and the religious globalist
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:41.200]  islamists exactly and you know that on the face of it they would seem to have little in common
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:49.280]  because you know you think of the secular left as being feminist and pro woman and pro gay rights
[2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:54.720]  and all that whereas islamists tend to not be too fond of those things but if you look a little
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:26:00.720]  deeper they really do have a lot in common these two we have footage all over the world
[2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:06.480]  germany the u.s of the leaders are islamic women and they're actually getting women to say
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:11.760]  that that that women's rights is now sharia i can't even believe it it's crazy but if you look
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:19.120]  at what they they share common enemies okay they they both have a common hatred of christianity and
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:26.960]  judaeo christian values they both have a disdain for national borders the muslims the islamists want
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:34.000]  a cat global caliphate the globalist secular people want a global super socialist state
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:39.520]  without borders they both believe in the nanny state sort of cradle to grave taking care of
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:45.600]  people sharia law has those same principles with in common with with the socialist and of course
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:51.360]  jihad on the islamist side you have jihad you know violent revolution and the socialists as we've
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:57.120]  seen are now getting more and more violent and are for all four revolution revolutionary overthrow
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:05.200]  of the american system they both also have a common disdain for free speech they are completely
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:10.480]  intolerant of free speech we saw that on the campus of berkeley last week and we see it all
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:15.520]  the time of course in muslim countries where you cannot speak out against islam or muhammad or
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:21.280]  anything that islam says is sacred it's a crime you can lose your head okay so they do have more
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:26.720]  in common than people think and i think they'll work out these differences after they accomplish
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:31.760]  their goal of having uh you know global control and and why do they want to flood our countries
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:38.880]  with refugees from the third world alex i think it's to break down society to cause instability
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:45.200]  divisions and wear down our social social cohesion and and what's left of patriotic
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:51.040]  nationalist americans hardworking middle-class americans uh i exactly they bring in the
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:56.240]  incompatible group they control it then they take our rights away saying we've angered them and then we
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:00.560]  get wiki leaks documents admitting it but i can't even keep track of all the articles here's fox seven
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:06.400]  austin ice detainer denied for man charged with repeatedly sexually assaulting young girl i have
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:11.440]  two of these in one week from different people in austin they just say raping kids reportedly you
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:18.160]  can go it's like a godlike status well it just gets crazier and crazier and then i have like five
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:22.640]  articles out of germany without even looking for them today where they're just letting people
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:27.920]  rape women or giving them a week in jail i mean it's just like what and now they're saying we are
[2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:31.840]  going to have to have days a week where women can't show their faces and swimming pools where
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:37.760]  burkits like adopted and like don't wear short dresses the the muslims might rape you and then
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:42.480]  that you like the liberal mayor comes out in the german city and says well the women are good looking
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:49.040]  at your fault it's not the muslims fault right they don't know that's illegal they and and alex
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:55.280]  again that's the harbinger ignorance of the law is no excuse germany and sweden are our future if
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:01.520]  we don't change course and do it quickly you you guys reported on twin falls idaho last year so did i
[2:29:01.520 --> 2:29:07.520]  and if you recall the backlash to that was was furious they did not want us to tell the truth
[2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:13.440]  about what happened there with the little five-year-old girl being sexually assaulted by three refugee
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:19.920]  boys and they were from iraq and sudan and they raped this this and the media said it was a hoax
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:25.200]  and then later it came out it was true and they're still saying it's a hoax alex it was fake news
[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:31.600]  they tell us yeah and i was recently berated by a retired supreme court justice in idaho who said
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:38.240]  that uh myself info wars and breitbart had it all wrong we were just uh you know everybody knows

[2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:22.400]  american people that ever actually elected trump it was the russians and trump comes out and points
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:27.840]  out these leaks are illegal but hasn't gone with the fact that saudi arabian others openly funded
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:33.040]  hillary because he just wants to move on and try to fix the country and he knows it's laughable
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:37.360]  but they're going to continue to cook it up and continue to call for his murder
[2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:40.480]  so they're trying to push trump into taking action but what else can he do
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:47.520]  do these are arrogant people and the american people back trump

[2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:58.960]  trending dot com i i i do every couple days i just thought this morning i get him on i don't
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:05.120]  know his view yet on what's happening but i know i know uh not in a bragging way because i don't
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:09.280]  actually like knowing these people and being involved in all this stuff but as much as i'm
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:14.160]  involved in everything obviously and with the big rollout under obama the military and the cia
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:20.960]  being publicly involved in domestic media uh that's what goes on so people have been authorized
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:26.000]  over the years and and i think it's backfired uh to actually reach out to the media and so
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.040]  good elements of the cia and other agencies have allowed the american people to vote and overthrow
[2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:34.720]  hillary who was going to steal it i mean chelsea had a book printed how they were going to run a
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:40.160]  global healthcare scam and global government i mean it's incredible and so there has been a
[2:38:40.160 --> 2:38:44.640]  counter coup against the globalist coup that was just wanting to bankrupt us with obama care
[2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:50.240]  and open borders and the islamic invasion all the rest of it that's all basically falling apart
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:55.360]  in europe wilders is going to win and the netherlands lapin's going to win she's way ahead and there's
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:39:00.240]  muslims burning paris down they won't call them muslims on the news they call anti police riots
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:06.880]  uh so the point is is that islam has exploded over a billion plus people i'm not against the
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:12.640]  average muslim but the radical really you know provincial ones are coming in they've been brought
[2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:19.040]  in with this weird globalist alliance between globalist uh corporate socialist and globalist islam
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:23.520]  who think they can coexist to take over and defeat the west and it's just not gonna happen
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:26.720]  you can get rid of trump you can do whatever the genie ain't going back in the bottle and
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:30.800]  i look at nancy polosi you're not knowing that bush isn't president anymore in the same press
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:37.360]  conference and uh then what waters you're not knowing what a lepo is and then saying the russians
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:43.760]  have invaded korea not even north or south folks you watch c span that these people think islands
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:49.520]  float so there are a lot of smart people in the technocracy and special interests that just want
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:54.240]  to make their money but no one's really even a central brain up there i'm kind of embarrassed we
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:40:01.840]  can't beat these people easier but they just act like a locus swarm of dis info and flin still hasn't
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:05.200]  apologized he said oh i'm sorry the president i wasn't totally clear but that's what a national
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:09.360]  security advisor does for my research and they even tacitly admit that and say well this is normal
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:15.440]  to make these calls but what were they doing being spied on by obama so this is huge i want to ask
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:19.760]  patrinic what his view is on this and i wanted to get to what should we do because michael more and
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:25.040]  others are saying overthrowing killing arresting it's all over the news just every major comedian
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:31.760]  newt you name it kill him kill him kill him this is like an organized civil war of a bunch of crazy
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:37.360]  people that don't even know what what what ends up and there's red brigades marching around attacking
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:43.200]  cat sanctuaries in austin it's like what i mean that these people are so nasty
[2:40:44.720 --> 2:40:49.440]  i don't even know i think that they're insane so i'm gonna ask dr patrinic who is a psychiatrist
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:53.040]  former head of psychological warfare for different agencies i know he has a lot of contacts he's not
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:57.680]  doing this for an agency but he's talked to the agencies i have connections obviously separate
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:04.240]  from patrinic pretty high level and the big contracting and and other groups and you know
[2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:09.440]  major groups that hook into all these things and they say it's like 90 anti-globalists and that
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:15.360]  they're done it's just it's written they're just laughing i don't see this as funny but the consensus
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:18.720]  is is that if they really try to get violent they're really gonna get their ass handed to them
[2:41:18.720 --> 2:41:23.040]  i don't know i just i am really concerned dr patrinic that's like a five-minute intro thanks
[2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:27.280]  for joining us on short notice t patrinic dot com co-wrote books with tom clancy hard to do all
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:32.720]  your bio it's so long co-founded delta force with general boykin and others what are we really
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:38.880]  looking at here you heard my little breakdown i think as usual you've articulated the emotional
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:44.800]  aspects of what's going on but it's really getting out of control not with you it's getting out of
[2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:51.760]  control with a lot of the comedians and the media what's happening is the media can no longer understand
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:59.520]  that flinn was not intended to remain in the national security agency that's news in other
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.400]  words when he was placed in there wait a minute i was told that by other sources yesterday man you
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:09.440]  really got some amazing i wasn't hold on i was told this was all a setup sorry go ahead all right
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.640]  i said it from the beginning that we put in flinn but it was not intended to keep them there
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:21.440]  all the time my flinn is an excellent general and defense intelligence agency many do not like
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:28.160]  him we knew that many do not agree with him we knew that at the same time it was flinn and bannon
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:34.800]  and a bunch of others who are able to get trump over the hump and into the presidency now i wrote
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:41.200]  a blog yesterday which you guys received and in that blog i simply said welcome to american
[2:42:41.200 --> 2:42:48.080]  entrepreneurship in other words we place people in positions then we take them out the chief of
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:56.480]  staff or the chief ceo which is what trump is comes in and fires fires and fires the reason
[2:42:56.480 --> 2:43:04.320]  why america is not used to this is america has become lazy it has become surfeit it has become
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:10.640]  non-capitalistic when we put a business man this is the first businessman in a hundred years who
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:17.840]  we've put into the presidency the first thing the businessman does and he correctly does is he fires
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:23.840]  the people who have helped him he fires the people who have not helped them and it's not personal
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:29.760]  we have no personal stake in this other than the fact that we wanted major change in the united
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:36.320]  states and that is what major change looks like you help somebody and then you leave the chief
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:42.400]  of staff may not be the chief of staff very much longer previous the person who's giving the press
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:50.480]  talk spicer may not be the next chief as a speaker and flinn knew very well that given his personality
[2:43:50.480 --> 2:43:56.080]  given the fact of how loyal he was to american to trump that that was enough to get him to the
[2:43:56.080 --> 2:44:01.600]  position that he needed to be and he knew he would have to leave now what in fact happened
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:06.880]  flinn did not commit any crimes neither did anybody in the trump administration let me
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:13.520]  go back to when i was in the reagan and bush administration when reagan and bush sent out
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:19.040]  of the individuals to iran while i was involved with the carter administration in the iran hostage
[2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:25.920]  siege so if they want to impose a logan act on flinn or anyone else in the trump administration
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:33.280]  they better go back to newt gingrich they better go back to reagan and his staff and to bush and
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:39.920]  his staff i do not think they want to do that there is no violation of the logan act there is no
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:46.240]  transaction that regards money sure but what is the total attempt to overthrow trump in the hysteria
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:50.560]  you're right it's crazy where's that coming from well it's coming from what you said and what we
[2:44:50.560 --> 2:44:57.520]  talked about when people are ineffectual and they have been aced out which is what happened to hillary
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:02.320]  it's what happened to bill clinton it's what's happened to the entire left it happened to the
[2:45:02.320 --> 2:45:08.480]  democratic party they didn't know how fast we were moving in and how quickly we could eviscerate them
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.440]  they're eviscerated everything else that's occurring is nothing but a bunch of sheeps
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:21.280]  bleeding out and complaining but it has no effect whatsoever if however they continue to make pronouncements
[2:45:21.280 --> 2:45:27.840]  like the following that trump is crazy which he is not that trump is mad which he is not and this
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:35.120]  is made by psychologists then i strongly recommend that trump and the administration file suit against
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:41.120]  the american psychiatric against the american psychological associates and against every physician
[2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:49.120]  who has positively stated that on tv including the comedians bill marr steve colbert john stewart
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:54.880]  or anyone else who makes that pronouncement that is beyond the freedom of speech that has to do with
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:46:00.880]  slander of a personality because they're using your professional guild their professional letters
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:06.960]  to then project across and and make a diagnosis try to ruin someone i mean that i mean that is the
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:12.720]  definition of of defamation that's correct but it's also medical malpractice when i saw a group
[2:46:12.720 --> 2:46:19.760]  of psychologists 30 of them none of whom i knew state categorically that trump had mental illness
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:28.560]  that was grounds for debauding them and delegitimizing their uh academic credentials there is no
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:34.720]  reason whatsoever for anybody to make that kind of diagnosis unless they have seen trump they have
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:40.240]  gone and talked to him and i would guarantee you that's not the conclusion you would come to
[2:46:40.240 --> 2:46:47.040]  however this kind of hysteria which is really created by the left and by the frustration
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:53.920]  and impotence of the comedians of the politicians is what we can expect but there will be limits
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:47:01.040]  that will be set now let me go back into why it's important that flin left flin understood that he had
[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:06.720]  a limited time within the national security agency it had nothing to do with bannon it had
[2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:12.800]  nothing to do with jared kushner it had much more to do with a much more important triumvirate which
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:19.120]  has a legitimacy in this administration and that triumvirate has to be james madis secretary of
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:29.120]  defense uh pompe the director of the cia and uh the other generals who are involved in taking care
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:36.080]  and maintaining our stability now what am i saying this is not a military coup what it is in fact is
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:44.320]  a disciplined highly professional staff who happen to have been military officers ran major institutions
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:50.720]  in the thousands and thousands who now are coming into the civilian ranks running the government as
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:56.560]  it should be a professional organization be it a business or military organization and they're
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:01.680]  cleaning out everything that's not used sure but the media is using it to then legitimize the whole
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:06.000]  russian thing and really create a hysteria just stop right there's i have to ask this question
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:10.240]  as you know foreign policies an arm of the washington post and the cfr and it kind of puts
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:14.240]  out what the establishment's really thinking they've come out and said the kremlin is really starting
[2:48:14.240 --> 2:48:20.560]  to worry about trump then it goes into okay we know trumps really not crazy he really is a nationalist
[2:48:20.560 --> 2:48:24.800]  has this plan to devolve power and america's gonna be so powerful through the global system now
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:28.960]  it's going to take over and we were actually going to weaken america through globalism so
[2:48:28.960 --> 2:48:33.360]  putin you really ought to be against trump because he really is meaning what he says he's going to do
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:38.480]  and really is a revolutionary and we're scared of him so the establishment communicating with itself
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:43.360]  in this two-day old article really tips their hand and they do this in a lot of other articles i mean
[2:48:43.360 --> 2:48:48.400]  they really know that trump look he is trying to get rid of the fines on obama care he is trying to
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:52.960]  control the borders he is really trying to get loans to main street instead of wall street and look
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:57.360]  at the economy takeoff goldman sacks has already made all this money just off of what trump did
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:03.120]  but they're still working against him i just don't get why they don't just back down well the key
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:09.280]  here is listen first of all most of goldman sacks is in the trump administration let's be frank uh
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:17.200]  mr cohen who was ceo of goldman sacks is a serious banker was asked he did not volunteer he was asked
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:23.920]  by a jarred questioner to come in to be head of the economic council you have minutiae who came in
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:28.000]  no i know but but but he brought but i'm saying he's he's blowing up the whole goldman sacks
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:33.280]  last ten-year plan well that's correct but at the same time let me be frank there are two elements
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:39.200]  that are going on it first trump is cleaning out our government and our institutions as if we were
[2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:46.160]  a nation state obama never treated us as a nation state was jr never treated us a nation state and
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:52.160]  neither did clinton they had no concept that this country was more than just a group of bureaucrats
[2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:59.200]  who ran an organization and made kumbaya now we're coming to very definitive points where we have to
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:04.960]  have trade with bilateral negotiations not multilateral where we have to sit down with the
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:10.640]  canadian leaders with the mexican leaders with the japanese leaders it's not an accident abbey
[2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:16.880]  who happens to be extremely bright and understands strategic positioning that he came very quickly
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:22.480]  to the united states to have a relationship with trump so what is the press highlight they don't
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:28.240]  understand the strategic importance of japan what they highlighted was the fact that there was a uh
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:35.280]  non-secure discussion in the dining room absolutely absurd the most important element of that visit
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:42.960]  was not the security was the fact that trump could take uh abbey prime minister abbey on a golf course
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:48.480]  and talk to him over hours that's exactly what eisenhower did with all of the foreign leaders
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:52.160]  sure he's actually trying to be president actually trying to make good deals for the us that are
[2:50:52.160 --> 2:50:57.280]  you know a both way not one way we'll be right back to talk about those specifically where all
[2:50:57.280 --> 2:51:00.880]  these calls for killing trump are going because i mean that's being green lighted by some big people

[2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:02.800]  am ashamed of just the all these slugs everywhere they don't want to work and it's almost all like
[2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:07.040]  little spoiled rotten white kids running around screaming or an effing white male and women in
[2:55:07.040 --> 2:55:13.680]  hegebs everywhere i see it in austin i saw it in dc you literally like there is lomifying the women
[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:19.280]  handing out hegebs and islamic women that call for shreya law run the the million woman march i was
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:23.280]  there and then women are chanting a la oct bar with their breast hanging out it's like total
[2:55:23.280 --> 2:55:27.280]  mental illness michael moore is like running around like a psychopath look at this article
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:32.400]  meetup.com fueling anti trump soros funded protest networking site pressures members of
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:36.080]  protest trump the state department is ignoring trump we can do five more minutes if you've got
[2:55:36.080 --> 2:55:40.160]  time but you can ask this question they're in rebellion against rex telesan they say they're
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:47.920]  going to try to defeat the russians in in uh france which is quote lapin's a russian agent
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:53.680]  this is all pure bs we saw the communist chinese and the saudi arabians involved in the election
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:56.880]  and it's just i can't so so i know you're wanting to say things are good and trump's
[2:55:56.880 --> 2:56:00.560]  trying to get a lot done what he said but i'll be honest it looks like a civil war on the federal
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:06.720]  government to me dr pacenic what do you say well it may be perceived as a civil war but you don't
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:14.080]  put a man like rex telesan who's run a 400 billion dollar corporation all over the world knows every
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:19.520]  country in the middle east and southeast asia better than any foreign service officer no i know
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:25.120]  he's great for the job he will clean out that state department i have run that state department
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:31.440]  and there have been 20 000 people you could easily clean out 10 000 i agree so so so i mean why is this
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:36.400]  going on right now then because i said they're frustrated when you're impotent and frustrated
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:42.240]  you go into rage into a childish rage and that's what's happening to the left can they affect the
[2:56:42.240 --> 2:56:47.920]  changes that we will implement no i can guarantee you none of the changes will occur there will be
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:51.520]  no impeachment hearings so is that why all the other people i talked to you say the intelligence
[2:56:51.520 --> 2:56:56.960]  community is almost completely behind trump that's correct those who were involved in putting trump
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:03.520]  in are behind him and that's a major number of people in both the civilian and military intelligence
[2:57:03.520 --> 2:57:08.160]  contrary to what you hear from the brandon and others who have left and will continue to ask
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:14.080]  my next question what is wrong with brennan what is his problem his problem was i don't want to get
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:19.200]  into brennan i mean brennan was an irish catholic who went to fortum he was not very bright he went
[2:57:19.200 --> 2:57:25.280]  to saudi arabia converted and when you don't have very bright people who have never really been trained
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:30.880]  to be professionals have never been in combat that's what you get you get the slugs of the
[2:57:30.880 --> 2:57:36.400]  intelligence community this is new intelligence communities way different than anything else
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:42.560]  the new man that we're getting is a naval commander vice admiral of the navy special forces
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:48.240]  he has far more talented in many ways than mike flint he will bring in his own team he will then
[2:57:48.240 --> 2:57:53.600]  get rid of those who were brought in by flint that is the nature sir i hope you're right stay over

[2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:11.760]  whistleblower william benny in an interview with alex jones said the spy grid is part of a world
[2:59:11.760 --> 2:59:17.920]  government takeover certainly it is the population control but not just of any given country but of
[2:59:17.920 --> 2:59:21.840]  the world i think that's probably what they're after in order to do that they have to be able to
[2:59:21.840 --> 2:59:27.440]  control the people of the world now despite assurances made by governments that the replacement
[2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:33.680]  of cash with a digital currency will make all our lives easier experts and whistleblowers
[2:59:33.680 --> 2:59:40.560]  disagree they say the cashless society is one big giant distraction to cover up the real agenda
[2:59:40.560 --> 2:59:47.280]  of a worldwide surveillance state i'm darin Mcbrane and you can learn more right now at info wars dot
[2:59:47.280 --> 3:00:00.000]  com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:21.920]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones all right let's be clear i'm not an
[3:00:21.920 --> 3:00:27.120]  actor people ask me all the time are you for real or is this an act it's for real but i'm letting
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:32.560]  myself be upset the machanics like you know be calm we're we're winning don't worry i understand
[3:00:32.560 --> 3:00:37.520]  that but i don't just want to be confident for its sake i agree globalism's in trouble it's broken
[3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:42.080]  it's delusional it's insane it's in trouble almost everybody i talk to low-level high-level
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:47.840]  military intelligence agencies they're all behind trump the higher levels of minorities are for
[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:52.160]  trump and what the media says his polls are up good things are happening i get we're in a good
[3:00:52.160 --> 3:00:57.440]  position but they're trying to just push hey kill trump so crazies try it uh they're openly
[3:00:57.440 --> 3:01:01.440]  acting very confident so i just don't want to be too overconfident here so when i get a little
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:06.880]  hysterical it's to get america to wake up and understand we won a major battle but not the
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:11.120]  war yet dr steve pacinic his self has been involved in regime change around the world
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:17.680]  and here in the united states uh and we're clearly witnessing them a say the democrats are saying
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:22.240]  we're going to overthrow trump we're going to remove them their mouth main mouthpieces are
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:28.000]  saying that now with him less than a month in so dr pacinic uh again you're saying you know
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:35.360]  basically everything's okay well what i'm saying is i and others who've been involved in regime
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:41.760]  change including this regime change can assure you that what you're seeing now is flailing
[3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:49.680]  consequences of having a very rapid knife cut right through the heart of the democratic
[3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:57.040]  party the nation and the fact that the people who wanted to bring back capitalism entrepreneurship
[3:01:57.040 --> 3:02:03.440]  have succeeded it's not something we're going to step back from but let me assure you the nsa the
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:10.400]  intelligence community the national security council the white house the secretary of defense
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:14.960]  the secretary of homeland security our people are in so good luck to the coup people our people
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:22.880]  are in so good luck the point is we created the counter coup we're now in control we're not amateurs
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:30.080]  at this we have done this for 30 to 40 years the soviet union is not our enemy neither is russia
[3:02:30.080 --> 3:02:35.600]  even when i took it down i said russia will always remain our ally our ally will be now
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:42.240]  saudi arabia israel dubai united after ever the new allies in the in the new system the new system
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:49.200]  allies and i gotta give credit to bb he brought together saudi arabia ua e dubai all sharing
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:55.040]  intelligence and they all want to work with jared kushner to bring a solution to the palestinians
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:03:00.960]  and israelis the israelis understand they're finally starting to roll over well i don't want to call
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:05.920]  it that i want to say it's a new approach they understand that for now the realignment in the
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:09.920]  middle east is legitimate and that's why trump said today we'll soon we're gonna be announcing some
[3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:17.040]  big things well because sirius wants peace bashar asad has had enough war he doesn't want
[3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:22.880]  any more war iran needs to reconstitute its government contrary to what other people said
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:29.360]  secretary of defense is leary of iran which is correct uh tell us and understands iran understands
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:34.080]  the middle east better than any other secretary of state i've ever seen or met before i haven't
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:39.840]  met the gentleman yet and the secretary of defense is in great control his all his allies
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:45.600]  so we're seeing a temper tantrum by just the dregs that are trying to act have a big you're
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:50.880]  right you're in the baby clinic now you're in the montessori school of democrats where they're
[3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:56.720]  crying and yelling booping in their diapers and basically can't do anything they're just screaming
[3:03:56.720 --> 3:04:02.960]  and pooping that's all it is for the most part we control the house we control the personnel we
[3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:08.480]  control the cash flows we control everything i'm not being complacent i'm just saying to the people
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:13.680]  who have watched your show have been part of the revolution the revolution hasn't just stopped it
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:19.680]  continues because part of that revolution is we clean out our own people we then clean out those
[3:04:19.680 --> 3:04:26.160]  who are in our way and then we continue to increase the growth we continue to make sure that america
[3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:32.800]  does attain ascendancy into being thank you so much for the time all i know is they start blowing
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:37.040]  stuff up and rioting i don't want to see too strong a response by trump but he has to respond to
[3:04:37.040 --> 3:04:42.320]  people trying to overthrow the government we there's no question about it but their attempt to overthrow
[3:04:42.320 --> 3:04:48.400]  won't even get to page one trust me i've been in regime change for too long we anticipated this we
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:55.120]  understood it from day one as i said to you very early on years ago we're going to have a major
[3:04:55.120 --> 3:04:59.520]  change we're going to have a counter to that tool will be effective and it's happening thank you

[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:45.920]  but one of the best voices out there he does it for pox news on a bunch of the channels but
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:51.680]  the problem is he does it too happy for those channels like oh it's alex jones the wonder
[3:08:51.680 --> 3:08:57.120]  someone seems to be just like it's alex jones and the fight for the republic worldwide because it
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:09:00.560]  really is that epic battle look we've got our president in he's doing everything he said he
[3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:06.000]  do and i just talked to steve pacenna who is hooked into the highest levels of the cia he's to run the
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:12.240]  psychological warfare operations i'm hooked into very high level cia myself and all these years
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:17.200]  people said you're cia you're with the cia and i said no i'm not and there's a bunch of articles
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:26.080]  saying what is jones gonna do now that his power structure is you know his people you know where's
[3:09:26.080 --> 3:09:31.040]  his conspiracy is going to go there's a total war to keep trump from fixing things and then if
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:37.040]  trump ever actually got a bunch of his stuff completed then i'd be a watchdog i'm not you know
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:41.600]  just loyal to trump because he's trump i'm loyal because he wants to restore the republic is where
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:47.520]  my kids have a future i'm totally committed but they think the listeners are dumb oh now that
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:51.360]  trump sin does alex not believe in the same conspiracy theories what like that the polls
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:56.800]  were fake and trump is going to win or it's been now released this week it's in the intercept and
[3:09:56.800 --> 3:10:02.560]  other news that the pentagon under obama was preparing for a total takeover during a collapse
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:08.320]  i'm totally proven right again i was told that by people high level and special forces i mean we
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:12.960]  don't make stuff up around here we told you a month before mitt romney would never be secretary of
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:18.000]  state because a certain person was the source on that isn't like to brag but uh he just i guess
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:24.080]  and read the tea leaves uh but the point is we don't shovel bs here and roger stone normally
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:28.720]  hosts uh every uh wednesday and the fourth hour he invited me to pop on with him uh some today so
[3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:32.080]  i'm here to the bottom of the hour here to 20 after and i'm gonna i'm gonna get in there for
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:35.920]  the nightly news and a bunch of big announcements but obviously michael moore's announced it it's
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:40.320]  all over the news the democrats are in press conferences we want to arrest trump we want to
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:46.080]  overthrow it we want to install hillary this is almost even better i mean the new old order
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:50.240]  really is going to go down if they try this nationalism the you know the nationalist is in
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:54.640]  the lead the presidential race the netherlands the nationalist is in the lead in france lepin
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:11:00.320]  and guess what same thing merkel two-thirds of germans and major polls say they hate her
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:05.520]  oh they're all russian spies that's right i was against obama care and gun control because
[3:11:05.520 --> 3:11:13.200]  putin did so this is asinine but he's in the new york times today him and mattiford why the the the
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:22.160]  the brennan the you know converted wahhabist he says he says they're russian spies or they talk to
[3:11:22.160 --> 3:11:28.400]  the russians and then mattiford says he's boggled because he never did it's the same recycled story
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:33.840]  three times the last time was january 20th this is crazy folks this is insane meanwhile the
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:39.840]  communist chinese all of them are in the news saying take trump out and silicon valley says china
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:46.880]  help us stop trump will help don't worry foreign powers openly involved communist country
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:54.400]  you know that's a nice tie roger stone nice suit i bet did putin help you put that on because
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:58.640]  everybody knows he helps us shave in the morning america couldn't vote and get trump we couldn't
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:02.960]  do anything we couldn't you know go expose his illegitimate black son and get the black vote
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:06.160]  we didn't have any effect you didn't have any effect you don't have a best-selling book the
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:11.040]  making of a president america's never succeeded before why i mean you've heard maxine waters
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:16.880]  trump had to be given the term uh crooked hillary from putin because trump couldn't think of her
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:24.000]  being crooked himself could he yeah alex you were exactly right on election night when you said to me
[3:12:25.040 --> 3:12:30.800]  this isn't the this isn't the end this is just the beginning in fact the biggest fight is ahead
[3:12:30.800 --> 3:12:37.840]  of us you are absolutely right the two-party duopoly and the establishment simply will not
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:44.480]  accede to the democratic election of donald trump and let him exercise his constitutional authority
[3:12:44.480 --> 3:12:52.720]  to reform our government and to uh make america great again they are going to resist this at every
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:58.880]  level including breaking the law if it's necessary including the illegal monitoring of
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:13:05.120]  u.s. government officials and the leaking of that information which is of course a felony
[3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:11.120]  precisely what's happened here in the case of general flinn and just to be clear i've been
[3:13:11.120 --> 3:13:15.680]  covering politics 20 years but i grew up getting mother's milk during the you know when you were
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:20.320]  there in the nixon administration watching the uh you know whole hearings in congress i everybody
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:24.000]  knows that an incoming group talks to all the diplomats and back and forth and that it's a
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:29.520]  president's sovereign purview as a separate branch of government to go sign treaties with the russians
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:34.880]  if he wants then congress has to ratify i mean the president can do whatever he wants with the
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:41.360]  russians then it gets judged by us the voters this idea that it violates the logan act that the tpp
[3:13:41.360 --> 3:13:46.880]  with hillary and obama secretly negotiating with private corporations the deal without congress
[3:13:46.880 --> 3:13:52.880]  and not letting them have a copy that's treason the head of state with his designants communicating
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:14:00.480]  with other heads of state is the exact purview of the chief executive no this is extraordinary uh it
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:07.760]  is entirely appropriate for general flinn to uh make contact with the russians to set up uh you
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:16.480]  know a an initial congratulatory call between the new president uh and the head of the russian state
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:23.280]  we know from the transcripts that there was no substantive discussion of sanctions uh and we
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:30.240]  know from a review by the white house counsel's office that general flinn violated no laws this
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:37.360]  was typical inside the beltway lynching this is previous and let's just say it and i like him
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:41.680]  it's the vice president it's the big republican establishment swinging their wheelies around
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:49.040]  yeah there's no question about it and as uh dr coursey wrote today at info wars is exactly right
[3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:56.880]  the game plan here is very simple purge the trump loyalists first general flinn then the very capable
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:03.760]  steven miller and then finally the president's chief issues man steve bannon the problem here
[3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:10.640]  for them for the republican establishment is that we trump loyalists are not going to stand for it
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:17.520]  there is zero chance we will let this happen and if we have to mobilize the grassroots
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:23.440]  to make sure the president knows we have his back i'm prepared to do so and i know you are as well
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:27.840]  i get why he had to bring previous in them and because that's a big system to run he wanted
[3:15:27.840 --> 3:15:31.440]  to work with him but they're such and then ryan gets on tv and says i'm going to work with him
[3:15:31.440 --> 3:15:37.760]  he looked like a weasel like eddie haskell when he said it and now we know previous is the leaker
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:41.280]  on a lot of this stuff it's come even mainstream media and i know we have sources
[3:15:41.280 --> 3:15:45.680]  who've talked to the little guy so he better i mean you know here's the deal we're just going
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:49.600]  to get a data package together obviously everybody but do it through twitter you name it the public
[3:15:49.600 --> 3:15:54.240]  it's not just roger and i he hears the public and i'm doing a big story on this tonight it's
[3:15:54.240 --> 3:15:59.360]  confirmed for two weeks no one's allowed to get in the twitter feed where he can read it but hundreds
[3:15:59.360 --> 3:16:04.320]  down they block it so he doesn't see your link doesn't read your article doesn't retweet you okay
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:10.400]  they're trying to cut him off okay and so they don't even let you uh get to the president now
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:14.800]  they only put haters up at the top and previous has been meeting with twitter this is all a
[3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:21.120]  disgusting little action so this is incredible they're trying to cut trump off from the american
[3:16:21.120 --> 3:16:26.560]  people and it's disgusting and it's an example of how controlled this is if they can censor
[3:16:26.560 --> 3:16:33.120]  and hijack the president's feed and it's not even in the news then folks imagine what else is going
[3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:38.960]  on remember a month ago they said let's ban the president off twitter roger where does this go
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:44.640]  no it's really extraordinary alex you know i pick up the paper and i read that the president's
[3:16:44.640 --> 3:16:50.240]  son-in-law jared kushner who i have a very high regard for is meeting with the captains of of
[3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:57.280]  silicone valley as if they are our friends let's be very clear google particularly facebook sought
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:05.040]  undermined donald trump in this campaign fiddled with their seo to try to bury uh uh bad news
[3:17:05.040 --> 3:17:12.960]  about hillary clinton elevate any criticism of donald trump these folks are not our friends
[3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:19.520]  again dr jerry coursey has done extraordinary research into google's efforts to infiltrate
[3:17:19.520 --> 3:17:25.840]  this administration so they can have the kind of advantages and the kind of inside uh fix on the
[3:17:25.840 --> 3:17:32.960]  issues they care about that they enjoyed under eight years of barack obama the silicone valley
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:41.440]  crowd the wall street crowd the inside the beltway lobbyist culture uh and the establishment republican
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:48.880]  party are not our friends they are not part of the reagan rebel pardon me of the trump revolution
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:56.080]  little protean slip there uh they are they are doing everything possible they can to foot drag
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:18:04.000]  and now i'm increasingly concerned that rince previs is inserting himself into the selection
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:12.000]  of ambassadors is going to give us people who are unqualified as dr coursey broke the news today
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:18.400]  previs circumvented the state department violated a commitment that was given to the secretary of
[3:18:18.400 --> 3:18:25.760]  state rex tillerson that he would have the ability to interview the candidates for the absolutely
[3:18:25.760 --> 3:18:33.120]  strategically key embassies and instead now those jobs are going to r n c he should be fired right
[3:18:33.120 --> 3:18:38.160]  there he's off he's off the republican party donors that trump got none of the money from
[3:18:38.160 --> 3:18:43.280]  he doesn't want their money he's kicking them out of politics why the hell are all these these
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:48.880]  tough all these peacocks all these narcissists that want to go stand around at embassies and act
[3:18:48.880 --> 3:18:53.840]  like they're fancies pants and have these stupid parties why are all these want to be first and
[3:18:53.840 --> 3:19:00.560]  how the thirds even being allowed in well we only minutes ago we got word that the nominee for
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:08.560]  secretary of labor andy puzzler is withdrawing his name where did his name come from to begin with
[3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:14.080]  i can answer that in two words rights previs and by the way that's see how we're on target see how
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:18.400]  that's in course he's uh headline i just trust coursey three number one new york times best
[3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:23.280]  sellers all of his key deals absolutely upsetting two elections i don't know his sources but he's
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:28.160]  been in dc he's moved there back there he's at these meetings and he said that it is incredible
[3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:32.800]  what's going on with previs and there is no doubt there is if we'll put his article on screen there
[3:19:32.800 --> 3:19:36.480]  is no doubt that previs is one of the prime leakers here it is previs next to go as trump
[3:19:36.480 --> 3:19:41.760]  strikes back over flin i talked to some of my uh folks that are connected into the intelligence
[3:19:41.760 --> 3:19:46.480]  agencies and again i'm not with an intelligence agency i'm an independent american citizen
[3:19:46.480 --> 3:19:50.320]  the most the intelligence agencies are totally against the globalists because they're sick of it
[3:19:50.320 --> 3:19:54.800]  they want america back so that you know all they're doing is confirming or denying info for me so i
[3:19:54.800 --> 3:19:59.760]  know but they say that uh it looks like the fate of previs is still not known i guess that's in
[3:19:59.760 --> 3:20:08.960]  trump's brain well in an odd sense while the uh flin ouster may be a catalyst it may be the beginning
[3:20:08.960 --> 3:20:14.880]  of the dominoes that end with the fall of mr previs they have also run interference because
[3:20:14.880 --> 3:20:22.720]  this is a much bigger story than the mismanagement of the white house uh and the leaking uh of
[3:20:22.720 --> 3:20:28.320]  information from white house staffers that make the president look foolish let's be clear that
[3:20:28.320 --> 3:20:32.800]  chris ruddy got called up by high-level players as high as they go except the president and told
[3:20:32.800 --> 3:20:38.160]  police backtrack on this and i'm not going to get into the rest of it but uh i mean that that went
[3:20:38.160 --> 3:20:43.440]  on he admitted that happened yeah on the other hand i still don't think this will stand is my
[3:20:43.440 --> 3:20:49.280]  understanding that rince previs and steve bannon who i have a very high regard for and have
[3:20:49.280 --> 3:20:56.080]  defended in a dozen forums from the outrageous attacks on him that he is an anti-semite or a
[3:20:56.080 --> 3:21:02.800]  bigot or a nativist all those things are false uh they're doing these joint press these joint
[3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:07.760]  telephone calls with reporters telling them how much they love each other and how they work so
[3:21:07.760 --> 3:21:14.800]  closely together these are like hostage videos alex they're being forced to say those things at least
[3:21:14.800 --> 3:21:22.080]  in this case i think bannon is he's a good man but he ought to be aware that he is on previs's
[3:21:22.080 --> 3:21:27.600]  target list next right after the very capable steven miller well it's funny you know they have the
[3:21:27.600 --> 3:21:32.560]  public policy uh kind of foreign affairs branch the washington post came out admitted an article
[3:21:32.560 --> 3:21:36.400]  we covered a lot the last few days that okay trump's really for real he's a nationalist he wants
[3:21:36.400 --> 3:21:41.200]  prosperity america's going to take over the whole globalist system basically and russia better watch
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:44.560]  out because globalists were going to work with russia but trump's actually just going to be totally
[3:21:44.560 --> 3:21:49.120]  dominant so we hope the russians that understand that and they admit that bannon and trump and
[3:21:49.120 --> 3:21:53.440]  everybody just want americana and good deals for us and the truth is that we just get these deals
[3:21:53.440 --> 3:21:58.080]  before they can plunge the economy it's game over we're going to dominate everybody i mean give me
[3:21:58.080 --> 3:22:02.400]  a break china's tottering on the edge of collapse so why doesn't the globalists just get out of the
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:09.120]  way and let the united states of america dominate here's what really bothers them alex they realize
[3:22:09.680 --> 3:22:15.520]  that we could be on the verge of peace in latimer putin and donald trump you have two
[3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:25.200]  very very tough guys two very stubborn guys two guys who have the best interests of their respective
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:31.840]  countries at heart i am convinced that if rejnath and nixon can hammer out an agreement on the
[3:22:31.840 --> 3:22:40.800]  strategic arms limitations then trump and putin can make a deal for peace and the bureaucracy
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:45.680]  admits they don't want that and and and they admit that russia wants to do deals and not get
[3:22:45.680 --> 3:22:49.440]  bankrupted by a new cold war we don't want to be bankrupted by one there'll be plenty of defense
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:54.640]  spending plenty of issues it's ridiculous we shouldn't sit here because the neo cons want
[3:22:54.640 --> 3:22:59.680]  to reconquer russia because trotsky got kicked out and they've still got a hard on for the russians
[3:22:59.680 --> 3:23:04.800]  because they got to kill so many of them they're blood thirsty for them i think we all know what
[3:23:04.800 --> 3:23:11.520]  this is really about hillary clinton had promised the boys at langley and the folks at the pentagon
[3:23:11.520 --> 3:23:18.880]  that they would have a wider proxy war in syria they were licking their chops over a no fly zone
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:23.760]  god we could get world war three wouldn't that be great this is how the neo cons think
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:29.920]  donald trump has no intention of going out provoking an unnecessary and by the way the pentagon
[3:23:29.920 --> 3:23:34.720]  the pentagon it was it was one that helped block the neo cons on this and let's take net and yahu
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:39.200]  they claim all over the neo cons net and yahu is even signaling he doesn't want big wars and wants
[3:23:39.200 --> 3:23:44.960]  to stop this what does that mean well because i look he is another leader who has the best
[3:23:44.960 --> 3:23:52.240]  interest in it of his country at heart war is good for no one other than the defense contractors
[3:23:52.240 --> 3:23:57.280]  and many of hillary clinton's biggest donors to the clinton foundation steve pacinic with his
[3:23:57.280 --> 3:24:03.840]  sources and i have mine as well they say look this is like babies throwing fits uh you know
[3:24:03.840 --> 3:24:08.640]  everybody's saying kill trump overthrowing uh he's you know the press covers are saying he's
[3:24:08.640 --> 3:24:13.760]  a russian agent it's going nowhere well then why get rid of flin when trump even today with that
[3:24:13.760 --> 3:24:18.480]  yahu said i like him you know he flins a great guy why have you know the press secretary say well
[3:24:18.480 --> 3:24:22.560]  it was a trust issue and he just didn't tell him the truth when he said no we didn't substantively
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:26.800]  discuss sanctions the russians just said they wanted to talk about sanctions with the president
[3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:31.840]  that's what that's what you do as the national security advisor yeah it's it's a gender setting
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:39.280]  this was very sadly uh a typical inside the beltway lynching general flin who is a i think a great
[3:24:39.280 --> 3:24:48.560]  man and a great patriot and a man who understands the dangers of of islamic uh a terrorism uh has
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:58.000]  been pushed out over what could have been contained he broke no laws he acted appropriately uh he merely
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:04.880]  had to uh apologize to the president for a protocol breach and we could have moved on you told me
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:09.360]  that yesterday it looked like trump got stampeded like previous does recall people in says they're
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:14.720]  fired the person gets depressed goes in and resigns and it kind of says like he was told so he resigned
[3:25:14.720 --> 3:25:19.040]  and went and apologized and trump looked like today he got he wasn't playing good cop as i know
[3:25:19.040 --> 3:25:23.280]  for people that have said he doesn't play good cop bad cop he'll fire if you're really firing you
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:27.920]  he's like well flin's a really great god too bad this happened almost like he wasn't behind that
[3:25:29.120 --> 3:25:34.240]  yeah perhaps the president is looking at all the facts and the world went into the last 48 hours
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:42.000]  and and uh he's come to that conclusion look i also don't think sean spicer is doing the president
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:46.080]  any good by the way trump called it a criminal attack on a wonderful man trump ramps up war
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:50.400]  on his own spies as he rages against democrats leakers who he legally brought down disgrace
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:55.520]  my friend yeah in fact i was heard this from little birds and now it's pretty much confirmed by this
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:25:59.920]  they stampeded him just like they tried with can i say the other guy's name you know in the meetings
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:03.120]  where they say you you know you've got to resign and then he goes i want to talk to the president
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:10.000]  it's not true and anthony scaramucci well thought of in conservative and trump supporters circles
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:17.120]  hanging in limbo even as we speak appointed a liaison to the business community by the president
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:24.560]  but yet to be sworn in again right previs is jealous of the fact that anthony scaramucci
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:29.680]  has a direct personal relationship with the president and can communicate with him that was
[3:26:29.680 --> 3:26:35.920]  his same problem with general flin mr previs would like to be the source of all information
[3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:41.840]  for the president and that shows he doesn't know donald trump well it's clear now it all
[3:26:41.840 --> 3:26:45.760]  just crystallized with trump statements and everything it was the previous they admitted
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:50.240]  they went to flin and basically the vice president went to him and they said okay you're bad flin
[3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:54.560]  said okay haven't anything wrong but if i miss if i didn't answer perfectly here i just resigned
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:58.800]  it looks like they manipulated him into resigning but maybe it'll turn out good but i just now
[3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:02.720]  trump is on i've never seen he's like flin's really wonderful he he's a great guy this is
[3:27:02.720 --> 3:27:08.640]  horrible this happened this looks really bad well i look i'm hoping that general flin remains in
[3:27:08.640 --> 3:27:13.200]  the public eye remains in public life and will continue speaking out because i think he still
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:19.760]  has a very valuable role to play uh and then alex said this this whole week gets topped off
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:27.040]  by picking up the newspaper this morning and reading in order to coincide with this flin
[3:27:27.040 --> 3:27:34.560]  flap the new york times essentially recycled their story from june 20th reiterating again the
[3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:41.760]  completely bogus and false allegation that paul maniforte my former partner chairman of the
[3:27:41.760 --> 3:27:47.600]  trump campaign during the summer and into the convention and that i were continuously under
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:53.920]  communication it's continuously is the headline at cnn continuously in communication with the russians
[3:27:53.920 --> 3:27:59.600]  and maniforte says i'm boggled i talked to no one no look my wife called minutes ago
[3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:06.800]  she saw my photo flash up on cnn and she said wait a minute you didn't talk to any russians did you
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:14.880]  and you know the answer absolutely categorically not i spoke to no russians no intermediaries for
[3:28:14.880 --> 3:28:22.320]  the russians no representatives of the russians i have no russian clients no russian contacts no russian
[3:28:22.320 --> 3:28:27.760]  money and have never spoken to anybody in russia here's what's happening they're targeting everybody
[3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:31.600]  they know are good advisers off the record and trump is saying they've been spotted as potential
[3:28:31.600 --> 3:28:36.800]  russians you can't talk to them now and no flin's are russian and now michael boar says trump's are
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:41.920]  russian and at a certain point this this he's the president he can talk to every once this is a load
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:47.440]  of horsemen there and he's gotta just go ahead and just point out it is and start an investigation
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:51.920]  of hillary with the sari arabians and kami chinese i think the answer is the offense i'm gonna turn
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:55.760]  the baton over to you my friend but your books available at info war store dot com we have a new

[3:29:00.400 --> 3:29:05.280]  roger i mean what does trump do doesn't he go on the offense he needs to not only go in the
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:12.000]  off lens alex but he needs to clean house he needs to clean house at the white house there are many
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:19.760]  many capable republican operatives who were for donald trump from the beginning who sacrificed to
[3:29:19.760 --> 3:29:27.120]  help get him elected who are more than capable of handling these mechanical jobs at the white house
[3:29:27.120 --> 3:29:32.800]  there are many fine people who could be assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries in the
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:38.720]  departments who are capable individuals who supported donald trump from the beginning
[3:29:38.720 --> 3:29:44.640]  who share his world view we need to repopulate this administration absolutely and just get
[3:29:44.640 --> 3:29:50.000]  rid of the paul ryan tentacle mr penis excuse me mr previs we'll be back roger stone takes over

[3:33:24.560 --> 3:33:30.080]  welcome back to info wars i have just picked up the torch from the great alex jones for the
[3:33:30.080 --> 3:33:36.880]  balance of power uh and joining me now is andrew kerr of the citizens audit talk about one of my
[3:33:36.880 --> 3:33:42.400]  favorite subjects a weasel that we need to keep our eyes on very carefully and that is the former
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:50.640]  conservative flip-flop artist and liberal hitman david brough now mr brough uh fronts a number of
[3:33:50.640 --> 3:33:58.640]  organizations that he claims are monitors of the media or or monitors of public public ethics
[3:33:58.640 --> 3:34:05.600]  but in fact these are all propaganda organizations designed to cover up the many crimes of bill
[3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:12.640]  and hillary and chelsea clinton uh into hurl invective and personal insults smears as it were
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:19.200]  against anybody who has the courage to speak out against the clinton's or the political status
[3:34:19.200 --> 3:34:26.640]  quo in washington i estimate that mr brough probably burned through perhaps 30 to 40 million
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:34.880]  dollars in the last election having absolutely positively nothing to show for it now comes
[3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:42.720]  amazing new research by dr jerome coursey showing that brock is in bed with both google and facebook
[3:34:42.720 --> 3:34:50.160]  attempting to censor critics of the clinton's and advocates for president trump so to help us
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:58.160]  keep an eye on what illegal activity mr brock is involved in now andrew kerr joins us from citizens
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:05.120]  audit welcome andrew to info wars dot com thanks roger it's the honor to be speaking with you right
[3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:13.840]  now so you have done some extraordinary work uh and i always enjoy reading the updates on your
[3:35:13.840 --> 3:35:22.000]  site tell our listeners who mr brock is where he came from and what he's done he's like he says
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:27.920]  he's a former conservative author um he he wrote the true story of anita hill um back in the early
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:35.120]  90s and he was commissioned to essentially write a hit piece on hillary clinton or yeah on the clinton's
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:41.040]  in um in the late 90s and he came out of that being a staunch ally of them he did a total
[3:35:41.040 --> 3:35:47.840]  ideological switch um ended up founding an organization called media matters for america um
[3:35:47.840 --> 3:35:55.360]  a supposed watchdog a conservative media watchdog information fact-checker and since then uh
[3:35:56.480 --> 3:36:02.320]  he's he's got a total of uh of 14 entities that he's running out of this office space a variety of
[3:36:02.320 --> 3:36:09.920]  uh supposed nonprofits foundations uh and super packs uh that were uh working directly with the
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:15.600]  the clinton campaign during this previous election season and yeah he probably did burn through a you
[3:36:15.600 --> 3:36:21.200]  know 30 or 40 million dollars and just a couple weeks ago he was asking for another 40 million
[3:36:21.200 --> 3:36:27.760]  dollars from his network of donors um you know for for round two now that you know now the trump
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:37.200]  is empowered well uh i evidently his manifesto leaked um i've seen a copy of it uh dr coursey
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:42.640]  seen a copy and i know you have seen a copy of it it's quite grandiose he takes enormous credit
[3:36:42.640 --> 3:36:48.720]  for things that in fact he had nothing to do with uh it's amazing to me that based on my
[3:36:48.720 --> 3:36:56.800]  calculation uh bill and hillary clinton probably spent spent upwards of two billion dollars uh in
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:04.080]  their efforts to seize the white house uh the cost of the mainstream media coverage of the
[3:37:04.080 --> 3:37:12.560]  campaign which was really one long hillary clinton commercial um that in itself is millions of dollars
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:20.000]  now you figure in the manipulations of facebook the manipulations of google it's really a miracle
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:27.920]  that donald trump won given all that he faced uh i am under the impression that based on a very
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:34.560]  comprehensive and well-drafted complaint at the federal election commission that mr brock has broken
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:41.280]  multiple laws that he has been shuffling money between non-profit entities hard money entities
[3:37:41.840 --> 3:37:47.680]  and so on i know this if i did this or if you did andrew we'd already be in jail
[3:37:49.280 --> 3:37:53.760]  exactly and and and that's the problem is that we have the media matters for america is is a
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:38:00.480]  charity it's a um it's supposed to be a charitable organization and here's a snip from their fundraising
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:05.520]  document from a couple weeks ago media matters has already secured access to raw data from facebook
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:11.120]  twitter and social media sites we will now develop technologies and processes to systematically
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:18.160]  monitor and analyze this unfiltered data so they have a they have a line into social media sites
[3:38:18.160 --> 3:38:23.440]  in order to review the data analyze the data mine it and here's what they plan to do with it
[3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:28.480]  this is their top outcomes over the next four years media matters will focus on exposing
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:33.200]  serial misinformers and right-wing propagandists and having everything from social media to the
[3:38:33.200 --> 3:38:39.280]  highest levels of government uh internet and social media platforms will no longer uncritically
[3:38:39.280 --> 3:38:45.120]  and without consequence host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists so what they're saying is
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:51.040]  you know it's one thing to go after roger stone which they have uh and we'll get to that in the
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:55.360]  second but it's not what they're saying is that they're going to go after individuals on social
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:39:01.680]  media if they determine those people to be serial misinformers and we have to ask ourselves is that
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:06.160]  what a charitable organization should be doing we have people that are donating money and they're
[3:39:06.160 --> 3:39:11.680]  deducting that from their uh from their tax returns and they also talk about they brag about
[3:39:11.680 --> 3:39:21.360]  how they targeted you roger saying that we put pressure on cnn msnbc and fox news and due to
[3:39:21.360 --> 3:39:26.720]  our pressure they stopped booking roger stone on their shows so these shows wanted to have you on
[3:39:26.720 --> 3:39:32.240]  and the media matters came in and said no his views are unacceptable don't book him anymore or
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:35.680]  we're going to put pressure on you we're going to we're going to put pressure on advertisers to
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:44.400]  stop booking with you um in an effort to silence you instead of allowing you to uh to debate and
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:49.280]  you know let the merits of your ideas and thoughts you judge what you're saying they just they want
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:54.880]  to silence people that are saying things against uh the the status quo that they went out there
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:40:01.520]  and you were speaking to alex jones before about twitter how if you look at uh donald trump's twitter
[3:40:01.520 --> 3:40:07.920]  and 100 percent of the replies is all negative even though all this tweets get you know 50 60
[3:40:07.920 --> 3:40:17.680]  70 000 likes but media matters has raw access to twitter's uh data and uh it shouldn't be a stretch
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:24.400]  of the imagination that they're pressuring twitter to filter the uh the the view on the site to show
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:32.080]  only negative comments to trump creating this false illusion that 100 of americans are against
[3:40:32.080 --> 3:40:40.240]  trump so perspectives of pro trump supporters are just not being seen by the greater media or by the
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:45.040]  population and then we get into the situation where you know uh there's millions of people
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:50.960]  millions of americans that believe that everybody that voted for trump is a nazi racist uh xenophobe
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:56.240]  which is just not true well i think they've actually made a mistake because you see the president
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:41:02.000]  follows his twitter feed religiously uh and he's a highly intelligent in fact brilliant man
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:08.640]  who will quickly realize that the responses are being manipulated so i think this will open a window
[3:41:08.640 --> 3:41:16.080]  to a broader understanding of what brock and the extreme left are up to as far as um their successful
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:22.800]  efforts to censor me and some kind of stylistic like censorship in all honesty i would never have
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:30.000]  met and affiliated with info wars and alex jones if i was regularly appearing on fox so they have
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:36.560]  done me an enormous favor and based on my studying of the data andrew you and i are reaching far
[3:41:36.560 --> 3:41:45.360]  more people right now than cnn or fox in this same time frame so in in essence um they what these
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:53.680]  attacks on us have only made us stronger uh i understood that mr brock was trying to seek
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:42:01.440]  some formal role uh in deciding what is fake news and that's laughable because virtually everything
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:08.800]  he and his twisted little psycho fans that media matters crank out is the fake news they are the
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:17.040]  purveyors of fake news they may be the inventors of fake news what say you yeah um and i hear you
[3:42:17.040 --> 3:42:23.120]  it's it's backfired dramatically i i honestly think that if it wasn't for uh david brocks uh
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:28.880]  just conglomerate organizations aggressively targeting conservative viewpoints on the internet
[3:42:28.880 --> 3:42:35.840]  then uh hillary clinton may have won i think that it totally backfired and it's uh it's kind of hysterical
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:40.240]  to see him trying to do the same exact thing without you know it obviously hasn't learned his lesson
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:48.240]  but um you know on the other end though a large majority of americans a significant percentage
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:53.600]  of americans get their news from facebook and twitter so you know whether or not people would like
[3:42:53.600 --> 3:43:00.160]  the news that is being produced by alternative media sources such as uh info wars what media
[3:43:00.160 --> 3:43:08.080]  matters is trying to do is to just make those posts those links to any alternative news sites just
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:16.480]  not show up at all so even if somebody wants to see that news see that insight they i mean how can
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:19.600]  you find something if you don't even know what you're looking for so they just want to you know
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:25.600]  contain the echo chamber and keep their echo chamber in place instead of allowing communication
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:32.080]  that happened between the two opposing uh uh political ideals in this country it was particularly
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:37.440]  interesting to me is given david brocks long record of ineffectiveness and the fact that he's
[3:43:37.440 --> 3:43:41.760]  spending a huge amount of money and achieved virtually nothing particularly given the enormous
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:49.040]  built-in institutional advantages of his candidate i can't imagine why any rich liberal would give him
[3:43:49.040 --> 3:43:55.840]  ten cents in fact if i were george soros i'd be demanding a refund this guy's incompetent he lets
[3:43:55.840 --> 3:44:03.040]  his boyfriend run the organization by and large he has been caught cheating on his taxes look i
[3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:09.440]  owe the irs some money but i have a payment plan and i pay them every month and it hurts i assure you
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:17.040]  but mr brock is not in that situation as it has been widely reported so uh look i think that he's
[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:23.760]  breaking multiple laws i think uh it's perfectly understandable why the obama justice department
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:29.280]  hasn't looked at him uh but if we're really going to have equal protection under the law
[3:44:29.280 --> 3:44:34.720]  then frankly i think he should be brought to justice not for his political ideas but for the
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:40.560]  for the fact that he's cheating and that he's violating federal election laws in this incredible
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:47.360]  effort to smear and call people names in all honesty i'm being i'm tired of being called a racist
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:54.160]  i was out working against the racist rockefeller drug laws in uh new york state before david brock
[3:44:54.160 --> 3:45:01.120]  was in long pants i was helping richard nixon desegregate the public schools without violence
[3:45:01.120 --> 3:45:10.080]  before david brock was uh was uh a gleam in his father's eye so um this name calling bigot racist
[3:45:10.080 --> 3:45:18.880]  and so on it is what the left does when they can't refute your ideas with facts it is really beneath
[3:45:19.760 --> 3:45:26.560]  our national political dialogue that's my view where do you think mr brock goes from here andrew
[3:45:26.560 --> 3:45:34.720]  because i know you are wisely keeping a very close eye on him well um about six months ago i started
[3:45:34.720 --> 3:45:40.160]  looking into his organizations because uh all of a sudden you know there's just all this astroturfing
[3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:46.080]  online um it looked like paid comments you know pro hillary clinton comments online and it turns out
[3:45:46.080 --> 3:45:52.720]  that uh david brock's uh one of his super PACs correct the record was uh essentially correcting
[3:45:52.720 --> 3:45:59.040]  hillary clinton's record online and they were out in the open saying that hey we're a super PAC
[3:45:59.040 --> 3:46:04.160]  but since we don't make any paid advertisements on tv or on the radio we just stick with online
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:08.640]  communications we can directly coordinate with the clinton campaign so we can wait for orders from
[3:46:08.640 --> 3:46:14.240]  the top and then you distribute the message on on internet forums uh across the internet creating
[3:46:14.240 --> 3:46:18.560]  this false illusion that a lot of people like hillary clinton when it just wasn't the case so
[3:46:18.560 --> 3:46:23.440]  you know that goes to you know backfiring against what his intentions were but the the problem here
[3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:32.400]  and what what i'm looking into uh my my investigation is trying to unravel the complex relationship
[3:46:32.400 --> 3:46:39.040]  between his uh you know up to 14 separate entities that are all sharing office space with media
[3:46:39.040 --> 3:46:45.520]  matters in downtown washington dc and it's extremely complex and we talk about you know
[3:46:45.520 --> 3:46:50.560]  submitting an official complaint well the problem is on the right there isn't really much infrastructure
[3:46:50.560 --> 3:46:55.680]  for you know for groups that focus on litigation against uh liberal groups that may be breaking
[3:46:55.680 --> 3:47:00.960]  the law there's there's no real you know there's there's not a network of of organizations that
[3:47:00.960 --> 3:47:06.880]  focus on on that type of thing the federal election commission is completely incompetent they
[3:47:06.880 --> 3:47:12.480]  they have no idea how to enforce the current laws period they regularly deadlock whenever an
[3:47:12.480 --> 3:47:16.400]  organization will ask the federal election commission hey is it okay if we can do this
[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:20.400]  and they'll spend a year working on the decision and they'll come back saying
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:24.960]  it's a three three split we don't know so we're just not going to issue a ruling on it so they
[3:47:24.960 --> 3:47:30.320]  don't know how to enforce the law the irs is clearly compromised they put way too much focus
[3:47:30.320 --> 3:47:36.720]  on conservative groups watch talking conservative groups but they don't even look at um at liberal
[3:47:36.720 --> 3:47:44.720]  groups so it's just a system of incompetence to where nobody knows how to enforce the law
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:52.640]  period and so what david rock is doing in in my view is getting away with as much as possible
[3:47:52.640 --> 3:47:57.440]  out in the open and he's protected by none other than just the complex relationship between
[3:47:57.440 --> 3:48:03.760]  multiple nonprofits foundations and super PACs all working together under one you know it's
[3:48:03.760 --> 3:48:08.960]  it's really just one single entity but they claim to be 14 separate related organizations
[3:48:09.520 --> 3:48:14.320]  and my most recent research is focused on analyzing you know cost sharing agreements
[3:48:14.320 --> 3:48:19.440]  between the separate organizations and issues that are surrounding that and it's it's a very
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:27.680]  big story but it's just so hard to talk about because it's just so complicated um and uh and
[3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:33.120]  so that's that's what i've been looking into i think that if the work on my site the citizen's
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:40.160]  audit uh gets out uh and we have you know and we start a conversation around the operations of
[3:48:40.160 --> 3:48:45.360]  media matters and the relationship with political entities it would be a very big issue for for
[3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:50.400]  david rock because there's a significant amount of concerning things that that they're doing with
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:56.000]  their money that at the very least should trigger the IRS to come in take a look at their books
[3:48:56.000 --> 3:49:00.480]  and determine hey should media matters be a charitable organization you know we should i
[3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:07.920]  believe that that they have lost um any reason to be designated as a as a charitable organization
[3:49:07.920 --> 3:49:12.160]  that should be revoked and they should be liable for for back taxes for all the time that they've
[3:49:12.160 --> 3:49:17.680]  been claiming to be a charitable organization but in reality just operating like a political
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:24.400]  organization yeah they've clearly violated uh their current tax status and they should be held
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:32.560]  liable you may remember back when i published my book the uh clinton's war on women which was the
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:39.280]  definitive oppo dump on bill hillary and chelsea clinton and their various illegal activities
[3:49:39.280 --> 3:49:47.280]  there was a major effort to invade the amazon.com page to allay a disproportionate number of
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:55.120]  one star and no star reviews of my book most of them we were able to track back to brock
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:50:01.760]  and his minions now on amazon there's evidence that this is beginning again pertaining to my new
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:08.880]  book uh the making of the president uh 2016 how donald trump orchestrated an american revolution
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:15.040]  so this is as good a time as any to ask folks who are tuned in today who like the book please go to
[3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:22.720]  amazon and leave a a an objective review uh for others to see this is more important than you
[3:50:22.720 --> 3:50:31.760]  might think because uh the wholesale book retailers and others monitor amazon very closely to see
[3:50:31.760 --> 3:50:41.680]  what the reviews look like before they decide to order uh i think we have our our music here uh if
[3:50:41.680 --> 3:50:47.360]  somebody can show me the clock we can see what we've got here but i want to thank you uh andrew

[3:54:47.760 --> 3:54:55.360]  fan of the super blue fluoride toothpaste that you can now get again at the info wars dot com
[3:54:55.360 --> 3:55:02.160]  store now this has been sold out for months but now it's available again and research across the
[3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:09.840]  board indicates that this does more than just cosmetic value this has a health value because
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:17.760]  healthy gums contribute to overall health and help prevent both heart disease and heart attacks
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:24.240]  when bacteria infect your gums it can actually enter the bloodstream and therefore contribute
[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:32.400]  to blood clots or heart attacks i must tell you missus stone is very very particular about
[3:55:32.400 --> 3:55:40.000]  the oral products that she uses and she swears by super blue fluoride toothpaste so here's a chance
