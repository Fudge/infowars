[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  It's Friday, February 4th, 2022, and each day, each broadcast gets more intense.
[00:29.920 --> 00:41.600]  Because of the terrain we are in, spiritually, physically, mentally, financially, inter-dimensionally.
[00:41.600 --> 00:47.200]  Again, all of these articles and documents are not here as props.
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.720]  I have probably read 20% of these articles this morning and scanned over the rest,
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.720]  and I just must cover it all. I've got to at least hit on the surface of these.
[00:58.720 --> 01:04.960]  This is unbelievable. But I am in a paradox to catch 22.
[01:05.920 --> 01:12.320]  I should really only talk about one story today that is the biggest,
[01:13.920 --> 01:18.800]  and that it ties into all the others. In fact, I just wrote the show headline,
[01:18.800 --> 01:22.240]  minutes before we went live. It's about to go up. I dictated it.
[01:23.360 --> 01:26.640]  And I decided to go with the medical kidnapping all over the world by big
[01:26.640 --> 01:30.080]  pharma-controlled hospitals, where they're keeping people away from children and adults
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.520]  to then murder them and say COVID-19 did it after stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:35.520 --> 01:42.560]  from each victim. That's all confirmed in criminal cases, lawsuits, lawyers,
[01:42.560 --> 01:48.400]  epic times has a huge breakdown on that. That's giant, but it's not the root.
[01:51.200 --> 01:54.240]  The headline deals with that, and we're going to leave the headline that way. That's important.
[01:54.240 --> 02:04.480]  So, the subheadline deals with the root. And I knew this was coming,
[02:04.480 --> 02:08.800]  and we were the first to say it along with Dr. Boyle, because when you've got all the jigsaw
[02:08.800 --> 02:16.000]  pieces in front of you, and you start putting them in, and you know that the same jigsaw maker
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.240]  took the photo and made this one as similar ones you built before,
[02:20.240 --> 02:28.720]  even though you've not seen the cover of the box even, you start figuring out what the image is.
[02:30.560 --> 02:37.920]  And so, two years ago, now two years ago, two years ago, plus now, I have the articles right
[02:37.920 --> 02:51.280]  here from infowars.com, late January 2020. Now, two plus years, we specifically exactly predicted
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.480]  what they would do. And when I got up this morning at 5 a.m. and started researching and
[02:56.480 --> 02:59.680]  saw these headlines, it was like a punch in the stomach.
[02:59.680 --> 03:12.080]  How are you going to like a common cold virus that you can't escape, that gives you HIV,
[03:12.080 --> 03:15.520]  gives you AIDS? How are you going to like that?
[03:19.120 --> 03:25.200]  Because that's really what COVID-19 is. And then when you take the vaccine, it actually
[03:25.200 --> 03:29.920]  starts growing and inside your body, and you ask, well, why don't they just give you one shot that
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.640]  gives it to you right away? Well, then it's too obvious, but if they do it through a group of
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.360]  shots, then it slowly happens, and the demographics are different, so they're able to hide it better.
[03:40.320 --> 03:46.160]  They also hit certain populations with placebo is now confirmed. And then they can also have
[03:46.160 --> 03:50.800]  cures, they've got treatments and cures for themselves when they get infected to the prion
[03:50.800 --> 03:57.520]  crystals. And things that mitigate it, even when you're not actively sick, things like ivermectin
[03:57.520 --> 04:05.040]  do go in and start eradicating the lattice that these prion crystal occupiers, colonizers build.
[04:05.600 --> 04:12.000]  So we've cracked the complete code, and they've now announced it. They've now announced, oh my gosh,
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.200]  there's a new deadly HIV while you catch it like a cold and it's more deadly and it's going to kill
[04:17.200 --> 04:25.680]  you. Oh, it mutated with COVID-19. That's right. Viruses don't do that, folks. And the Indian
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.680]  scientists, when they first looked at it in January two years ago, they've got a gene editing machine.
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.440]  They said, this is man made. This is five different viruses, very serious. HIV delivery system spike
[04:37.440 --> 04:42.720]  protein. They gave the code number owned by Fauci. He owns it with Bill Gates. I mean, Bill Gates even
[04:42.720 --> 04:47.200]  owns the weapon in our bodies. It's in my body. It's in your body. And they're just murdering us
[04:47.200 --> 04:51.760]  with extreme enjoyment. And we're probably just going to lay down and take it. That's what we do.
[04:51.760 --> 04:56.160]  And our children. He's our God. Our children belong to Bill Gates. He is our king.
[05:01.280 --> 05:08.240]  For only 72 hours, our groundbreaking course that helps you break free of the globalist

[05:16.720 --> 05:23.360]  There has been massive unprecedented censorship at every level to block this information.

[05:28.480 --> 05:34.400]  This gives you the tools to break out of that system. This points out the tools that God created
[05:34.400 --> 05:40.720]  and has already given you, but that most people forgot or never discovered reset wars.com.

[05:48.160 --> 05:53.200]  So it's a 360 win. The only way you fail is not taking action. This is the most important

[06:18.240 --> 06:26.960]  You got me. Welcome so much for joining us.
[06:28.720 --> 06:31.760]  I want to thank you so much for being here with us on this Friday,
[06:32.480 --> 06:38.000]  February 4th, 2022 transmission. I know a lot of haters tuning as well,
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.520]  but everybody to know who signed on to this evil system, you're not going to get out of the system.
[06:43.520 --> 06:48.160]  You're not going to come out on top serving it. The only way we make it out of this is coming
[06:48.160 --> 06:52.880]  back to goodness, coming back to God and coming back to being honest, decent people.
[06:54.400 --> 07:00.960]  And so we got a big tent here for everybody who wants to be informed and involved and engaged.
[07:04.960 --> 07:10.240]  Because I'm not out to destroy or hurt anybody, but I do have a mission and a job to not go along
[07:10.240 --> 07:14.400]  with this evil. And I have reverse engineered along with all of our experts, guests and researchers
[07:14.400 --> 07:20.160]  what's exactly going on. And it is incredible.
[07:23.680 --> 07:27.840]  Now there's a lot that goes into this. And I'm going to cover it in great detail at the bottom
[07:27.840 --> 07:32.320]  of the hour. And I hope that everybody out there reaches out to their friends, their family, their
[07:32.320 --> 07:38.320]  neighbors, random strangers and tells them to tune in right now at info wars.com forward slash show.
[07:38.320 --> 07:45.520]  Free world news dot TV and the current URL they're not banning or blocking future news dot news.
[07:47.040 --> 07:52.720]  And send them the live feed that's live on the Alex Jones section there at future news dot news.
[07:53.760 --> 08:03.440]  Because I didn't just get up here last month or last year or today and say they're going to roll
[08:03.440 --> 08:11.440]  out a new HIV that's basically airborne and that is much more deadly and that attacks your white
[08:11.440 --> 08:18.000]  blood cells. And that what they launched what Fauci was program leader on what they launched in the
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.040]  late 1970s early 1980s he was high level on the project became the director later was a beta test
[08:25.040 --> 08:28.640]  for the new group and batch of these viruses that they're releasing.
[08:28.640 --> 08:35.920]  And these viruses of course mutate over time and become less infectious they're developed
[08:35.920 --> 08:43.120]  to be very deadly in the lab but over time even artificial viruses under God's system and plan
[08:43.120 --> 08:53.280]  degenerate and procreate into a system that is not as deadly and that actually is able to live
[08:53.280 --> 08:59.360]  in the host organism which is the real mission of the virus not to actually kill its host.
[09:00.800 --> 09:08.000]  So we knew this in January and February two years ago and I have all the articles you know
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.160]  unlike Brian Stelter unlike mainstream media I will actually show you the articles when we wrote
[09:14.160 --> 09:24.560]  them what we said and then give you the new news. And it's very horrible new HIV strain found in
[09:24.560 --> 09:33.440]  the Netherlands highly infectious variant makes it people ill twice as quickly. Now I don't just go
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.080]  off this as if it's true or you're believing another Daily Mail I already know about this project
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.600]  I already knew this was coming I told you we can get the archive is to find it
[09:41.600 --> 09:48.880]  in January and February two years ago in March laying out our predictions that the vaccine
[09:50.640 --> 09:57.040]  for COVID-19 would cause autoimmune deficiency disorder
[10:00.400 --> 10:07.760]  autoimmune deficiency syndrome and that they would then just say oh really certainly everybody's
[10:07.760 --> 10:13.200]  just got HIV because I read the scientific reports I read the scans of the man made virus COVID-19
[10:13.760 --> 10:20.480]  and we know Fauci headed up the HIV bio weapon program against Africa that blew back into the
[10:20.480 --> 10:26.960]  West by design and into gay men with compromised immune systems from hundreds of partners and
[10:26.960 --> 10:32.640]  methamphetamine use that could also tip the T lymphocytes over to dying and being susceptible to
[10:32.640 --> 10:38.400]  colonization by the HIV there's a lot of other factors that went into it but that's the real
[10:38.400 --> 10:45.600]  science on it. So you study criminology criminals like to do the same thing over and over again
[10:46.400 --> 10:52.480]  and Fauci was heavily involved in developing and deploying HIV against the world I mean he was
[10:52.480 --> 10:57.520]  known back then it came out and blocking good treatments and giving people deadly treatments
[10:57.520 --> 11:05.280]  that also then kill the sick that's his added fun just like Rindesivir but 30 some percent of people
[11:05.280 --> 11:11.600]  that kills them on record so they don't let you have zinc or hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or
[11:11.600 --> 11:18.160]  vitamin D you don't get any of that it's like oh you're drowning let me hold your head underwater
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.520]  how about some Rindesivir that does nothing to stop the virus and literally eats your liver and
[11:23.520 --> 11:31.040]  kidneys hey renal failure is fun huh it'll get from Old Docky F DR Fauci
[11:34.720 --> 11:43.040]  and so we looked at COVID-19 and the man-made spike protein synthetic HIV delivery system
[11:43.040 --> 11:49.680]  and we said it's going to give people false positives for HIV and indeed they go oh some of
[11:49.680 --> 11:54.320]  the COVID vaccines cause false positives don't worry you wink wink you don't really have HIV
[11:55.840 --> 12:00.480]  and they just sit there and watch what it does and then when you take the Pfizer the Moderna or
[12:00.480 --> 12:06.560]  the JMJ or AstraZeneca they all have different mechanisms but they're the same destination
[12:06.560 --> 12:12.080]  as Fauci told him in December before COVID was even announced two plus years ago 25 months ago
[12:12.080 --> 12:22.000]  26 months ago came out in documents via Peter Dazik's group and lawsuits that oh oh get ready for
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.280]  this type of vaccine and your vaccine can do it however it wants but it's got to create
[12:27.280 --> 12:34.640]  this spike protein in the body which is the alone man manipulated man-made
[12:34.640 --> 12:42.240]  HIV delivery system on record this is not debatable so it's a fact
[12:42.800 --> 12:48.640]  like what the molecular makeup of his water is a fact well this this is a fact and then you look
[12:48.640 --> 12:51.280]  at it you go well they're going to give you something that makes you sick and turns off
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.840]  your white blood cells they're going to put a virus out that attacks your white blood cells
[12:55.840 --> 13:02.640]  and then they're going to sit back and try to cover this up how are they going to do it I've
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.680]  said last year and this year thousands of times they're going to have a new virus that shows up
[13:07.680 --> 13:14.400]  on the scene even worse and guess what it's the super HIV that's much easier to catch
[13:16.080 --> 13:21.200]  and kills you a lot faster they're saying and then when you find out you're positive when you're
[13:21.200 --> 13:26.800]  really just positive from the so-called vaccine you will then go and Fauci and the who owns the
[13:26.800 --> 13:35.120]  big patents on the stuff will pump you full of the AZT and all the new chemicals and interfere on
[13:35.120 --> 13:42.400]  disruptors and the rest of it that will kill your ass just like rendezvous and so they will get you
[13:42.400 --> 13:47.280]  sick with the first phase the bio weapon and then it's binary they will then hit you with the next
[13:47.280 --> 13:55.760]  phase of the bio weapon and that's how it works just like that and then they get all the money out
[13:55.760 --> 14:02.480]  of you while they kill you see how that works learn about binary weapons so that's at the
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.880]  bottom of the hour I'm going to go through all that it's a big deal and we predicted it would
[14:06.880 --> 14:11.200]  show up and they would do it exactly and they have because we know the enemy that's what we do
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.120]  and that's why they want to software that's why they can't stand us now that leads me
[14:17.040 --> 14:23.200]  that's one stack one incredible stack let me tell you about the other incredible stacks
[14:23.200 --> 14:28.640]  it's amazing stuff happening in Canada and around the world these truckers triggering peaceful
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.720]  revolution everywhere and letting all the weak minded that have stayed quiet and felt alone
[14:32.720 --> 14:40.000]  and been gaslit under mass Stockholm psychosis is what I call it call it mass formation psychosis
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.160]  Carl Jung and the clinical term would be mass psychosis mob rule the madness of crowds those
[14:46.160 --> 14:55.440]  are the more arcane names for it the founding fathers talked about but here we are and they're
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.840]  now announcing the Canadian news that the government's preparing to use the military against them
[15:00.480 --> 15:05.680]  boy I sure hope they do that that would really backfire on the new world order except if they
[15:05.680 --> 15:12.160]  do use the military they will stage a false flag all special operations at the captain level and
[15:12.160 --> 15:19.360]  above get taught how to stage false flags when you're outnumbered and can't defeat a group and if
[15:19.360 --> 15:24.880]  they're given orders they will stage a false flag the military will the public just has to be made
[15:24.880 --> 15:30.000]  aware of that okay but it came out in the wiki leaks and I already knew this as I talked to family
[15:30.000 --> 15:37.040]  that was told this stuff when they were in the military that it was captains and above in the
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.000]  green berets being taught how to stage a false flag and that might might mean killing a village kid
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.480]  blaming it on the enemy or that might mean blowing up you know the food supply at the village the
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.120]  water supply the water tower to blame the enemy if you got to get people to force multiply them
[15:51.120 --> 15:55.520]  it's what you do so the next big move will be a false flag against the truckers we got all that

[19:54.720 --> 19:59.280]  thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we can
[19:59.280 --> 20:15.200]  beat him easily leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[20:29.600 --> 20:39.280]  emergency friday broadcast globalist controlled hospitals are medically kidnapping patients
[20:39.280 --> 20:47.440]  and killing them all over the western world and that's just the first headline meanwhile as predicted
[20:48.320 --> 20:55.600]  new lab-grown version of hiv spiked with covet 19 has been released in the netherlands as part
[20:55.600 --> 21:03.680]  of phase two of the globalist population operations dr. peter mccullough will join alex live to counter
[21:03.680 --> 21:12.080]  msm lives lies that he put out this information on joe rogan you do not want to miss that second
[21:12.080 --> 21:22.080]  hour all right bottom of the hour i'm gonna hit the big hiv news and people know i don't just put
[21:22.080 --> 21:27.040]  out fear porn people used to tune in 20 years ago they thought this is wildly entertaining
[21:27.760 --> 21:32.560]  even harry shearer you know went on national tv he's a great actor great comedian you love the
[21:32.560 --> 21:37.920]  work he does and spinal tap the simpsons you name it and said man alex jones is just incredible
[21:37.920 --> 21:42.560]  he's one of the greatest writers ever the stuff he comes up with he's just a science fiction genius
[21:43.120 --> 21:47.760]  no dude i didn't come up with any of this it's what they're doing to us
[21:47.760 --> 21:54.640]  and i get that it sounds insane believe me but they're doing it
[21:56.880 --> 22:00.160]  and i've had a lot of friends and family get really sick or die from this crap
[22:01.200 --> 22:06.080]  and the damn vaccine is not a vaccine and attacks your white blood cells on record
[22:07.680 --> 22:11.440]  it's all confirmed now and that they've made their move that's why they've paid out tens of
[22:11.440 --> 22:16.960]  billions of dollars from high-level influencers movie stars basketball players football players
[22:16.960 --> 22:21.680]  who get hundreds of thousands of not millions right down to small youtube channels with 100
[22:21.680 --> 22:27.600]  thousand members with maybe 10 20 000 people watching their videos at a time getting tens of
[22:27.600 --> 22:34.960]  thousands of dollars thousands of people have gone public tick tock influencers you name it and
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.880]  said look here's the letter offering me two thousand dollars up to 50 000 100 000 putting
[22:40.880 --> 22:48.320]  on the letters for every time i mentioned and say i took the vaccine i love it i took the vaccine
[22:48.320 --> 22:52.720]  i took it it works i love it it's wonderful oh my gosh i want boosters it's so great
[22:52.720 --> 22:57.840]  bing bing bing cashier jing jing jing jing jing jing jing jing jing they did all this folks
[22:58.480 --> 23:02.160]  to move against the public and you could say well the dumbasses that believe it and take it
[23:02.160 --> 23:12.240]  they deserve it do the children do the children deserve to be injected with something that the
[23:12.240 --> 23:22.720]  phyzer moderna j and j and astrazeneca all turn off the killer t the killer t is the infantry
[23:22.720 --> 23:32.240]  man of the blood hiv attacks the t lymphocyte that is the general that first approaches sees what
[23:32.240 --> 23:38.880]  something is and then goes and puts out call it viruses orders whatever chemical orders
[23:39.600 --> 23:45.440]  to the other white blood cells to attack so hiv takes out the generals
[23:45.440 --> 23:55.600]  covid injections masquerading his vaccines take out the troops jack sprat could eat no
[23:55.600 --> 24:00.560]  fat his wife could eat no lean between the two of them they licked the platter clean
[24:03.760 --> 24:08.960]  yeah what do you think killer t's do all day they just run around like pac-man eating cancer
[24:08.960 --> 24:17.600]  viruses eating cancer cells this is a direct attack on your defense system
[24:19.680 --> 24:27.200]  they're they're basically amoebas programmed and grown in your bones in your femurs to kill
[24:28.160 --> 24:35.120]  the enemies of your body and if you want to take your body down you shut those little
[24:35.120 --> 24:41.520]  sweethearts down plus they deserve to die they're white they are white in color very bad so ladies
[24:41.520 --> 24:48.080]  and gentlemen this is where we are and this is what we face and i'm gonna hit all the science
[24:48.080 --> 24:54.080]  next segment but here's an example of what we're talking about they had a state department briefing
[24:54.080 --> 24:59.920]  yesterday and an ap reporter is saying we want to see proof you know like kennedy showed the
[24:59.920 --> 25:06.400]  nuclear missile launchers in cuba and at least with the fake wmds in iraq they held up fake
[25:06.400 --> 25:10.480]  anthrax and at least said well here's a truck that makes anthrax which it didn't it was actually
[25:10.480 --> 25:15.360]  a truck that pumped up hydrogen balloons to direct artillery that the u.s and reddish had sold
[25:15.360 --> 25:22.560]  saddam and the iran iraq war in the 1980s but the point is is that the state department thinks
[25:22.560 --> 25:28.080]  the public doesn't research or know any of this so they just get up there and they say hey we're
[25:28.080 --> 25:33.200]  telling you this is classified statement we're not giving any evidence that russia is making a movie
[25:35.120 --> 25:39.520]  about a false flag they're going to stage they're like wow you got those specifics tell us
[25:39.520 --> 25:47.040]  let us see it oh no we can't let you see that now the truth is tens of billions of dollars of
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.680]  high-tech weapons anti-tank anti aircraft have been shipped in the last two years and put the
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.480]  said you're massing troops i know army guys that just got came back from there they were literally
[25:56.480 --> 26:00.560]  in you know in fights with the russians a little green man we're losing troops they're losing troops
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.920]  we're in a proxy war with the russians and by the way trump basically expanded it something one of
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.360]  the bad things he did and so the russians are massing troops in baylor russians under areas
[26:11.360 --> 26:17.600]  saying listen you keep saying you want to be peaceful but you're moving people in and weapons in
[26:17.600 --> 26:24.560]  and you've got proxy armies attacking us that's all western weird psyops and they show here's the
[26:24.560 --> 26:29.760]  poor ukranians they've got wooden guns they don't have any weapons or know how to use them
[26:29.760 --> 26:35.280]  that's all made up they've got warehouses full of weapons they just don't have people willing to go
[26:35.280 --> 26:42.000]  start a fight with the russians so they're shooting at each other at a half mile away and sabotaging
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.480]  warehouses and blowing up chemical plants and and in both sides are tit for tatting back and forth
[26:48.480 --> 26:55.840]  on the borders of eastern and western ukraine and so i'm not lionizing russia i'm not saying
[26:55.840 --> 27:01.360]  russia's perfect i i'm saying that you're watching this piece we'll get to a little bit later in the
[27:01.360 --> 27:07.040]  hour after i hit the big news and the ap report thinks he scores this big michael jordan slam dunk
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.200]  he goes you're going into alex jones territory here with all your false flags
[27:11.200 --> 27:17.520]  you and sake say they're going to stage a false flag you don't have evidence of that
[27:18.640 --> 27:23.440]  and the media is like oh boy got a big score in where's the proof it's alex jones the difference
[27:23.440 --> 27:27.840]  is when alex jones tells you that something might be a false flag i've got evidence and reasons and
[27:27.840 --> 27:32.320]  i'm questioning because a lot of time stuff isn't real whether it's jesse smallett or
[27:32.320 --> 27:37.840]  whether it's bubble wallace or whether it's the gulf of tonkin or whether it's roe v wade
[27:37.840 --> 27:46.400]  that baby never died they now i bet it was fake and i'd say 80 of the time hate crimes and and
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.480]  stuff that starts wars you name it staged and all major governments do it it's in mainline
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.520]  history books that the french and the british constantly stage false flags on each other
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.120]  in the 500 years of wars they had it's what you do
[28:01.120 --> 28:11.760]  do because war's dirty and i'm not defending dirtiness i'm just telling you that people should
[28:11.760 --> 28:16.000]  actually know how war works you should actually know how war start you see and then but they said
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.240]  they talked down to you oh it's alex jones territory to think that if the russians were
[28:20.240 --> 28:25.920]  going to invade they'd stage a provocation yeah you bet they would and you bet the us military
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.400]  would if they get the order to go in you're just going to attack the russians without staging
[28:30.400 --> 28:35.760]  something but you don't think the us government had staged plenty of stuff like the uss main
[28:35.760 --> 28:43.600]  to start the spanish-american war grow up people look at the godfather when she says to michael
[28:43.600 --> 28:47.360]  curling up she goes he goes you know presidents have people killed i have people killed she goes
[28:47.360 --> 28:53.520]  presidents have people killed he says k look who's being naive let's just stop being naive people

[31:19.840 --> 31:25.680]  and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now you need to get prepared

[31:59.440 --> 32:05.440]  to be self-sufficient let's go ahead take another call let's talk to malcolm in tennessee welcome
[32:05.440 --> 32:10.240]  hello alex yes malcolm all right i will make this quick and real short where the other patriots can
[32:10.240 --> 32:15.600]  get on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host owin shroyer
[32:15.600 --> 32:21.440]  supermail volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank
[32:21.440 --> 32:26.880]  supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have
[32:26.880 --> 32:33.120]  never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.920]  work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact
[32:37.920 --> 32:41.760]  each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like
[32:41.760 --> 32:44.960]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong that's just
[32:44.960 --> 32:50.960]  how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong
[32:50.960 --> 33:03.680]  but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it leading a frontal assault
[33:03.680 --> 33:25.600]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[33:25.600 --> 33:34.400]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[33:36.320 --> 33:42.960]  so we know that hiv was a lab grown developed weapon the evidence scientist all the information
[33:42.960 --> 33:48.800]  came out since then top scientists with modern systems have scanned it and said yes it's man made
[33:48.800 --> 33:55.680]  Fauci owns along with the consortium but he's the majority owner the patent
[33:57.360 --> 34:08.080]  on the isolated hiv spike protein and so all the different wuhan lab testing and development
[34:08.080 --> 34:17.040]  of a whole class of viruses of chimeric viruses used that spike protein that they'd already developed
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.880]  developed as the main weapon system a natural spike protein they'd found that they had then
[34:22.880 --> 34:29.680]  bred and and through generations in animals and humans to create a particularly rhinoceros like
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.560]  virus that just half the virus is the giant spike that that that you know gets into those
[34:34.560 --> 34:41.760]  receptor sites into the cells so it's the it's it's the canon that fires the poison it's the
[34:41.760 --> 34:51.280]  fangs that inject it so that's all there i mean this this guy is a modern joseph mingola he makes
[34:51.280 --> 35:00.960]  joseph mingola look like a amateur amateur absolutely amateur compared to what fauci's done
[35:00.960 --> 35:05.520]  on the scale he's done that it's not fair to call him joseph mingola joseph mingola just
[35:05.520 --> 35:09.840]  had nothing on him and he's just one of the operatives of these mad scientists involved
[35:09.840 --> 35:18.000]  they're all involved google's chief scientist all of them so let's let's look at this new hiv strain
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.240]  found in the netherlands highly infectious variant makes people ill twice as quick oh and
[35:24.240 --> 35:29.680]  it's strangely connected to covid they're telling us this is just a cover story of course put out
[35:29.680 --> 35:37.280]  by mi6 at the daily mail a new super mutant hiv strain that makes infected individuals ill
[35:37.280 --> 35:43.360]  twice as fast as current versions of the virus has been detected in the netherlands the new mutant
[35:43.360 --> 35:49.680]  called the vb variant has infected at least 109 people according to a study by oxford university
[35:49.680 --> 35:55.040]  oh my goodness the strain damages the immune system and weakens the person's ability to
[35:55.040 --> 36:00.640]  fight everyday infections and diseases faster than previous versions of the virus now what
[36:00.640 --> 36:07.040]  is now confirmed because they have this lie that fauci said a year ago people in the hospital
[36:07.040 --> 36:14.320]  99% dying had not had the vaccine total live been proven so now they say oh 90% of the hospitalizations
[36:14.320 --> 36:21.680]  are that they just repeat it never giving you a source it's made up but the vaccine itself
[36:21.680 --> 36:29.600]  it's a gene therapy does turn off your killer teas it continues so so a lot of this is oh
[36:29.600 --> 36:34.400]  you're sick of hiv and and now they've got tests that are tailored where when they test you
[36:34.400 --> 36:39.760]  you've had covered 19 from the lab leak the lab release or you've had it from the vaccine
[36:40.320 --> 36:43.600]  with that top scientist on does the exact same thing because the shots are even worse
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.320]  the naturally catching it you get a larger load tends to replicate better in the body
[36:48.320 --> 36:53.680]  and then now they're they skew the test over before to not call it hiv now they change the test
[36:53.680 --> 36:59.360]  and go oh my god because it's happening it's all over the news like houston texas record hiv la
[36:59.360 --> 37:10.240]  record hiv new york detroit of miami uh london frankfurt tokyo durban mexico city
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.440]  real dejan arrow just type it in record hiv and it's worse and it's bad and they get
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.440]  fevers and their immune system's gone and they die and they get cancer real quick
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.360]  what have we been saying 85 billion times on air let's not exaggerate 5,000 10,000 times
[37:27.360 --> 37:34.560]  last two years myself mike adams dr boil a bunch of medical doctors these shots will turn your
[37:34.560 --> 37:40.320]  immune system off and then you get cancer or it can jack it way up the way it's designed and they
[37:40.320 --> 37:51.360]  call it ade antibody dependency enhancement so oh my gosh the the the virus and the vaccine
[37:51.360 --> 37:56.880]  creates the hiv spike protein you set the test to either not pick up a spike protein
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.720]  so people don't get scared they've been given hiv or then when you want to tell them oh now the new
[38:02.720 --> 38:16.880]  plague is super hiv that just showed up everywhere wow wow isn't that just sick
[38:19.600 --> 38:22.400]  and if you're dumb enough to take it i guess they think you deserve it
[38:22.400 --> 38:30.400]  but the children don't and and you're like well i just won't take the shot it doesn't matter these
[38:30.400 --> 38:34.160]  bodies then breed it and replicate it get the dr. malone clip from two days ago i never played
[38:35.440 --> 38:40.080]  ready guys remember malone he said this two years ago the advent of marina and he said it again a
[38:40.080 --> 38:44.640]  year ago it said again a month ago setting in this week had this clip since monday haven't played it
[38:44.640 --> 38:49.280]  yet and he says listen i don't want a fearmonger here so he dolls it way down he goes but uh
[38:49.280 --> 38:55.280]  when you give billions of people a shot while they have a virus it caused it to mutate become more
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.880]  aggressive normally if somebody has a virus it mutates it becomes less aggressive that's what
[39:00.880 --> 39:07.040]  they do but when you when you during a big outbreak go give people something like this that then
[39:07.040 --> 39:12.080]  goes and suppresses it it then causes it to spike worse and become more powerful just like bugs
[39:12.080 --> 39:19.520]  becoming resistant to pesticides you know the nichian saying that which does not kill you only

[46:57.760 --> 47:14.000]  out now at it for store dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.000]  i'm going to boil this down very very simply on the alex jones show on this friday edition
[47:24.000 --> 47:30.240]  christians believe in treating everybody good and standing up for the innocent
[47:30.960 --> 47:35.280]  pagans believe in survival of fittest and they believe that if you can dominate and control
[47:35.280 --> 47:40.000]  and kill people and exercise your will it means that you have a right to do it and you're making
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.760]  the world a better place and there's arguments for both schools of thought
[47:48.160 --> 47:51.440]  but the end of the day the globalists aren't even doing survival of fittest and power as they're
[47:51.440 --> 48:00.320]  doing it to end humanity as we know it so when you wonder why fouchy and these globalists have
[48:00.320 --> 48:06.560]  released a new version of hiv's of the vaccine and remember they attacked me two years ago jones
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.840]  is claiming that it was made in a lab connected to hiv and that the vaccine will give you hiv
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.240]  i don't know that's just you know the owner and the creator of it the guy that owns the spike protein
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.240]  and the guy that ran the lab and the guy that says he wants to kill you and your family on record
[48:22.240 --> 48:26.160]  bill gates and fouchy want to depopulate you they go to depopulation summons and talk about
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.240]  how they want to kill everybody and they are i mean you got to respect the fact that they're
[48:30.240 --> 48:35.760]  actually doing what they said they do i'm just going off what they say what they do their track
[48:35.760 --> 48:43.440]  record they've killed before they're killing again miss french his ex-wife i think probably
[48:43.440 --> 48:49.040]  wouldn't read in on the whole thing and she's decided to go hide and totally pull out a foundation
[48:49.040 --> 49:01.680]  and stop funding all the eugenics that's good that's real good because you're on a collision
[49:01.680 --> 49:07.520]  course with us and we're in a civil war against the devil worshipers and those that love christ
[49:07.520 --> 49:13.680]  that's the real civil war on this planet it's war against god and just now the evil people are
[49:13.680 --> 49:17.120]  figuring out this thing going to be the cakewalk they thought it was because they know we're not
[49:17.120 --> 49:23.520]  going to turn off in this game of chicken and now they're going to have to bite the bullet like big
[49:23.520 --> 49:30.880]  boys like big boys do you think you're just going to kill little kids and poison everybody and
[49:30.880 --> 49:36.960]  dump everybody down and get away with this no you're going to have to face retribution
[49:41.600 --> 49:45.200]  real justice not the top handed out by your corrupt courts and justice department
[49:45.760 --> 49:53.440]  but the intergalactic interdimensional multiverse and judgment of the big guy the kahuna the maker
[49:53.440 --> 50:00.320]  the master you keep playing like your god all day pretending like you are the force of nature
[50:00.320 --> 50:05.360]  that's here to call us little mere humans and we just have to sit here while you kill us
[50:05.920 --> 50:12.560]  it's not how the world works not the ball bounces so after mccullough leaves us this is going to be
[50:12.560 --> 50:18.160]  a big interview where he exclusively counters all of this information lies uh in the media
[50:18.160 --> 50:23.520]  attacking him predominantly and dr malone i'm from the joe rogan mega viral interviews
[50:23.520 --> 50:32.320]  i'll get more into this because there's a lot to cover and so we'll do this the last 30 minutes
[50:32.320 --> 50:35.920]  of the third hour we'll do an hour and a half of mccullough then i'll be able to really spend
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.440]  i mean we need to spend a lot of time on this and it's not because it became the top news story
[50:41.440 --> 50:50.800]  in the us yesterday seriously like thousands of articles tens of millions of views per video i mean
[50:50.800 --> 50:54.240]  one is like 10 million five million i wouldn't even try to find it was just everywhere like 10
[50:54.240 --> 50:59.920]  million five million three million two million uh on every news channel ha ha look they want war
[50:59.920 --> 51:05.040]  with russia and the state department wouldn't give any evidence and was talking about false flags
[51:05.040 --> 51:10.000]  that's alex jones territory because you know false flags don't exist no false flags are a very
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.680]  real thing differences when i talk about false flags i give you evidence and history and background
[51:16.240 --> 51:19.920]  and and i look at big events and say could they be a false flags a lot of time they are sometimes
[51:19.920 --> 51:23.840]  they're not most of the time we've been right sometimes we've been wrong questioning false
[51:23.840 --> 51:30.080]  flags or potential false flags and i don't apologize for that but they don't want you the
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.760]  little people when there's a big event to ask who actually stands to gain from this
[51:36.960 --> 51:43.040]  so we got fox news cnn msnbc the wall street journal the bbc the london telegraph the moscow
[51:43.040 --> 51:50.480]  times they all have this this is one of the biggest stories in the world the ap reporter
[51:50.480 --> 51:55.200]  is sitting there asking the state department spokesman what is your evidence you're not
[51:55.200 --> 52:00.640]  like kennedy that's what the reporter should have said you know showing us the photos of the of the
[52:00.640 --> 52:13.600]  medium medium range nuke missiles in cuba in 1961 62 they didn't say hey show us show us documents
[52:14.240 --> 52:19.600]  he just said hey give me something and i goes well i just told you you know kind of like
[52:19.600 --> 52:24.880]  statement effective you take the vaccine uh you can't transmit to other people which was not true
[52:24.880 --> 52:31.680]  true they just want us to believe them and so you know it's very true though we are in
[52:31.680 --> 52:36.240]  alex jones territory where we actually learn about history learn how things work do our own
[52:36.240 --> 52:40.560]  research set to be an expert on football or baseball or basketball which i'm not against
[52:40.560 --> 52:43.760]  people that like that but you know they their whole lives are knowing everything about it
[52:43.760 --> 52:47.760]  and where the players all live and what they eat for breakfast and what their wife's name is
[52:47.760 --> 52:52.480]  that doesn't help you in the world knowing about geo politics and the private federal reserve
[52:52.480 --> 52:59.040]  and the Uyghurs in the new world order and nano tech that's important and how the power grid works
[53:00.640 --> 53:05.120]  and how under law they're putting kill switches in all the cars now isn't that a big deal what do
[53:05.120 --> 53:10.320]  you think that's for when you try to go have an auto demonstration against the lockdowns
[53:10.320 --> 53:14.480]  well we just turn your car off they're putting the kill switches and everything we're not in
[53:14.480 --> 53:23.280]  kansas anymore shall i'll play the whole exchange coming up maybe you guys real quick just get up
[53:23.280 --> 53:27.600]  to the middle where they do the whole alex jones thing but the whole exchange is six minutes long
[53:27.600 --> 53:33.280]  and i really want to air the whole thing because it is new for them to give no evidence i mean
[53:34.640 --> 53:41.440]  in front of the un in 2003 to launch that fake phase of the war colin pal holds up fake anthrax
[53:41.440 --> 53:48.400]  what even real puts up pictures of trucks that were pumping up balloons uh artillery hydrogen
[53:48.400 --> 53:53.680]  balloons you know they'd have drones back then in the 80s or at least drones that you just put
[53:53.680 --> 53:58.480]  the battlefield easily and so you just run a balloon up of hydrogen and then would have cameras on
[53:58.480 --> 54:03.760]  a truck that would transmit that back to the generals just to direct their artillery and he
[54:03.760 --> 54:10.640]  puts up the artillery balloon truck and he goes and this is where they make the anthrax of course
[54:10.640 --> 54:14.560]  anybody could go to a jane's weapons quarterly and look up that exact truck we did by the way
[54:14.560 --> 54:19.440]  i was on the air then we actually broke that we're like that's a jane's weapons quarterly
[54:22.720 --> 54:31.440]  balloon truck for any aircraft and and and uh not any aircraft for uh artillery direction
[54:31.440 --> 54:36.080]  the point i'm getting at here is is that they don't want you to know how this works they don't
[54:36.080 --> 54:41.600]  want you to think about how this works they don't want you to be aware of any of this information
[54:44.880 --> 54:50.160]  yeah now the pentagon's using radar balloon network to track cars in six midwestern states
[54:50.160 --> 54:54.720]  i mean this is a military industrial complex out of control that isanauer told us about
[54:54.720 --> 55:00.480]  that it's just gobbling up like a cancer and eating america and eating our troops and and eating
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.080]  our sovereignty it's not our military at the top it's globalist traders that tell you white people
[55:06.080 --> 55:09.760]  are the main enemy that's the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the adl
[55:12.800 --> 55:17.680]  they're hit larian they're bringing you a race-based system of discrimination and evil
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.720]  so that's all coming up but i mean it it just really is insane that this isn't alexion's territory
[55:24.720 --> 55:31.200]  in that the guy gave no evidence or any history or any background but it is alexion's territory that
[55:31.200 --> 55:37.040]  now they've so discredited talking about false flags even though they're a real part of his human
[55:37.040 --> 55:44.080]  history that now when someone tries to say the russians might do a false flag that can't even
[55:44.080 --> 55:48.320]  be brought up because that's a term you're not allowed to talk about that's the level of political
[55:48.320 --> 55:54.560]  correctness where they're not just banning words like oh we got to ban lynch hall uh because lynching
[55:54.560 --> 56:02.080]  might scare somebody two words like mother and father scare me oh ban them so you can't talk
[56:02.080 --> 56:07.760]  about a known thing in history that the russians might stage an attack on themselves as a pretext
[56:07.760 --> 56:13.200]  to come in i mean that's possible the west does it more often and it is more corrupt in my view
[56:13.200 --> 56:18.800]  right now but the point is this is a real thing being discussed of course they're probably lying
[56:18.800 --> 56:24.240]  about it russia doesn't have a motive to go into ukraine troops and weapons are being massing ukraine
[56:24.240 --> 56:31.440]  to push the russians out of Crimea that they took in 2014 that is their historic land and their
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.240]  main oil pipelines and the west is already trying to cut off their pipelines into europe right now
[56:36.240 --> 56:40.640]  the old ones and the new ones but see i'm a weirdo i know the old pipelines i know the
[56:40.640 --> 56:46.000]  Nord Stream i know the big communication cables i'm a weirdo i don't know the sports scores
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.680]  of your favorite baseball player but i know the names of some of the big cables i know the satellite
[56:51.680 --> 56:58.800]  networks i know how many satellites elon muskis put up i mean i'm into stuff like that i'm a weirdo
[57:01.840 --> 57:06.080]  and i want you to know about all that and so coming up after dr mccullough leaves us
[57:07.200 --> 57:10.560]  we're going to play the club and get into all of it but it's a wild world folks
[57:12.320 --> 57:18.000]  we're going to go to break please don't forget you've only got nine days until the 13th to get 25

[1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:11.280]  boosters i understand it's a turn of phrase we don't mean it but this is really serious but i
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:15.840]  would tell them before they want to make children take it who aren't of age and can't make a decision
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:19.520]  for themselves i would ask people that are wanting to hurt the children because they think there's
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:25.360]  too many people on the planet kill yourselves seriously uh i mean if there's too many people
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:31.120]  show us how you do it bill gates i don't wish any harm upon you i'm not going to attack you
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:36.000]  myself nobody should but if you want to pour gasoline all over yourself on national television
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.080]  you already pay for most of the media so you buy all the channels for an hour come on every channel
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:43.760]  in the world uh that's corporate and then just pour gasoline on yourselves that there's too many
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:49.360]  people and i mean to show you that i mean to act by example lead by example just strike the match
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:53.520]  and self emulate and i will really respect bill gates here's greg rees's report
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.680]  if the government served the people then the government would have nothing to fear from the
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:15.520]  people but it is clear that now the government fears us after years of persistent abuse of the
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:20.800]  constitution during which time they have betrayed robbed injured and killed the Australian people
[1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:26.240]  we have had enough and we are not alone internationally the people are rising up peacefully
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:31.760]  against the unlawful and criminal excesses of those whom they have elected millions of good and
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:36.720]  decent men and women around the world have decided that this war for the world must end
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:41.520]  and they know it will end when enough of us stand up and declare in one voice no more
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:47.120]  here in austria the people are gathering in the nation's capital camber in order to communicate
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:52.640]  their intent that the governor general should meet his constitutional responsibility by dissolving
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:58.320]  the parliament and appointing a new executive council in order to prepare for free and fair
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:04.160]  elections in the long journey from barbarism to civilization days such as these are rare
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:10.240]  seminal days when a people bands together putting aside their petty differences in order to secure
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:16.240]  their lives and their liberty in other words to earn their rights to their sovereign nationhood
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:22.000]  now is the time to play your part in the liberation of austria now is the time to stand alongside
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.840]  your fellow australians and resist tyranny now is the time to ensure your children and grandchildren
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:34.480]  are free you were here because generations ago your ancestors sacrificed all for you it is now
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:41.840]  time to pay that debt for now nothing else matters this is not about politics this is a non-political
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:46.720]  event this is about our very lives and our very future you must strong everything and get the
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:53.360]  camber as soon as you can some have made their way from far afield as adelaide melbourne and rock
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:04:02.160]  hampton what's your excuse and they plan to stay until we win remain calm regardless of the force
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:07.840]  used against you they will provoke a reaction which ultimately will see the use of police snipers
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:15.120]  opening fire this is a reality regardless of the force used against you you must we must
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:22.160]  remain calm in order to win fly drive walk if you must but we need an army of millions in
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:28.720]  camber to win this war and we will win if you attend pack up as much food and water as you can
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.760]  the people already there are sharing and cooperating as never before if you can't find accommodations

[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:45.920]  to it listen to me baby anybody can do it all you gotta do is just let yourself go
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:51.840]  Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest and he's a cardiologist very respected run different government
[1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:58.480]  FDA study programs and he went on Joe Rogan in late December and came on our show a few days later
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:04.640]  and over the next three plus hours he just laid out the science the studies the facts
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:11.520]  citing them all showing everything that he talked about then CNN and every other globalist
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:17.520]  establishment channel around the world literally attacked him then Dr. Malone came on the inventor
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:23.200]  of mRNA they talked to him and just would never those specifically say what they said was wrong
[1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:29.840]  they just say they're crazy they're cooks they're giving out this information but they never showed
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:35.280]  what it was so i asked Dr. McCullough a couple weeks ago to please come on he had time today
[1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:40.800]  he was going to be here but the i-35 from Dallas to Austin basically shut down many areas from the
[1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:47.440]  snowstorm but he joins us now and in the next hour and a half of time we have we're gonna have a lot
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:53.520]  of b-roll after he goes we're gonna play some of the clips of the big anti-forced injection
[1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:59.200]  rally that happened a few weeks ago in DC and more but i wanted him to first get into the Joe
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:05.040]  Rogan interview and it really seems like the tipping point and the attacks and the disinformation
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:11.200]  and how we counter these these disinformation specialists that then project on to us and
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:16.240]  say we are the people involved in disinformation when we are showing people everything we're
[1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:20.400]  claiming so Dr. McCullough thank you so much for coming on with us well thanks for having me
[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:26.320]  well again Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest you can find him on twitter at p underscore
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:33.040]  McCullough MD where do you want to start here? Alex i just wanted to tell the audience about
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:39.200]  the context of my Joe Rogan interview Joe had reached out to me about a month in advance and
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:43.680]  because of scheduling it was about a month period of time for me to get down there I was down there
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:53.600]  on December 8th and you know I sent Joe a slide deck a slide deck of all the data on COVID-19
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:59.200]  that I had in fact a slide deck I've reviewed with your audience in studio that slide deck was
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:06.560]  continuing medical education certified for a presentation at the Association of American
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:12.880]  Physician Insurgents meeting in October of 2020 so this was semi-certified
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:23.040]  every single slide was cited all the evidence was there and so I brought my computer in studio
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:27.520]  and I brought it and I showed Joe the slides and it went over and you know Joe was the journalist
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:33.280]  Joe did not offer any medical opinions neither did I I simply was showing the data I left the
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:40.720]  slide file as well as separate figures for his producers you know as I would with your studio
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:47.040]  and the interesting thing is the reaction actually was let you basically levered at Joe
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:53.600]  as if Joe had quote spread misinformation Joe was the journalist I was the doctor expert I know
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:59.360]  because I've published some of these studies and so the the bottom line is now this is just part of
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:06.320]  of medical scientific interchange no one reached out to me at all no one Spotify no one sent me
[1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:11.840]  any messages no one asked me for the slides or opinions none of the fact checkers reached out
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:16.880]  to me none of the fact checkers produced any of their slides and so my point is and this escalated
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:23.680]  all the way to the White House where Jen Psaki in a press interview said that Rogan should be
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:28.480]  censored I reached out through Twitter and I said listen I'd be happy to sit down with the president
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:36.320]  the surgeon general Jen Psaki we'll go over all the data there now are a thousand papers on vaccine
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:41.360]  injuries in the peer-reviewed literature a thousand papers out so I'd be happy to go through
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:47.280]  there it'll take about a day and we can organize it into myocarditis blood clots we can go through
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:51.840]  all the diseases and they can figure out what published scientific papers they would want to
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:57.920]  censor or not but what you're saying is so key here you spent two plus hours with us after Joe
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:01.920]  only showing part of the slides we didn't have to I mean it would take days as you said this is
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:06.800]  college level you know medical stuff but it's all well known as you said six months ago on the show
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:13.120]  they now have a term in cardiology for vaccine cause myocarditis this is not debated the inserts
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:17.440]  admit it can cause this they admit and increases in it but then they turn around and say you're
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:22.160]  just making it up but then they never challenge what you're specifically lying about in the key as
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:27.680]  you said didn't reach out to you to ever get a comment or let you defend yourself they just lied
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:33.120]  actually they they never reached out for the slides or the the figures I mean they actually
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.280]  never reached out to see the information so I'd be happy to it's an open offer I'm happy to sit down
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:44.880]  with any platform if you know Spotify being a common carrier essentially or any journalist
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:51.680]  I thought Joe Rogan was a very perceptive intelligent wonderful journalist there was no
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:59.440]  hyperbole there was no opinion in fact one of the fact checkers raised some issue with a comment
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:04.960]  about a pandemic planning and you know just as I did with you Alex I referred to the book by
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:10.800]  peter bregan COVID-19 and the global press we are the prey it has all the citations in it actually
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:17.920]  I gave you a print copy Alex so you know I am just referring to the information that's out there
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:24.800]  people can seek it themselves and they can review it themselves absolutely but again they can't
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:29.440]  counter us on facts so they just say disinformation silence them censor them but I think it's safe
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:35.120]  to say this is backfired on them mightily previously Elon Musk had the biggest interview with Joe
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:40.720]  Rogan I had the second third fourth and fifth biggest but now you and Malone's interviews
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:46.240]  are right up there in the top five with myself and Elon Musk which is great so his normal show has
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:51.440]  10 million but now it's got 50 60 70 million on the different platforms because they tried that
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:59.280]  and everywhere the world is waking up and turning against them it's true and you know you know Neil
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:05.920]  Young didn't reach out to me neither did Prince Harry and none of these celebrities you know I'm
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:11.120]  the guest I presented all data I've published in this field you know I've had Aaron Rodgers reach
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:17.680]  out to me I've had Eric Clapton reach out to me I've had Arthur Joseph reach out to me so listen
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:22.640]  it's I'm not it's not a unusual thing for people to reach out and want to have a discussion but
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:27.840]  the fact that Spotify or the White House press secretary no one actually wanted to have a
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:33.360]  discussion review the data they simply wanted to slam Joe Rogan I thought that was wrong and
[1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:38.960]  and unfair and I saw Joe's response and when Joe basically got out there and said listen I brought
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:44.080]  on these experts he's not a doctor and I think both you and Joe have a terrific journalism style
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:51.120]  where you're you're simply you know helping the viewers get access to medical experts exactly we
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:55.760]  have known I mean many many years ago I had Shoemaker and Levy on because I wanted to know
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:14:00.400]  about comets and things you know hitting gas giants and so I didn't do it I'm not an astronomer
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:04.560]  and it was a cool interviewer I had all the people that discovered it the amateur astronomers one
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:09.680]  was a professional too or amateur on it was a two-hour interview and because I'm not an astronomer
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:14.480]  but but I had famous astronomers on it's the same thing we have and that's why they're so scared of
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:19.120]  you is you are one of the top people in your field and so instead of debate your credentials or the
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:24.800]  facts they try to shut down the venue you were on to punish people to not have you on but let me
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:31.040]  guess that's not probably silence to you I would imagine after Joe you got a lot more media requests
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:38.160]  even though you were already flooded you know I had made one statement on Joe Rogan that evolved
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:43.920]  with the science you know on December 8th I said you can't get COVID-19 a second time and on December
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:49.120]  10th the news broke that in fact Omicron broke through natural immunity so when I went on with
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:54.240]  on your show and others you know I will let the I let the audience know I was on Laura Ingram in
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:00.240]  Fox News I said listen you know the the virus is mutated things change but everything is factual I
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:05.760]  think everybody just needs to reduce the tension level here and let's just start discussing the
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:12.240]  data more and more information comes out on my Twitter feed I have you know five papers today

[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:11.360]  why is it from Chiapas mexico the communist well that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:17.360]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:21.200]  it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really they're just a commune
[1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:25.280]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:28.640]  mexican government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:32.400]  it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:36.720]  another name for about 50 more for pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're
[1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:42.160]  gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in
[1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:49.200]  fact i'm not gonna tell you a little story um we had like that okay you want to believe it
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:54.640]  anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't find us
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:20:05.600]  don't want to see that's fine leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:15.600]  alex jones
[1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:22.240]  so the hallmark of my broadcast are that when i talk about something i new radically show it to you
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:26.240]  it doesn't mean that piece of information is always totally accurate doesn't mean things
[1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:33.200]  don't change like dr mccullough said normally viruses don't evolutionary just jump like omnicron
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:38.320]  did and that's why a lot of top scientists said this looks like it was lab manipulated to actually
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:43.440]  in this pandemic and some white hats made it to counter the lab made virus that we know from my
[1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:48.800]  research uh fouchy made but dr mccullough doesn't go there he doesn't like to speculate the point is
[1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:54.880]  is that 99 percent of the time you don't see stuff like that happen but when suddenly okay omnicron
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:59.040]  has now you know done this and people that were immune can get sick from it i know because i've
[1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:05.040]  had both delta and omnicron uh that that's absolutely true uh but when he wasn't wrong
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:09.840]  things just changed in general that's normally how it is but this is a weird wacky world we're in
[1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:14.800]  right now so dr let's go through i think the best place to start is the latest information
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.520]  and people can follow along with that on your twitter account so dr peter mccullough people
[1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:25.520]  should go to fp underscore mc mccullough md or just go to twitter and search dr peter mccullough
[1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:30.800]  we'll also link to his twitter under the live show feed right now so folks can find that easier
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:36.320]  let's start getting into these studies okay well the first one is let's pick up on hasi
[1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:44.480]  at all from the cdc mm wr they published six weeks of safety data of children ages five
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:50.400]  to eleven getting the vaccines and the data were not good at all uh they ended up with
[1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:56.320]  uh 100 serious safety reports 15 percent of which had an elevation in troponin that means
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:02.400]  there's heart injury occurring in children below age 12 we previously didn't think this was possible
[1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:08.000]  when we looked at myocarditis uh before COVID-19 vaccination you almost never saw it before
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.600]  puberty almost this basically just didn't happen a paper by arolia and colleagues from finland
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:19.440]  demonstrated that you know the explosion in myocarditis is very rare but if it happens it
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:24.000]  happens after puberty here with the COVID-19 vaccines it looks like it's going to happen
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:31.920]  in younger children and then in the hasi paper the self-reported data came in from vsafe alex
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:41.360]  and reported their uh systemic reactions were reported in 34 percent of the children on shot one
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:50.160]  40 percent on shot two and then a negative health impact on the children 10 percent of those uh
[1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:59.200]  it shot one and 15 percent in shot two and that's by hasi in mm wr that was just out recently
[1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:05.120]  this does not look good this is cdc data and i can tell you since children at this age have a
[1:23:05.120 --> 1:23:13.120]  negligible symptomatic presentation for COVID-19 and it's likely the majority are now COVID-recovered
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:19.120]  to actually sustain this type of damage and injury is simply unacceptable uh the next day
[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:24.400]  they're trying to spin it i've noticed interrupt they're trying to spin it now that oh inflation's
[1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:29.200]  causing heart attacks including an eight-year-old i have articles saying well now little kids have
[1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:34.240]  heart attacks it's just the new normal it's the stress no doctor what's really happening is first
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:38.640]  they said oh COVID-19 is causing the microcarditis but then now it's happening and people that have
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:43.520]  already been recovered what's really happening no joe rogan i uh you know i've had a conversation
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:49.600]  offline on this too the the COVID-19 the respiratory infection does not cause microcarditis that's
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:55.040]  been ruled out by a paper by joy and colleagues uh from washington university in st louis what
[1:23:55.040 --> 1:23:59.360]  happens in sick adults they can have an isolated elevated troponics because they're sick in the
[1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:05.440]  icu just like someone with pneumococcal sepsis but the clinical definition of myocarditis
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:11.600]  chest pain ekg changes heart failure sky high troponin that is uh basically what we see with
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:17.120]  the vaccines not with the respiratory illness i want to move to uh you made a comment regarding
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:23.680]  mutations of omicron paper out by medical reporter in brish medical journal mahasi it's on my twitter
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:32.400]  feed mahasi uh remember the ba one signifies the omicron variant and then the ba two is the
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:38.080]  sub variant it turns out you're right alex that uh the ba two looks like it's actually a back
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:44.880]  mutation uh where there's been some code restored into the for the spike protein the ba two uh
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:52.960]  that's picking up in um in europe but the point is in the mahasi paper look at this at 25 weeks
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:59.280]  the vaccines only had nine percent vaccine efficacy for the original omicron and only
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:06.080]  13 percent for the ba two and the boosted the freshly boosted calculated vaccine efficacy
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:13.280]  was 63 percent for ba one and 70 percent for uh ba two i can tell you that the non-randomized
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:20.000]  estimates of vaccine efficacy are gross over estimates and these are low gross over estimates
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.440]  what i'm telling you is with no randomized data at this point in time it would be my inference
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:31.600]  that the vaccines are fundamentally useless against omicron which they tried to deny just a
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:36.080]  few months ago they said get your shot all these world leaders and it'll protect you just like
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:40.960]  biden kept saying oh get the shot you're totally protected six months a year after they were admitting
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:47.600]  that it had waning effectiveness well you see this in the report again on my twitter feed by
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:54.000]  ioko bucci also in british medical journal where the national health system alex has
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:00.240]  completely dropped vaccines for the health care workers in the uk uh so i can tell you it's just
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:06.640]  not a compelling proposition uh the next big update actually came from jama in the united
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:13.200]  states has just hit the wires uh very good study high quality antibody study listen to this it's by
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:22.480]  alizio al e j o alex in those who have covet recovered like you and i 99 percent have positive
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:29.200]  antibodies and it's not limited by time with with these uh better antibody tests of those who had
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:36.880]  suspected covet but never got a test 55 percent antibodies and completely asymptomatic 11 percent
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:43.280]  at antibodies and now we saw something hit the news wire that starbucks and g e and other companies
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:49.360]  are hiring back unvaccinated workers since unvaccinated workers look so good in terms of
[1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:54.560]  their immunity for those who are covet recovered and i'll just interrupt before you keep going and
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:58.720]  go back because i saw this is one of the reasons i was begging you to come on last week this is huge
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:03.760]  to have the british medical system the uk saying okay we're not going to make our workers take it
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:08.960]  anymore and then they start sourcing and people have interviewed them and they're told hey we're
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:13.760]  told this vaccine's getting pulled soon or the whole program is going to be pulled we've we've
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:17.200]  seen that we've heard that from sources in the uk have you heard any rumblings
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:24.320]  no i haven't you know i've been calling for the vaccine mandates to be dropped and the vaccines
[1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:29.680]  to be pulled from the market for quite some time and and i hope it's soon uh you know many uh when
[1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:37.280]  i always had a packed auditorium in uh fox river lutheran church in illinois last weekend alex and i
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:42.080]  when i mentioned the idea of the vaccines being pulled off the market there was a standing room
[1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:47.520]  ovation people thought it would be a national holiday the day the vaccines go away i want to
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:53.360]  point you to another paper in jama out by akashi and colleagues and this is the results of all the
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:59.840]  asymptomatic testing done at the olympics now i was on newsmax with rob mitchell before the olympics
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:07.280]  and i forecasted this they ended up doing thousands of a test alex and uh what they found
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:15.040]  is that the rate of picking up any positive test at the olympics was 0.44 percent and it was clinically
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:20.720]  useless so i've said for the longest time we should follow the regulatory science here
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:26.880]  and patients with no symptoms should never be tested the tests are only approved or clinically
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:33.120]  cured to use as a diagnostic aid in acutely sick individuals wow we're gonna go to break
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:40.000]  you got so much to cover what are we gonna hit next i want to hit some highlights from the senate

[1:32:05.200 --> 1:32:11.760]  their world id and then that's exactly what the covid passports are all about and clout swab and the
[1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:17.760]  un and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've gotten you with that
[1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:24.400]  system then they're gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do and publicly they're
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:29.920]  saying they're gonna decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then
[1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:34.720]  all the other companies are currently announcing they're gonna track what you do and where you go
[1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:41.040]  and tax you with a carbon tax for it this is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen
[1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:46.160]  this is the takeover in humanity better wake up and say no finally folks are starting to wake up
[1:32:46.160 --> 1:32:50.480]  Joe Rogan Tucker Carlson others who leave the charts along with info wars but it's not enough
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:55.600]  every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice
[1:32:55.600 --> 1:32:59.040]  you see they need the fear of god put in them legally and lawfully
[1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:06.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:15.120]  i've got a tiger by the tail that's way to see
[1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:26.400]  i won't be much when you get through with me he never gives up he's alex jones broadcasting
[1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:34.080]  from deep in the heart of texas worldwide well i've stopped well they definitely got a tiger
[1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:40.720]  by the tail with the medical community of doctors and scientists and nurses and lab technicians
[1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:45.920]  that are seeing all this cancer explode you've got the epidemiologists going public you've got
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:51.360]  the pathologists of the world going public from germany to japan to the united states to canada
[1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:57.600]  who's who i mean i'm actually proud of the scientific community at the real level but then
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:03.120]  you got the big pharma corporations and big tech and the big media together trying to force these
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:08.480]  products down people's throats and man is it blowing up in their face you got bill gates
[1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:13.440]  his wife now publicly separating herself not just from jeffrey eppstein and her husband
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:19.680]  but from his agenda i mean these are rats leaving the sinking ship maybe she's a good
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:24.320]  person and didn't know how bad he was seductive mccullough i want to talk about the 35 000 foot
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:28.480]  view and you'll have the florida drilling all the science and facts like you like but as a
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:34.080]  as a patriot you know as an american as a doctor as a citizen as a free soul
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:38.320]  how do you see this fight going it looks like they've got a tiger by the tail and they're
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:41.680]  getting torn up by it and then i got a little concerned what are they going to counter that
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:46.880]  i mean you've got former black rock fund managers high level coming out saying we've crunched the
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:52.000]  numbers what fares what the pentagon numbers show it's even worse there's mass death and illness
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:56.880]  everywhere this is happening you can't hide it it's historic everybody anecdotally sees it plus
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:01.280]  we see it the numbers what would you call this moment in history and how do you think the system
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:06.080]  extricates itself because this is going to make other bad drugs that were put on the market
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:11.760]  historically that caused disasters look tame in comparison is this the biggest medical malpractice
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:18.320]  big pharma disaster in human history you know what i see is the first wave was the respiratory
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:23.840]  illness which caused great fear and and and the medical community and and the public responding
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:30.240]  to it but the vaccine rollout the worldwide indiscriminate vaccine rollout has really
[1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:36.080]  galvanized the world on freedom now it's not freedom like one country and its borders with
[1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:42.640]  another country it's medical freedom it's the personal freedom to decide what goes into one's
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:49.040]  own body and we saw that on the steps of the lincoln memorial the defeat the mandates american
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:56.480]  homecoming march and then about 35 000 march from the washington monument to the lincoln memorial
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:04.320]  and uh tj sears whose austin's own comedian was the moderator i gave the leadoff medical
[1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:13.600]  presentation and uh we had doctors scientists nurses lawyers public health officials really
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:20.880]  a spirited presentation by austin's del big tree of that was fantastic and and i tell you
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:27.120]  everyone was listening to every word of bobby kennedy that was the backdrop for january 23rd
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:34.080]  and then we moved right into the historic us senate panel led by republican ron johnson from
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:41.040]  wisconsin i co-moderated the panel and the title of the panel was a second opinion on
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:49.680]  covet 19 and boy i couldn't have any better title so putting on your citizen cap where do you see
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:53.520]  this going i mean you even have the head of the unvaccine program as you know it got almost no
[1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:57.520]  attention two weeks ago saying don't give this to children you have the e you a month ago saying
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:01.040]  don't give it to children you have all these different federal regulators having to resign
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:05.040]  because they said don't give it to children and then here's biden and sake and and all their little
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:10.240]  paid for minions on youtube and instagram saying you better do it you know the children will die
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:15.120]  if you don't i mean these people realize the crime they've signed on to because you could argue they
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:19.120]  did it by accident they didn't know before i think all things preventative evidence is there
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:26.080]  but now they know and so now they are committing the crime the wall is crumbling it seems like
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:30.960]  bricks are falling on either side of the wall you know when we were in dc we couldn't even get a
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:38.000]  cup of coffee without showing a vaccine card in dc but we go a few miles into the uh state of virginia
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:45.440]  was easy to you know no masks no vaccines required scottland ireland and england the uk just dropped
[1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:50.800]  all mandates including vaccine mandates that's happening in a few places so does sweden so does
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:56.480]  sweden it's like dominoes it's like dominoes in the united states the city of denver just dropped
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:04.160]  all its mandates starbucks dropped its mandates ge and others so you're going to see this fracturing
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:10.560]  here but what happened in the u.s senate panel was five hours of truth bombs and it was dozens and
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:17.280]  dozens of of doctors and scientists nurses patients and others and i have to tell you by the way
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:21.840]  let me interrupt we put up five or six versions of this one's five hours long one's three hours
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:26.320]  long there's a bunch of short clips but everybody needs to see the whole presentation
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:30.960]  wherever you find it folks you need to get it what's the best term to to search doctor to find the
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:38.080]  full senate committee meeting i think just search u.s senate panel second opinion ron johnson one of
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:44.000]  the best alex is a 38 minute highlight reel i'll shoot that over to your producers to get that up
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:51.120]  it's up on youtube and i have to tell you what i learned from this is that uh there are far more
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:57.280]  doctors who understand covet 19 is a treatable illness uh than i ever thought uh we heard from
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:01.280]  the father of critical care the person who's published more on critical care than anybody in
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:07.680]  the world paul merrick he said flat out based on his analysis and he cited the data remdesivir
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:14.160]  is killing americans and that's right and just to be clear we have that 38 minute clip so when
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:18.560]  this shows over today and we archive it to go viral folks i know it'll get a million views and he's
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:23.280]  10 million listeners we've got some videos of five six seven million but none of ever hit 10 million
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:28.800]  a band on video i want to reach more people this is a life and death situation uh you you you
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:34.000]  mentioned remdesivir we will add the video you talked about at the end of the report but i have
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:39.760]  articles out of the epic times very credible with all the links to it it all over the u.s not just
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:44.560]  in canada or europe they are taking people away from their families they are intubating them
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:49.600]  just like they did the last two years and they are forcing them on remdesivir and killing them so
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:55.280]  this is being called by the epic times not by me that's radical for them medical kidnapping what's
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:02.560]  going on here it's true we heard from dr erin carady former professor at uc ervine a professor
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:08.560]  of psychiatry at human ethics expert present and testified to that fact this is all in the senate
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:14.400]  record now i think it's the authoritative nature of the presenters when when paul merrick who's
[1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:19.120]  published more on critical care he's taking care of acutely sick covid patients in the hospital
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:25.120]  hundreds of them when he said his analysis from desivir is killing people when erin carady you
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:29.680]  know who's in ethics he does hospital ethics consults and he said basically patients are
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:34.960]  imprisoned against their will i mean these were truth bombs i asked christina parks uh respected
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:41.680]  scientist a phd scientist from michigan uh who's african-american i asked her are african-americans
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:47.200]  being denied treatment elix you know what she said she said yes dr mccullough my dad just died
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:54.240]  three days ago of covid and he was denied monoclonal antibodies in early treatment absolutely i remember
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:41:00.000]  asking you months ago are they suppressing monoclonal antibodies you said it looks like it
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.040]  and then i talked to people that actually run clinics in texas they said yeah but we don't
[1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:08.560]  want to you know buck the system right now now they've since gone public but and then last week
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:15.520]  biden comes out and just says they don't work uh is that true there's a paper by poliam and colleagues
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:20.960]  from south africa it's a modeling study not a clinical study suggesting that the lily product
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:26.800]  and the regeneran product may not hit the omicron uh ba one variant and we don't know about the ba
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:33.840]  two sub variant but clearly sotirivumab the gsk product does and uh it's designed to actually
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:39.040]  cover mutant strains since it targets a glycoprotein part of the spike protein that's not amenable to
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:46.080]  mutation so that gsk product's been e way approved from me and so i was on sean hannity radio i said
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:50.080]  sean we're at the battle of the bulge with omicron we've got some six seniors who will get
[1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:56.080]  symptomatic we need to use it where's the gsk product our administration is completely falling
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:01.680]  flat on supply lines and here we are when we really need it we've got a high quality product
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:07.920]  the federal government has no accountability or transparency on where it is well it seems like a
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:15.200]  faulty doesn't own a stake in it it doesn't get promoted you know just the therapeutics overall
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:21.840]  have not been promoted twitter feed today senator um rand paul says we have to be focused on therapeutics
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:27.840]  that's what ron johnson has said all along do you know that ron johnson invited dozens and dozens of
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:33.200]  public health officials and others to attend the second opinion and learn from expert doctors who
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:38.640]  are publishing and those who are treating covet nineteen patients no one showed up that is so
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:44.000]  powerful let's talk about that when we come back and something else senator paul said he's gonna call
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:50.560]  for a criminal investigation have hearings uh on faulty so that's all happening if the republicans
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:55.520]  went back in control of the senate and with this senator the democratic senator almost dead from the
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:43:01.120]  shot it looks like it may be sooner than we thought with all the craziness going on in the world
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:06.640]  with the globalist plotting their next big lockdown with the next phase of the great reset
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:13.520]  being a stage cyber attack with the deep state pushing a civil war not just here but in europe
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:19.280]  and war with russia with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:24.800]  like supply chain breakdowns you need to get prepared now with high quality storeable food

[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:06.080]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:28.080]  he agrees with me
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:37.440]  well big pharma tried to take over and it looked like they were winning it first but right now
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:41.600]  it's blowing up their face up to peter mccullough is our guest there's so many places to go so many
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:47.440]  studies so much do breaking news i know you're not a vindictive person but fouchy in the gain of
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:52.640]  function and the things he said the things he's done uh senator paul that you mentioned is is
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:57.120]  now saying he's really going to go after him i don't even want to go after these people except
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:00.960]  it seems like if we don't discredit them and go after them they're going to keep coming after us
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:08.000]  with lockdowns that john hobkins has discredited and more quote boosters that don't even work and
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  vaccine passports so it just seems like we've got to really go after the system what's your view
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.480]  on that and how do we punish those in power that have done this they don't do it again
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:25.360]  well tensions are clearly mounting uh you know at our u.s senate panel by video uh professor j
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:32.880]  batachara from stanford who's one of the authors of um uh the great barrington declaration he's
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:39.040]  been a directly attacked by our our director of the national allergy immunology branch at the
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:45.840]  nih and remember alex that a division head at the nih is not a very high position and the nih is a
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:50.880]  government research organization they work for us you know i'm an academic doctor the NIH basically
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:56.960]  is subservient to a clinical investigator which would be my status the cdc is an outbreak investigation
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:02.640]  unit they also work for us and then the fda is a drug safety watchdog organization and they do the
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:08.640]  advertising labels for the new drugs remember these agencies do not sit above doctors in the public
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:14.080]  they're actually below us they work for us they serve us that's the kind of employment relationship
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:20.720]  so we have a situation where the doctors the treating doctors are the ones who have a superiority
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:27.680]  in any type of decision any type of clinical care and really honestly have superiority in the decisions
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:33.200]  on how and to interpret the data and so j batachara has been very fair he's a frequent contributor
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:40.400]  on fox news along with myself and scott atlas and kurt milhohn and rea skewy uh and others and we've
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:48.560]  been very fair as we review the data and we go on many news channels oan newsmax etc what we have
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:54.960]  not seen is we have not seen fair balance with respect to our public health officials or even
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:50:00.560]  our executive branch people when there's statements so for instance anytime the vaccine is presented
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:06.880]  it must be according to law it must be presented with risks and benefits that there's the truth
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:12.320]  in advertising the u.s. food and drug cosmetic act and the landmine act that all say any biopharmaceutical
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:18.000]  product e way or not must be presented in fair balance and you know there's no fair balance
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:25.440]  president biden is basically barked to command saying get vaccinated doctor i think you hit
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:33.440]  something really central here we have corporations trying to take over the the office of doctors
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:40.720]  and of healers and that's what this really is is a corporate media big tech war trying to say
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:45.520]  that they are who you can go to and when they tell you something you better live by it forget a
[1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:53.200]  second opinion as they try to gag the the real medical people i mean it just seems extremely
[1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:58.640]  evil and that's what this fights is all about it's true and you know doctors have to show some
[1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:03.760]  backbone uh and i can tell you the the doctors in this group had no problem doing that pierre
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:09.360]  quarry uh the fearless leader of the frontline critical care consortium ryan call who really
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:15.360]  brought up the issue about the vaccines and the emerging data on cancer uh richard urso
[1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:25.840]  of uh around the table david wiseman former j and j uh scientists vaccine scientists robert
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:32.880]  malone uh independent consultant and patent holder on messenger RNA vaccines uh this was an all star
[1:51:32.880 --> 1:51:40.160]  cast paul alexander former white house advisor who advisor christina parks uh i've mentioned you
[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:45.120]  just kept going on and on jennifer bridges who's the lead nurse in the houston methodist case and
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:51.600]  jennifer bridges told america what it was like to be a nurse in a room with a patient with acutely
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:56.400]  ill covet nineteen and what she did to compassionately care for patients and how she lost her job
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:00.560]  because she couldn't take the vaccines you couldn't medically take the vaccine i mean this was
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:05.760]  stunning testimony it was five hours there was no break and it was uh it was extraordinary
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:11.680]  absolutely extraordinary again i could guide the discussion but you're the expert here what
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:15.680]  else you want to get to the viewers mind out there so they're aware of what's happening
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:22.720]  well the very important updates now are that uh it's becoming fundamentally clear
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:27.920]  that there's little or no interest in our seniors you never hear our public health agencies
[1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:33.440]  talk about our seniors but our seniors still are where the action are there still are going
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:38.560]  to be some seniors who get hospitalized or worse with omicron there's no mention of them
[1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:45.440]  there's an incredible focus on children we've now heard about trying to vaccinate children below
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:50.240]  age five remember children there's been no school outbreaks the kids are back at school
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:56.640]  there's no credible student to teacher spread with serious illness we know the transmission is
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:02.560]  within the household usually adult to child when it happens majority of children probably are
[1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:08.640]  actually already now already immune that the focus now in children under age five and here it would be
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:15.600]  Pfizer giving five micrograms of messenger RNA and the the trials actually failed to raise immunity
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:20.240]  the children's bodies were pretty adept at fighting off the messenger RNA now there's some
[1:53:20.240 --> 1:53:24.960]  recalculation of trying to push forward even though they're not efficacious uh you know these are
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:30.000]  things that parents need to understand when i gave my presentation on the steps of the Lincoln
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:35.440]  Memorial i said really the the decision is in everyone's hands if everyone tomorrow worldwide
[1:53:35.440 --> 1:53:40.880]  said no this entire program crumbles and you know what we are having a rally in Washington there
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:49.120]  were dozens and dozens of rallies and marches occurring over the the leading up to this all
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:54.640]  over the world and then shortly afterwards was this massive Canadian convoy that converged on
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:54:00.560]  Ottawa's really made the news heroes like paul alexander were there roger hodkinson uh dr
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:06.480]  peness uh these were absolutely terrific canadian heroes many americans can't get across the border
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:11.440]  because they haven't taken the vaccine but i tell you our canadians have really made us proud
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:16.960]  they're basically shot dr peter mccullough you're absolutely right and a point you raised because
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:20.240]  you're the doctor but i've looked at the studies that's what i gleaned from them but you can correct
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:28.160]  me if i'm wrong the children are so powerful they're fighting off the attempt by the gmo injection
[1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:32.640]  to take over their cells so it's not working and they even admit the headlines doesn't work but
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:40.400]  still let's do it just to have that pretext to own children's bodies i guess it's going to
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:45.840]  cause harm there's no doubt about it there's no benefit then there's only harm uh the data do
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:51.760]  not look good on safety across the board you know i i've said from the very beginning young people
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:59.600]  should not take the the vaccine because uh more harm than good we're going to cover a lot of news
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:05.680]  the next 30 minutes what are we going to cover next well i'd like to pick up on the whole issue
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:13.840]  of uh the erosion of the mandates and the data that are coming forward on masking social distancing
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:20.320]  lockdowns uh and it's it's it's real indictment that just came out of john's hopkins and marty
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:25.840]  macri who's also one of my colleagues from john's hopkins frequent contributor on fox news uh it's
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:32.880]  become clear now that uh the virus wasn't impacted at all by social distancing wearing masks or
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:38.960]  lockdowns and they've caused irreparable harm uh harm on an individual psychological level
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:45.440]  from a sociologic level economic uh you know this is irrecoverable we can't go backwards now
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:51.280]  uh because children uh have been impacted uh families have been fractured there are suicides
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:57.520]  we can't get back you know there's more suicides in the military than military actually getting
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:05.040]  serious covid 19 or dying with covid 19 uh the same thing would be true true in teenagers uh so
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:08.800]  so they dr mccullough stay right there we're going to come back with 30 more minutes with you we
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:12.480]  really appreciate your time today and by the way i'm going to ask you about this when we come back
[1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:17.840]  you saw the headline denver won't make adults take the shot or wear a mask but children have to
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:21.280]  because that's the little prisoners they've got with the national education association
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:24.960]  trying to create a cult this is a true war crime against humanity ladies and gentlemen

[2:00:09.040 --> 2:00:18.400]  me right all right welcome back a lot of stations carry the first five minutes but some don't
[2:00:18.400 --> 2:00:24.720]  someone to ask dr peter mccullough board certified cardiologist and one of the main experts out
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:28.560]  there exposing all the sustainability has been totally vindicated to hit some other important
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:33.200]  subjects so that next segment when the bunch of stations join us we can get into the mandates the
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:37.840]  lockdowns the john hopkins report that broke over a week ago and it's gotten also no coverage it's
[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:42.080]  been blacked out so that's coming up here about six minutes but what else is on your radar screen
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:51.360]  well i think the big news is that um the lead attorney tom rents and co-counsel lead dundas
[2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:57.680]  came to the table at the historic senate panel held on monday january 24th ron johnson uh
[2:00:57.680 --> 2:01:03.680]  covet 19 a second opinion and what rents and dundas presented was data from three
[2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:12.240]  department of defense whistleblowers and they gave department defense data which is very important
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:16.640]  because this is clinical data it's not there is it's not self reported where they knew vaccine
[2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:22.240]  administration and they knew the diseases that occurred after the vaccine uh and there were
[2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:32.880]  several fold increases in neurologic cardiac including myocarditis miscarriages hematologic
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:38.720]  disease elix the disclosure was stunning uh senator ron johnson said that that that those
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:43.440]  data and reports had been subpoenaed he actually took action swiftly subpoena to make sure they
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:50.240]  didn't fudge the numbers afterwards so all this typically is out in the open and that's why when
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:59.280]  i see fauci and i see uh the head of fizer on tv they don't look as arrogant as they used to look
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:05.440]  they look like the air has been let out of them it's true i think they know they have a giant
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:11.280]  safety problem on their hands that you know in the open verus system uh and they've now clarified
[2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:15.840]  this i've had some personal communication with the group that runs the open verus system it's an
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:20.400]  overlay and i've done my own queries i've done my own verus queries to validate this
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:26.080]  that about 90 percent of what we see are domestic reports uh 10 percent are actually us that report
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:31.760]  through the vast majority are actually reported by the pharmaceutical companies and then by doctors
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:37.680]  or other healthcare workers to verus sadly we're over 21 000 people have lost their lives
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:44.720]  about 50 within two days 80 within a week the deaths are very quick we know that 86
[2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:50.800]  percent of the time by mcglacklin and collie showed this that the only a cause is the vaccine it's a
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:57.600]  giant signal we were approaching 400 000 hospitalizations er visits and office visits
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:04.720]  for vaccine injuries sadly we've topped 40 000 now permanently disabled americans
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:09.840]  because they've taken a covet 19 vaccine so the sentiment that i'm hearing is that people are
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:15.680]  furious they feel like they've been duped because they took the vaccine they got covet anyway they
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:21.680]  took enormous risks they've seen family members friends church uh members and others be injured
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:27.200]  or even worse die after the vaccine americans are becoming furious over the vaccine program
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:33.440]  well that was actually my next question how are they going to get away with this and it it's just
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:38.000]  crazy because what you're saying is true i see it online i see it in person i know a lot of people
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  took two or three shots and now they're mad because they got even sicker and so they're really angry
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:47.360]  now that fouchy and others are saying take four take five take six look at israel i mean it's crazy
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:54.640]  you know the who is advising against it now the who is basically questioned the utility of any
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:03:59.680]  further boosters and in fact there's some statements led out by the european medical
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:05.040]  association european health association saying that the vaccines actually may weaken the immunity
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:10.400]  and there's a good rationale for that because the body continues to be loaded with the spike protein
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:15.680]  so the immune system is basically taxed with trying to clear out this foreign protein it gets
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:21.520]  distributed into the brain the heart blood vessels all through the body and then recently
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:28.560]  stephanie sent off who's a phd uh scientist at mit was on laura ingram and stephanie and i are
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:34.240]  publishing together she's discovered that the messenger RNA itself travels in exosomes and
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:41.040]  the messenger RNA itself uh you know maybe be and probably does have direct toxicity in a loan
[2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:46.320]  and separate from the spike protein clearly exosomes can travel along neurons into the brain
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:51.600]  and we certainly have a risk of a neurologic injury from the spike protein and the messenger
[2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:55.200]  and i want to talk more about that and then the big news the lockdown straight ahead

[2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:29.520]  Dr. peter mccullough is right up there in the top two or three people in the world exposing
[2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:36.720]  and fighting the biomedical world government world id world social credit score vaccine passport
[2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:43.120]  takeover because even if these shots work great i'd be taking them but i wouldn't want the vaccine
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:49.040]  passport to control and track where i go on what i do that's really the big scandal and the big
[2:06:49.040 --> 2:06:54.160]  corporations admit this is just their power move to get total control over our lives and consolidate
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:58.480]  control but you were getting into and i'm glad you bring this up because i've been making this
[2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:03.440]  point all week long and so did paul watson when he was on yesterday i read this whole thing when
[2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:08.320]  it came out a week ago or so it's only 60 something pages long and a lot of it i've seen in the news
[2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:12.240]  i've heard from you and others but it's outrageous to have john hopkins one of the most respected
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:17.120]  you know medical university systems in the world that actually quarterbacked a lot of the you know
[2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:24.880]  the whole cuba tyranny coming out from the belly of the beast and saying this didn't help anybody
[2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:29.680]  and this caused mass suicide and depression and death and not to mention destroyed the economy
[2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:35.360]  and admits that and consolidated power but oh the big billionaires on average doubled their wealth so
[2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:42.080]  now we see where this is all going why did so many american mainstream media outlets ignored the
[2:07:42.080 --> 2:07:48.160]  reputable university study that lockdowns didn't work john hopkins study lockdowns did not reduce
[2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:56.080]  covid deaths but had devastating effects close quote on society that's another headline new
[2:07:56.080 --> 2:08:01.360]  john hopkins study lockdowns have had little to no public health effects close quote it imposed
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:05.920]  enormous economic and social costs those are quotes and so when you read info wars you have to
[2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:14.480]  believe me we link to the actual study here right now so dr peter mccullough you've read this this
[2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:21.120]  is a huge story uh why is it so big and please go over it for us elix it's cohesive i think the main
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:27.440]  thing i want your audience to understand it's cohesive so j baruchara who testified in the
[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:33.280]  senate panel by video presented the principles of the great barrington declaration which was signed
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:39.840]  uh in mid 2020 and it was clear the great barrington declaration of which had thousands and
[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:46.800]  thousands of expert sign said listen no lockdowns don't do it it's going to cause harm uh scott atlas
[2:08:46.800 --> 2:08:54.640]  who's uh you know what was on the white house task force on the going to cause harm we had paul
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:59.680]  alexander advisor to president trump and then the who paul testified at the senate paul showed all
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:05.440]  the data there was no benefit to public masking no benefit to lockdowns from all the studies paul
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:12.000]  has tabulated this in the brownstone institute and then this paper comes out from johns hopkins
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:18.560]  really a meta analysis synthesizing all the information it's conclusive it's not just one person
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:26.320]  it is clear that it was a colossal mistake to ever put a mask on somebody without symptoms
[2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:30.400]  it was a colossal mistake to have people stay in their homes who didn't have covet 19 the only
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:34.800]  people needed a quarantine was the small fraction of people who are sick at any given time and we
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:41.120]  only quarantine when we give early treatment in order to basically make the syndrome uh resolve
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:49.680]  so we have a situation here where the the social and psychological and uh economic impact is
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:56.720]  disastrous and now there are three more analyses one by supermanian camp and beady all showing
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:03.600]  from a medical perspective the mass vaccination program was a colossal disaster so everywhere
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:10.320]  where there's a greater intensity of vaccination there are more and more covet 19 cases and there's
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:16.880]  more deaths so it's clear from the very beginning there wasn't a single step that was taken from
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:23.040]  a public health perspective that turned out to be a correct step we've got a clip i know you're
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:26.720]  familiar with him talking about a lot of scientists and epidemiologists and virologists have talked
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:31.120]  about it but what about what malone keeps pointing out a year ago and now currently it's been proven
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:36.560]  i mean at least by what i've seen as a layperson that when you give a bunch of so-called vaccines
[2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:41.680]  or gene therapies to people while a virus is in in the middle of a big blow-up you're going to put
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:46.240]  evolutionary stress on it and you're going to make super viruses come out so as whereas normally
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:51.440]  viruses get less lethal over time that actually doing a mass injection program of vaccine during
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:57.200]  it can actually create even more deadly ones and cause all sorts of problems what is your view of
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:11:03.840]  that you know i think i'm packet now i'm an internist and cardiologist i'm a trained epidemiologist
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:09.680]  and i i've been focusing on this for two years now i basically have a fellowship in at least
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:16.560]  covid-19 infectious disease and i see an exam in patients and i treat them my view on this is that
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:24.160]  it's clear in analyses by nissen vincotic christianan and others including the original report
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:33.040]  on the border of basawana of omicron is clear that mass vaccination has promoted the advancement
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:40.400]  of super dominant mutants we went from a blend of wild type alpha beta gamma into a super dominant
[2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:47.040]  delta as a result of mass vaccination and then super dominant delta right into super dominant
[2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:50.480]  omicron literally it just changed within a few weeks the only thing that can do that is mass
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:56.160]  vaccination because the immunity is so narrow narrow what the virus is doing is it taking
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:01.520]  advantage of the nasal cavity so with omicron it replicates 70 times faster than that of delta
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:06.720]  in the nasal cavity it closes the immunologic door on omicron by forming immunity against
[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:11.760]  against delta i'm sorry so omicron forms immunity against delta omicron obviously forms great
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:16.560]  immunity against itself so what we're seeing is the virus is climbing
[2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:25.520]  called bottleneck and then it finds a way to innovate and survive if we didn't have the vaccine
[2:12:25.520 --> 2:12:31.440]  program it's my estimation that that the whole pandemic would have been closed by this time
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:37.280]  we haven't seen the specter of what geert van der Bosch and malone have implicated that we have
[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:43.680]  a hyper dominant strain that's more lethal thank goodness that hasn't happened yet but we must
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:50.400]  stop vaccination now in order to let diversity in natural immunity and diversity in the viral
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:58.240]  strains come back into play what about ad you know outside of a paper by liu and colleagues
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:03.840]  i looked at that carefully that from a preclinical perspective suggested it could happen and then the
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:09.360]  burst of cases we see after shot number one with the messenger RNA vaccines uh this is a
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:14.720]  Pfizer briefing booklet by the way i think that's the only manifestation of ad we've seen remember
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:20.720]  antibody dependent enhancement means the disease is enhanced or more uh more severe and so far
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:26.400]  we haven't seen that i can tell you alex and you probably can uh test this yourself omicron's a far
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:32.960]  milder oh it was not even very bad cold at all yeah but delta man i was i felt like that was rough
[2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:38.240]  right it was definitely not the flu or cold i've never been sick like that you could tell like this
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:44.160]  is new yeah that's true i think most people and by the way i was been on fox news marty
[2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:50.080]  macri orzhan that with that week this came out omicron is basically acting like a natural booster
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:55.120]  it's boosting the immunity of someone who's covered recovered but it's also boosting the immunity of
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:59.600]  the vaccinated so i tell many of my vaccinated patients listen it's not a bad thing uh it's a
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:03.680]  very mild syndrome well i know you don't like to speculate but a lot of scientists have looked at it
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:09.680]  and said it looks like it was built to counter uh what was built by looks like Fauci i mean i mean
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:15.360]  how do we speculate how do we know looking at what happened with the omicron it's hard to know
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:22.080]  remember most mutations are either deletions or substitutions the unique thing with omicron it
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:27.280]  actually had an insertion so it actually had some new code inserted into the receptor body
[2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:32.400]  domain so i mean that's what's raised the speculation was i mean again i'm not a genetic
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:37.600]  engineer but like a lot of the big institutions even said wow what is like 20 plus changes just
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:43.840]  in the spike protein i was actually 30 in the spike protein but it's peppered around the receptor
[2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:48.640]  binding domain i showed your audience that diagram from vancate christian you know there's a company
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:53.920]  in boston called inference and they're doing great work they're doing great sequencing work using
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:59.520]  modeling and you know there's actually a lot of great science out there elix it's not all bad
[2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:06.000]  and you know the the medical field is advancing in this understanding of covet 19 it's just that i
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:10.240]  think at this point how we need to drop the mandates pull the vaccines off the market
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:16.000]  and then let us treat the final cases i want to be clear it's like a gun a gun can be used to hunt
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:19.840]  food or defend yourself we're going to be used to rob people or a tractor could be used to pull
[2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:24.720]  houses down or you know plow fields so i'm all for science i just don't want the bad guys having
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:29.440]  control of it and then silencing us because isn't science about second and third opinions and open
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:35.440]  debate is it the idea that don't question science is that the opposite of science it is science is
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:40.720]  all about discourse and debate this happened in the senate panel people disagreed i pointed
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:46.800]  out to senator ron johnson disagreement is normal for us to advance the field wow dr
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:51.040]  peter mccullough final segment so much to hit stay with us and i got big breaking news every
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:16:01.360]  goes we're so thankful for him being here sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:06.960]  with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large if you're having trouble
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:12.720]  getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of our new sleep support formula down and out
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:18.960]  it's just the thing it's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to
[2:16:18.960 --> 2:16:25.120]  help you get the shut-eye you deserve formulated to improve upon our best-selling product knockout

[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:42.240]  it one of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used
[2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:48.080]  by native americans like the cherries who used it for its relaxing qualities be sure to take
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:53.920]  this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out selling
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:17:01.920]  out now at it for store dot com i want to explain something that is absolutely feed
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:06.880]  understanding our world it's very very simple but the most people don't know the privately owned
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:13.440]  central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:21.360]  other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property energy
[2:17:21.360 --> 2:17:27.760]  they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:31.840]  so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that money
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:36.560]  to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:41.520]  gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up
[2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:47.120]  everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force a
[2:17:47.120 --> 2:17:52.240]  collapse of civilization making the companies they do find the only things left standing
[2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:56.480]  this is the great reset this is what's happening now warn everyone it's the only way to stop it
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:05.280]  get our great bag of it here i mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the
[2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:10.320]  communists well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:15.520]  organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:18.880]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:22.960]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government
[2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:26.800]  take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[2:18:26.800 --> 2:18:30.720]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:34.720]  percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere
[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:40.000]  it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm not gonna
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:49.120]  say a little story um we had like that i think you want to believe it anyway so it's infowarstore.com
[2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:52.800]  and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us you don't want to see that's fine
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:02.880]  u n run contact tracers aren't coming they're here all over the world from australia to the
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:08.000]  united states from canada to germany these tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:13.440]  and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into
[2:19:13.440 --> 2:19:18.320]  the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their
[2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:22.960]  shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:27.680]  for their safety this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:32.800]  is to get high quality faraday cages many of which are made here in america and are very compliant
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:39.520]  meaning us government military grade at infowarstore.com we have the entire line of silent pocket ready

[2:19:57.120 --> 2:20:04.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:23.280]  i want to thank dr peter mccullough for his tireless service to truth and to freedom and to my
[2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:28.000]  family and your family everybody's family because there was a integrity of people like him and just
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:34.400]  the armies of good doctors and scientists the vast majority of them it's very few that'll
[2:20:34.400 --> 2:20:38.080]  actually even get up there and chill that's why there's like 10 or 15 you see internationally
[2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:44.160]  up there and they're loathed and they're hated i mean humanity is really seeing through them so evil
[2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:50.480]  always tends to win up front but very soon people turn against it and that's why i love dr
[2:20:50.480 --> 2:20:55.200]  peter mccullough because i'm a factoid obsessed person i read news constantly i'm addicted to it
[2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:58.240]  and i don't just read news because i want to believe it i go research it and try to find out
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:02.640]  the truth and most of the time i'm right sometimes i'm wrong but we're always you know finding out
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:08.080]  more he just mentioned last segment real fast as he rattles off all this data to you for you to go
[2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:15.840]  check that oh the senator in this hearing they had put him on notice do not destroy the data do
[2:21:15.840 --> 2:21:22.640]  not change the data and here's the letter he just mentioned honorable loy j osa secretary of defense
[2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:32.160]  from the senator saying do not destroy this in formation and then sure enough within 24 hours
[2:21:32.160 --> 2:21:37.040]  of that happening the articles on info wars dot com by don salazar with links to defense
[2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:43.520]  department's own link site dod claims glitch in database after attorney exposes skyrocketing
[2:21:43.520 --> 2:21:48.800]  military vaccine injuries and now the fda suddenly scrubs moderna document from website
[2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:55.120]  had for reporters ask question this is what guilty people do so you mentioned senator
[2:21:55.120 --> 2:22:00.800]  ron johnson him doing this here's the letter bringing up the hypertension diseases of nervous
[2:22:00.800 --> 2:22:08.800]  system 1000 plus percent hypertension 2000 plus malignant neoplasms 894 this is what their own
[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:14.480]  data shows it mirrors data out of europe and boy they are trying to spike this right now i tell you
[2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:20.640]  that this is amazing you talk about hand in the cookie jar here doctor you know this is the first
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:27.440]  time that i've seen data aggregate data on cancer and note it was breast cancer that was the lead
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:32.560]  you know there had been a paper published earlier a lot of people that you know overlooked it
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:37.680]  was published by university of pittsburgh showing that the s2 segment of the spike protein which is
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:43.680]  produced in those who take the vaccine interacts with the brca or the brackaging which controls
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:49.600]  breast cancer and female reproductive cancer now we have the data emerging from the dod now
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:55.920]  you know it's either discovery bias that is you know people held back on mammograms and they held
[2:22:55.920 --> 2:23:03.040]  back on other screenings or in fact it's it's real that it's an explosive rising cancer pathologist
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:08.320]  ryan kohl testified in the senate committee he thought it was real i've talked to scott atlas
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:12.400]  and i tend to agree with scott i think it's probably discovery bias but i tell you those
[2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:18.080]  who are on this cancer trail right now this is worrisome because you know so many people have
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:24.320]  accepted the vaccines they never understood what was in them and now the first dod hard data under
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:30.800]  file senator ron johnson and this all this is going to generate tremendous investigation
[2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:33.920]  because dr mccullough let me stop you there because you've been out for a long time talking about
[2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:39.440]  this but i remember i remember dr yedon former chief scientist over vaccines and respiratory stuff
[2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:44.960]  at fiser and others and wolf king woodard writing that lawsuit in in late 2020 to the e u saying
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:50.240]  don't do this it's going to cause microcarditis heart attacks infertility blood clots cancer
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:56.240]  and then the cdc had a document in october of 2020 saying the same thing so even before it started
[2:23:56.240 --> 2:24:01.120]  the experts knew this would happen both the good guys the bad guys and i guess the asleep people
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:06.880]  so so that's why this is so powerful exactly what the cdc predicted exactly what other scientists
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:11.360]  warn is exactly what happened i call that pretty damn conclusive like i don't need to be a pathologist
[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:16.240]  to know if i stick a 12 game shotgun in my mouth a double-lock buck and pull it the back of my head
[2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:20.000]  is going to blow off it's going to kill me probably maybe i'll live be a vegetable so
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:24.400]  they told me you take this this happens it happened i saw it happen so it's like you don't run in
[2:24:24.400 --> 2:24:29.200]  traffic a bus is going to kill you i mean i don't need to be a scientist to know this it's very
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:35.680]  obvious what's going on here well on that cdc slide which i believe is from their meeting in
[2:24:35.680 --> 2:24:41.680]  october of 2020 you know they had all the neurologic hematologic and cardiac problems but notice
[2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:47.440]  there's no cancer on that slide no cancer and i think that the do d data which i said is the
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:52.960]  first aggregate data i've seen now on cancer is explosive a lot of the things on this slide
[2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:58.240]  there's official fda warnings you know there's warnings for giambore syndrome there's warnings
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:05.040]  for anaphylaxis there's warnings for myocarditis even in the eua documents that consent form
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:10.880]  consent form lists that death can happen so so you're right this is transparent most of this
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:16.480]  alex is really buyer beware the people who are signing up and taking the vaccine they really
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:23.040]  need to know what they're getting into the fda is laid it out here and you know that the surprise
[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:27.920]  was the cancer you know in a recent program that i held a public program in wichita kansas
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:35.280]  we had chris koback as co-presenter he's running for the ag in kansas terrific constitutional
[2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:41.520]  lawyer and also a physician state senator but we had a private doctor's meeting alex and the question
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:47.680]  that was asked was what percent of patients do you think took the vaccine for medical reasons
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:51.520]  and what percent do you think were forced into it because of their job and you know that the
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:58.240]  general uh gestalt was 50 50 wow so i can tell you 50 50 percent of people took the vaccine
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:03.360]  are having but i'm really angry uh they were following they're forced into it and now we've
[2:26:03.360 --> 2:26:07.440]  got a safety nightmare well that's where i'm going and closing and i appreciate your time and i hope
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:13.440]  you get your studio soon you and your wonderful wife love visiting with you and your crew we
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:16.720]  i guess we talked to text by the other day and you said i think that you know the warm's turning
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:20.560]  i think the word you use we've hit the tipping point and i think that's clear why are you saying
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:25.280]  we've hit the tipping point in understanding and awakening to this you know i'm getting more and
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:30.560]  more messages from academic physicians doctors who in my circle who are previously quiet and now
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:34.800]  they're coming out saying you know i'm really with you here i'm starting to see this we understand
[2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:40.160]  your viewpoint i just had a very high level administrator who i worked with for years he's
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:44.880]  now in the biotech industry he just got covid himself and he went on the scramble he had severe
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:48.960]  his immunocompromised he had severe symptoms we got him early treatment through one of our
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:55.040]  early treatment networks and he texted me this morning he says he says now i understand now
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:00.400]  i understand the struggle this chill that was put on early treatment the suppression of early
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:05.520]  treatment and the forcing the mass vaccination you know he feels burned he took the vaccine he
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:10.720]  got severe covid anyway uh and now he can't get early treatment i think more and more people are
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:16.240]  coming out alex well exactly my dad was dying didn't tell me he was sick for eight days almost
[2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:23.520]  died a two percent oxygen within a day of ivermectin and zinc and and z-pac and inhalable steroids he
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:28.720]  was back he was back he had some rain fog for a while but he was back i mean i had it and as
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:33.520]  soon as i got on the drugs i felt a lot better it was like night and day and then to imagine that
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:37.920]  being denied when you take your husband or wife or child the hospital and they're denying you this
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:44.720]  stuff that's insane you know i published a paper with fozio and colleagues from italy uh it just
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:48.800]  hit that was published in the medical science monitor and the point of the paper alex says
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:53.600]  the golden window for treatment is the first three days that's where it's all at if you
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:57.920]  can hit it in the first three days patients turn around quickly this case i mentioned last night
[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:03.280]  text me this is already better because we got him on day two there still are going to be a few high
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:08.960]  risk people they must seek early treatment in the first three days hospitalization is completely
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:12.720]  avoidable that's right this is not a joke folks you go to the hospital they turn you away and wait
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:16.800]  to your it's too sick and then they innovate you this is life and death you start getting sick now
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:21.440]  you better do the pretreatments or you're in big trouble dr mccullough thank you so much for the

[2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:06.400]  global is plotting their next big lockdown for the next phase of the great reset being a stage
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:13.920]  cyber attack with the deep state pushing a civil war not just here but in europe and war with russia
[2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:19.120]  with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain
[2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:26.320]  right now you need to get prepared now with high quality storable food that is ready to ship and
[2:31:26.320 --> 2:31:31.440]  it's been four years since my patriot supply at prepare with alex dot com has offered their
[2:31:31.440 --> 2:31:41.680]  storable food at 25 off four years but right now it's 25 off until february 13th 2022 a little over
[2:31:41.680 --> 2:31:48.640]  two weeks from the time i'm cutting this to get 25 off and prepare with alex dot com on the entire
[2:31:48.640 --> 2:31:55.120]  catalog of my patriot supply act now get prepared now this is absolutely essential for everybody
[2:31:55.120 --> 2:32:01.680]  that wants to be self-sufficient if your ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every
[2:32:01.680 --> 2:32:07.280]  government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upper probability
[2:32:07.280 --> 2:32:11.840]  you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted that's why
[2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:18.000]  the fortune 100 have wrapped themselves the name of lb gt and african-american rights all the rest
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:23.360]  of it all over the world that's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in africa
[2:32:23.360 --> 2:32:27.920]  and in communist china and many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here
[2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:33.840]  and spy on us through the big tech the central banks and other zone so this is a criminal takeover
[2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:41.200]  and when you look at the new superclass it's the politicians it's the corporate media it's the police
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:45.280]  it's the bureaucrats it's members of congress and their staff and their families it's the white house
[2:32:45.920 --> 2:32:52.560]  hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the general public and
[2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:56.720]  everybody else through corporate rule so this is the true discrimination that's going on
[2:32:58.240 --> 2:33:04.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:12.400 --> 2:33:18.720]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:25.600]  i'm just an average man with an average life i work from nine to five
[2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:31.520]  i pay the price all i want is to be left alone we're not gonna get left alone by the new world order
[2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:37.520]  all right i probably covered 20 percent of the news today which is good i mean there's just so
[2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:42.480]  down much of it and i kind of want to let the crew off tomorrow i've been doing saturday shows a lot
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:45.840]  that are very popular but you know what we just can't do it the crew wants to come in anyways
[2:33:45.840 --> 2:33:54.960]  so uh ladies and gentlemen let's just pick a time let's do it again let's go live tomorrow at
[2:33:54.960 --> 2:34:02.960]  2 p.m. central for two hours commercial free to get to all this i didn't get to and to cover
[2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:07.040]  more than a lobby see break by then because i got to 20 percent but don't you want to hear all the
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:13.840]  rest of this because it's all just as important i mean it's crazy crazy level uh important here
[2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:20.640]  ladies and gentlemen let me go ahead though and get to this because this is one of those stories
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:26.000]  that is so complex and so interesting but also so simple at many levels that if you understand
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:32.880]  this piece of information you basically understand it all and that is the state department having
[2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:38.000]  a press briefing an associated press writer it's one of the top stories if not the top story in
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:43.680]  the last 24 hours it's everywhere all over foreign news top of all the channels top trending
[2:34:43.680 --> 2:34:47.680]  printed number one last night without me even looking for everybody's calling like you're the
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:52.000]  number one on twitter and instagram 10 million views five million views eight million views
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:57.360]  and it's all oh you're in alex jones territory well i mean i think we're all kind of in alex
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:03.920]  jones territory because alex jones sees what's going on so do you and we're not stupid so false
[2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:09.520]  flags are very very real in world history i'm gonna show you some proof of that here in a moment
[2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:16.080]  but because unlike the spokesperson for the state department i'll show you my proof that false flags
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:20.640]  are a real thing that are done sometimes that could be happening anytime there's an event
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:29.200]  so we should look for those and ask as the romans did in latin qui bono qui qui bono who stands to
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:36.720]  gain who has the motive who benefits so the alex jones territory is the reporter saying saying
[2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:41.520]  that governments might stage terror to launch a war is alex jones territory well no that's a real
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:45.600]  thing that could happen the west has a bigger history of doing it i don't believe joe biden
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:51.280]  who controls him the russians don't want a war the u.s and nato are massing troops in
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:57.280]  ukraine that's why russia is massing troops on the border we do the same thing it's just a fact
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:02.240]  so they don't want you questioning events they don't want you questioning jessie smollett
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:07.360]  they don't want you questioning wmd's in iraq the gulf of tonkin all this because when you do
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:13.760]  you usually find out it's staged as a pretext for the war i'm going to show you some historical
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:18.800]  examples that are admitted that i guess this ap reporter doesn't want known now do i believe
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:23.120]  that rat likes to take department spokesman do i believe the russians really are planning a false
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:28.080]  flag and that biden has proof no the u.s is massing the globalists are massing they want to let russia
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:31.920]  know if you try to fight back we're going to call it a false flag and when we attack your troops
[2:36:31.920 --> 2:36:36.560]  we're going to say you did it that's where all the money's at that's where all the history's at
[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:42.560]  that's where the motive ish doesn't mean i'll ionize the russians or say they're perfect either
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:45.920]  but the motive and the history and the cutting off the russian pipelines and the
[2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:52.240]  triggering the revolution in ukraine that's been the west doing that and then drawing russia in
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:57.760]  to start a new cold war that's what's happening and putin said that he's been trying to stop that
[2:36:57.760 --> 2:37:03.120]  and even cut their defense spending five years ago so here's the bizarre exchange journalist says
[2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:06.720]  state department engaging in alex jones level russian false flag conspiracies
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:12.320]  so now talking about a historical thing that governments do do it's bad it's alex jones territory
[2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:18.160]  but see the trap now see the trap now they're all in here's part of the exchange uh okay well
[2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:26.240]  that's a quite a mouthful there um so you said actions such as these suggest otherwise suggest
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:30.080]  meaning they suggest they're not interested in tomsen they're going to go ahead with something
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:36.000]  about what action are you talking about one the actions i've just pointed to uh the fact
[2:37:37.040 --> 2:37:43.600]  the fact that russia continues to engage in disinformation well you made an allegation
[2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:50.000]  that they might do that have they actually done it what we know matt is what we what i've just said
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:56.320]  that they have engaged in this activity uh in this planning activity what but let me let me because
[2:37:56.320 --> 2:38:02.800]  obviously this is not this is not the first time we've made uh these reports public you'll remember
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:08.880]  that just a few weeks ago sorry you made what report public if you let me finish i will tell you
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:14.320]  what report we made public uh we told you a few weeks ago that we have information indicating
[2:38:14.320 --> 2:38:19.440]  russia also has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:24.320]  in eastern ukraine so that matt see your question is an action that russia has already taken it's
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:31.440]  an action that you say that they have taken but you have shown no evidence to to to confirm that
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:36.000]  and i'm going to get to the next question here which is what is the evidence that they i mean
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:42.480]  this is like crisis actors really this is like alex jones territory you're getting into that um
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:48.240]  what evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some pause there back in up 10 seconds
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:55.520]  this is alex jones territory what evidence do you have he won't give the evidence he says the
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:03.040]  evidence as i told you and so you got ned price the cia operative a little swarmy arrogant know
[2:39:03.040 --> 2:39:08.080]  it all obviously up there lying to everybody not giving any proof not giving any evidence
[2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:13.360]  saying i've just given you evidence no you haven't but then his counter is here in alex jones territory
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:19.600]  what exposing false flags exposing the lies exposing these people are doing this so it
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:24.080]  shows how desperate they are that the power structure is now having its own propaganda
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:30.320]  used against it because no one buys what the system says and then they use the guy exposing
[2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:35.680]  not trusting the system as the example of the system now they're getting smart i told politico
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:39.760]  and ram paul got elected years ago they said why do you win we threw everything at him and i said
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:47.920]  if you endorsed him he'd lost you see but start calling joe biden alex jones that will hurt alex
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:55.360]  jones so see they're starting to get sophisticated here i mean look at that little arrogant swarmy
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:40:03.120]  oh he's in the cia oh my god he has the intel no one else has up there lying to us continue
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:09.360]  evidence to confirm that and i'm gonna get to the next question here which is
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:14.320]  what is the evidence that they i mean this is like crisis actors really this is like alex
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:20.800]  jones territory you're getting into them um what evidence do you have to support the idea that there
[2:40:20.800 --> 2:40:27.520]  is some propaganda film in the in in the making now this is derived from information known to the
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:32.640]  u.s. government intelligence information that we have declassified the pause again well yeah just

[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:10.800]  they just go 90 percent of people in the hospital take the shot it's not true they just say it

[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:58.160]  classified briefing and look at his arrogance his projection of hating everyone thinking everyone's
[2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:04.640]  dumb thinking he's smarter than you and now he's being called the devil alex jones but then in
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:09.760]  that is the truth and this is all alex jones territory the fall of this corrupt system let's

[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:32.320]  rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling although the streets are swollen keep them roll their
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:38.480]  knees rolling roll from york city rain and wind and west to tokyo japan
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:46.280]  Robots are now on the streets ordering you to wear face masks and scanning your vaccine
[2:47:46.280 --> 2:47:49.320]  passports.
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:53.360]  And we've got similar things happening all over the western world.
[2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:54.360]  It is sick.
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:58.600]  I want to show you an article that ties into this whole CIA State Department garbage we
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:02.920]  just saw where, oh, we're in Alex Jones territory here.
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:04.280]  False flags are a real thing.
[2:48:04.280 --> 2:48:09.840]  They're a part of history and the fact that the corporate media has demonized me for popularizing
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:14.760]  and I'm on record, they admit I popularized the term, though it was in scholarly papers
[2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:17.440]  and military documents throughout history.
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:19.040]  And they didn't want a discussion about that.
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:24.000]  But now that it's in the lexicon, people are having debates about it.
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  But Alex Jones territory is about documentation and a historical understanding into present
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:33.360]  times and then projecting forward with the future of understanding.
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:35.240]  That's why we're tomorrow's news today.
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:41.640]  But a really big article from Mises.org posted on InfoWars.com, wokeism could provoke a
[2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:44.360]  global anti-American backlash.
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:45.360]  What have I told you for years?
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:54.080]  The plan is globalism launches all the wokeism, all the pedophilia, all over the world.
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:48:58.400]  And then the world turns against America when America implodes, but the disease has already
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:00.800]  been injected out there.
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:04.640]  And then the globalists themselves don't get blamed for what they've done around the planet.
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:11.160]  We've been hijacked by the Club of Rome, by the Bilderberg group, by these organizations.
[2:49:11.160 --> 2:49:16.640]  And they want us to carry out their dirty work and it be seen as America and Hollywood
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:20.580]  that are behind all this, but Hollywood is not America.
[2:49:20.580 --> 2:49:24.120]  And so there's a big understanding of this taking place and it's important.
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:32.640]  People like this CIA operative up there gaslighting everybody, he doesn't represent America.
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:33.640]  So here's some of the headlines.
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:38.400]  Alex Jones Territory, a reporter, battle State Department spokesman on Russia false flag
[2:49:38.400 --> 2:49:40.880]  claim.
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:46.920]  Veteran reporter tears in the State Department spook over Russia false flag allegation.
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:48.400]  You have no evidence.
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:53.120]  Well, does Alex Jones have evidence when he talks about things?
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:55.760]  Here's a history article.
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:00.760]  How a false flag sparked World War II, the Gliwitz Incident, where the Nazis attacked
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:05.760]  their own radio station, dressed up some concentration camp victims as German and Polish soldiers
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:10.000]  shot them for the newsreels and then put it on the newsreels so they could have an excuse
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  to invade Poland.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:15.160]  That's how World War II started in Europe.
[2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:16.160]  Let's continue.
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:17.160]  We'll go back to Northwoods in a minute.
[2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:21.480]  Here's the Gliwitz Incident on your precious Wikipedia for anybody that wants to see it.
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:25.200]  So show that to the Associated Press Writer.
[2:50:25.200 --> 2:50:31.440]  This weekend in history, Nazi staged fake attack at the start of World War II, desert.com.
[2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:40.160]  What was Operation Ajax, CIA staged in 1953 the overthrow of Mohamed Mosedek by blowing
[2:50:40.160 --> 2:50:42.920]  up mosque and buildings and blaming it on the government?
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:43.920]  Declassified.
[2:50:43.920 --> 2:50:48.400]  Herman Roosevelt, grandson of Franklin Delano Roosevelt carried that out.
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:51.160]  He gave NPR interviews before he died bragging about it.
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:55.760]  The Gulp of Tonkin Incident, they've now declassified in 2004.
[2:50:55.760 --> 2:51:01.480]  From 1964, the audio tapes of LBJ from his Texas ranch talking to McNamara of the Defense
[2:51:01.480 --> 2:51:06.200]  Department about how they were going to stage an attack later than that day against U.S.
[2:51:06.200 --> 2:51:11.080]  aircraft carriers to blame it on the North Vietnamese is a pretext to launch the war.
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:13.640]  You can look that up yourself, totally declassified.
[2:51:13.640 --> 2:51:19.960]  Oh, see, the White House globalist New World Order arm doesn't show any proof of a Russian
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:20.960]  false flag.
[2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:23.480]  I show you history that false flags exist.
[2:51:23.480 --> 2:51:25.560]  That's why I'm bad.
[2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:29.440]  ForeignPolicy.com, that's the folks over at the CFR and the Washington Post.
[2:51:29.440 --> 2:51:34.120]  Sixty-four years later, CIA finally releases the tales of Iranian coup.
[2:51:34.120 --> 2:51:39.800]  Operation Ajax, it's all right there for you, ladies and gentlemen, but they don't want
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:40.800]  you to look at it.
[2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:41.800]  Here's the U.S.
[2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:42.800]  example.
[2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:43.800]  Operation Northwoods, L.L.
[2:51:43.800 --> 2:51:47.560]  Lemnitzer, Curtis LeMay, on the joins you to staff, brought on the plan to bomb U.S.
[2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:52.400]  movie theaters, shoot up U.S. streets, attack U.S. military bases to blame it on Cuba,
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:57.680]  and as a pretext to war, for war with the Soviet Union.
[2:51:57.680 --> 2:52:02.680]  You can go find it on the National Archives for yourself, here's a photo, Operation Northwoods
[2:52:02.680 --> 2:52:05.200]  with Kennedy and with L.L.
[2:52:05.200 --> 2:52:06.200]  Lemnitzer.
[2:52:06.200 --> 2:52:10.160]  Now, his brother of all people, as Attorney General, did work with the Pentagon to stage
[2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:12.280]  a Central American false flag for a coup.
[2:52:12.280 --> 2:52:13.280]  They blew up the U.S.
[2:52:13.280 --> 2:52:14.280]  Embassy.
[2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:16.040]  That's declassified, been on PBS.
[2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:20.520]  But again, that's what the grownup table talks about, you see at the State Department, you're
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:24.560]  the little kids over at the little kid table, you're not supposed to know about the big
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:28.840]  boy table and what they're openly doing over there.
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:32.960]  I love the America that believes in the Millerites, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence
[2:52:32.960 --> 2:52:38.280]  of Human Liberty and a connection to God, private property, you name it, right to self-defense.
[2:52:38.280 --> 2:52:41.240]  The people that have hijacked our country are the opposite of that.
[2:52:41.240 --> 2:52:45.120]  They're parasites that are running our nation of the ground, that have been propagandizing
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:50.560]  us and brain-damaging us and trying to keep us in a tiny box so we're not aware of the
[2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:51.560]  enemy we face.
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:56.800]  Now, we've got a big special guest host about to take over, very excited to listen to this,
[2:52:56.800 --> 2:52:57.800]  in the fourth hour.
[2:52:57.800 --> 2:53:01.480]  He's the best-selling author and researcher, and I couldn't have made Reset Wars without
[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:02.480]  him.
[2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:04.400]  He's got a bunch of big topics to cover.
[2:53:04.400 --> 2:53:09.400]  Jake Ducey is about to take over, but I wanted, before we end this hour, to go to him briefly
[2:53:09.400 --> 2:53:12.720]  to hear about some of what he's about to lay out the next hour, but first, get his take
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:18.400]  on this statement here that, the biggest story in the country yesterday, literally, Alex
[2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:23.800]  Jones' territory, the whole media turning against Biden saying, we don't want war with
[2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:26.760]  Russia and saying, you have no proof you're Alex Jones.
[2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:28.040]  I have the proof.
[2:53:28.040 --> 2:53:30.120]  I say, study any big event.
[2:53:30.120 --> 2:53:32.360]  A lot of times it's staged or provocative.
[2:53:32.360 --> 2:53:35.040]  I'm not the White House not giving evidence.
[2:53:35.040 --> 2:53:39.160]  I'm the opposite, giving evidence and continuing to control the paradigm.
[2:53:39.160 --> 2:53:42.560]  This is just, we're inside their heads, Jake, and that's what Reset Wars does, it's helped
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:46.200]  us get inside our heads to get them out of our heads.
[2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:47.200]  Jake Ducey.
[2:53:47.200 --> 2:53:50.800]  Hey Alex, it's good to see you.
[2:53:50.800 --> 2:53:57.000]  I just wanted to first say, just a couple minutes ago, I found out that really a guy
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:04.640]  that changed my life, my mentor, and I excuse my emotions, I just found out that he passed
[2:54:04.640 --> 2:54:07.800]  away about two minutes ago.
[2:54:07.800 --> 2:54:09.560]  I'm sorry to hear that, man.
[2:54:09.560 --> 2:54:12.040]  Did he come back to you?
[2:54:12.040 --> 2:54:18.760]  You know, I'm good, you know, I think that when we think about Reset Wars and we think
[2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:24.240]  about everything happening in the world, this individual named Bob Proctor, he really changed
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:29.040]  my life and the reason he changed my life and, you know, the message that we're hoping
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:37.400]  to get across with Reset Wars is that we create our reality and we control our reality and
[2:54:37.400 --> 2:54:46.240]  that the system doesn't and that what they want us to do, there's two forms of consciousness.
[2:54:46.240 --> 2:54:50.560]  There's a creation form of consciousness and a reaction form of consciousness, right, and
[2:54:50.560 --> 2:54:56.600]  you were mentioning that viral clip where they were being interrogated and what they
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:55:02.240]  want us to do is stay in this reaction consciousness, right, and an example of that with that viral
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:08.280]  clip was, he just wanted everyone to just react and accept it, oh my gosh, Russia, oh
[2:55:08.280 --> 2:55:13.640]  my gosh, Russia, oh my gosh, okay, okay, and stay in a reaction state of consciousness
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:20.560]  and I believe that the solutions to our problems are found in something I learned from my mentor
[2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:26.400]  Bob Proctor, which is that human beings are the only creatures on earth with the ability
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:33.240]  to create their own environment and we can use creativity or we can use reaction consciousness.
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:37.800]  And by the way, this is crazy because Bob Proctor is the trailblazer pointing out so
[2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:41.640]  much of what we've now discovered ourselves and expanded on and he literally just died
[2:55:41.640 --> 2:55:46.320]  today in the last few hours, it's just now breaking in the news this minute and you told
[2:55:46.320 --> 2:55:50.680]  me what a big mentor he was for you, so it's just wild that he just went to the next level
[2:55:50.680 --> 2:55:51.680]  today.
[2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:58.160]  Yeah, and I know he would laugh at me being emotional because Bob always says, you're
[2:55:58.160 --> 2:56:03.120]  spiritual being in a physical body and you know, one of the reasons that I think his
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:10.200]  work is so powerful is because what the whole system is designed to keep us trapped in our
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:15.160]  physical self, it's to make us believe we're just a physical body because when we're just
[2:56:15.160 --> 2:56:20.000]  a physical body, they can manipulate us through the reptilian centers of our brain and through
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:25.280]  the fear complexes, this is what traps us in a lower electromagnetic states and this
[2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:28.880]  is how they use manipulation and fear.
[2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:35.800]  And so for everyone listening, please excuse me, you know, for a little bit of those, a
[2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:37.600]  little bit of those feelings.
[2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:41.200]  Well, hold on, you're going to take over in a minute, but I want you to talk about Bob
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:44.720]  Proctor because I've read some of his work, great guy and he's just dialing into what
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:48.240]  we already and lately know, but doing a great job organizing and getting people to realize
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:51.960]  that and not letting the globalist say you're a loser, you're a failure, it's all over,
[2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:55.920]  you're going to die, we're not going to make it, humans are dirty, post-human world, looking
[2:56:55.920 --> 2:56:57.160]  forward to the end of humanity.
[2:56:57.160 --> 2:57:00.560]  No, we're beautiful, we're amazing, we're made the image of God and by accepting God
[2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:04.360]  in our lives, he helps us transcend our sin and our fallen nature and takes us to the
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:05.360]  next level.
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:11.640]  So, Jake Ducey is about to take over in the fourth hour today to talk about resetwars.com
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:14.640]  and I should also add to all the viewers and listeners, they've been trying to censor,
[2:57:14.640 --> 2:57:19.600]  they've been trying to block it, it's a great course and it funds the Info War, a 360 win,
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:23.800]  the only way we failed was you don't take action, it's 50% off, today was going to be
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:27.800]  the last day, let memory of Bob Proctor, we're going to extend it through Sunday, then that's
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:30.840]  it because we got to fund a bunch of stuff with this and build a big infrastructure.
[2:57:30.840 --> 2:57:34.360]  So again, a lot's coming out of this, thanks for being right on the front lines, folks,
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:38.200]  thank you all that signed up for it, if you've been on the fence and have it, go get it today,

[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:35.720]  it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it, but particularly those that

[2:58:48.640 --> 2:58:54.040]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[2:58:54.040 --> 2:58:55.520]  a healthier life.
[2:58:55.520 --> 2:58:59.920]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:01.560]  that contains both.
[2:59:01.560 --> 2:59:06.520]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[2:59:06.520 --> 2:59:08.120]  from the InfoWars store.
[2:59:08.120 --> 2:59:12.920]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[2:59:12.920 --> 2:59:15.640]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:20.840]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[2:59:20.840 --> 2:59:25.160]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[2:59:25.160 --> 2:59:26.160]  shown.
[2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:30.440]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[2:59:30.440 --> 2:59:35.080]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:40.200]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[2:59:40.200 --> 2:59:41.200]  like here in America.
[2:59:41.200 --> 2:59:46.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:49.760]  our rose hips don't lie.
[2:59:49.760 --> 3:00:07.200]  Making a Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:07.200 --> 3:00:11.600]  Hello everybody, I want to welcome you back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:21.280]  My name is Jay Doosie, and I apologize for a little bit of my emotion there earlier.
[3:00:21.280 --> 3:00:27.320]  I just found out that probably more so than anyone that's really ever lived, a guy that
[3:00:27.320 --> 3:00:32.800]  really changed my life, and I want to talk a little about some of the things that I learned
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:40.000]  that I think can really help us defeat this agenda that we're facing here.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:48.280]  In order to illustrate this power of the human spirit, that first of all, they don't want
[3:00:48.280 --> 3:00:53.360]  us to tap into, and second of all, the thing that they fear the most.
[3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:57.720]  In order to illustrate that, I just wanted to play a quick video that really touched
[3:00:57.720 --> 3:01:03.320]  me that I'm not sure if you've all seen yet or that Alex played earlier.
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:10.960]  So if we can roll that clip at Washougal High School here of the very, very amazing kid
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:14.000]  that if I was his parent, I would be incredibly proud of.
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:20.600]  So if we've got that clip, guys, we can go ahead and we can roll that here to start off
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:22.600]  today.
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:26.640]  Everybody shut up!
[3:01:26.640 --> 3:01:31.880]  This is not an excuse for any of you freshmen and sophomores to disrespect your teachers.
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:40.400]  If I hear of anybody disrespecting teachers or staff tomorrow, that makes us look bad.
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:43.200]  We want this to be a peaceful, respectful movement.
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:48.040]  We are just trying to gain back our rights as citizens.
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:52.960]  We do not care about the teachers in the end are just doing their jobs.
[3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:55.400]  It doesn't come from them.
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:58.320]  It comes from the state.
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:01.840]  Now, what we're hoping is that they kick us out.
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:05.680]  This sounds bad, but we're hoping that they kick us out because they have to report that
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:07.560]  attendance to the state.
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:11.720]  And if the state sees a day where a hundred or I don't even know how many kids are here
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:16.760]  are absent, they're going to start asking questions.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:20.640]  Our hope is, is we can get this statewide.
[3:02:20.640 --> 3:02:24.640]  Now I might get in trouble for this, but the plan still stands for Wednesday.
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:30.040]  And for tomorrow, I mean, everybody is going to meet at the back row of the senior parking
[3:02:30.040 --> 3:02:34.480]  lot and we're all walking into the school with no mask on.
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:35.480]  You can get me in trouble.
[3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:36.480]  They can suspend me.
[3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:37.480]  I don't care.
[3:02:37.480 --> 3:02:39.000]  We're done with this.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.400]  And obviously all of you are too.
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:43.760]  Shut up!
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:44.960]  Shut up!
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:49.320]  Obviously all of you are done with the mask too.
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:54.280]  Now again, we're doing this peacefully and respectfully if a staff member asks you to
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:58.160]  put a mask on, you say, no, thank you and keep walking.
[3:02:58.160 --> 3:03:01.520]  And if they kick you out, then go home.
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:06.000]  And if people need rides home, then some of the seniors, I'm sure we can start giving
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  people rides home.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:19.880]  So the reason that I love that video, I found it very touching is because I think it's the
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:24.360]  perfect example of, look, we're all upset about what's happening in the world.
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:26.200]  We don't like what's happening in the world.
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:33.280]  If you watch InfoWars, you know how bad things are getting and it's very easy to get angry
[3:03:33.280 --> 3:03:35.520]  and it's very easy to get upset.
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:36.720]  But that's what they want us to do.
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:40.320]  They want us to move into a victim state of consciousness.
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:44.360]  And what Bob Proctor taught me is that there's only two forms of consciousness.
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:50.120]  There's a creation form of consciousness and there's a reaction form of consciousness.
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:54.560]  And they want us to be asking, well, how bad is this?
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:03:55.880]  How bad is this going to get?
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:57.000]  Why are they so bad?
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:58.560]  Why are they so evil?
[3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:00.080]  They want us to be angry.
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:01.720]  They don't care if we know what's happening.
[3:04:01.720 --> 3:04:03.920]  They just want us to stay angry.
[3:04:03.920 --> 3:04:09.480]  And my question that I want to pose to you is how can you take the energy of anger, the
[3:04:09.480 --> 3:04:13.560]  energy of depression and the energy of despair that you may feel?
[3:04:13.560 --> 3:04:18.520]  And how can you creatively transmute that energy into doing something powerful?
[3:04:18.520 --> 3:04:24.640]  Because you were given God given not only rights, but you're made in the image of God.
[3:04:24.640 --> 3:04:29.920]  The creative force of the universe is literally moving through you at any single second.
[3:04:29.920 --> 3:04:34.560]  And the question is, how can we turn this energy into powerful forces?
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:37.640]  And we're going to be talking about that for the rest of the show here today.
[3:04:37.640 --> 3:04:39.960]  I'm on in honor of Reset Wars.
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:46.600]  The 50% off censorship special going on right now, that's resetwars.com, where you can join
[3:04:46.600 --> 3:04:50.960]  the movement, which is about moving out of our anger and our victimhood, transforming
[3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:52.920]  our minds and changing our world.
[3:04:52.920 --> 3:05:13.440]  That's resetwars.com, whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible
[3:05:13.440 --> 3:05:28.960]  for our enemies.
[3:05:28.960 --> 3:05:38.560]  That's it.
[3:05:38.560 --> 3:05:46.560]  us by force. This is the final battle of the information war. Give now, buy products, donate.
[3:05:46.560 --> 3:05:56.560]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end. Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[3:05:56.560 --> 3:06:12.560]  So I want to welcome you back to the Alex Jones show here in the fourth hour. My name is Jake Ducey and I'm filling in an honor of the 50% of Reset Wars special at resetwars.com.
[3:06:12.560 --> 3:06:23.560]  So I want to thank you for being involved in that. And I want to talk a little bit about what I learned from my mentor Bob Proctor that really changed my life.
[3:06:23.560 --> 3:06:35.560]  And I was aware of all of these things that were happening in the world. But if I looked in the mirror, I was angry, I was depressed, and I wasn't doing anything about it.
[3:06:35.560 --> 3:06:49.560]  And Bob posed a question to me. He said, does your thinking create your reality or is the world creating your reality? Does your thinking create your reality or is the world controlling your thinking?
[3:06:49.560 --> 3:07:02.560]  And in Alex's course, Reset Wars, one of the things that I really love about it is a section where he talks about, are you a victim to the new world order? Are you a victim to the regime?
[3:07:02.560 --> 3:07:14.560]  And the way that they've set the system up is to keep us in a state of anger so that we're trapped in the reptilian center of our brain which traps us into lower states of consciousness.
[3:07:14.560 --> 3:07:26.560]  And when we're trapped in lower states of consciousness, we remain in a reactive state only. We can only react. We may have great knowledge of what's occurring, but we can only react to it.
[3:07:26.560 --> 3:07:31.560]  And kind of like a ton of bricks, it finally hit me that there wasn't much I was doing about it.
[3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:38.560]  I could tell you all types of declassified documents. I could tell you what the agenda was. I could tell you what was coming down the pipeline.
[3:07:38.560 --> 3:07:46.560]  I could recite everything that was happening in the world, but I wasn't doing anything about it. I really wasn't.
[3:07:46.560 --> 3:07:57.560]  I like to think I was because I had a lot of knowledge of what was occurring. And I realized that I had become a victim to the new world order.
[3:07:57.560 --> 3:08:06.560]  I had become a victim to it. I thought that I couldn't get ahead in life. I thought that there was nothing really to find that much joy in because X, Y, and Z things were happening.
[3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:16.560]  And I want to pose this question to you. Does your thinking create your reality or has the regime controlled your thinking?
[3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:23.560]  And one of the things that Bob Proctor talks about is the ability to accept or reject any idea.
[3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:29.560]  Right? There's something called our conscious mind and our conscious minds responsible for 5% of our life.
[3:08:29.560 --> 3:08:37.560]  The majority of our life is a subconscious habitual thought pattern that is controlled by a reactionary animalistic state of consciousness.
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:48.560]  And the entire goal is to, in a sense, disorient our conscious mind so that we accept the will that is given to us.
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:55.560]  So we accept the will or we accept the regime or we accept the agenda that is being laid down.
[3:08:55.560 --> 3:09:06.560]  And I want to pose a question to you. And that question is, have you discovered what you're really capable of as a human being?
[3:09:06.560 --> 3:09:11.560]  Have you discovered what you're really capable of as a human being?
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:17.560]  And it's one thing to have all of these knowledges about everything that's taking place in this world.
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:24.560]  And I believe it's another thing to ask ourselves this question of what creative utility can I provide to the world?
[3:09:24.560 --> 3:09:39.560]  And the reason that I've come on the show and I've been, you know, relentlessly promoting reset wars is quite frankly because I believe that the way the world changes
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:52.560]  and I believe it can change is when we wake up, not to our power just to find out what's going on, not just to our power of getting upset and protesting,
[3:09:52.560 --> 3:09:58.560]  but when we realize what Buckminster Fuller once said so eloquently and I'm paraphrasing here.
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:05.560]  He said that in order to change the system, you don't fight it. You build a new one that makes the old one obsolete.
[3:10:05.560 --> 3:10:16.560]  And I believe that we're spiritual beings in a physical body and God is always speaking to us and moving through us if we're ready to answer that call.
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:24.560]  And my question to you is what place in this incredible moment in history do you have?
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:32.560]  Is it to rebuild the education system? Is it to build new media platforms? Is it to build a new social media company?
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:37.560]  And you might say, well, I don't know how to do it or I don't have the resources to do it.
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:45.560]  And I want to challenge any thinking that may come up there. You may think you're too old, you're too young, you're in the wrong spot, you're too busy.
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:55.560]  Because I believe that when you have a vision, when you are inspired by some great purpose, by some extraordinary bonds,
[3:10:55.560 --> 3:11:02.560]  all of your perceived limitations break apart and you find yourself to be a more powerful individual than you ever thought possible.
[3:11:02.560 --> 3:11:09.560]  And the question is, what is your place? What is your purpose?
[3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:17.560]  And I'm willing to bet deep down you know that there's something big that you're meant for.
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:24.560]  And the way that we start to change this world is when all of us, instead of just watching in full wars,
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:30.560]  instead of just telling everyone what's happening in the world, it's when you create something meaningful.
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:37.560]  When you and I all come to an inspired place and we tap into that higher level of spiritual energy,
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:41.560]  not the lower level that makes us angry, we transmute it.
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:47.560]  Alex talks a lot in Reset Wars about the various laws of the universe and about quantum physics.
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:53.560]  And he talks about how energy is never created or destroyed, it can only be transferred to different states.
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:59.560]  And what we're talking about here is the transmutation of energy from anger, from despair, from helplessness,
[3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:05.560]  from I can't believe what Bill Gates is doing, I can't believe what the regime is doing.
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:11.560]  And we reverse that and we say, I'm going to take all of that energy and build something meaningful.
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:20.560]  And I'm challenging you to take that energy and take that anger and build something great today.
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:28.560]  Whatever it is, rebuilding the education system, writing a book, building meaningful music, teaching kids,
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:32.560]  building a new school, whatever it is that might be for you.
[3:12:32.560 --> 3:12:37.560]  One of the things that I learned from Bob Proctor was to take whatever it was that my vision was,
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:42.560]  and I'm pulling it off my computer here, and write it on a piece of paper,
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:46.560]  and carry that index card with you everywhere that you go.
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:53.560]  Because the fact is, not only is all of these crazy things occurring in the world,
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:12:57.560]  but outside of all of these crazy things that are occurring in the world,
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:03.560]  at some point, you and I are going to have to face who we've been in this life.
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:07.560]  And we're going to have to face God and we're going to have to face the universe,
[3:13:07.560 --> 3:13:10.560]  not in a fear-based way of, are we going to be punished?
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:15.560]  But in a way of, did you make the most of it?
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:21.560]  We're alive in the greatest time in human history, with the most tools, with the best technology that we've ever had.
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:26.560]  And there are a lot of problems, but there's a lot of great things that we can do about it.
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:31.560]  We all have access to the same universal mind that Einstein had access to,
[3:13:31.560 --> 3:13:37.560]  that Elon Musk has access to, that anyone that you're admired by, Alex Jones has access to.
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:40.560]  We can all tap into that unconscious level.
[3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:48.560]  But what happens is, we've been conditioned through a self-image to believe that the other people have the power,
[3:13:48.560 --> 3:13:54.560]  whether it's Joe Rogan, whether it's Alex Jones, whether it's Owen, whether it's Paul Watson.
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:14:01.560]  We've been conditioned to believe that we cannot be the one.
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:08.560]  And not only have I found that to be an incredibly incorrect statement,
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:12.560]  but I've found that the focus is entirely shifted in the wrong direction.
[3:14:12.560 --> 3:14:21.560]  And I think that when we can start to find significant purpose and significant meaning
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:27.560]  in something we can do every single solitary day to make the world a better place.
[3:14:27.560 --> 3:14:32.560]  And for me, I thought the only thing I could do was just study how bad things were,
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:34.560]  and to study what was wrong.
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:40.560]  And I started to reverse engineer that, and I said, what is a problem I could solve?
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:42.560]  What is a problem I could solve?
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:47.560]  And my question that I want to pose to that is, what is a problem you can solve?
[3:14:47.560 --> 3:14:51.560]  And what I invite you to do here is we head into a break in just a moment,
[3:14:51.560 --> 3:14:55.560]  is to pull out a pen and pad and write out what problem you can solve.
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:56.560]  Write out a goal.
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:14:59.560]  Bob Proctor talks about three types of goals.
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:01.560]  An A-type goal is a goal you know how to do.
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:04.560]  A B-type goal is a goal you think you know how to do.
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:07.560]  Based off your current thing, I think I could probably do that.
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:11.560]  And a C-type goal is a goal you have no idea how to do.
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:14.560]  It's going to take an entire new paradigm.
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:19.560]  It's going to take the power of God to uplift you once you have the courage
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:23.560]  to face that big vision, that big fear, even if you're afraid.
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:28.560]  And I'm inviting you to look within yourself and call upon God for a C-type goal.
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:31.560]  A C-type goal that can build something beautiful, right?
[3:15:31.560 --> 3:15:33.560]  They talk about building back better.
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:37.560]  What about building something beautiful and building something meaningful?
[3:15:37.560 --> 3:15:40.560]  And I'm really proud of Alex and I'm proud to have been involved in Reset Wars
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:42.560]  because that's a plan to do that.
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:44.560]  It's resetwars.com.
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:47.560]  It's a 50% off censorship special right now.
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:49.560]  He had money back guaranteed.
[3:15:49.560 --> 3:15:52.560]  I encourage you to head over to resetwars.com right now
[3:15:52.560 --> 3:15:55.560]  and go ahead and sign up at resetwars.com.
[3:15:56.560 --> 3:15:59.560]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement
[3:15:59.560 --> 3:16:02.560]  from inside a concentration camp in World War II
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:06.560]  that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:10.560]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:14.560]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[3:16:14.560 --> 3:16:17.560]  The Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in,
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:19.560]  it's banning people to three hours of video games a week
[3:16:19.560 --> 3:16:22.560]  and if you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:25.560]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world
[3:16:25.560 --> 3:16:27.560]  under the guise of COVID.
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:29.560]  Vaccine passports, they even admit it.
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:32.560]  Now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:34.560]  They're going to track where you go and what you do
[3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:36.560]  and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:38.560]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[3:16:38.560 --> 3:16:40.560]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:44.560]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:46.560]  pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[3:16:46.560 --> 3:16:49.560]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:51.560]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them
[3:16:51.560 --> 3:17:17.560]  or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:25.560]  That is ready to ship.
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:29.560]  And it's been four years since my patriot supply at preparewithalix.com
[3:17:29.560 --> 3:17:35.560]  has offered their storeable food at 25% off for years.
[3:17:35.560 --> 3:17:40.560]  But right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[3:17:40.560 --> 3:17:42.560]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this

[3:17:46.560 --> 3:17:49.560]  on the entire catalog of my patriot supply.

[3:18:31.560 --> 3:18:33.560]  and a touch of sea salt.
[3:18:33.560 --> 3:18:35.560]  It even tastes better than last formula.
[3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:37.560]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[3:18:37.560 --> 3:18:42.560]  Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein isolate powder
[3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:44.560]  for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:46.560]  You're going to love this.

[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:13.560]  and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:17.560]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.

[3:20:27.560 --> 3:20:32.560]  And more importantly, how to transmute all of this energy that we're facing.
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:38.560]  The psychological warfare, spiritual warfare, the anger, all these rightful feelings that we have.
[3:20:38.560 --> 3:20:42.560]  How do we transmute that so that we can make a dent in the universe
[3:20:42.560 --> 3:20:44.560]  in a meaningful and significant way.
[3:20:44.560 --> 3:20:46.560]  That's at resetwars.com.
[3:20:46.560 --> 3:20:48.560]  It's a 50% off special right now.
[3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:50.560]  So you can go ahead and check that out.
[3:20:50.560 --> 3:20:54.560]  And let's talk a little bit about what they don't want us to know.
[3:20:54.560 --> 3:20:56.560]  What do they actually fear?
[3:20:56.560 --> 3:21:03.560]  Now that people are waking up to the agenda, do they fear us just knowing about the agenda?
[3:21:03.560 --> 3:21:05.560]  Or is there something deeper?
[3:21:05.560 --> 3:21:08.560]  And I would argue that there's something deeper to it.
[3:21:08.560 --> 3:21:13.560]  And it's the hidden knowledge that's always been there.
[3:21:13.560 --> 3:21:16.560]  But the books have been burned.
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:21.560]  The secret libraries have been moved underground.
[3:21:21.560 --> 3:21:26.560]  And that question is, what do they not want us to know?
[3:21:26.560 --> 3:21:35.560]  And I think in order to answer that question, we have to ask ourselves maybe a more significant question.
[3:21:35.560 --> 3:21:39.560]  And that question might be, who are you really?
[3:21:39.560 --> 3:21:42.560]  And what are you capable of?
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:52.560]  And just right before we went live on air, I found out that one of my best friends and my mentor, Bob Proctor, he just passed away.
[3:21:52.560 --> 3:21:57.560]  And I know he would laugh at my feelings.
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:08.560]  And I'm not sure if it's because I'm sad that he passed away or if it's just that I'm overwhelmed with everything I've learned from this individual and how he's changed my life.
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:15.560]  And one of the things that they don't want us to know is the real power of consciousness.
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:20.560]  We're seeing now that governments are even starting to talk about the power of vitamin D.
[3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:32.560]  And I have to laugh at that because not because, yeah, vitamin D, they've shown all the studies that people that are most susceptible to illness and death are people that have low vitamin D levels.
[3:22:32.560 --> 3:22:38.560]  But more importantly, I think it's because it's incredibly elementary.
[3:22:38.560 --> 3:22:46.560]  The best way to protect our immune system and more importantly, the best way to defeat this agenda is to recognize the power of human consciousness.
[3:22:46.560 --> 3:22:57.560]  You know, there's a few terms in science that, for whatever reason, they have not made it into the scientific textbooks that we're studying in schools and colleges.
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:23:04.560]  And a couple of those terms are epigenetics. We know about placebo, but what about no-cebo effect?
[3:23:04.560 --> 3:23:09.560]  The placebo effect, of course, and forgive me, I know you know about the placebo.
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:25.560]  And placebo, right, is take a sugar pill and you may think it's real. And due to the power of consciousness, you can evoke a response through your nervous system, through your cells, and through your immune system.
[3:23:25.560 --> 3:23:33.560]  Now, the no-cebo effect, Dr. Joda Spenza has read out length about this in his book called You Are the Placebo.
[3:23:33.560 --> 3:23:49.560]  Not the placebo effect, but you are the placebo. Now, the no-cebo effect is consciousness that you and I hold also has the same ability to affect us negatively on a cellular level.
[3:23:49.560 --> 3:23:54.560]  Or, more importantly, because cells are just energy and you and I are just a field of energy.
[3:23:54.560 --> 3:24:04.560]  It looks like my body ends right here, but it really extends, you know, maybe another five, six, seven feet. I'm on an electromagnetic field of energy and you are an electromagnetic field of energy.
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:20.560]  And the no-cebo effect is about how negative consciousness or negative assumptions about reality can not only make you sick, but they can actually kill you.
[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:34.560]  And if we bring it back to what we were talking about earlier in Reset Wars, one of the parts of Alex's course that I love so much is he breaks down a section about are you a victim to the New World Order?
[3:24:34.560 --> 3:24:46.560]  And he says, you know, you may be awake, you may know everything that's happening in the world, you may be one of the most brilliant individuals that can explain exactly what's occurring in the world.
[3:24:46.560 --> 3:24:59.560]  But that doesn't mean that we aren't victims to the New World Order. And that's why the famous quote is said so often that knowledge isn't power, it's the application of that knowledge that becomes power.
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:06.560]  And so the question is, what are we going to do with these things that we know? And what are we going to do with these things that we learned?
[3:25:06.560 --> 3:25:18.560]  And I think as we move deeper into that, and we move into the no-cebo effect, we can see how the negative images that we're holding, all of reality is a projection of images and a projection of consciousness.
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:27.560]  If I say, think of your refrigerator, you can close your eyes and in a second the image flashes onto the screen of your mind.
[3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:34.560]  Your refrigerator might be silver. You say, what's your car look like? And immediately you see a white four-door SUV.
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:42.560]  We think in images. 95% of our life is subconscious. So 95% of those images are held subconsciously.
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:52.560]  And those subconscious images, because the ruling elites know this, are designed to reinforce an image of a negative future.
[3:25:52.560 --> 3:26:00.560]  And this image of a negative future, I would propose, is also run by the no-cebo effect.
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:15.560]  Now, we talked about the immune system. One of the most powerful way to strengthen your immune system is to understand that your immune system is a stress response that's based off electromagnetic stimuli that's moving through your nervous system and your brain on a subconscious level.
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:24.560]  But if we take a step back, the question is, are we using the no-cebo effect to create our own enslavement every single day?
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:30.560]  And one of the things that I learned from Bob Proctor is that I have the ability to accept or reject any idea.
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:48.560]  I know that there's talk of a planned economic collapse. I know we're seeing inflation at record levels, but as Bob says, he once saw a bumper sticker on the back of a car that said, I heard there's a recession taking place and I will not participate in it.
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:58.560]  I heard there's a collapse of the middle class and enslavement of the middle class, but I will not participate in it.
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:06.560]  And the conscious mind, because we're free from powerful individuals, we have the ability to accept or reject any ideas.
[3:27:06.560 --> 3:27:19.560]  And what I invite you to do is look at the assumptions that you're holding about the future and look at your assumptions that you're holding about reality and ask yourself, is this an image?
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:29.560]  Given that you're made in the image of God and you're endowed with creative faculties and the ability to create your own environment, is this an image that you want to hold?
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:46.560]  Now, if all of us are collectively holding negative images about how they have bought and sold all the governments, if we believe Klaus Schwab's Wikipedia page that Alex has talked about repeatedly where he talks about capturing global governments,
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:52.560]  if we believe they've captured it, then they have. It's just the fact of the matter.
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:28:05.560]  But if we believe the opposite, if we believe that that's just a suggestion, if we understand that what they're trying to do is implant these ideas into our subconscious,
[3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:14.560]  let's say you're always going to be a debt slave, you have to worry about your own death, if you have to worry about your own immune system, they win.
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:32.560]  Now, if the nocebo effect can affect an immune system in a way that can create illness or create death, can the nocebo effect also cause us, if all of us are holding these negative images, can it also cause us to create our own enslavement?
[3:28:32.560 --> 3:28:45.560]  And we're going to be talking about that more through the rest of today's show. And if you want to find out how to reprogram that, rebuild that, become a powerful force of good in the world far beyond your wildest imaginations,
[3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:55.560]  I encourage you to go to resetwars.com right now. There's a 50% off censorship special right now at resetwars.com, so check it out.

[3:30:29.560 --> 3:30:38.560]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:55.560]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:30:55.560 --> 3:31:12.560]  It's time to protect your privacy.

[3:31:12.560 --> 3:31:25.560]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[3:31:25.560 --> 3:31:37.560]  That's why everybody should visit m4store.com. We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in America products that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible.

[3:33:06.560 --> 3:33:22.560]  I want to welcome you back to the fourth hour of the Alex Shown Show. My name is Jake and I'm here in honor of the Resetwars 50% off censorship special.
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:38.560]  That five or six major attacks on resetwars. We're doing a 50% off censorship special because quite frankly they don't want this type of information to get out there and it's not just resetwars.
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:54.560]  It's this type of information in general because they want to sustain a reactive state of consciousness where using the observer effect, the power of quantum physics and the no sebo effect we continue to feel powerless to what's happening.
[3:33:54.560 --> 3:34:01.560]  And the more powerless we feel even if we're awake to what's happening, the more they win.
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:19.560]  And so you can go to resetwars.com right now and check out the 50% off censorship special that's going on. I think it was going to close today but Alex extended it for another day or two in honor of the passing of my mentor and one of my dear friends, Bob Proctor,
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:42.560]  who's really changed my life in an immeasurable way because he helped me realize that I have the power of free will and I have the power to harness my own consciousness and my own mind and my own behaviors and my own actions to do something meaningful in the world
[3:34:42.560 --> 3:34:50.560]  instead of just sit around and complain about what's happening and study it and get mad at it, that I could take this energy and do something useful.
[3:34:50.560 --> 3:35:19.560]  That's the why behind resetwars and why it was created. Of course, it's very important to continue to fund these operations, but more significantly, this is about the next step in human evolution and tapping into the power that you have as an individual to do something incredibly meaningful in the limited amount of time that you're here in a body.
[3:35:19.560 --> 3:35:27.560]  And so I want to talk a little bit about quantum physics here and I want to talk a little bit about the observer effect.
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:37.560]  But before we get into that, I just finished a great book called Embrace the Suck. It was written by a Navy SEAL. I'm forgetting his name right now off the top of my head.
[3:35:37.560 --> 3:35:50.560]  And I really love the phrase Embrace the Suck because, look, right now there's a lot of bad things happening in the world on a global level, but you may have been influenced on a personal level.
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:57.560]  You may have lost a job. You may be behind financially. There may be a lot more stress than you'd like to have.
[3:35:57.560 --> 3:36:09.560]  And when you're aware of what's happening in the world, there's also an increased level of subconscious tension because you want to do something about it and it can be frustrating.
[3:36:09.560 --> 3:36:17.560]  And I think a good mantra for us is to embrace the suck and do something meaningful.
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:34.560]  We're not going to be able to avoid the suck that happens in life, but the question is, are you trading your suck for building something meaningful or are you just tolerating it?
[3:36:34.560 --> 3:36:39.560]  Most people just tolerate the suck.
[3:36:39.560 --> 3:36:51.560]  Well, this is just the way it is and, you know, if the financial system wasn't such a fraud and if they didn't declare everyone non-essential and if this wasn't happening, I'd be happier.
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:37:02.560]  I'd have more financial freedom or if X, Y, and Z wasn't occurring, I'd write that book. I'd rebuild the education system. I'd run for a local office, but I can't. Here's why.
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:09.560]  But embracing the suck, I think, is illustrated very well in Victor Frankl's book, A Man's Search for Meaning.
[3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:21.560]  And we've all heard about that book, but one of the points that really stuck out to me is, here was this psychologist that got put in Auschwitz and many of these terrible camps.
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:40.560]  And while faced with, you know, an unspeakable level of tyranny, what he realized was that they could do anything to him, but they could not take away his ability to think what he wanted to think.
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:55.560]  And he found that the people that didn't make it, that just couldn't find the will to keep going in the face of this enslavement, it was because they didn't have a connection to something larger than themselves.
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:19.560]  They couldn't find meaning in it. And what I love about Reset Wars is it's giving us the tools to not only embrace the suck, but to find significant meaning in what's happening in the world and find your place to make it brighter, to make it better, to make it more beautiful.
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:32.560]  And telling everyone what's happening in the world alone isn't going to solve or fix what's occurring.
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:49.560]  What's going to change the world is when everyone around you sees that you've woken up and you're changing your financial life. You've doubled your sales and your business. You've started to build that nonprofit. You've started to rebuild the education system.
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:59.560]  You had an idea, but you don't know how to code. So you taught yourself how to code. Whatever it is, this is the keys to our own freedoms.
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:18.560]  Now, one of the questions that I posed earlier is what really is the hidden knowledge? And the hidden knowledge comes back to a question is who are you really? And as Bob Proctor always said, who you are isn't your name and it's not who you see in the mirror.
[3:39:18.560 --> 3:39:30.560]  And there's a point in my life when someone said, who are you? I would say, well, I'm Jake Ducey. Here's who I am. I have blue eyes. I'm about this tall. This is who I am. But that's not who I am.
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:48.560]  The physical body is just a rental car that houses your soul for a limited period of time. And your soul is your connection to God, to this Holy Spirit. That's all powerful. That's all knowing.
[3:39:48.560 --> 3:40:04.560]  And this same creative force that is constantly expanding the galaxies in the universe, you and I have access to it within our own minds. And we can accept what's happening in the world right now or we can disassociate from our five senses,
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:11.560]  tap into the spiritual side of ourselves and build a vision. And I believe this is how things change.
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:23.560]  Now, one of the most empowering things that I found about quantum physics in the observer effect is regardless of what's happening in the world, it's changeable.
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:33.560]  Steve Jobs, he had a quote and he said that once you realize the world was built by people no smarter than you, you can mold it, shape it and change it however you want.
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:53.560]  Now, that's not just an inspirational quote. Observer effect of quantum physics shows us that, that this pen right here looks like a solid object, but all it really is is a mass of molecules or an energy pattern that vibrates at a frequency that's so dense and we're so used to it that it appears to be a solid object.
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:41:10.560]  Similarly as so for your bank account, similarly as so for the state of the world, it's just an electromagnetic field. It's just a frequency pattern that has been vibrating at a certain amplitude or rate of vibration for so long that it seems immovable.
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:31.560]  And I want to suggest that it is movable. Now, what the observer effect shows us is that there's these things, right, atoms, and we always thought atoms were the building blocks of the universe, but there's these things even smaller called subatomic particles.
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:48.560]  What they found out was that these subatomic particles would sometimes be observable and sometimes they would be invisible. Sometimes they would be a particle and sometimes they would be a wave, meaning they were a frequency pattern that was no longer localized in space and time.
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:42:05.560]  Sometimes they called this the spooky science. But what does this show us? Well, it shows us that the basis of reality that we think is real, the future that we are headed on right now, is actually totally changeable, malleable, and movable.
[3:42:05.560 --> 3:42:21.560]  And based off of our own consciousness, based off of our own vibratory rates, and based off of the own images that we're holding, we are affecting reality, first our own personal realities and then collectively our whole world, from a subatomic level.
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:36.560]  This is why they don't want us to wake up. This is why they censored reset wars, and this is why they're stopping this information from getting out, is because if we wake up to the power of recreating our world, they lose.
[3:42:36.560 --> 3:42:55.560]  The whole goal is to keep us trapped in fear in the reptilian centers of our brain.

[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:23.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Shown Show. My name is Jake, and I'm here in honor of the Reset Wars 50% off censorship special that is going on right now at resetwars.com.
[3:47:23.560 --> 3:47:41.560]  And, you know, I've been on on the show promoting reset wars real hard. And the reason that I'm promoting it so hard and why it's so obvious that they don't want this type of information in general to come out is is of course we've, as we've mentioned,
[3:47:41.560 --> 3:47:51.560]  we've had numerous iterations of censorship and numerous iterations of shutdowns of putting this work out there in the world.
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:48:01.560]  But more importantly, it's about giving their goal is about giving the appearance that we are not in control.
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:11.560]  And I go back to the question that Alex poses in the reset wars courses. Are you a victim to the new world order?
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:29.560]  And so far today we've talked a lot about the power of consciousness. We've talked about the the really immeasurable power that you have as a human being, because you're connected to God, you're connected to the universe.
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:37.560]  And you can harness this power to create measurable change and measurable impact in the world.
[3:48:37.560 --> 3:48:49.560]  But what happens is, based off the way that we've been programmed from the time we're little children, up until the time you're about six years old, you're in a brainwave state similar to hypnosis.
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:57.560]  You're in a hypnotic brainwave state. So we've inherited all of this conditioning from the way that we grew up.
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:49:07.560]  By the time we're about 18 years old, the neurological circuits in our brain have pretty much been formed. And then we spend the rest of our lives playing those programs out.
[3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:17.560]  And we come to build what's known as a personality. And your personality might say you're good at this, you're not good at this, you're only capable of this.
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:29.560]  But what I invite you to consider is that your personality is nothing more than an illusion. It's an illusion that feels very real due to the nervous system.
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:39.560]  There's a term in neuroscience that Alex talks about in the Reset Wars course called Hebb's Law. And Hebb's Law says that nerve cells that fire together wire together.
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:46.560]  Every time we have a thought, every time we have an emotion, especially in the earlier years of our life, we fire cells in our brain.
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:59.560]  And when we fire the same cells over and over and over again, they wire together and they build the neurological circuitry in our brain similar to an old growth forest, how all the roots grow together.
[3:49:59.560 --> 3:50:07.560]  And they basically become one and it becomes a hardened root system. Well, similarly, that's all your personality is.
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:17.560]  But we now know through neuroscience, neuro meaning brain and plastic meaning changeable, we know through the changeable studies of the brain that you aren't stuck that way.
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:26.560]  And today we talked about building a vision and three types of goals, an A type goal, a B type goal, and a C type goal.
[3:50:26.560 --> 3:50:36.560]  And a C type goal is a goal that you don't know how to do. So a C type goal is when God fills you with a vision, an extraordinary purpose.
[3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:50.560]  But what happens to most people is once they're inspired by that, they move back into their old personality complex that rationally explains why they can or cannot do something.
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:51:06.560]  And the whole of this agenda relies, again, off of us believing we are just physical bodies, we are just our past, and we are what our brain or nervous system tells us.
[3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:18.560]  And there's two questions that Bob Proctor really changed my life with. And he said, number one, is it true? And number two, who would I be without that thought?
[3:51:18.560 --> 3:51:35.560]  Is it really true that because of the regime that you cannot find joy, is it really true that you have to be depressed and angry and upset and resort to over drinking or reusing of substances?
[3:51:35.560 --> 3:51:47.560]  Is it really true? And who would I be without that thought? Who would I be without the thought that I will always be in debt because of the debt slave system that was created?
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:55.560]  Who would I be without the thought that I don't know how? Who would I be without the thought, well, I want to build a big media company.
[3:51:55.560 --> 3:52:05.560]  I want to build an awesome podcast that inspires people. I want to do X, Y and Z, but I don't know how. Who would I be without that thought?
[3:52:05.560 --> 3:52:22.560]  And there was a time in my life where I thought that the people with the power were just Joe Rogan or just Alex Jones or just some of the other great guests that would come on and expose what was happening in the world.
[3:52:22.560 --> 3:52:29.560]  And then there was a point in my life where I said, why am I giving my power away to everything outside of myself?
[3:52:29.560 --> 3:52:38.560]  And this is the question that they don't want us to ask. How am I giving my power away? And why am I doing it?
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:46.560]  Now, the answer to why we're doing it is because it's a habitual thought pattern, but we have something called free will.
[3:52:46.560 --> 3:52:52.560]  And that's the ability to think anything that we want to think and override the programs that are buried in the subconscious.
[3:52:52.560 --> 3:53:07.560]  And so the question that I invite you to keep in your back pocket as we end the show here today and you pull out a pen and pad and you write down your big vision for the way that you're going to dent the universe,
[3:53:07.560 --> 3:53:24.560]  for the way that you're going to tap into the image in God in which you were made and you're going to harness that divine power to do something powerful and do something meaningful and do something significant is whenever the old thoughts come in,
[3:53:24.560 --> 3:53:32.560]  you ask yourself two questions. Is this really true? And the answer is probably no.
[3:53:32.560 --> 3:53:42.560]  And the next question is, who would I be without that thought? Who would I be without that thought? Because it's easy to think that you can't build a new awesome business.
[3:53:42.560 --> 3:53:56.560]  You can't rebuild. You can't build an awesome new social platform. You can't do something powerful with the education system because, oh, well, we don't have in QTEL funding us and we don't have the venture capital behind us.
[3:53:56.560 --> 3:54:07.560]  Or I don't have the charisma or the skill set that Alex Jones has or whatever it might be. I'm too busy. I have too much going on. I don't have the time.
[3:54:07.560 --> 3:54:23.560]  Who would I be without that thought? Who would I be without that thought? You know, when Jesus said mountains move and they shall, I don't think he sat back and said,
[3:54:23.560 --> 3:54:34.560]  but could I really? Is it actually possible? Because at every single second, this universal energy is flowing through us.
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:41.560]  And at every single second, you and I are making a free will decision of how we're going to harness this energy.
[3:54:41.560 --> 3:54:53.560]  And there's a quote that Tony Robbins says a lot and he says that most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year and they underestimate what they can accomplish in a decade.
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:55:10.560]  And as we come to the conclusion today, earlier in the show, I was a little emotional because just three minutes before I came on air, I found out that my mentor and one of my dear friends, Bob Proctor, had just passed away today.
[3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:24.560]  And it made me think about something is what do you want to leave behind? The life expectancy of a human being is roughly 78 years.
[3:55:24.560 --> 3:55:33.560]  You know, let's say it's higher now because of new advances in technology or whatnot. And I want you to just pull out a mental calculator in your head.
[3:55:33.560 --> 3:55:43.560]  Take your age and subtract it by call it 80 years. You're 50 years old, subtracted by 80. That means you got roughly 30 years left.
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:56.560]  30 years left. And the question is, are you going to surrender your creative power to what's happening in the world or are you going to do something about it?
[3:55:56.560 --> 3:56:07.560]  We're all not going to be Alex Jones. But in every single city and every single state in every single country, there's work to be done.
[3:56:07.560 --> 3:56:18.560]  Now, your work may not be altruistically feeding a million kids, but you might be able to harness the power of creative energy to double the sales in your business.
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:26.560]  So you have double the resources to not only protect your family, but then to fund the projects that you care about and that you find meaningful.
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:36.560]  And I'm not asking you to believe me. I'm asking you to test this to yourself. I'm asking you to deepen your connection to God and deepen your connection to the universe
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:49.560]  and ask God to show up for you to take a big, bold action somehow in your life today, tap into a C type vision and ask God to show up for you in a meaningful way.
[3:56:49.560 --> 3:56:58.560]  If you don't know how, doesn't matter. You don't need to know how. If all the energy that ever was and ever will be is already created because energy can ever be destroyed,
[3:56:58.560 --> 3:57:07.560]  so that means the future. That means your problems. That means the know how, the plan, the resources. It's already out there somewhere in the quantum field.
[3:57:07.560 --> 3:57:17.560]  But most people never find out that real magic of God and that real magic of the universe because they talk themselves out of it before they even get there.
[3:57:17.560 --> 3:57:21.560]  That's what they want to do and that's what they want to keep happening.
[3:57:21.560 --> 3:57:28.560]  So, I encourage you, if you're looking for a first step or a next step, to head to resetwars.com right now.

[3:59:32.560 --> 3:59:38.560]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism or about corporate fascism.
[3:59:38.560 --> 3:59:45.560]  And it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
