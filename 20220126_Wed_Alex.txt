[00:00.000 --> 00:21.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here hosting the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.200 --> 00:29.080]  What an honor to be with you here today on this Wednesday, January 26th, 2022.
[00:29.080 --> 00:35.320]  It's coming up in the next segment and then we'll be hearing from him again at the bottom
[00:35.320 --> 00:37.880]  of the hour.
[00:37.880 --> 00:43.960]  And I mean, boy oh boy, what a time to be sitting at this desk behind this microphone
[00:43.960 --> 00:51.320]  as Joe Biden is going out for ice cream socials and boutique shopping sprees.
[00:51.320 --> 00:57.880]  I guess that's how he clears his mind as he weighs and the people behind him weigh whether
[00:57.880 --> 01:06.760]  or not they want to start World War III with Russia and China and then see where the pieces
[01:06.760 --> 01:08.480]  fall after that.
[01:08.480 --> 01:15.800]  Now the good news is the American people in polls, whatever accuracy they represent,
[01:15.800 --> 01:24.280]  perhaps some form of accuracy, polls are saying only 15% of people want to see the U.S. get
[01:24.280 --> 01:29.960]  involved with a potential war or foreign entanglements with Russia and Ukraine.
[01:29.960 --> 01:30.960]  So that's good news.
[01:30.960 --> 01:31.960]  The American people don't want it.
[01:31.960 --> 01:37.360]  Those 15% that want it probably live in, you know, Northern Virginia, D.C. area.
[01:37.360 --> 01:38.360]  We know who.
[01:38.360 --> 01:44.320]  They want to remodel their homes and then maybe just some crazed neocons and just some
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.840]  crazed brainwashed liberals who think, you know, if Biden dropped trowel and took a dump
[01:49.840 --> 01:51.960]  at the ice cream parlor, it'd be a good thing.
[01:51.960 --> 01:53.360]  So anything he does would be good.
[01:53.360 --> 01:58.920]  But most Americans don't want anything to do with Russia or Ukraine.
[01:58.920 --> 02:00.640]  It's just the great reset.
[02:00.640 --> 02:07.240]  It's just the corrupt American regime that A, needs a distraction from the disaster that
[02:07.240 --> 02:12.080]  is the Biden administration, a distraction from all the information coming out on the
[02:12.080 --> 02:20.360]  vaccine injuries and a distraction from the disaster that has been the COVID response.
[02:20.360 --> 02:23.680]  So that's the big news story for today that we're going to be covering.
[02:23.680 --> 02:28.080]  But I've got a ton of news that we're going to cover and great guests coming up.
[02:28.080 --> 02:31.120]  You know, here's the situation that we're in.
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.720]  And it's a hard reality to accept.
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.920]  And this is why most people don't want to accept it because it requires you to take
[02:40.920 --> 02:48.680]  some form of a survival mechanism response.
[02:48.680 --> 02:52.600]  It is if you want to have a future, if you want to have a prosperous future, if you want
[02:52.600 --> 02:58.840]  your future generations of lineage to even exist.
[02:58.840 --> 03:00.360]  And so here's the analogy.
[03:00.360 --> 03:06.120]  Well, let's just start with this and then we'll do the analogy.
[03:06.120 --> 03:08.720]  Just take COVID as an example.
[03:08.720 --> 03:13.160]  Just take COVID as the scenario.
[03:13.160 --> 03:24.520]  We know that Western interests like Anthony Fauci knew and took part in what was going
[03:24.520 --> 03:29.480]  on in the Wuhan Institute of Virology to make biological weapons for the Chinese Communist
[03:29.480 --> 03:35.320]  Army that then escaped the lab most likely intentionally.
[03:35.320 --> 03:38.440]  That's what the evidence would support.
[03:38.440 --> 03:41.200]  Intentionally they released it.
[03:41.200 --> 03:46.840]  But either way, they then covered it up so that you wouldn't know about it and that they
[03:46.840 --> 03:49.200]  wouldn't be held responsible.
[03:49.200 --> 03:53.480]  Now you just think about how evil that is.
[03:53.480 --> 03:55.640]  You just think about how evil that is.
[03:55.640 --> 04:00.880]  As if it's not evil enough to make bio weapons with the Chinese Communist military, but to
[04:00.880 --> 04:09.800]  then cover it up, make it worse, and then make that crisis into your power grab is total
[04:09.800 --> 04:10.800]  evil.
[04:10.800 --> 04:17.800]  You're walking through the woods on a hike and you see a bear kind of foraging around
[04:17.800 --> 04:20.320]  maybe eating some berries doesn't look too threatening.
[04:20.320 --> 04:22.920]  It's kind of it looks like it doesn't really have any interest in you.
[04:22.920 --> 04:25.320]  It's just kind of eating these berries or whatever doesn't have its kids with it.
[04:25.320 --> 04:29.000]  And you're like, okay, you know what, I'm a little afraid of that bear, but it doesn't
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.200]  look like it's going to come after me right now and eat me.
[04:31.200 --> 04:33.080]  So I'm just going to kind of go my other way and not panic.
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.640]  But you see a bear and let's say it's got the group of hikers in front of you and it's
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.880]  ripping them apart.
[04:39.880 --> 04:41.320]  It's protecting its kids.
[04:41.320 --> 04:46.720]  Well, you know that bear is in a bad way and you got to get the hell away from that bear.
[04:46.720 --> 04:50.720]  So we're not dealing with a nice quiet bear foraging for berries.
[04:50.720 --> 04:55.320]  We're dealing with a bear that's ripping the hikers in front of us apart.
[04:55.320 --> 04:58.280]  And it's time to be serious with a response to that.
[04:58.280 --> 05:14.080]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[05:14.080 --> 05:25.120]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[05:25.120 --> 05:31.440]  And make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated
[05:31.440 --> 05:32.440]  up in camps.
[05:32.440 --> 05:39.240]  The traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[05:39.240 --> 05:40.240]  So be it.
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.160]  Make them silence us by force.
[05:43.160 --> 05:46.240]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.240]  Give now.
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.240]  Buy products.
[05:48.240 --> 05:49.240]  Donate.
[05:49.240 --> 05:54.960]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[05:54.960 --> 05:55.960]  Free for death.
[05:55.960 --> 06:01.960]  Go now to infowarstore.com.
[06:01.960 --> 06:11.480]  It's Wednesday, January 26, 2022.
[06:11.480 --> 06:18.480]  You're listening to another edition of the censored attack light about demonized feared
[06:18.480 --> 06:22.720]  by tyrants edition of the Alex Jones show.
[06:22.720 --> 06:27.080]  I will be taking over in minutes.
[06:27.080 --> 06:32.600]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to play a clip from the Kennedy Center
[06:32.600 --> 06:39.520]  10 months ago last year that has just now surfaced and begun to go viral on Instagram
[06:39.520 --> 06:41.320]  and Twitter.
[06:41.320 --> 06:47.480]  It's Klaus Schwab, head of the Bilderberg group and the front man for the global crime
[06:47.480 --> 06:51.680]  syndicate known as the New World Order.
[06:51.680 --> 06:58.120]  The Russians call it the Anglo-American establishment because that's what Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's
[06:58.120 --> 07:00.240]  mentor called it, and that's what they call themselves privately.
[07:00.240 --> 07:05.040]  It has nothing to do with the fact that Anglo is the term for white people.
[07:05.040 --> 07:14.000]  It goes back to a combine that basically created William the Conqueror a thousand years ago
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.640]  and the current power structures and empires the world.
[07:19.640 --> 07:24.400]  And the reason I harp on this continually is if you don't understand the different power
[07:24.400 --> 07:29.440]  players and how these rifts and how these fissures go back thousands of years and the
[07:29.440 --> 07:36.760]  black nobility of what is Italy today and you don't understand China and the Chin and
[07:36.760 --> 07:43.160]  legalism, then you don't understand why the world operates the way it does.
[07:43.160 --> 07:46.760]  But this is a big deal.
[07:46.760 --> 07:51.560]  He goes further than he's ever gone admitting the criminal takeover of society and quote
[07:51.560 --> 07:55.240]  penetrating our governments and taking them over from within.
[07:55.240 --> 07:59.840]  So it's not just on the Davos groups on websites, it's not just on their Wikipedia page edited
[07:59.840 --> 08:06.440]  by their people that we are capturing your governments for your own good, removing control
[08:06.440 --> 08:10.120]  of the people and giving it to special stakeholders.
[08:10.120 --> 08:11.640]  That's a quote.
[08:11.640 --> 08:16.000]  He says it at the Kennedy Center with David Gergen.
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.520]  We have it coming out of his filthy demonic evil piehole.
[08:21.520 --> 08:24.760]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is just pure arrogance.
[08:24.760 --> 08:29.640]  They are hiding this illegal garbage right out in the open and we are so close to a tipping
[08:29.640 --> 08:32.400]  point where this becomes mainstream knowledge.
[08:32.400 --> 08:34.520]  Joe Rogan is talking about it.
[08:34.520 --> 08:39.200]  Tucker Carlson is talking about it now and they're bellwethers of the tipping point.
[08:39.200 --> 08:40.280]  And so we're so close.
[08:40.280 --> 08:44.440]  That is coming up bottom of the hour, as I said, and then no one takes over the rest
[08:44.440 --> 08:47.240]  of the transmission, he's got so much to cover, he's done such a great job while I've
[08:47.240 --> 08:51.480]  been here camping in the woods having a great time with my family, looking at the stars
[08:51.480 --> 08:55.200]  and roasting hot dogs and cutting firewood.
[08:55.200 --> 08:58.440]  We've been listening over the audio app and the crews have been doing an amazing job
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.040]  and so have the guests and knowing everybody, someone to salute everybody and it's taken
[09:02.040 --> 09:07.400]  a few days off here, but I can't keep from reading all the news on infoawards.com and
[09:07.400 --> 09:10.760]  watching some of the videos because this is just such an incredible time to be alive.
[09:10.760 --> 09:13.880]  Here's the other giant news obviously.
[09:13.880 --> 09:20.640]  A huge seismic victory, but it had to happen or we truly are in the end of the Republic.
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.200]  And that is, even the corrupt, compromised partially, not all of them, but part of them,
[09:26.200 --> 09:33.040]  Supreme Court said no to the mandates, the force vaccine mandates of the businesses.
[09:33.040 --> 09:38.200]  And now even OSHA, as of yesterday, has withdrawn that garbage.
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.480]  And remember what happened six months ago when the CDC was saying they basically control
[09:43.480 --> 09:48.000]  all rents and properties in the U.S. under emergency powers.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.600]  Well it took the Supreme Court saying no to that.
[09:50.600 --> 09:56.280]  So it's good that the Supreme Court is doing the right thing, but it's doing it very, very
[09:56.280 --> 09:58.080]  narrowly.
[09:58.080 --> 10:04.560]  And that's what I want to really concern everybody that outrageous stuff like this is being tried
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.480]  to see if the globalists can get away with it through their puppet Biden.
[10:08.480 --> 10:14.120]  It doesn't matter how unpopular it is, it doesn't matter if it hurts the credit and
[10:14.120 --> 10:18.520]  faith that people have in the U.S. government because the globalists actually want that
[10:18.520 --> 10:19.520]  in the end.
[10:19.520 --> 10:22.200]  They carry out the criminal activity through their puppets.
[10:22.200 --> 10:24.920]  We then blame American institutions.
[10:24.920 --> 10:28.880]  Trust begins to falter even further and civilization and society falls apart.
[10:28.880 --> 10:31.440]  Now let's be clear, I don't want to trust institutions.
[10:31.440 --> 10:35.960]  I don't want to follow all their orders, but I don't want to destroy those institutions.
[10:35.960 --> 10:39.680]  I don't want to keep those institutions constitutional.
[10:39.680 --> 10:42.360]  And so yeah, our government's got a long history of problems that certainly corrupt
[10:42.360 --> 10:43.640]  and needs to be reformed.
[10:43.640 --> 10:49.360]  But the globalists are trying to make it hyper-corrupt and hyper-oppressive to again
[10:49.360 --> 10:51.720]  cause a clowered and pivoting collapse of society.
[10:51.720 --> 10:55.680]  We certainly do not want that, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:55.680 --> 10:58.360]  So we've got that huge piece of news.
[10:58.360 --> 11:03.120]  We also have NATO just a few days ago threatening military action and a few months ago all the
[11:03.120 --> 11:07.000]  threats of preemptive nuclear war against Russia.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.840]  Now NATO has said no military options on the table and has at least de-escalated from its
[11:11.840 --> 11:17.120]  previous escalation threatening Russia, the precipitated Russia escalating its massing
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.280]  of troops on its borders with Poland and with Ukraine and other areas.
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.040]  So that is some more really, really good news.
[11:27.040 --> 11:32.960]  The bad news is the globalists are accelerating the devaluation of major currencies.
[11:32.960 --> 11:38.320]  They're using the money up front to buy up infrastructure and patents and companies and
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.520]  everything else you can imagine in raw land while leaving us with the bill and the inflation
[11:42.520 --> 11:47.720]  and the devaluation of our currencies and the taxes and the debt.
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.520]  And so yes, a lot of good things are happening but also a lot of grim things are happening
[11:52.520 --> 11:56.440]  and all the globalist controlled cities of the world where the alumni, the Bilderberg
[11:56.440 --> 12:03.400]  group, Davos group are in control, they are not backing off, they are again ramping up
[12:03.400 --> 12:04.560]  everything they're doing.
[12:04.560 --> 12:08.280]  So Owen is about to take over here in a moment.
[12:08.280 --> 12:14.520]  I am cutting a special report right now that we're going to air at the bottom of the hour
[12:14.520 --> 12:20.400]  tying Davos group into Skull and Bones, into Bilderberg, into the Kennedy Center and so
[12:20.400 --> 12:21.400]  much more.
[12:21.400 --> 12:23.640]  So look for that at the bottom of the hour.
[12:23.640 --> 12:28.480]  You should not forget, we cannot run this operation and we cannot stay on air without
[12:28.480 --> 12:29.480]  your support.
[12:29.480 --> 12:32.440]  You see how they're shutting Owen down basically right now, strangling them.
[12:32.440 --> 12:34.920]  They're going after Newsmax.
[12:34.920 --> 12:39.040]  And those are good organizations overall but not one-tenth as hardcore as we are.
[12:39.040 --> 12:43.080]  That's why we're the tip of the spear and that's why you can't take these institutions
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.080]  for granted.
[12:44.080 --> 12:46.600]  You should support Owen, you should support Newsmax.
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.880]  You should share the links to it in the articles but you should also redouble your efforts to
[12:50.880 --> 12:58.040]  share the links and articles from InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and banned on video because
[12:58.040 --> 13:02.040]  if you don't, nobody will and people are now more ready to hear the truth and wake up than
[13:02.040 --> 13:03.040]  ever before.
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.440]  So please remember to tell folks, InfoWars lives and the truth the system doesn't want
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.720]  you to see is alive now, right now, and send them articles and video links and live show
[13:14.720 --> 13:19.880]  links or take our stuff and post it on your own site to get around sensors and share that,
[13:19.880 --> 13:28.000]  the site right now to share that gets around the sensors is futurenews.news, futurenews.news
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  and yes, get the products at InfoWars.com.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.760]  We have to end the sale on Monday, maximum Tuesday because we are going to end up selling
[13:34.760 --> 13:39.320]  out of Rainforest Plus, our great new Tropic at 40% off.
[13:39.320 --> 13:46.120]  We have the amazing Whole Food Vitamin System and our great 1,100% daily allowance of organic
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.720]  vitamin C with zinc and rose hips, the turbo charge for your immune system and body, that's
[13:50.720 --> 13:51.960]  40% off.
[13:51.960 --> 13:55.000]  All those sales are going to have to end on this Monday, so please take advantage of
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.960]  those, defend your body and your family's bodies and immune systems while keeping us
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.560]  on the air as well, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:02.560 --> 14:05.880]  But so many other huge developments, Owen's going to be covering in the next segment and
[14:05.880 --> 14:11.000]  I've got this huge class swab report and then Owen will broadcast for the balance of the
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.800]  Alex Jones show today and he will do that tomorrow as well but I'll be back in the afternoon
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.720]  with filing reports.
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.440]  We've got a lot to fight for folks, our families, our future and God's watching.
[14:21.440 --> 14:24.280]  So again, I salute you all and thank you all for tuning in.
[14:24.280 --> 14:28.480]  Just remember the last part about sharing the articles and the videos is tell the people
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.520]  you give it to that if they find it informative and helpful for them to share it and for them
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.000]  to tell those they give it to you to share it and vice versa and then we're unstoppable
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.800]  together, triggering the chain reaction.
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.680]  InfoWars.com, the front line of the fight for human destiny.
[14:43.680 --> 14:46.680]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[14:46.680 --> 14:53.000]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.640]  left doesn't like, at least in government, but there's a new avenue for those who would
[14:57.640 --> 15:01.600]  like to censor what you say and think and that's corporations.
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.920]  The left have wised up to this.
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.600]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it, the social
[15:09.600 --> 15:11.440]  media giants and they are.
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.280]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent
[15:16.280 --> 15:17.280]  them from speaking.
[15:17.280 --> 15:20.280]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been
[15:20.280 --> 15:22.040]  the radio show host, Alex Jones.
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.000]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.800]  Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.400]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.800]  you ban this person?
[15:35.800 --> 15:41.080]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content
[15:41.080 --> 15:43.080]  will be a little harder to find.
[15:43.080 --> 15:47.120]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.040]  a tat dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.440]  with Big Tech.
[15:53.440 --> 15:56.280]  People know what's true, they can smell it.
[15:56.280 --> 15:59.960]  Infowars, the most banned.
[15:59.960 --> 16:05.560]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill and it is the fastest growing market
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.240]  and supplements in the world, for good reason.
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.760]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not, that do incredible
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.160]  things in our brains and we've tried them all, we've researched them all and we will
[16:19.160 --> 16:24.840]  not sell you anything that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity or any type
[16:24.840 --> 16:25.840]  of extreme hangovers.
[16:25.840 --> 16:29.360]  I mean, because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit
[16:29.360 --> 16:32.280]  of a let down once you take them, but that would just be a lie, but these are very, very
[16:32.280 --> 16:36.960]  clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you and one of our best sellers
[16:36.960 --> 16:43.280]  is back in stock, BrainForce Plus, a good, clean, Neutropic, a good, clean brain pill.
[16:43.280 --> 16:45.280]  You can find stuff that's stronger, but it's not good for you.
[16:45.280 --> 16:50.240]  This is a high quality system, it's available at InfowarsTour.com, it's sold out for a long
[16:50.240 --> 16:55.520]  time at 40% off, so get your BrainForce Plus today at InfowarsTour.com and help keep us
[16:55.520 --> 16:56.520]  on air.
[16:56.520 --> 16:59.920]  Thank you so much and I'll see you out there.
[16:59.920 --> 17:05.320]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[17:05.320 --> 17:07.360]  a healthier life.
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.200]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[17:11.200 --> 17:12.840]  that contains both.
[17:12.840 --> 17:17.800]  This Infowars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[17:17.800 --> 17:19.400]  from the Infowars store.
[17:19.400 --> 17:24.240]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[17:24.240 --> 17:26.960]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[17:26.960 --> 17:31.760]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[17:31.760 --> 17:36.440]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[17:36.440 --> 17:37.440]  shown.
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.760]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[17:41.760 --> 17:46.320]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.440]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[17:51.440 --> 17:52.440]  like here in America.
[17:52.440 --> 17:57.280]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfowarsTour.com where we promise
[17:57.280 --> 18:04.280]  our rose hips don't lie.
[18:57.280 --> 19:05.760]  I want to explain something that is absolutely seed understanding our world that's very, very
[19:05.760 --> 19:08.160]  simple but the most of all don't know.
[19:08.160 --> 19:14.880]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[19:14.880 --> 19:21.520]  of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[19:21.520 --> 19:28.120]  property, energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence and in the past they
[19:28.120 --> 19:32.760]  created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulated market so
[19:32.760 --> 19:36.880]  they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause
[19:36.880 --> 19:37.880]  massive inflation.
[19:37.880 --> 19:42.960]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[19:42.960 --> 19:48.960]  buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and
[19:48.960 --> 19:53.480]  force the collapse of civilization, making the companies they do find the only things
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.480]  left standing.
[19:54.480 --> 19:58.480]  This is the great reset, this is what's happening now, warn everyone, it's the only way to stop
[19:58.480 --> 20:00.480]  it.
[20:00.480 --> 20:30.240]  All right, we have some breaking news right now, Supreme Court Justice
[20:30.240 --> 20:37.280]  Stephen Breyer has announced his retirement, he is the oldest serving Supreme Court Justice
[20:37.280 --> 20:45.400]  at 83 years old, he was obviously a left leaning liberal leaning Supreme Court Justice appointed
[20:45.400 --> 20:52.000]  by Bill Clinton and so he is on his way out.
[20:52.000 --> 21:05.240]  Boy oh boy, now what or rather who or maybe rather what is Joe Biden going to appoint
[21:05.240 --> 21:15.320]  as the next Supreme Court Justice, could you imagine would he be so bold as to nominate
[21:15.320 --> 21:23.240]  Merrick Garland, I don't think so, I don't think that would get the votes needed for approval
[21:23.240 --> 21:29.880]  just given on how partisan, how much of a partisan hack he has been as the Attorney
[21:29.880 --> 21:35.200]  General and how he clearly has blood in his eyes going after Trump supporters.
[21:35.200 --> 21:41.560]  So I know that that will probably be a concern for many but I don't think that's where this
[21:41.560 --> 21:43.200]  is going to go.
[21:43.200 --> 21:50.200]  However, you know Biden is going to look for the most radical leftist he can find that
[21:50.200 --> 22:02.360]  could clear the Congress for approval to get on to the Supreme Court.
[22:02.360 --> 22:06.640]  Obviously when it comes down to voting, it's probably not going to be the most drastic change,
[22:06.640 --> 22:14.400]  the riot and whatever radical leftist Biden appoints probably have similar decisions at
[22:14.400 --> 22:22.120]  the Supreme Court level, however, it's just the Democrat Party is not the Democrat Party
[22:22.120 --> 22:27.720]  of old, it is the radical left wing party now and that is going to be represented on
[22:27.720 --> 22:33.840]  the Supreme Court I believe with whoever replaces Stephen Breyer.
[22:33.840 --> 22:37.480]  So this news is breaking right now.
[22:37.480 --> 22:43.840]  But you know Biden is, he's busy having ice cream socials so he can't be bothered with
[22:43.840 --> 22:48.760]  such things at this moment.
[22:48.760 --> 22:54.760]  He needs to test out the 31 flavors of Baskin Robbins after all, it's Wednesday, January
[22:54.760 --> 22:55.760]  26th.
[22:55.760 --> 22:57.120]  Don't you know what's Biden doing today?
[22:57.120 --> 23:00.440]  He's having ice cream.
[23:00.440 --> 23:04.520]  He's having ice cream.
[23:04.520 --> 23:07.320]  Oh my gosh, talk about embarrassing.
[23:07.320 --> 23:14.960]  I mean, you know, you see all of these embarrassing moments for Joe Biden and it just gets worse
[23:14.960 --> 23:17.560]  and worse with every time.
[23:17.560 --> 23:19.480]  And by the way, it's well known.
[23:19.480 --> 23:25.320]  There's two things that are well known for optics.
[23:25.320 --> 23:31.920]  Bad guys, their publicists will tell them for optics, go have an ice cream cone.
[23:31.920 --> 23:36.680]  Everybody loves ice cream, old people, young people, black people, white people, go out,
[23:36.680 --> 23:38.880]  pose for a picture with an ice cream cone.
[23:38.880 --> 23:40.280]  That'll help your ratings.
[23:40.280 --> 23:41.800]  That'll help your public image.
[23:41.800 --> 23:43.880]  Just go have an ice cream social.
[23:43.880 --> 23:46.760]  So Biden's been doing that for decades.
[23:46.760 --> 23:54.760]  It's also well known that dementia patients like ice cream because it kind of quells
[23:54.760 --> 24:01.480]  their anxiety of having the memory problems and forgetting where they're at and kind of
[24:01.480 --> 24:04.440]  having irrational responses to stimuli.
[24:04.440 --> 24:08.200]  So they go for ice cream.
[24:08.200 --> 24:15.280]  So yeah, while Biden is in the process of potentially starting World War Three, he's
[24:15.280 --> 24:18.000]  going out for ice cream socials.
[24:18.000 --> 24:25.040]  As the country is seeing record crime rates, the president is going for ice cream socials.
[24:25.040 --> 24:29.840]  I mean, if you want to even play along with the leftist narrative, what's the biggest
[24:29.840 --> 24:31.040]  leftist thing right now?
[24:31.040 --> 24:32.040]  Well, it's COVID.
[24:32.040 --> 24:33.040]  They're obsessed with it.
[24:33.040 --> 24:34.040]  Okay.
[24:34.040 --> 24:39.320]  Well, we just had more COVID deaths last year than any other year ever.
[24:39.320 --> 24:43.960]  If you believe the numbers, we have more positive cases than ever.
[24:43.960 --> 24:44.960]  And what's Biden doing?
[24:44.960 --> 24:46.600]  He's having the ice cream social.
[24:46.600 --> 24:47.840]  That's how you distract.
[24:47.840 --> 24:50.200]  That's how you save your public image.
[24:50.200 --> 24:57.200]  So Biden gets embarrassed on the world stage, curses out a reporter, slurs and stumbles
[24:57.200 --> 25:01.440]  his way through his second press conference.
[25:01.440 --> 25:02.440]  So what do you do?
[25:02.440 --> 25:05.360]  What do you do when you're embarrassing yourself on the world stage?
[25:05.360 --> 25:08.160]  You go for an ice cream.
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.800]  You go for the old ice cream social.
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.360]  Joe Biden stops for ice cream as Russia's invasion of Ukraine remains imminent.
[25:17.360 --> 25:21.720]  That's what we're being told.
[25:21.720 --> 25:28.480]  Ukraine doesn't seem to be so panicked about it though, but we'll get back to that.
[25:28.480 --> 25:31.160]  He didn't only, he didn't stop at the ice cream social though.
[25:31.160 --> 25:38.560]  He then went on a shopping spree, went to some nice boutiques to do some shopping.
[25:38.560 --> 25:42.800]  Seemed to be stuck in the kids section most of the time, Biden while holding a Kamala
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.320]  Harris mug in DC boutique.
[25:46.320 --> 25:51.280]  The media found out where he was and started harassing him.
[25:51.280 --> 25:54.560]  And he said, if Putin invades Ukraine, it would be the largest invasion since World
[25:54.560 --> 25:55.560]  War II.
[25:55.560 --> 25:58.840]  Oh, I see.
[25:58.840 --> 26:01.800]  Are you, uh, are you trying to tell us something?
[26:01.800 --> 26:04.200]  Are you trying to say, oh, I get it.
[26:04.200 --> 26:09.160]  You're going to blame Putin if you start World War III.
[26:09.160 --> 26:16.600]  No, if whatever goes on between Russia and Ukraine is going to stay between Russia and
[26:16.600 --> 26:21.720]  Ukraine, no one else will get involved.
[26:21.720 --> 26:27.000]  But if the US decides to get involved or if the US decides to spur NATO to get involved,
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.320]  which really just be the US anyway, that will lead to a larger conflict.
[26:32.320 --> 26:35.760]  I believe that will get China and other countries involved.
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.720]  So no, it wouldn't be Putin, it would be the other foreign interventions that would start
[26:39.720 --> 26:40.720]  that World War III.
[26:40.720 --> 26:47.920]  That would be a local incursion or skirmish between Russia and Ukraine.
[26:47.920 --> 26:49.320]  That would be it.
[26:49.320 --> 26:53.360]  But as soon as the US or NATO get involved, everybody knows it's going to become a larger
[26:53.360 --> 27:02.520]  conflict and there's going to be a new, it'll be a new axis of power type of situation.
[27:02.520 --> 27:05.960]  And the pieces will fall where they may.
[27:05.960 --> 27:12.280]  And I don't think we're going to like where the US lands in that scenario.
[27:12.280 --> 27:15.320]  And we don't like what's going on now.
[27:15.320 --> 27:20.160]  According to polls, most Americans want nothing to do with this.
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.440]  Only 15% of Americans support sending US troops to Ukraine in the event of an invasion.
[27:25.440 --> 27:30.920]  Now, just to kind of go sideways off of that for a second.
[27:30.920 --> 27:36.480]  Can you imagine, and maybe this number is true, and we just don't know it because we
[27:36.480 --> 27:43.560]  don't get fair representation in the media or in our government, but only 15% of Americans
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.520]  support getting involved in Ukraine.
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.960]  Imagine if only 15% of Americans supported any of the COVID nonsense that we've seen
[27:52.960 --> 27:56.840]  in the last, what are we, in the third year now?
[27:56.840 --> 27:59.800]  Imagine if it was only 15% of Americans that supported any of it.
[27:59.800 --> 28:03.360]  Now, that number could be accurate.
[28:03.360 --> 28:04.600]  How am I to even know?
[28:04.600 --> 28:11.400]  I would imagine most people don't like it, but when I go out now in Austin to get groceries
[28:11.400 --> 28:19.520]  and I see that 80 to 90% of people are wearing masks again when just this last summer, nobody
[28:19.520 --> 28:21.040]  was wearing masks at the grocery store.
[28:21.040 --> 28:23.520]  Now they're all back wearing masks.
[28:23.520 --> 28:28.140]  So I guess they just do whatever they're told to do by the TV or they're afraid of
[28:28.140 --> 28:32.320]  whatever the TV tells them to be afraid of.
[28:32.320 --> 28:38.480]  But imagine if only 15% of Americans actually wanted any of the COVID nonsense.
[28:38.480 --> 28:39.560]  Would we already be over it?
[28:39.560 --> 28:40.760]  Would we already be above it?
[28:40.760 --> 28:42.720]  Would our government listen to us?
[28:42.720 --> 28:44.240]  Would our media represent us?
[28:44.240 --> 28:49.160]  Well, I don't know, but you're about to find out with the Ukraine and Russia situation
[28:49.160 --> 28:51.480]  within the next month or two.
[28:51.480 --> 28:55.800]  Nobody wants to get involved in Ukraine and Russia except radical neocons and brainwashed
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.760]  leftists and people in Virginia that are about to remodel their homes.
[29:00.760 --> 29:07.480]  Reset Wars is a great tool, amazing and eye-opening.
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.800]  Really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily
[29:12.800 --> 29:18.280]  go across political lines or religious lines, but about all of us as a human species coming
[29:18.280 --> 29:19.280]  together.
[29:19.280 --> 29:24.960]  I'm a combat veteran and that brought me close to God, but what Alex goes through brought
[29:24.960 --> 29:26.080]  me even closer.
[29:26.080 --> 29:27.760]  I can feel God in my life now.
[29:27.760 --> 29:32.160]  The viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously programmed into your brain
[29:32.160 --> 29:36.640]  and how to erase those programs and install new.
[29:36.640 --> 29:41.200]  Reset Wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular Info Wars broadcasts.
[29:41.200 --> 29:46.160]  It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious
[29:46.160 --> 29:47.440]  and self-determined life.
[29:47.440 --> 29:50.840]  If you're on the fence about Reset Wars, it's time to get off the fence.

[29:59.920 --> 30:05.320]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply
[30:05.320 --> 30:07.000]  chain breakdowns.
[30:07.000 --> 30:10.560]  You've done a great job supporting Info Wars and supporting your immune system.
[30:10.560 --> 30:14.800]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the Great Reset, we can't get these products
[30:14.800 --> 30:15.800]  in.
[30:15.800 --> 30:22.440]  They came in but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient,

[30:35.080 --> 30:36.320]  rose hips.
[30:36.320 --> 30:39.840]  Number one thing you can do if you're immune system and your body is so much more.

[33:00.800 --> 33:17.520]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:17.520 --> 33:20.680]  You've found it, the tip of the spear.
[33:20.680 --> 33:32.760]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[33:32.760 --> 33:46.640]  So the American people are now well aware that in recent decades our foreign incursions,
[33:46.640 --> 33:53.600]  our foreign involvement, our foreign entanglements, our proxy wars and all of it have had almost
[33:53.600 --> 34:00.600]  no benefit to the United States, to our citizens and in fact have been actually a negative
[34:00.600 --> 34:01.600]  for us.
[34:01.600 --> 34:07.120]  They've cost us so much blood and treasure and we're sick and tired of it and so their
[34:07.120 --> 34:14.280]  newest attempt to get us involved in Russia has fallen flat.
[34:14.280 --> 34:19.160]  So now the Biden administration which is already a complete disaster, I mean Biden says he
[34:19.160 --> 34:23.760]  wants to run again, I don't know how anybody could take that seriously, the guy's approval
[34:23.760 --> 34:31.200]  rating is about to, I mean I would say pretty soon it'll be below the 30% mark in almost
[34:31.200 --> 34:32.200]  every poll.
[34:32.200 --> 34:34.480]  Really, you're going to run again?
[34:34.480 --> 34:40.880]  You can't even string two sentences together without stammering and now you're threatening
[34:40.880 --> 34:48.320]  another foreign incursion in a land far away that has absolutely no benefit to us while
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.320]  we have our own problems here domestically, we have our own border issues, we have in
[34:53.320 --> 34:58.680]  fact the worst border problem, I mean nobody's even really talking about the border except
[34:58.680 --> 35:05.480]  I will say Fox News made the border story their number one story all day yesterday and I'll
[35:05.480 --> 35:11.200]  be covering that and telling you why, but there's nothing new there, that's just Fox
[35:11.200 --> 35:14.960]  News being a year behind info wars on what's going on at the southern border, literally
[35:14.960 --> 35:20.640]  just filming all the exact stuff that we filmed a year ago, I mean literally, it's like hey
[35:20.640 --> 35:25.400]  you could have used all of our stuff a year ago and reported the same stuff but hey good,
[35:25.400 --> 35:33.800]  good for Fox News for reporting it, it needs to be known what's going on in Texas but see
[35:33.800 --> 35:39.000]  you're not even allowed to go to California and film it, they have that situation locked
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.680]  down so strong that they don't let the media anywhere near the illegal immigration pipeline
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.160]  but here in Texas they don't have it nearly locked down as much, you could tell that they
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.240]  tried to do it in some of their locations where the illegal immigration pipeline is
[35:54.240 --> 36:02.520]  going on and we were able to just film outside of it and get some undercover footage but
[36:02.520 --> 36:06.240]  yeah you're seeing the footage there from Fox News which is just basically essentially
[36:06.240 --> 36:11.800]  the same footage we shot a year ago but so what are you going to do if you're Biden,
[36:11.800 --> 36:15.360]  you've already saber rattled and puffed out your chest to Russia and Putin like you're
[36:15.360 --> 36:19.440]  the big man on campus, you're going to do something and then you realize you turned
[36:19.440 --> 36:24.920]  around and nobody really had your back and Putin would obviously kick your ass but that's
[36:24.920 --> 36:34.320]  just an analogy and so what do you do, oh well you go for the ice cream social and then
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.080]  you back off your rhetoric a little bit but you still have to do something, you still
[36:40.080 --> 36:44.760]  have to be the tough guy, you still got to be the loudest barking dog in the yard because
[36:44.760 --> 36:47.880]  you're Biden after all, you're one of the most corrupt politicians in world history,
[36:47.880 --> 36:51.960]  you're not going to be shown up by Putin, you're not going to be shown up by Russia,
[36:51.960 --> 36:58.920]  you're Joe Biden, you make mincemeat out of other politicians with your corruption.
[36:58.920 --> 37:05.200]  So he has a plan which will fail also but he thinks he has a plan or the Pentagon thinks
[37:05.200 --> 37:09.240]  they have a plan or who's ever running the show, who knows thinks they have a plan.
[37:09.240 --> 37:13.240]  As Pentagon backtracks on talk of Russian invasion, Putin responds to Biden personal
[37:13.240 --> 37:21.000]  sanctions threat so now they're saying Biden and the Pentagon are saying well why don't
[37:21.000 --> 37:30.840]  we just attack Putin personally and let's just sanction Putin, that'll show him, here's
[37:30.840 --> 37:39.080]  the problem, Vladimir Putin isn't the corrupt bastard that Joe Biden is, Vladimir Putin
[37:39.080 --> 37:49.480]  isn't the money grubbing power hungry thief like American politicians are and so zero
[37:49.480 --> 37:57.960]  hedge is showing the irony here that they can sanction Putin all they want, Putin is really
[37:57.960 --> 38:07.280]  not a wealthy man, he has an apartment and three cars so no he hasn't built vast wealth
[38:07.280 --> 38:13.320]  of hundreds of millions of dollars like American politicians have, like Democrats have, like
[38:13.320 --> 38:21.320]  the Bidens have, like the Clintons have, like the Bushes have, no Putin doesn't have a history
[38:21.320 --> 38:31.000]  of political thievery and corruption that ends up stacking his bank accounts to infinity
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.640]  and beyond.
[38:35.640 --> 38:41.360]  So what are you going to do, you're going to go after Putin but see they're so delusional,
[38:41.360 --> 38:49.720]  they're so removed from the actual reality of anything else but themselves, they just
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.480]  assume that Putin is as big of a thief as they are, they just assume that oh let's go
[38:54.480 --> 38:59.080]  after Putin will embarrass him on the world stage, they don't get it, you don't have the
[38:59.080 --> 39:04.640]  moral high ground, you don't have the backing of the citizens of this planet, we know who
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.520]  the corrupt politicians are, we know how politicians are making hundreds of millions
[39:10.520 --> 39:16.320]  of dollars and it's not off their government salaries.
[39:16.320 --> 39:19.840]  So going after Putin personally they will find out shortly, it would only embarrass
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.880]  them further and so I believe they'll back off of that as well but they had to puff up
[39:23.880 --> 39:28.600]  their chest a little more, they had to save or rattle a little more and every time they
[39:28.600 --> 39:35.480]  do that it just is another failure for Biden and the people backing him and this is our
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.680]  leadership now, corrupt as the day is long.
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.720]  Now there is some unrest happening in Ukraine right now, it is somewhat similar to what
[39:45.720 --> 39:55.280]  we saw, I guess it was what around 2014 in the Crimea skirmishes, Ukrainians attempt
[39:55.280 --> 40:03.920]  to storm parliament building and so they're upset because Zelensky has a law that makes
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.000]  cash registers required for all businesses, I don't know why they would have a problem
[40:09.000 --> 40:17.440]  with that, seems like some Soros funding at play here maybe, some Soros manipulation
[40:17.440 --> 40:22.720]  at play here just like there was in Crimea almost a decade ago now, it's hard to believe
[40:22.720 --> 40:29.640]  that's the case and I remember this was before I even was fully immersed into politics and
[40:29.640 --> 40:34.960]  I was kind of just starting to wet my whistle in politics if you will and I remember when
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.960]  it was the biggest story, guys when you find out when was that situation in Crimea, I think
[40:40.960 --> 40:47.560]  it was 2014 and there was all kinds of Soros funding and involvement in that and then it
[40:47.560 --> 40:52.360]  got so out of control there were people getting shot and the whole thing just kind of scuttled
[40:52.360 --> 40:58.040]  out after that but so they're mad at Zelensky because he wants to make cash registers required
[40:58.040 --> 41:01.280]  all businesses so I guess he likes cash, that's a good thing, he doesn't want to be tracking
[41:01.280 --> 41:07.920]  your money and then they also say that they don't like his new tax system but yeah okay
[41:07.920 --> 41:13.360]  there might be some legitimate cause for these protests, there might be some legitimate cause,
[41:13.360 --> 41:19.320]  this could be organic grassroots or it could be just another Soros astroturf fund to just
[41:19.320 --> 41:30.840]  create chaos in Ukraine to just make it a hotbed for further chaos and potentially even
[41:30.840 --> 41:38.160]  maybe a war, here's Tulsi Gabbard today or yesterday rather, the Biden administration
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.480]  is ready to go to war with Russia to save Ukraine's corrupt so called democracy while
[41:42.480 --> 41:47.000]  destroying our own democracy here at home, yeah I mean how much longer can Tulsi Gabbard
[41:47.000 --> 41:54.160]  claim she's a Democrat, I mean she's clearly not a deranged anti-American lunatic which
[41:54.160 --> 42:04.320]  is the standard grounds to be a Democrat these days, she's a rational modern day liberal that
[42:04.320 --> 42:11.040]  doesn't hate America and likes free speech and likes the military, that's not the trademark
[42:11.040 --> 42:17.400]  of a Democrat in the year 2022, so I don't know if she thinks she can reform the Democrat
[42:17.400 --> 42:21.480]  party, by the way she'll never be able to win as a Democrat cause they, you know and
[42:21.480 --> 42:28.480]  I was thinking about this last night too as Biden is just such a disaster, you Democrats
[42:28.480 --> 42:36.120]  don't even get real elections within your own party, I'm no Bernie Sanders fan but he
[42:36.120 --> 42:42.120]  should have been the Democrat nominee in 2016 and in 2020 but the Democrats wouldn't
[42:42.120 --> 42:46.720]  let him, so they rigged the primaries for Hillary and they rigged the primaries for
[42:46.720 --> 42:53.640]  Biden, remember during the debates Biden was a racist, Biden was too old, I mean but oh
[42:53.640 --> 43:01.560]  he somehow got the nomination even though he lost every debate and didn't have a rally.
[43:01.560 --> 43:05.600]  This night seemed to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[43:05.600 --> 43:10.920]  both at home and the world at large, if you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep

[47:01.000 --> 47:09.520]  Having a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:09.520 --> 47:15.400]  And welcome back to this live Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones show, I'm your host Alex
[47:15.400 --> 47:16.400]  Jones.
[47:16.400 --> 47:21.400]  We're about to dive into something that is of paramount importance and is an issue that
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.840]  I hammer home every day because it is one of the main keys of victory and destiny.
[47:27.840 --> 47:32.800]  We have to know who our enemies are, we have to understand who the globalist are and what
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.560]  their plans for us are and how they brag in hundreds of books they've written and thousands
[47:38.560 --> 47:42.960]  of articles that I've personally read, I'm sure there's thousands more I haven't read
[47:42.960 --> 47:48.840]  about how we're idiots and how we need to be depopulated and how they've taken control
[47:48.840 --> 47:52.480]  of society and civilization through the corporations.
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.360]  And if we simply identify these people and realize from their own words and deeds because
[47:57.360 --> 48:05.280]  they're not boasting that they are the authors of 90% or more of the world's problems.
[48:05.280 --> 48:10.680]  Now an example of this is Klaus Schwab, he's the central example of it.
[48:10.680 --> 48:16.840]  If you go to the Wikipedia page, it has a link to the Davos group with him bragging
[48:16.840 --> 48:22.920]  about three years ago, seizing control of quote, democracies by penetrating them and
[48:22.920 --> 48:28.920]  infiltrating them and whining and dining and paying off young leaders in many cases at
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.120]  the college level and up by the thousands every year around the world using intelligence
[48:33.120 --> 48:40.520]  agency tactics to then embed them as spies inside first local state and then federal
[48:40.520 --> 48:46.680]  governments and then these international organizations like the IMF, the World Bank,
[48:46.680 --> 48:53.160]  the UN through the Davos group can direct a top down takeover by the very top of the
[48:53.160 --> 48:59.040]  world system, it's unelected authoritarian going and recruiting and getting all the
[48:59.040 --> 49:04.520]  people elected and put in positions in the local state and national governments.
[49:04.520 --> 49:07.240]  This is how you capture a civilization.
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.480]  This is what has happened to us and I understand our amazing audience is sitting there saying
[49:12.480 --> 49:17.120]  Alex, we knew this before you were born or a lot of you are like, yeah Alex, we tuned
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.440]  in 20 years ago, we know, we checked, we know it's true, why are you telling us again?
[49:21.440 --> 49:27.040]  Because the general public still doesn't know and I talk to top lawyers and top bank owners
[49:27.040 --> 49:33.040]  and top talk show host all the time and spend 10, 15 minutes showing them clips about Klaus
[49:33.040 --> 49:37.200]  Schwab and the UN and the Davos group and the Bilderberg group and the club of Rome and
[49:37.200 --> 49:41.480]  British intelligence and Carol Quigley and Cecil Rhodes and explaining how it all works
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.280]  and boom, they wake up, they understand it, they're off and running and then they're
[49:46.280 --> 49:47.920]  now not exposing it.
[49:47.920 --> 49:52.480]  So we've gone from almost nobody doing about this 25 years ago to a large portion of folks
[49:52.480 --> 49:58.880]  getting it and we're very, very close to identifying it and stopping it dead in its tracks.
[49:58.880 --> 50:06.680]  Now a new piece of video has emerged from the Harvard Kennedy School with the globalist
[50:06.680 --> 50:13.360]  new world order operative David Gergen interviewing Klaus Schwab at the Kennedy School, which
[50:13.360 --> 50:15.080]  is getting one of these big globalist organizations.
[50:15.080 --> 50:20.360]  So you have a real Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. fighting their great reset agenda and
[50:20.360 --> 50:26.920]  then you've got something bearing his brother's name and it's absolutely captured by the organization
[50:26.920 --> 50:32.280]  multinational group that undoubtedly ran the murder of the man whose name they've now stolen.
[50:32.280 --> 50:36.080]  It's just too rich but getting back to the video clip you're about to see, it's only
[50:36.080 --> 50:38.440]  a minute and 15 seconds long.
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.520]  We're going to link in the live show feed of info wars.com, the full hour long discussions
[50:43.520 --> 50:46.160]  you go watch for yourself because there's stuff just as bad in it.
[50:46.160 --> 50:53.080]  But here is Klaus Schwab admitting what he says in the Wikipedia entries on television
[50:53.080 --> 50:55.160]  in front of a crowd of people on C-SPAN.
[50:55.160 --> 51:00.160]  Here he is saying that their alumni, including Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin, oh you
[51:00.160 --> 51:05.600]  didn't know that, including the prime minister of New Zealand, the prime minister of Canada,
[51:05.600 --> 51:12.680]  the president of France, all of them went to the Bilderberg school, the Davos Young
[51:12.680 --> 51:14.240]  Lobe Leader School.
[51:14.240 --> 51:17.960]  Now obviously anybody wanting to get powerfully, who I want to get ahead wants to go be part
[51:17.960 --> 51:21.320]  of this feeder group and I'm not saying everybody that's gone is evil.
[51:21.320 --> 51:25.000]  Now Tulsi Gabbards went to it, Dan Crenshaw.
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.280]  But the point is, is that we should be aware of this and understand this and understand
[51:29.280 --> 51:34.680]  that what Klaus Schwab set up with Henry Kissinger is only a more modern model of what the British
[51:34.680 --> 51:40.160]  round table groups started setting up in places like India 250 years ago for the British East
[51:40.160 --> 51:44.080]  India Company that then spread around the world.
[51:44.080 --> 51:47.160]  And that is these organizations and groups that go and recruit the locals and round table
[51:47.160 --> 51:52.280]  groups that are controlled by like a central agent in the middle that operate like a British
[51:52.280 --> 51:55.480]  intelligence operation because it is a British intelligence operation.
[51:55.480 --> 51:56.480]  That's the model of it.
[51:56.480 --> 51:59.760]  And Carol Quigley and many others wrote books about it, it's a bit of a Brazilian key.
[51:59.760 --> 52:02.240]  This is not a secret in the intelligence here.
[52:02.240 --> 52:06.080]  And we have to be adults and know the playbook and know what we're up against and realize
[52:06.080 --> 52:12.920]  these globalist would be controllers are very evil and don't even want you to be alive.
[52:12.920 --> 52:17.400]  That's the radiology is to destroy you, to enslave you and suck everything you've got
[52:17.400 --> 52:19.280]  out of you and then destroy you.
[52:19.280 --> 52:20.400]  That's why they've got to be opposed.
[52:20.400 --> 52:26.160]  So here's this short, extremely powerful clip that we're going to come back with more.
[52:26.160 --> 52:32.880]  And I mentioned our names like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on.
[52:32.880 --> 52:37.840]  They all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[52:37.840 --> 52:47.120]  But what we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, President
[52:47.120 --> 52:52.840]  of Argentina and so on, so that we penetrate the cabinets.
[52:52.840 --> 53:03.560]  So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I would know that half
[53:03.560 --> 53:11.280]  of this cabinet or even more half of this cabinet are for our actually young global
[53:11.280 --> 53:13.320]  leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[53:13.320 --> 53:15.040]  That's true in Argentina as well.
[53:15.040 --> 53:18.560]  It's true in Argentina and it's true in France now.
[53:18.560 --> 53:24.240]  I may be the president who is a young global leader, but if you're live, we've linked
[53:24.240 --> 53:28.200]  to it again at infowars.com in the live show feed area.
[53:28.200 --> 53:33.360]  You can go watch this for yourself where he's describing their alumni, not just being the
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.160]  prime ministers and presidents, but having the majority of the cabinets being their people
[53:38.160 --> 53:43.600]  and being believers in the transhumanism world government depopulation agenda.
[53:43.600 --> 53:49.360]  This is a death code and that's why whether it's Merkel or whether it is Macron or whether
[53:49.360 --> 53:54.680]  it is Leonardo DiCaprio, they're all graduates, they tell you the world's ending in 2030 because
[53:54.680 --> 53:59.520]  they plan to trigger events to blame on the general public and global warming that lead
[53:59.520 --> 54:01.400]  to that depopulation.
[54:01.400 --> 54:03.440]  So that's why I'm so desperate to warn you about this.
[54:03.440 --> 54:08.480]  Now let's go back to 2004 in a short clip from one of my documentaries where we run
[54:08.480 --> 54:15.000]  into David Gergen on the streets of New York at the RNC and bring up Skull and Bones and
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.760]  Bohemian Grove that is the sexual side of this and that binds them together in the cult.
[54:20.760 --> 54:25.600]  So here's a few minutes from 9-1-1 Marshall Law and then we'll go back to Owen Schroer
[54:25.600 --> 54:28.880]  in my broadcast and I hope you research all this yourself and share it.
[54:28.880 --> 54:35.680]  While in New York, we ran into the Karl Rove of four administrations, David Gergen, top
[54:35.680 --> 54:43.160]  presidential adviser to Ford, Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Bill Clinton.
[54:43.160 --> 54:48.080]  We're talking to David Gergen and he has advised several presidents and of course has written
[54:48.080 --> 54:52.800]  quite a few books and is a, I would call you a political pundit or researcher?
[54:52.800 --> 54:55.480]  Commentary and over the hill, whatever.
[54:55.480 --> 54:56.480]  What do you think of this circus?
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.240]  Well, I haven't seen all the protests yet but I've never seen as much security for
[55:00.240 --> 55:01.920]  a convention as we have here.
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.800]  There's been a lot of news articles and reports saying that there's a height and risk of terror
[55:06.800 --> 55:07.800]  attacks.
[55:07.800 --> 55:10.280]  Do you think that that's, do you think there's a chance of that or?
[55:10.280 --> 55:14.600]  Yeah, I think it's very real danger and you've got the Madison Square Garden is sitting
[55:14.600 --> 55:20.200]  right basically on top of a train station and Boston Convention was right on top of
[55:20.200 --> 55:21.200]  a train station.
[55:21.200 --> 55:25.560]  Yeah, I just have to remember the trains are very accessible, vulnerable.
[55:25.560 --> 55:26.560]  One last question.
[55:26.560 --> 55:31.880]  I read a Washington Times article many years ago where you had a comment about the organization
[55:31.880 --> 55:35.200]  and then now it's been in the Wall Street Journal, it's been in a lot of different newspapers
[55:35.200 --> 55:37.120]  and that's the Bohemian Grove.
[55:37.120 --> 55:44.080]  And back in what was it, 1996 when you joined as a Clinton advisor, the Republicans were
[55:44.080 --> 55:45.080]  criticizing you.
[55:45.080 --> 55:47.800]  Oh, what about Bohemian Grove and then you countered them by saying, hey, I don't run
[55:47.800 --> 55:48.800]  around in the woods naked.
[55:48.800 --> 55:49.800]  What did that mean?
[55:49.800 --> 55:52.320]  I don't know what quote, I don't know what quote you're referring to.
[55:52.320 --> 55:54.760]  I'm not aware of any quote like that.
[55:54.760 --> 56:00.000]  Listen, I am a happy member of the Bohemian Grove.
[56:00.000 --> 56:06.880]  I like the folks who come there and it's really inappropriate for me to talk about the group
[56:06.880 --> 56:07.880]  beyond that.
[56:07.880 --> 56:08.880]  Thank you.
[56:08.880 --> 56:12.680]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of care?
[56:12.680 --> 56:17.880]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[56:17.880 --> 56:33.400]  Well, I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
[56:33.400 --> 56:36.880]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video and spent on national TV.
[56:36.880 --> 56:38.880]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[56:38.880 --> 56:39.880]  You do?
[56:39.880 --> 56:40.880]  I do.
[56:40.880 --> 56:41.880]  But it's a lot of big public officials going in there.
[56:41.880 --> 56:42.880]  Don't we deserve to know?
[56:42.880 --> 56:45.880]  You took, I don't know anything about you and I don't know anything about your film.
[56:45.880 --> 56:49.160]  But if you go in there with an understanding, you violated that understanding by releasing
[56:49.160 --> 56:50.880]  that film and I don't respect you for that.
[56:50.880 --> 56:51.880]  Really?
[56:51.880 --> 56:52.880]  But we have public officials in the public office?
[56:52.880 --> 56:53.880]  I'm sorry.
[56:53.880 --> 56:56.880]  You took an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film.
[56:56.880 --> 56:58.400]  Did you have an understanding when you went in there?
[56:58.400 --> 56:59.400]  No.
[56:59.400 --> 57:00.400]  Did you crash it?
[57:00.400 --> 57:01.400]  Yes.
[57:01.400 --> 57:02.400]  Yeah, and it has no trespassing signs there too, doesn't it?
[57:02.400 --> 57:03.400]  No, they put them up after.
[57:03.400 --> 57:04.400]  I just walked in.
[57:04.400 --> 57:05.400]  I'm sorry, sir.
[57:05.400 --> 57:06.400]  I've been there before.
[57:06.400 --> 57:10.480]  I know what the circumstances are and I'm sorry you violated the understandings.
[57:10.480 --> 57:11.880]  That was not a gentlemanly thing to do.
[57:11.880 --> 57:12.880]  But what about the ritual?
[57:12.880 --> 57:13.880]  Is the ritual gentlemanly?
[57:13.880 --> 57:26.440]  Sir, everything, I don't owe you this comment.
[57:26.440 --> 57:30.880]  You have, this is what's called ambush journalism and I disrespect you for that as well, so
[57:30.880 --> 57:31.880]  thank you and goodbye.
[57:31.880 --> 57:32.880]  Have you ever gotten the ritual?
[57:32.880 --> 57:34.880]  That's none of your damn business.
[57:34.880 --> 57:35.880]  Oh.
[57:35.880 --> 57:36.880]  All right.
[57:36.880 --> 57:43.720]  Listen, listen, you go around and make understandings with people and violate them.
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.840]  You ambush people on the streets when that's an inappropriate form of journalism.
[57:47.840 --> 57:49.640]  If you wish to practice that.
[57:49.640 --> 57:53.080]  And for warriors, if you're like me, you've been a long-time listener of this program
[57:53.080 --> 57:56.000]  and you've fed up with everything going on in the world.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.680]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning and something needs to change.
[58:00.680 --> 58:05.960]  And yet, we feel helpless, almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created
[58:05.960 --> 58:06.960]  for us.
[58:06.960 --> 58:09.480]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[58:09.480 --> 58:11.760]  Race at Wars is a game changer.
[58:11.760 --> 58:16.880]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[58:16.880 --> 58:22.240]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy, and makes us depressed
[58:22.240 --> 58:25.000]  and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.680]  When they feel their lie-cheat-steal plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an awakening.
[58:30.680 --> 58:37.040]  Race at Wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep-rooted
[58:37.040 --> 58:40.160]  psychological tactics that were being used against me.
[58:40.160 --> 58:41.720]  And now, I'm not scared anymore.
[58:41.720 --> 58:44.040]  I have to say, I was blown away.
[58:44.040 --> 58:47.240]  I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[58:47.240 --> 58:50.080]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together.
[58:50.080 --> 58:51.520]  You're absolutely right.
[58:51.520 --> 58:53.880]  We are reflections of God.
[58:53.880 --> 58:55.200]  We are emanations of that.
[58:55.200 --> 59:00.280]  And we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this life.
[59:00.280 --> 59:04.600]  Romans 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[59:04.600 --> 59:05.800]  And that's a process.
[59:05.800 --> 59:08.880]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[59:08.880 --> 59:11.960]  When people go through their day and don't think about many things, you can drive along
[59:11.960 --> 59:14.880]  a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[59:14.880 --> 59:20.560]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to reprogram
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.280]  that subconscious mind.
[59:22.280 --> 59:26.800]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind, because there's a war on for our
[59:26.800 --> 59:27.800]  mind.
[59:27.800 --> 59:28.800]  He's exactly right.
[59:28.800 --> 59:33.200]  And he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening.
[59:33.200 --> 59:38.200]  And I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com.
[59:38.200 --> 59:40.200]  That's where your journey begins.
[1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:22.720]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show, and we are watching the response to the announcement
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:29.560]  of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer's retirement.
[1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:32.400]  And I think that it symbolizes a couple things.
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:38.320]  That, well, people think that there was some political pressure from the Democrat party
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:47.120]  to get Breyer to retire, or he was just dealing with it all and didn't want to be the subject
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:52.120]  of discussion or expected to pull the Democrat line with some of these big decisions coming
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:54.520]  up.
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:01:02.800]  But it also could mean that if there was some political pressure or some conversations behind
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:10.440]  the scenes, the Democrats are expecting to lose the Senate in the midterms, and so they
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:15.400]  had to make this process happen now.
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:22.480]  But after all the attacking of cinema and mansion, are they even going to have the votes?
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:25.080]  And then what is their play going to be?
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:30.120]  Are they going to put a transgender individual on the Supreme Court just to say you're transphobic
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:35.560]  if you don't vote for this person and then use the media to run that narrative?
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:41.800]  The most interesting, and I think as insane as this sounds, but the best political strategy
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:44.920]  for the Democrats right now would actually, and I don't even know what the president,
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:52.560]  if there is one, if it's ever been done, would be to nominate Kamala Harris because that would
[1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:57.240]  get her out of the way because they don't want her as vice president.
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:59.400]  They're done with her.
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:05.480]  They looked at her as just a token to get Biden over the edge, but now that he's in
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:11.240]  there and falling apart and they don't want Harris involved, you know, oh, well, you can
[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:15.280]  still feel important and be a part of things on the Supreme Court and then we get you out
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:18.960]  of the way in the vice president's seat and you don't have to be around us all day long
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:19.960]  anymore.
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:25.240]  Now, I think the odds of that are pretty slim, but these are some of the things that are
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:34.480]  being discussed as the news dropped just a few hours ago.
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:39.120]  So we'll obviously be watching that closely along with everybody else.
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:44.920]  Now there is a developing situation happening in Wisconsin right now and I don't know how
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:48.000]  this hasn't made bigger news.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:55.400]  In fact, guys, do me a favor because when I looked last night, because that's when the
[1:02:55.400 --> 1:03:03.040]  story was published on the Gateway Pundit, Wisconsin Assembly votes to advance Representative
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:07.400]  Ratham's resolution to reclaim Wisconsin electors for president and vice president that were
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:12.640]  certified under fraudulent purposes, Wisconsin Assembly sends election shockwaves by voting
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:17.400]  to withdraw 10 Biden electors.
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:23.040]  Now when this broke last night, nobody else was covering it.
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:27.000]  I couldn't find anything on cable news as I was flipping through the channels to see
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.160]  if they'd mention it.
[1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:33.080]  I didn't see really anything online of anybody covering this.
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:38.960]  I mean that's kind of a huge story.
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:41.080]  Why wouldn't that make bigger news?
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:44.480]  Well, I guess it's pretty obvious why.
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:50.880]  If the state of Wisconsin realizes that it was fraudulent votes that put Biden over the
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:57.280]  top and retracts their electors, well then that might be a domino effect that could lead
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:08.400]  to Pennsylvania or Michigan or Georgia or Arizona doing the same thing.
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:09.960]  And they don't want that news out there.
[1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:16.880]  They don't want the American people to know how rigged this last election was.
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:18.000]  What was it, Democrats?
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.200]  You can't have your cake and eat it too.
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:25.040]  Is it worse voter suppression ever keeping Democrats from voting like you claim?
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:28.120]  Or did Biden have 81 million votes, the most votes of all time?
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:30.640]  Which is it?
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:31.640]  Which is it?
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:38.800]  But because we only have one member of the media that's not a Democrat sent to the White
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:45.440]  House to protect Biden, that would be Peter Ducey, the Democrats will never have to answer
[1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:50.560]  these questions and they'll always get to have their cake and eat it too because the
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:53.880]  media is on their team.
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:59.920]  Team Destroy America, Team Democrat.

[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:24.960]  Welcome back to another special edition of the Alex Jones Show, I'm Alex Jones your
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:29.520]  host, I'm sure you're sitting and doing a fabulous job is about to take over here in
[1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:34.960]  just a moment but going through the different stacks of incredible stories that are on Infowars
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:40.000] .com, I wanted to go back to one from a few days ago that didn't really get the attention
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:46.200]  it needs, it's a real chink in the armor of the lie factory that is the corporate media
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:52.640]  and it's a Paul Joseph Watson article from Infowars.com, Broadcaster issued warning after
[1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:59.760]  falsely claiming 90% of COVID patients were unvaccinated.
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:04.920]  Now remember how Fauci likes to go around and say that 99% of the deaths are unvaccinated,
[1:07:04.920 --> 1:07:08.280]  he's insane for over a year, it's total lie.
[1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:13.680]  Remember how you'll see the headline everywhere, oh that you're 30 times or 29 times less likely
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:18.720]  to be hospitalized if you're vaccinated or fully vaccinated and then when you try to
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:22.960]  find where those numbers actually come from, they're either fake studies that have now
[1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:28.600]  been reversed or debunked or pulled or it's completely pulled out of thin air.
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:34.920]  Well, you see Bill Gates and his organizations and basically every other major corporate
[1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:40.160]  outfit as its own fact checking group that runs around trying to police the internet,
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:45.360]  to police your YouTube account or your Twitter account or your Facebook account and they'll
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:50.200]  twist the meanings of what you said to try to get you suspended or banned.
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:55.960]  But in the UK they actually have a watchdog government group that actually targets disinformation
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:08:01.320]  and blatant lies on television and as of late with the public filing complaints, it hasn't
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:09.880]  been the vaccine skeptic doctors and others that have been the ones getting warnings
[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:14.920]  and getting told to stop lying, no it's been the corporate media.
[1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:22.720]  Here it is, broadcaster issued warning after falsely claiming 90% of COVID patients were
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:31.080]  unvaccinated, British broadcaster ITV was issued a warning by regulator Offcom after
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:37.400]  a guest and a presenter on the TV show, they've done this before, falsely claimed that 90%
[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:40.720]  of COVID hospital patients were unvaccinated.
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:42.160]  That's the big pharma lie.
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:48.160]  I bet you money if they got SWAT teamed, their computers have got money from Pfizer that they've
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:51.560]  got the emails giving them the talking points for money.
[1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:59.280]  The spurious remarks were made by Dr. Hillary Jones and Lorraine Kelly during a segment
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:03.560]  on the Lorraine show.
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:09.000]  Those people who haven't been vaccinated, we'd really love to think again and be vaccinated
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:15.560]  because 90% of people in the hospital are unvaccinated right now with COVID said Dr.
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:16.560]  Jones.
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:21.080]  That's the figure we have to really concentrate on, you mean the lie.
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:28.400]  90% of people in the hospital have not been vaccinated, Kelly repeated, and it goes on
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:29.600]  from that.
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:35.360]  But it wasn't true, the real number was 36% were the unvaccinated in the hospital from
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:38.800]  the government's own numbers, 4,000 plus complaints.
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:43.600]  This is how we get back on the offense against these liars with the science, with the facts,
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:45.100]  with the reality.
[1:09:45.100 --> 1:09:49.520]  Everybody should go to infoworks.com and get this article and share it and remind people
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:55.000]  that if that's a proven lie, well Fauci's 99% is even a bigger proven lie, isn't it?
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.920]  And let people know they've been lied to and to stop loving the lies and stop loving
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:00.920]  the fraud.
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:03.320]  The vaccine doesn't work to protect you from COVID.
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:06.680]  The people that made the vaccine are the people that created COVID.
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:08.040]  They need to go to prison.
[1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:10.280]  This is their great reset plan to take over.
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:13.720]  All right, back to Owen Schroer on the live broadcast.
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:17.480]  Please also take this clip from the show, everybody, and share it because this is serious
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:18.480]  information.
[1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:20.600]  And we've caught them red-handed yet again.
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:22.720]  All right, Alex, thank you.
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:29.640]  We're back here live in studio now.
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:38.120]  And just to kind of pick it back up where I left off here, discussing the Wisconsin Assembly
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:48.400]  voting to withdraw the 10 Biden electors, basically voting to nullify the victory
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:54.000]  for Biden in Wisconsin, the privilege resolution to withdraw the Biden electors will now proceed
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:01.600]  to the Wisconsin Rules Committee in the Wisconsin Assembly and to the Wisconsin Senate.
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:07.080]  The legislation was introduced by Representative Timothy Ram Thun.
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:10.200]  So it's still obviously got hurdles.
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:15.440]  And I'm not getting my hopes up, but it is interesting.
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:16.440]  It is interesting indeed.
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:23.200]  And when Democrats deny the results of the election, which every time they lose in the
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:29.800]  21st century, they have, every time a Democrat has lost in the 21st century, they claim it
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:37.200]  was a false result, whether it was Al Gore or Hillary Clinton.
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:42.920]  We all remember, but they never had this much actual activity, this much actual political
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:49.400]  activity and proof or anything when it comes to their denials of the results, like we've
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:54.760]  seen with the 2020 election.
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:57.520]  But we'll see if that goes anywhere.
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:11:59.520]  Speaking of, we'll see if it goes anywhere.
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:08.360]  You know, there were huge, you can call it huge, I mean, I guess it just depends, revelations
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:14.720]  in the Durham investigation that came out yesterday.
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:18.760]  Here's a story that got published this morning covering it at the Gateway Pundit.
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:24.000]  Latest actions by Durham indicate a broken investigation by a broken DOJ.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:32.200]  And you know, I try to wrap my head around all of the stuff that came out and you follow
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:39.440]  good accounts like Technofog that does good reporting on this from a legal perspective.
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.360]  And there were a lot of others that were reporting on this yesterday, but it really all just
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:45.480]  comes down to the same thing.
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:48.800]  We all know Obama was illegally spying on Trump.
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:55.720]  We all know that Hillary Clinton was using foreign intelligence assets to fabricate evidence
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:59.920]  against Donald Trump leading up to the 2016 election.
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:04.200]  And they've basically been caught red-handed and Durham is kind of in a wild goose chase
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:05.960]  of who done it.
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:09.000]  And everybody's pointing the finger at the next guy saying, I don't know what's going
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  on.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And so with every hurdle, every pointed finger, Durham just gets deeper and deeper into this
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:23.760]  rabbit hole that is capturing more and more people and evidence in this conspiracy that
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:28.880]  it was really Hillary Clinton and her campaign and the Democrat Party that were running leading
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:36.080]  up to the 2016 election to spy on Donald Trump and to lie about Donald Trump so that Hillary
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:38.320]  Clinton could win.
[1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:44.560]  And the problem that I have is I just don't even want to waste my time or my energy trying
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:50.560]  to dig into it anymore because it's just it's everybody knows what happened.
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:55.320]  And so you can sit here and look at the names and look at the different sectors of the government
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:59.320]  and the bank accounts and everything that's getting exposed right now, but it's like,
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:03.240]  you know, this is seven years too late.
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:07.680]  And nobody really cares anymore, quite frankly.
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:10.760]  Something should have been done about this years ago.
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:15.860]  Something should have been done about this when Trump was in office and nothing was done.
[1:14:15.860 --> 1:14:21.360]  And so I'm supposed to get excited or hyped up because Durham now seems to be actually
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:25.400]  getting concrete evidence of all the crimes that we knew already happened.
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:30.600]  And then I'm supposed to expect there to be legal action taken against these criminals.
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:31.600]  Sorry.
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:32.600]  Sorry.
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:38.360]  I just do not have the excitement levels there.
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:45.760]  Here's a zero hedge old headline arrest of steel dossier source a seismic development.
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:47.360]  Was it though back in November?
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:48.360]  Was it really seismic?
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:49.360]  Did you feel it?
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:51.600]  Did anyone else feel it?
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:53.720]  Not really.
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:55.520]  I mean, it's, it's, it's crazy.
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:58.600]  I mean, we have the bank accounts now.
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:14:59.600]  We have the names.
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:01.600]  We've got all of it.
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:04.000]  Durham is a lot of this information is getting out.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:07.280]  I don't know if it's coming straight from Durham's office or just they're reporting it
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:14.080]  to media or what, but I don't think anything will happen.
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:15.240]  Nothing will happen to Hillary.
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:16.980]  Nothing will happen to the Democrats involved.
[1:15:16.980 --> 1:15:19.040]  Nothing will happen to the banks involved.
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:23.800]  Nothing will happen to the foreign intelligence involved, except maybe one or two arrests
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:28.000]  or prosecutions here or there, just because of all the money that was spent.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.680]  That's how this goes.
[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:35.680]  But I don't know, it just feels the same as, Hey, look at all these states and all these
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:43.280]  special assemblies and committees that are saying we need to retract the, the victories
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:44.480]  for Biden in our states.
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:45.480]  They were done fraudulently.
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:46.480]  Well, okay.
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:47.480]  It's too late.
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:48.840]  Nothing's going to happen.
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:51.480]  Same thing with the Hillary corruption from the 2016 election.
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.600]  It's just, it's just too late.
[1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:54.600]  Yeah.
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:55.600]  Criminals are going to get away.
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:59.400]  It's what happens in this country.
[1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:03.640]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:06.280]  both at home and the world at large.
[1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:11.440]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep

[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.040]  a healthier life.
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:09.880]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:11.520]  that contains both.

[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:18.080]  from the InfowarsStore.
[1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:22.880]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:25.600]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:30.440]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:35.120]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:36.120]  shown.
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:40.440]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:45.000]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:50.120]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:51.120]  like here in America.
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:55.960]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com where we promise
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:57.960]  our rose hips don't lie.
[1:17:57.960 --> 1:18:02.560]  Well I am very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:03.560]  back in stock.
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:09.040]  Whole food, multivitamin, essential nutrient multivitamin from natural healthy sources not
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:15.400]  synthetic and vitamin C and zinc rose hips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel Prize winning
[1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:18.840]  formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your body.
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:24.760]  They are both back in stock sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:29.640]  Another reason I am very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep us
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:30.640]  on air.
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:38.120]  So again it is a 360 win but whatever you do go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:42.800]  and take vitamin C and take zinc and we also have some great vitamin D products at InfowarsStore.com
[1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:43.800]  as well.
[1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:48.760]  But whatever you do defend your body's immune system, we want to keep patriots in the game
[1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:49.760]  against the new world order.
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:54.080]  So it is a 360 win, it is something essential for your body and your health and your longevity
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:58.320]  and your immune system while funding the InfowarsStore.com.
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:18:59.640]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:01.600]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:02.600]  Welcome.
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:03.600]  Hello Alex.
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:04.600]  Yes Malcolm.
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:07.080]  Alright I will make this quick and real short where the other patriots can get on the
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:08.080]  line.
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:13.720]  Alex I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMailVialpiality
[1:19:13.720 --> 1:19:15.320]  and Brainforce Plus.
[1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:18.000]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  SuperMailVialpiality really really works, it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:29.160]  that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:31.400]  that also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:35.800]  This is like a very fine wine, in fact each batch is different.
[1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:38.880]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay, people are like why are you selling
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:41.320]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong.
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:43.840]  That's just how it is, it's how it works.
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:48.440]  So it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want
[1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:59.280]  the Rolls Royce at a decent price then this is it.
[1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:15.760]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:19.040]  Ladies and gentlemen we're back here live on the Alex Jones show, Owen Schreuer sitting
[1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:20.360]  in for Alex.
[1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:27.000]  We are joined now by Dr. Paul Isaacs, part of the Delaware Medical Freedom Alliance,
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:35.840]  DelawareMFA.org and they have an event coming up tomorrow night, we want to help share the
[1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:42.120]  Medical Freedom Rally happening tomorrow night at Bay Health, Dover, Delaware, 604 South
[1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:50.400]  State Street, this is happening at 5 p.m. tomorrow evening and they are going to be
[1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:53.920]  talking about and raising awareness for the fact that medical professionals are getting
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:59.960]  fired because they don't want to take the COVID vaccine and they are also warning people
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:05.480]  of the negative side effects of the vaccine, where there is risk there must be choice.
[1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:07.840]  Dr. Paul Isaacs joins me now.
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:15.960]  You know it's ironic but sad doctor that we saw the same people praising the front line
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:22.920]  workers in the medical field whether it was doctors or nurses in the response to COVID,
[1:21:22.920 --> 1:21:26.600]  how great they were, they were the heroes and then just one year after that if they
[1:21:26.600 --> 1:21:30.520]  don't take the vaccine they are the zeros, it's amazing how that happened so quickly
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:31.520]  isn't it?
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:36.360]  It is and it does not make sense.
[1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:39.840]  Well it only makes sense when you accept the people we're dealing with are evil, I don't
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:43.360]  know if you've reached that full conclusion yet but that's where I stand.
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:49.440]  But let's talk about tomorrow's event, getting people out there to be active that don't want
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:51.640]  to be a part of this medical tyranny.
[1:21:51.640 --> 1:21:55.400]  So talk about tomorrow's event, what it's going to be like and where people can go to
[1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:59.600]  find information if they want to join you there in Dover, Delaware.
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:04.480]  Well, it's the first time I've seen the fire, I wasn't sure that I was going to be talking
[1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:06.160]  about that per se.
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:10.680]  I believe it's across from the hospital, it's down on hospital property.
[1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:20.240]  It's on the sidewalk in front of I think it's Holy Cross Church on the road between the
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:27.080]  two buildings, between the hospital and the church so it's down on hospital property.
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:31.720]  And of course this is going to be a peaceful legal lawful rally, we always have to add
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.600]  those in because we know how provocateurs like to set people up so no this is obviously
[1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:42.320]  peaceful legally and lawful but you know let's say so you're going to be, if you're out there
[1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:45.600]  and you're a part of this, what are the big issues for you right now, what are the issues
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:51.920]  you see with COVID, what are the issues you see with the vaccines?
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:57.920]  We're forcing people to take something as a requirement to work which is not fully tested
[1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:02.640]  and the results that are coming through for a lot of people is that they're getting injured
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:04.480]  because of it.
[1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:10.480]  If you are going to get, can get COVID which CDC has admitted and I've seen it, if people
[1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:17.880]  can get COVID even though they've had a vaccination and they can receive it and pass it on, if
[1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:25.520]  they can get infected and transmit it both, I don't know why it has to be mandated and
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:32.240]  why I who have survived 20 months in the fire here would have to get the shot to continue
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:34.040]  being with people.
[1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:40.640]  If I have survived, it makes sense that my immunity is respectable and it should help
[1:23:40.640 --> 1:23:47.760]  me not get seriously sick myself but even if I don't have the vaccine, how can I be
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:54.280]  more dangerous or infectious or more able to give it to somebody else, those that have
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:24:00.040]  the shots are passing it to others, that does not prevent people from getting it.
[1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:06.920]  I'm saying people in the community, I have people that are relatives of mine and church
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:11.680]  folks, relatives of church folks and people I know in the state that I run into all the
[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:16.880]  time that have had it and survived even though they've had the shots or their family members
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:21.760]  have died after they've had the shots and to me the issue is people are not being fully
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:28.280]  informed about the hazard of the shot and how it does not prevent you from getting it.
[1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:33.320]  On the average flu season my understanding is the death rate is about 1% and COVID is
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:38.400]  no more than that and children, I'm concerned about children because children have a death
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:47.960]  rate according to people like Ben Carson about.024% which means that only a quarter
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:53.000]  of one child will die, they get it, why are we mandating them getting shots that could
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.400]  damage them 10, 20 years down the road.
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:00.880]  It does not make sense to me, bureaucracy is too powerful right now, the government
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:06.120]  is too powerful, people's rights are being banned, the fact is that we should, according
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:11.680]  to First Amendment, have the right to say no when it comes to our own own body and we
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:17.360]  should have the right to say what we allow to contaminate the tarantacle of God who lives
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:18.360]  in us.
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:22.120]  I believe we're all made in the image of God and I believe that when we put our faith
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:27.280]  in Him, we receive His Holy Spirit, we are His temple as a blank place and 1 Corinthians
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:32.960]  3 and 1 Corinthians 6 both say that people are going to answer for damaging or destroying
[1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:37.880]  that temple and I'm not willing to voluntarily surrender my temple to other people to abuse
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:46.240]  for any reason, so to me the issues are if I have faith and I have a right to live according
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:53.440]  to our constitution, I have a right to agree to what I participate in faith-wise or not.
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:57.360]  Congress is not allowed, the government is not allowed, the administration is not allowed
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:03.840]  to mandate what my faith is and yet people's faith are being rejected if they do not agree
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:10.560]  to the status and to the mandate of getting a shot, that doesn't make sense to me.
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:18.240]  So let's talk about that, doctors or anybody for that matter that have real medical exemptions
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.440]  is just one angle of it, that have real medical exemptions that can't get the vaccine are
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:27.840]  now losing their jobs because of that.
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:30.200]  Correct.
[1:26:30.200 --> 1:26:35.680]  For instance, I've been injured because of a flu shot and I have a brain shot, two of
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:36.680]  them.
[1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:39.080]  One works, one doesn't.
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:43.480]  I've been diagnosed with a brain tumor, well why should I take a shot that could further
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:49.600]  damage my ability to think and function, provide for my family and have ministry with people?
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:51.960]  It should be my right to say no.
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:56.840]  I should not have to take a shot out of fear that I won't have income and therefore risk
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:26:59.480]  my sanity, my livelihood.
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:04.880]  My brain and my body have already been damaged by the brain surgeries and by the flu shots
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:08.560]  so why would I make myself more vulnerable?
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:13.960]  I believe there should be people of faith that are allowed to serve with their faith,
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:20.040]  with whatever immunity they have and I'm willing to take the risk to get sick myself but I
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:24.320]  can't be more dangerous to others when those that have the shots have been proven to be
[1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:27.240]  guilty of passing it as well.
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:32.600]  I know people that have had both shots and a booster and had the flu shot and died.
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:34.320]  It does not prevent death.
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:36.680]  I don't care what story is being passed around.
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:39.760]  I've seen too much of the opposite.
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:41.240]  And there's a similar situation.
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:48.600]  An individual in Boston who is on a heart transplant list, he's now been removed from
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:54.440]  the heart transplant list because he is not vaccinated, he hasn't gotten the COVID vaccine.
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:59.560]  The problem is, his doctors tell him if you get this vaccine, you're going to die.
[1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:01.440]  Your heart's going to fail.
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.480]  So literally if he gets the vaccine, he dies but because he won't get the vaccine, he's
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:08.080]  going to die because he can't have the heart transplant.
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:17.120]  I mean that's basically medical induced prescribed death.
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:21.640]  Which again, makes you question what the motives are.
[1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:28.040]  Are people, is population being limited or controlled because of this?
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:29.560]  Well that's what I want to get with you.
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:34.800]  We're going to take a break here and the other side, when you look at all this and you're
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:40.680]  in the crosshairs of it now too, not wanting to get a vaccine that's going to do harm to
[1:28:40.680 --> 1:28:45.480]  you and is not going to do anything good for you or others around you, what conclusions
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:46.480]  have you reached?
[1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:47.480]  What are the motives?
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:49.920]  What do you think is really going on here?
[1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:54.960]  We are with Pastor Paul Isaacs here on the Alex Jones show, we'll answer these questions
[1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:55.960]  on the other side.
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:10.680]  It really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily
[1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:16.280]  go across political lines or religious lines but about all of us as a human species coming
[1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:17.280]  together.
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:22.680]  I'm a combat veteran and I mean that brought me close to God but what Alex goes through
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:24.000]  brought me even closer.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:28.880]  I can feel God in my life now, the viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously
[1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:34.560]  programmed into your brain and how to erase those programs and install new.
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:39.160]  Reset Wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular Info Wars broadcasts.
[1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:44.120]  It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious
[1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:45.400]  and self-determined life.
[1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:48.760]  If you're on the fence about Reset Wars, it's time to get off the fence.
[1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:59.160]  Join Reset Wars today.
[1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:03.960]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[1:30:03.960 --> 1:30:09.760]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[1:30:09.760 --> 1:30:10.760]  Domestic Terrorists.
[1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:14.760]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:17.760]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:21.000]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:24.840]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[1:30:24.840 --> 1:30:29.960]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the
[1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:36.440]  traitors know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:37.440]  So be it.
[1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:40.360]  Make them silence us by force.
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:43.440]  This is the final battle of the Information War.

[1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:51.880]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[1:30:51.880 --> 1:30:55.720]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:01.800]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:06.080]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:11.240]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:13.800]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:17.520]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that the media calls communists, but really
[1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:18.520]  they're just a commune.
[1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:21.600]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it.
[1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:23.800]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:27.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.200]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:32.560]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:35.080]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:38.480]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:44.080]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:31:44.080 --> 1:31:45.080]  We had like that.
[1:31:45.080 --> 1:31:46.560]  Do you want to believe it?
[1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:51.200]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:57.800]  And if you don't fund us, you don't want to see it, that's fine.
[1:31:57.800 --> 1:32:06.840]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:11.840]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:12.840]  in place.
[1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:18.280]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:23.840]  It is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:26.640]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:32:26.640 --> 1:32:34.880]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:41.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now, the entire future destiny of humanity
[1:32:41.240 --> 1:32:42.240]  is upon us.
[1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:46.200]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:32:46.200 --> 1:32:49.040]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[1:32:49.040 --> 1:32:51.200]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:54.560]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[1:32:54.560 --> 1:32:59.760]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:32:59.760 --> 1:33:22.360]  Seeing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:28.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:31.720]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:38.160]  Again, we're with Dr. Paul Isaacs and he's been a staff chaplain at Bay Health Hospital
[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:39.960]  in Delaware for seven years.
[1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:44.520]  He's been a pastor in the area for over 12 years.
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:49.120]  He's had a vaccine injury in his past.
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:56.960]  He cannot take another vaccine, but because he's not taking the ineffective deadly vaccine,
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:58.800]  he can no longer do his work at the hospital.
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:01.800]  He's one example of so many others.
[1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:09.200]  And so, Dr., going through all of this, the madness, the hysteria, the nonsense, the illogic,
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:15.760]  I mean, what conclusions are you reaching or what is kind of scrambling throughout your
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:18.160]  head trying to make sense of all of this?
[1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:23.040]  Well, I see it as government overreach.
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:28.880]  I see it as power of bureaucracy, denying people their faith, overruling the right to
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:33.400]  have a relationship with God, trying to be God in their place.
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:37.720]  Anybody that curses on national TV claims to be an expert and takes the name of God
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:41.080]  in vain is saying they're God.
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:46.800]  We're facing idolatry, we're facing spiritual warfare, we're facing what I believe is the
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:53.440]  preparation for one world church, you're having people scared to death.
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:59.080]  When I hear from people that their doctors have told them, if they go to church, they
[1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:04.280]  can't be their doctor, that tells me people are making a choice between their physical
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:08.200]  limits and their spiritual life.
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:13.200]  And the body's more than physical and mental, it's also spiritual.
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:21.440]  We have been supported by Plain Tree, Plain Tree says that the spiritual dynamic is just
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:25.480]  as important as the mental and the physical, I believe.
[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:29.040]  And I've been arguing for that, trying to stand for that.
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:33.720]  And the spiritual dynamic that's related to the God I know found in the Bible that
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:44.120]  so many faiths believe in, like Judaism and Christianity and Islam and Mormons, they
[1:35:44.120 --> 1:35:47.880]  all say that they believe in the Old Testament or the Bible.
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:53.120]  And the principles that I'm standing on are foundational there, they're found there, and
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:58.080]  I could quote a bunch of scriptures to deal with that as I did on my letter of resignation,
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:06.720]  to tell me that as a chaplain and pastor and committed Christian for many years and a pastor
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:13.920]  for over 40, and I've worked in hospitals and the military for over 17 years as a chaplain,
[1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:20.760]  to tell me that my faith is invalid unless it lines up with some particular religion
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:25.400]  that the hospital is deemed acceptable to me, that's religious discrimination.
[1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:28.000]  So that's part of what's going on.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.960]  There's too much at stake here in terms of power ruling over people's lives.
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:38.600]  There's too much at stake here in terms of people making money, fortunes over the vaccine
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:41.960]  and forcing it on people is making somebody rich.
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:47.040]  At the same time, we're risking, we're making people getting pigs to risk their health,
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:49.760]  their sanity, their future.
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:52.280]  People are being scared, they're overwhelmed.
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:58.440]  And I'm wondering sometimes if it's their reaction to fear is not contributed to because
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:00.320]  of what's in the vaccine.
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:05.160]  I found after I had the flu vaccine, the game of bills policy that I'm still struggling
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:10.440]  with three and a half months later, that I couldn't think as well in effect of my mind,
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:15.720]  not just my face and my mouth and my bills to speak, and my smile was never great, but
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:20.280]  now my smile is crooked, and it's just that there's something else in these shots that
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:21.280]  we don't know.
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:24.600]  And we have a right to know, they're supposed to be Freedom of Information Act, they're
[1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:31.800]  supposed to be what you call limitations or side effects that are supposed to be posted
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:35.680]  in all medications we get, but we can't know what's in the shot.
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:41.400]  And I've done research in the labs and found out that fetal tissues in them, which I'm
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:46.320]  conscientiously opposed to putting in my body, if we're finding animal things are in there
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:50.160]  and I'm consciously opposed to putting that in my body, because our bodies are the temple
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:51.160]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:56.040]  And we should not have to surrender to a government that tells us, we're going to give you something,
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:37:59.320]  we say it's for your good, but don't expect us to prove it.
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:05.360]  And just Pfizer doesn't have to give evidence, they're fighting giving evidence of what results
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:08.000]  have come from their testing and from the shots.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  People need to go to VAERS and find out the number of injuries, thousands of injuries,
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.760]  thousands of deaths, I'm sorry, over 200,000 injuries.
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:23.360]  People have had permanent disabilities, people have gotten things like diabetes and dementia
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:29.480]  and had been permanently disabled, thank you for putting VAERS up.
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:36.560]  The results are astonishing, my understanding when they had testing for the AIDS, when I
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:42.560]  was in Alabama in the 90s, they had testing for the AIDS vaccine and when they had 20
[1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:46.760]  or 50 injuries, they quit giving it because it was too dangerous.
[1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:51.080]  And we're giving this to people and there's been over, last time I saw the VAERS reporters
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:53.400]  over 15,000 deaths.
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:59.040]  So don't tell me the shot is benign or it won't hurt you or it keeps you from dying
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:02.440]  because it's killing people, I've seen that.
[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:09.360]  If it doesn't prevent me from getting sick, I can get it and I can give it, what good
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:10.360]  is it?
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:12.080]  I'd rather walk by faith.
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:16.840]  My God's stronger than a shot, he can keep me alive, he can keep people who believe in
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:17.840]  him alive.
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:23.640]  Psalm 91 promises if we make the Lord our tabernacle, our hiding place, our dwelling place, if
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:29.080]  we hide under the shelter of him, he promises to keep us from the pestilence, from the epidemic,
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:30.080]  from the enemies.
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:35.400]  We're faced by, surrounded by enemies right now, we're trying to rob us of peace and control
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:41.560]  our lives and that's what's at stake and somebody's getting rich out of this and getting overwhelmed
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:46.120]  with their own power and sense of importance and they're trying to replace God.
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:50.080]  That's what Scripture tells me the Antichrist is, a replacement to God and that's what I
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:52.200]  believe is being laid as a foundation.
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:57.840]  Yeah, and you know, I've reached the philosophical conclusion that government is satanic and
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:04.200]  when you talk about a one world religion, well how would you even possibly bring something
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:05.200]  like that about?
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:07.440]  Well, this would be the perfect scenario.
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:13.120]  You make a virus in the lab, you release the so-called virus from the lab, it infects
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:17.220]  a lot of people, it kills some people, you hype it up in the media and then you basically
[1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:23.120]  have this overwhelming belief in people that, oh, I'm gonna die from this virus so I have
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:29.080]  to change my whole lifestyle, oh, now I gotta get this vaccine and then pharmaceutical companies
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:32.720]  or the concept of pharmacia becomes God.
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:35.920]  Oh, pharmaceutical has saved my life.
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:39.800]  You know, man-made medicine has saved my life and then what does that transfer to?
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:45.200]  Oh, they are God, they are the saviors and ultimately then replacing God, one world government,
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:49.520]  one world religion, praising pharmacia.
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:55.240]  In the early church, Justin Marner, who lived around the year 100, said the major enemy
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:41:01.000]  or threat to the church at that time was Asclepius, the God of healing and the symbol for the
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.240]  God of healing is a snake on a pole.
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:08.480]  Have you ever seen that in hospitals or physicians wearing it or nurses wearing it?
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:14.600]  There you go, Asclepius, God of healing, well, I follow the great position and he's greater
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:16.560]  than the God of healing.
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:24.200]  He's Jesus Christ, he raised the dead, he came back from the grave, his healing, his
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:31.000]  deliverance from sin and death is eternal, much better than anything the world can offer
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:32.240]  us.
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:38.040]  People are getting their focus off God and off the one who heals and delivers and saves
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:42.320]  and they're being told they have to follow man who can keep them alive.
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:47.880]  Well, man's doing a terrible job, so why are we trusting him?
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:52.440]  It really is such an evil thing that's being done with these vaccines and there doesn't
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:59.760]  seem to be any relenting, but you know, you're one example of thousands, sadly, of people
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:06.680]  whose lives are being severely altered or even ruined because of these vaccine mandates.
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:10.000]  I want to thank you for joining us today, Dr. Isaacs.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.640]  Anything else you want to say before we let you go?
[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:18.160]  Thank you for the privilege of trying to share the truth.
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:21.760]  Well we need more men like you standing up and speaking out, that's the only way to
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:26.200]  turn this thing around and that's why we're glad that you're doing it, we're glad that
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:30.320]  this event is happening in Delaware tomorrow, again, if folks in Delaware want to be out
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:37.560]  there, 5 p.m. tomorrow night across the street of the Bay Health Dover, Delaware Hospital
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:42.920]  there, it's obviously peaceful, legal, lawful, you can find more information at DelawareMFA.org
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:47.040]  and thank you for sharing your story with us today, Dr. Isaacs.
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:49.440]  You're very welcome, thank you.
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:55.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's just, you know, they want to humanize people, let's
[1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:57.160]  humanize Dr. Isaacs.
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:43:03.800]  Well here we are in the year 2022 and Info Wars is now more important than it's ever
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:05.600]  been, we are truly in the zeitgeist.
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:09.240]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air and I want to encourage you to take
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:15.360]  advantage of a true win-win situation or a 360 win as I've called it at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:19.560]  Get high quality supplements that make your body healthier, make you happier and that
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:23.800]  defend your body with your immune system against outside attackers.
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:27.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, multivitamins are the way to go but so many of them are synthetic.
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:32.480]  Our multivitamin whole food system is one of the best quality multivitamin systems you're
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:36.080]  going to find but regardless of whether you get it from us or somebody else research it's

[1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:02.840]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait until they've
[1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:08.480]  got their world ID and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:13.880]  And clout swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:19.000]  once they've gotten you with that system then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:23.960]  you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're going to decide when
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:29.240]  you can travel and when you can't travel and MasterCard and then all the other big companies
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:33.320]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:35.720]  you with a carbon tax for it.
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:39.320]  This is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen.
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:40.320]  This is the takeover.
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:42.880]  In humanity better wake up and say no.
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:44.320]  Finally folks are starting to wake up.
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:48.800]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others leave the charts along with InfoWars but it's not enough.
[1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:52.800]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalist
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:53.800]  to justice.
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:57.800]  You see they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:03.800]  Cobra Commander here was an important message to humanity.
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:11.800]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:15.800]  but the injection is not ready yet.
[1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:24.800]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:32.800]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:40.800]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies that only
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:45.800]  I own profitable.
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:50.800]  You will then be my slaves and then you get that special shot of freedom from Cobra.
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:56.800]  It will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:45:57.800]  lives.
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:46:01.800]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:06.800]  I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists.
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:11.800]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:15.800]  in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:19.800]  farmers that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:23.800]  the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:26.800]  Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:28.800]  been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:33.800]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:36.800]  want the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:39.800]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels literally.
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:44.800]  In fact I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:45.800]  We had one.
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:47.800]  You wouldn't believe it.
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:52.800]  Anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:59.800]  fund us and don't want to share that's fine.
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:05.800]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:35.800]  Alright we're going to get back into the news now.
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:39.800]  First ladies and gentlemen remember infowarstore.com that's how everything we do here is possible

[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:22.800]  And this is how we speak truth to power to stop a one world government from forming
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:29.800]  to stop the freedoms guaranteed to American citizens from evaporating.
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:31.800]  That's our goal here.
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:35.800]  All right, let's get back into the news though now.
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:37.800]  Boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:41.800]  Let's look at some of this madness coming out here with the vaccines.
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:43.800]  I mean, there's just so much of it.
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:45.800]  And the response to COVID.
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:53.800]  Socky trashes Governor DeSantis for continuing to push for monoclonal antibody treatments after FDA blocks life-saving medicine from the state.
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:50:01.800]  So remember, they blocked hydroxychloroquine and zinc, which saved lives.
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:04.800]  They tried to block ivermectin that saves lives.
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:08.800]  Now they're trying to block the monoclonal antibodies that saves lives.
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:11.800]  So it's literally a vaccine or death.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:20.800]  That's the official approach to COVID from our establishment and now our White House vaccine or death.
[1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:22.800]  There is nothing else.
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:27.800]  There's only vaccines and there's only death for you.
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:33.800]  And remember, this is our White House that wished us all dead just a month ago.
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:41.800]  Remember that saying for those that are unvaccinated, you're going to have a winter of pain and suffering and death.
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:44.800]  Well, I'm still here.
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:48.800]  So I guess your wishes of death upon me failed.
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:50.800]  Sorry, Joe Biden.
[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:51.800]  Sorry, Jen Socky.
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:55.800]  I know you'd like us all to be dead, but we're not.
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:51:08.800]  But boy, oh boy, how sick, how sick is our political leadership and our health bureaucracies?
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:16.800]  How sick are they that they're literally blocking and making life-saving medical treatments illegal?
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:19.800]  Why shouldn't you have the choice?
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:24.800]  What happened to Donald Trump's right to try act?
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:29.800]  Where if you're sick and you want to try something, you have the right to try medicine to save your life.
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:37.800]  But not with COVID, which they try to act like it's the most deadliest thing on earth, but not with COVID.
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:41.800]  I mean, how is this, it's like, you say, how do they get away with this?
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:43.800]  How can they be doing this?
[1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:46.800]  They're evil people.
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:50.800]  They're evil people, folks.
[1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:53.800]  Oh, I can't even, oh my gosh.
[1:51:53.800 --> 1:51:55.800]  I mean, you just look at Jen Socky.
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:59.800]  And you know, again, I've always kind of given Jen Socky the benefit of the doubt.
[1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:00.800]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:08.800]  You're the press secretary for the most corrupt political crime family, maybe in the history of this country in the Bidens.
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:16.800]  And you're supposed to somehow correct all the wrongs and the lies and the slurs and the stutters and the crapping of the pants of Joe Biden.
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:21.800]  Like, yeah, that's a tough job, but she has to come out there and lie to the American public all day.
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:26.800]  Just represent the hatred that this administration has for the American public all day.
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:32.800]  So yeah, we're going to look at Jen Socky as a face and a voice of total evil.
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:41.800]  But she chose the job, so you can't say that she didn't have a choice, because she did.
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:43.800]  She chose to be the voice of evil.
[1:52:43.800 --> 1:52:45.800]  She chose to be the face of evil.
[1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:49.800]  She likes it.
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:54.800]  I just can't even, that's what I'm saying is just, like, I need to move on and cover other news stories.
[1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:55.800]  But this is it.
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:57.800]  I mean, this is like checkmate.
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:03.800]  You sick bastards are stopping life-saving treatment.
[1:53:03.800 --> 1:53:08.800]  You sick freaks.
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:12.800]  And that's my problem is, I know I need to just cover the other news and just move on.
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:13.800]  I can't move on.
[1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:18.800]  You sick psychos are killing people.
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:25.800]  You sick freaks are killing people and smiling about it.
[1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:30.800]  And I'm just supposed to move on.
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:38.800]  Again, if you approach this from a universal logical perspective and took all of their words at face value,
[1:53:38.800 --> 1:53:41.800]  okay, COVID is so deadly, you're all going to die if you get it.
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:48.800]  Okay, well then, I have the right to try and you'd think you'd want to try anything and everything that might work.
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:51.800]  And if it works to save your life, well, why wouldn't you try it?
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:53.800]  Why wouldn't you go for it?
[1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:58.800]  But no, see, there's where the logic ends.
[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:01.800]  No, you can only take the vaccine or die.
[1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:02.800]  That's it.
[1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:04.800]  Ivermectin works, we ban it.
[1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:07.800]  Hydroxychloroquine and zinc works, we ban it.
[1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:11.800]  And all of these things are well known for years.
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:15.800]  Monoclonal antibiotic treatment works, they ban it.
[1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:20.800]  Boy, it's like they want you dead.
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:26.800]  So let me just move on from the news that our government wants us dead.
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:27.800]  That's fun.
[1:54:27.800 --> 1:54:32.800]  Let me just move on from the revelation that your government wants you to die.
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:33.800]  That's fun.
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:35.800]  But I just got to move on.
[1:54:35.800 --> 1:54:39.800]  It's not over. Experts say new Omicron strain could prolong pandemic.
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:41.800]  Oh, yes, there'll always be a new strain.
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:43.800]  There'll always be a new pandemic.
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:44.800]  It's never ending.
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:55.800]  In fact, there was another individual that said that your multiple generations into next centuries are going to be dealing with COVID.
[1:54:55.800 --> 1:54:56.800]  Wow, thanks Fauci.
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:58.800]  Thanks Peter Dossick.
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:03.800]  Thanks Chinese Communists for making the virus that apparently is going to be here forever, making us all slaves to the New World Order.
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:08.800]  Death, death or vaccine, which is really just death.
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:11.800]  It's really just death period because the vaccine is killing people too.
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:17.800]  Governor Hochel's mask mandate back in effect after New York state appellate judge grants emergency stay.
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:19.800]  So this is how it goes.
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:22.800]  A judge declares that it's illegal.
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:25.800]  You can't force people to take an experimental vaccine.
[1:55:25.800 --> 1:55:31.800]  You can't people to force people to wear a face covering that restricts their breathing.
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:33.800]  It's totally illegal. It's totally unconstitutional.
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:34.800]  So what do they do?
[1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:42.800]  They find a Democrat judge that puts it right back into place like the sick freaks that they are.
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:46.800]  Yeah, I want you to wear mask 24 seven.
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:55.800]  I want you to take a vaccine every month and I'm going to make you do it because I love you.
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:58.800]  Yeah, we love you.
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:04.800]  We're going to give you an experimental vaccine and we're going to lie about it too.
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:06.800]  We're going to make you wear that face mask.
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:10.800]  Yeah, it's because we love you.
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:12.800]  I love you so much.
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:15.800]  I'm just going to strangle you to death.
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:17.800]  I love you so much.
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:19.800]  I'm just going to poison you.
[1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:24.800]  I'm going to poison you and poison you and keep poisoning you until you die.
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:31.800]  And I'm going to find the judges that back me up and I'm going to find the members of the media that back me up.
[1:56:31.800 --> 1:56:39.800]  And we're all going to team up to kill you because we love you so much.
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:47.800]  And see, I like have to go into like a character mode and like force myself to change my voice and like the looks and the expressions on my face.
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:49.800]  That's what Kathy Hochle looks like 24 seven.
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:53.800]  I mean, she looks like a damn evil villain demon.
[1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:55.800]  Just like all of them like Pelosi.
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:57.800]  I mean, they look like what they are.
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:56:59.800]  Thank you, God.
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:07.800]  Thank you, Lord God above the creator for giving us the visual representation of what these people are.
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.800]  Man in Boston kicked off heart transplant list for not being vaccinated.
[1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:12.800]  But guess what?
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:21.800]  If he gets the vaccine, he'll die because he'll get myocarditis and everybody knows the vaccine is causing heart inflammation
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:23.800]  and all these different heart problems.
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:26.800]  And so they said, you get the vaccine that's going to kill you.
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:30.800]  But because you won't get the vaccine, you're going to have to die.
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  We love you.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:33.800]  Die.
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:34.800]  We love you.
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:35.800]  Die.
[1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:36.800]  We love you.
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:37.800]  Die.
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:42.800]  Government is satanic.
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:44.800]  Government is satanic.
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:55.800]  Government is satanic.
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:57:59.800]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to Reset Wars.
[1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  It's really powerful.
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:05.800]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:10.800]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex.
[1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:12.800]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:14.800]  I found it to be awesome.
[1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:15.800]  It was worth it to me.
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:22.800]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific trust.
[1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:24.800]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:31.800]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum of information and experiences
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is definitely afraid of.
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:39.800]  To think the way we are intended to think by God.
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:41.800]  That's what this series is about.
[1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:48.800]  Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated my hope.
[1:58:48.800 --> 1:58:52.800]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:57.800]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far and wide.
[1:58:57.800 --> 1:58:59.800]  There is an awakening.
[1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:03.800]  Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[1:59:03.800 --> 1:59:10.800]  Reset Wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also learn new material.
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:14.800]  I'm not disappointed I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:18.800]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more.
[1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:19.800]  It's moving me.
[1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:23.800]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission.
[1:59:23.800 --> 1:59:26.800]  And I felt like I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[1:59:26.800 --> 1:59:30.800]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[1:59:30.800 --> 1:59:31.800]  This isn't magic.
[1:59:31.800 --> 1:59:39.800]  This is the real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years ago called The Matrix.

[2:00:09.800 --> 2:00:11.800]  You don't have control of my children.
[2:00:11.800 --> 2:00:13.800]  You don't have control of me.
[2:00:13.800 --> 2:00:17.800]  They shut outdoors and try to give her God's Fauci to hell with them.
[2:00:17.800 --> 2:00:18.800]  Stop!
[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:19.800]  Stop!
[2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:20.800]  Okay!
[2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:21.800]  He's a fraud!
[2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:22.800]  He's a fraud!
[2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:23.800]  He's a fraud!
[2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:24.800]  He's a fraud!
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:25.800]  He's a criminal!
[2:00:25.800 --> 2:00:28.800]  Churches are surrendering their pulpits to the demonic Hockle.
[2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:31.800]  As I come into your church, you're not getting my time.
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:32.800]  Are you crazy?
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:33.800]  I'm crazy!
[2:00:33.800 --> 2:00:34.800]  I'm crazy!
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:35.800]  I'm crazy!
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:36.800]  I'm crazy!
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:37.800]  I'm crazy!
[2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:38.800]  I'm crazy!
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:40.800]  All of these women educate of 24 years.
[2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:42.800]  They stop teaching them years ago.
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:44.800]  You just didn't know.
[2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:45.800]  Fazi.
[2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:46.800]  Fazi.
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:47.800]  You just didn't know.
[2:00:47.800 --> 2:00:48.800]  Education went to hell years ago.
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:51.800]  They taught them compliance.
[2:00:52.800 --> 2:00:54.800]  They stopped teaching them to think.
[2:00:55.800 --> 2:00:56.800]  Analytical talk went out the window.
[2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:58.800]  With state exams.
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:02.800]  Those state exams going to be used to try to get children to determine who are going to college.
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:03.800]  To train them.
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:07.800]  To support this government- Grizzler sakin system.
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:07.800]  or the helmet system.
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:16.200]  I don't care how you look at it, but you're in corporate America, you're imprisoned by
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:17.200]  your lifestyle.
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:21.200]  If you're in a government, you're imprisoned by your job with good benefits.
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:22.200]  You understand?
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:25.200]  If you are on subsidy, you're imprisoned by their benefits.
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:36.640]  We have to get out their system, pull yourself out, pull your dollars out, and level it.
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:43.640]  That was Tricia Lindsey, and the power of the seismic waves from that epic speech were
[2:01:43.640 --> 2:01:46.240]  felt all across the internet.
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:47.240]  Tricia joins me now.
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:50.760]  She's going to be with me for the next half hour.
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:53.680]  We've got just a couple minutes here before the break, and then the long segments coming
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:54.680]  up.
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:59.320]  I think the most amazing thing, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the most amazing thing
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:01.800]  about that speech was that it just came from the heart.
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:03.040]  It came from the soul.
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:04.880]  You didn't write anything down.
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:07.400]  You didn't have a teleprompter in front of you.
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:10.240]  You just came out with what was in your soul.
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:11.240]  Absolutely.
[2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:12.240]  Absolutely.
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:19.640]  I literally had gotten, I think I got off a plane the night before, got in maybe at
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:21.400]  about one o'clock in the morning.
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:24.960]  I didn't even have time to really look over anything.
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:30.760]  I jumped in my car and drove to Albany, got there and was told, you're on in 20 minutes.
[2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:34.160]  You're up in, I think, 15 and 20 minutes, so I didn't have time to think.
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:36.360]  So I just spoke from my heart.
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:42.520]  I just spoke about the things that have just been in my mind and what I've observed and
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:43.520]  just my opinions.
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:48.160]  And so it came completely out of my heart, absolutely.
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:52.440]  And for me, and I would say for most people, that was the first time we'd ever heard from
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:54.040]  you or heard you speak.
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:58.440]  How actively had you been speaking out against the mandates and the medical tyranny in the
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:00.800]  state of New York?
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:08.480]  I've spoken a few times, by now, if anyone Googles me or looks on different platforms,
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:09.600]  I do have speeches out there.
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:16.920]  I don't film myself and post, but there have been a number of people who have posted it.
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:23.520]  And so now I have people that are capturing the videos just so I can have a copy of it
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:24.880]  and because people ask.
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:28.040]  But I had been involved in it since the beginning, maybe.
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:32.320]  I would say since the beginning, and just spoken various places.
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:39.320]  And then, of course, as the tyranny increased, I became more and more involved.
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:44.160]  And as people began to know my name and hear me, Children's Health Defense and certain
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:51.040]  other organizations like New York Freedom Group, they would call on me to speak or to address
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:53.320]  certain issues.
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:58.480]  But that event in Albany was, I think, one of the, not that none were important before,
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:03.440]  but that was one of the more important rallies because of where it took place, right, where
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:07.080]  in the state capitol and because it was the opening of the legislative session.
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:08.080]  So it was major.
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:10.480]  And I just thought that they needed to just hear everything.
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:15.040]  And I'm just trying to call people into action.
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:18.960]  Not just gathering information, giving information is vital.
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:24.760]  And that needs to be, you know, transferred, the information that I have and that a number
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:27.360]  of us have has to be transferred to the larger public.
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:30.600]  And then we have to call them into action because something has to be done.
[2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:34.520]  Well, and what I see, and this is, I mean, it's well documented throughout American
[2:04:34.520 --> 2:04:38.600]  history, is that when you deliver a powerful speech like that, it motivates other people.
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:43.280]  It gets other people the confidence that they need when they see people speaking with such
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:47.400]  conviction, speaking truth to power, that gives them the motivation to stand up and
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:48.400]  do what's right too.
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:52.840]  Patricia Lindsay is with us for two more segments, looking forward to talking with her and getting
[2:04:52.840 --> 2:04:55.400]  her legal take on all this tyranny as well.
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:04.960]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:10.360]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:18.080]  The days of independent media are numbered, the government has made it illegal to oppose
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:19.080]  them.
[2:05:19.080 --> 2:05:21.960]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:27.840]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly, with practically half the population
[2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:30.880]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:35.880]  The traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening
[2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:37.380]  exponentially.
[2:05:37.380 --> 2:05:41.320]  So be it, make them silence us by force.
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:44.360]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.440]  Live now, buy products, donate.
[2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:52.880]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:06:07.160]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:20.040]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[2:06:20.040 --> 2:06:25.560]  And we are joined by civil rights lawyer and also very well studied and experienced in
[2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:27.240]  other forms of law as well.
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:32.160]  Patricia Lindsay runs her own law firm in New York, been outspoken against the medical
[2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:37.120]  tyranny and everything that's happened in New York since the beginning of COVID has been
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:41.480]  delivering multiple powerful speeches, but one that really rocked the internet world
[2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:45.040]  from the New York capital in Albany just a few weeks ago.
[2:06:45.040 --> 2:06:46.560]  And Patricia joins me now.
[2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:50.320]  I want to get your legal take on what we're seeing.
[2:06:50.320 --> 2:06:56.680]  Like for example, we just recently, the unelected governor of New York with her mask mandate,
[2:06:56.680 --> 2:07:02.960]  it gets rejected and shut down by a court of law, and then another judge says, no, wait,
[2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:04.680]  we're going to keep the mask mandate.
[2:07:04.680 --> 2:07:09.520]  I mean, on your legal map, where does all this stand?
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:14.760]  I mean, what legal precedent is there to force people to wear a facial covering that
[2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:16.280]  restricts their breathing?
[2:07:16.280 --> 2:07:19.360]  There is no legal precedent.
[2:07:19.360 --> 2:07:23.560]  It doesn't even have scientific precedent, to be honest with you.
[2:07:23.560 --> 2:07:25.960]  And I can say that because I have a science background.
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:31.920]  My first degree is in nursing and I taught biology for, I don't know, 20 years or so,
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:33.480]  15 plus years.
[2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:35.040]  So that's interesting.
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:42.040]  A biology teacher would tell you that you need air to breathe and you need your nasal
[2:07:42.040 --> 2:07:44.480]  passageways to not be interfered with.
[2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:47.480]  I mean, it's like forcing people to have asthma.
[2:07:47.480 --> 2:07:48.480]  Absolutely.
[2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:53.320]  You're forcing people to breathe back into poison that should be released from their
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:54.320]  bodies.
[2:07:54.320 --> 2:08:00.320]  I walk around and I watch people coughing, I mean, severely in masks and that's not
[2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:01.320]  allowed out.
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:03.240]  Our atmosphere is set up to cleanse itself.
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:09.600]  We have trees, we have the oxygen, the carbon dioxide and oxygen cycle that's set up to
[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:13.240]  cleanse and clean our air, right?
[2:08:13.240 --> 2:08:16.000]  And if you look at the mandates, it doesn't even make sense.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.840]  You walk into a restaurant with a mask on and then you sit at your table and remove
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:21.840]  the mask.
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:28.720]  So the virus is only, it will only attack you as you're walking into the restaurant
[2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:32.440]  and when you take off the mask and sit at your table, it's going to remain at the table
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:37.760]  with you, even though it's said to be an airborne virus.
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:42.760]  It just does not make any sense and there is no legal precedent and the governor knows
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:47.960]  it and all the legislators know it because we have to have informed consent in this country
[2:08:47.960 --> 2:08:53.560]  and the mask as well as the vaccines, as well as the tests are still in the emergency use
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:58.360]  authorization status and so they have not been licensed and approved and once it remains
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:05.000]  in that status, then we have to be able, we are the citizens have a right to reject it,
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:09.240]  to reject its use or to accept it, but it has to be informed and at the end of the day
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:12.880]  to require someone to wear a mask, I don't care if they even make it into a law, that
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:17.680]  law has to be repealed because you cannot force someone to restrict their breathing.
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:21.320]  Breathing is something that is necessary, it is a necessary form of life.
[2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:27.520]  Oxygen is necessary, it's a necessary element, a necessary gas in our body, our body functions
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:33.040]  and needs certain things to intake, to take in to carry out life processes.
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:41.680]  So when you're saying no and you're restricting our intake of oxygen and our ability to release
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:47.120]  other poisons such as carbon dioxide and other things, then you're pretty much subjecting
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:52.720]  someone to death, you're subjecting them to sickness, the very thing that you're trying
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:55.280]  to stop is what you're actually causing.
[2:09:55.280 --> 2:10:00.480]  Well, and I think most people would have to admit, aside from maybe the most deranged
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:04.120]  among us, people would have to admit that yeah, it makes no sense, you walk into the
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:07.600]  restaurant with the mask and then you take it off to sit down or put it back on when
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:13.240]  you get up to go to the bathroom or whatever the nonsensical procedures are, but of course
[2:10:13.240 --> 2:10:20.760]  it gets enforced because of government, because of these medical bureaucracies and so then
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:24.000]  restaurants are in fear that oh, they're going to get shut down or they're going to get
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:27.440]  fined or they're going to get punished if they don't obey and so then they have to force
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:32.920]  these nonsensical measures on to their customers and then their customers are sick of it and
[2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:35.760]  then eventually the customers don't want to go back because they're sick of it and then
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:39.320]  eventually the restaurants have to close down because they're not getting any business.
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:44.200]  I mean, this is what we've learned throughout human history, this is why we reject communism.
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:48.840]  Once big government gets involved in our free market, the free market dies.
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:51.240]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[2:10:51.240 --> 2:10:54.320]  And what people don't understand is the power that they have.
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:59.080]  We the citizens in this country have more power than what we're utilizing.
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:05.080]  We literally have the power and the authority to abolish the government if it fails to do
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:10.920]  the carry out the functions for which it was created and to create a new government.
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:16.360]  And I'm so serious about that and we just need to go back to the documents that founded
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:23.160]  this country that have been amended to include certain things but were formed and put measures
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:29.800]  in place to ensure that the government would not be able to usurp its authority and if
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:35.000]  they did, there were measures in place that we could now implement in order to get a hold
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.360]  of it, to control it and to stop it.
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:39.240]  We just have to take back our power.
[2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:43.960]  Well, and it's amazing that we have to sit here and say things like, hey, you know, the
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:47.960]  bill of rights is good, the Declaration of Independence is good, breathing oxygen is
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:53.360]  good, but we're now in this scenario where it's like we have to refresh this, we have
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.800]  to remind ourselves of this because we just look around at society and it just seems to
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:02.040]  be breaking down and going crazy and it's like, hey, remember, you need to breathe oxygen,
[2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:05.800]  hey, remember, you're a free citizen of this country, your government cannot oppress you
[2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:11.440]  like this and it's sad that we have to have what should be just elementary conversations
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:16.760]  but on this platform because this is the craziness of society we're dealing with now.
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:17.760]  Absolutely.
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:23.080]  And it's even crazy because most people don't even know or they don't have the information
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:25.600]  that we do discuss, right?
[2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:28.240]  Schools are not teaching this information.
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:35.080]  Most kids are not coming out of school understanding the basics of the founding of this country.
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:39.000]  And that's coming out of elementary school or even high school.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:46.480]  And unless you particularly go and take a course specific to getting this information,
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:48.440]  you won't even get it in college.
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:54.000]  And so government has taken over education, it's infiltrated its way into every area of
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.560]  our life and it has dumbed it down.
[2:12:56.560 --> 2:13:02.200]  That's what it has done and it has manipulated it and changed it for their purposes and to
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:08.560]  benefit them, not the people, which is contrary, completely contrary to their purpose.
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:10.060]  What of this stalemate?
[2:13:10.060 --> 2:13:13.640]  It seems that we have a stalemate here because I can ask you, I can say, hey, what legal
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:17.200]  action can people take but the legal action has been taken.
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:22.080]  I mean, the mask mandate was banned from New York City and then just one judge just comes
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:25.120]  about and says, nope, we are going to have the mask mandate.
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:30.160]  So what do you make of this legal stalemate that's back and forth of, hey, no masks, okay,
[2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:35.520]  yes masks, okay, no masks, okay, yes, I mean, it's just with every one of these COVID issues.
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:39.000]  I thank God for the judges that are bold enough to take a stand.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:45.800]  But I am also very careful when I read their rulings.
[2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:49.520]  And I said I had to read it more in depth, I wanted to go back over it and read it more
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:50.520]  in depth.
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:54.560]  But one thing I noticed in it, the judge made reference, which is very true, that it takes
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:14:01.040]  the legislators, right, to impose this, to make a law, pretty much, and to be able to
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:02.040]  impose this.
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:06.880]  And so at the way it stands right now, the mandates don't have the rule of law.
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:08.520]  They don't have the power of law.
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:13.960]  And so Hockle and the DOE or any agency are usurping their authority.
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:14.960]  They're overreaching.
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:15.960]  It's tyrannical.
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:18.840]  They don't have the authority to impose these mandates.
[2:14:18.840 --> 2:14:25.000]  Now I look at the language, because the language says a lot.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:30.400]  Because when I read it, I said the next step is going to be legislation behind this.
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:32.680]  They're going to try to turn this into a law.
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:37.760]  They're going to make a law surrounding this so that when people break the law, now you
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:40.840]  become subject to the judicial system.
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:45.240]  And at that point, your freedoms are lost based upon our 13th amendment and how it was
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:46.480]  written, the loophole.
[2:14:46.480 --> 2:14:48.400]  And so we have to be very careful.
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:54.120]  I am happy when I see the rulings, because it shows that there is someone that has the
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:58.640]  fortitude to do what is right.
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:04.080]  But I'm also very careful, because I watch to see the steps and what's coming next.
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:10.880]  And the inconsistent rulings can show that the law is there and everyone else is violating
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:11.880]  the law.
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:14.560]  And that's why you're having inconsistent rulings coming out of the court.
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:21.640]  But the inconsistency can also be created to get it to the legislatures, so that they
[2:15:21.640 --> 2:15:27.120]  can now create this law, which shuts down all this conversation and all this debate.
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:31.400]  And now you're going to be dealing with this from another angle and from a higher level.
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:35.560]  And so we have to be careful, and we have to get involved with what's going on.
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:41.040]  The legislative session is open, and there are tons of bills on the floor that are seeking
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:44.760]  to pretty much wipe away our rights.
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:49.120]  And the population has to get involved, the communities have to get involved.
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:50.120]  We have to get involved.
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:53.000]  And in the meantime, the citizens are in this whirlpool of madness.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.800]  We got to go to break, but we'll be right back with Attorney Tricia Lindsay.
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:15:58.720]  Don't go anywhere.
[2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:04.120]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply
[2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:05.800]  chain breakdowns.
[2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:09.360]  You've done a great job supporting info wars and supporting your immune system.
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:13.600]  The problem is, with all the COVID lockdowns, the great reset, we can't get these products
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:14.600]  in.
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:20.160]  So finally, they came in, but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential,
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:25.040]  nutrient, multivitamins, so you absorb it, and so it's not toxic in your body like synthetic
[2:16:25.040 --> 2:16:26.040]  vitamins.
[2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:27.960]  And then, of course, vitamin C and zinc.
[2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:33.880]  This sucker is really full and heavy because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:35.080]  rose hips.
[2:16:35.080 --> 2:16:38.600]  Number one thing you can do if you're immune system and your body, it does so much more.
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:44.400]  Both of these are now back in stock at infowarstore.com for 40% off, and I'm going to keep you at
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:46.360]  that price until they sell out.
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:50.960]  Because of supply chain breakdowns, we've got a limited run, so please take action now
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:55.000]  and order them at infowarstore.com, but whatever you do, find similar products out there and
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:59.640]  use them because this is a life and death situation to be healthy.
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:03.640]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:09.120]  I've never had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss like everybody else
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:10.120]  has.
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:19.840]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[2:17:19.840 --> 2:17:27.680]  and bled and sweat for, and now we're just throwing it all away, and I see the general
[2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:34.160]  public in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled
[2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:35.160]  tranty.
[2:17:35.160 --> 2:17:41.160]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meager under and it's so incredibly sad, but
[2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:47.480]  this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:50.520]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[2:17:50.520 --> 2:17:55.400]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decimence
[2:17:55.400 --> 2:17:56.400]  and collapse.
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:17:58.400]  To actually end the species as we know it.
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:02.680]  I want to tell you about sale that we've just launched, especially if you have not properly
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:05.200]  prepped for a disaster.
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:11.400]  10% off all storable foods at infowarstore.com, it's insurance you can eat.
[2:18:11.400 --> 2:18:16.000]  The globalists have crept out of the shadows and are now openly trying to destabilize the
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:21.320]  entire planet and in my opinion, now is the most crucial time to stock up on storable food
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:25.880]  and get ready for the next big crisis because these Democrats have already shown they're
[2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:27.520]  not holding anything back.
[2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:32.040]  In response to this communist sabotage of humanity, the team over at my Patriot supply
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:39.160]  has agreed to allow us to offer our customers 10% off all storable foods, but this deal
[2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:40.160]  can't last long.
[2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:43.000]  This is only available for a limited time.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:48.800]  Your decision now can mean saved time and money later, not to mention insurance you
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:50.560]  can eat in a crisis.
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:58.600]  10% off all storable food right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:01.400]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:06.560]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:10.040]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[2:19:10.040 --> 2:19:15.760]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:20.960]  facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:25.560]  they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:29.200]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:33.560]  to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:38.480]  compliant meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:43.640]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:48.840]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:51.440]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[2:19:51.440 --> 2:19:54.000]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:59.720]  So protect your privacy today and support the info war at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:59.720 --> 2:20:25.720]  Pleading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:49.120]  Thank God for great people like Tricia Lindsey who are speaking up, making their voices heard.
[2:20:49.120 --> 2:20:57.000]  And I wanted to ask her now, what is it like in New York, I mean, because you obviously
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:01.960]  have some pushback against these mandates, but I mean, what, what, what does the scoreboard
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:02.960]  look like?
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:04.600]  What, what does kind of the team layout look like?
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:07.360]  I mean, are there a bunch of lawyers jumping on board?
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:10.920]  I mean, is there a lot of pushback on the governor?
[2:21:10.920 --> 2:21:13.560]  Does she even care if there's pushback?
[2:21:13.560 --> 2:21:16.160]  Is she just going to have her will no matter what?
[2:21:16.160 --> 2:21:21.120]  With the medical tyranny, I mean, and then ultimately, I, I fear that, you know, New
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:25.080]  York will kind of be set as the example for the rest of the states.
[2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:28.480]  Maybe it doesn't make it to other states, but I think that that's the goal.
[2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:32.200]  So I mean, what, where do you think it stands in New York right now when it comes to the
[2:21:32.200 --> 2:21:37.200]  medical tyranny versus the freedom of choice battle that's happening?
[2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:39.040]  I think one more people are waking up.
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:42.000]  I think they're, they're, they're getting motivated.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:46.240]  You have a number of rallies that are, that are planned that I've been seeing coming across
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:49.920]  my phone and my email that are being planned.
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:53.080]  I believe there's one even happening right now or took place yesterday.
[2:21:53.080 --> 2:21:54.080]  Yeah.
[2:21:54.080 --> 2:21:55.080]  I can't even keep up.
[2:21:55.080 --> 2:21:56.080]  It's like every day.
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:21:57.080]  Yes, exactly.
[2:21:57.080 --> 2:22:01.680]  And I'll get the invitations to come, but I can't be at the rallies otherwise, I won't
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:02.680]  have a practice anymore.
[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:07.960]  So I can't be everywhere, but there are a number of people that are pushing back at Governor
[2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:15.520]  Hocko and at the local, the local politicians, our local leaders, because they realize that
[2:22:15.520 --> 2:22:16.520]  something is wrong.
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:20.360]  I mean, the inconsistent rulings out of the court helps with that too, as well as the
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:23.840]  inconsistent reports coming across the television, right?
[2:22:23.840 --> 2:22:30.120]  They're using mainstream media to pretty much brainwash people and to spread fear and propaganda
[2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:31.120]  into them.
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:35.440]  But now with all the inconsistencies that are coming across the screen, people, it's causing
[2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:38.040]  people to think that weren't thinking before.
[2:22:38.040 --> 2:22:42.440]  And so they're waking up another section of the population that are saying, wait a minute,
[2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:44.400]  this doesn't make any sense.
[2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:48.240]  And now with the math mandate being lifted, you have whole school districts that are planning
[2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:52.880]  to walk out, teachers, parents are getting involved in saying, not anymore, we're not
[2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:54.800]  doing this anymore to our children.
[2:22:54.800 --> 2:22:59.080]  And so as that spreads, as that starts to happen, then the momentum will continue to
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:00.920]  drive, will continue to move.
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:06.600]  But I know that in New York, people are waking up, restaurant owners are having a hard time
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:14.840]  because, I mean, let's face it, the vaccinated were going out before, but like they said
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:22.080]  on this, prior to the start of my interview, vaccinated people are getting tired of going
[2:23:22.080 --> 2:23:26.680]  out and having to show cards, they're getting tired of being asked, and they're getting
[2:23:26.680 --> 2:23:28.360]  tired of being separated.
[2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:31.760]  Because I've been invited to a few events in New York City, and I say, I can't go.
[2:23:31.760 --> 2:23:34.960]  And I'm not going because I'm not getting vaccinated, I'm not carrying a card.
[2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:36.400]  I'm not answering to that.
[2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:40.880]  And I'm not going to any establishment that is supporting these slave passports.
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:45.040]  And so now the vaccinated are putting pressure on to the business owners and saying, we're
[2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:46.040]  not going.
[2:23:46.040 --> 2:23:50.000]  And I tell people, come to this place, come to this area of New York, because this is
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:51.400]  not happening there.
[2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:53.640]  And so the momentum is driving.
[2:23:53.640 --> 2:23:57.400]  And from what I understand, there were a number of business owners that went and met with
[2:23:57.400 --> 2:23:59.880]  the new mayor and said, we can't do this anymore.
[2:23:59.880 --> 2:24:01.520]  We cannot take this anymore.
[2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:02.600]  We're losing business.
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:03.600]  We're going to shut down.
[2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:04.880]  We're not going to make it through.
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:05.960]  And I heard it through the grapevine.
[2:24:05.960 --> 2:24:09.680]  I didn't check it, but I heard it through the grapevine today that they are planning
[2:24:09.680 --> 2:24:14.680]  possibly on giving another bailout to the restaurants, which is going to be crazy.
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:15.880]  Where's all this money coming from?
[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:18.000]  There is no money in the economy.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:23.320]  And they're taking our taxpayer dollars and giving it to businesses so that they can continue
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:25.600]  to oppress the people that are supporting them.
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:28.680]  It's just madness, but people are waking up.
[2:24:28.680 --> 2:24:30.800]  The momentum is growing.
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:32.520]  And I believe we are going to succeed.
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:34.200]  I know we're going to succeed.
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:35.400]  We just have to hold the line.
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:36.720]  We just have to stand strong.
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:40.920]  And I know it's easier for some people to say it than others because a number of people
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:42.480]  have lost their jobs.
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:46.680]  People are on the verge of losing their homes, but it's taking us back to the basics and
[2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:48.480]  it's causing an awakening to happen.
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:51.760]  And so we just have to hold the line, help and support each other.
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:53.240]  Don't fight with people.
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:58.360]  I don't argue with people about my stance on the vaccine or the mandates or anything
[2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:03.440]  if they are just so far gone and that it's going to be a debate.
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:04.760]  I love them from a distance.
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:07.120]  I pray for them and I hope that they wake up.
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:09.680]  But if not, I leave them alone and I wish them well.
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:10.920]  You know what I mean?
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:15.280]  But the population is waking up and we are going to win this.
[2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:18.680]  Hockle Park doesn't care because most of them are arrogant.
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:24.440]  They have the backing of whoever it is, these nefarious people sitting in high places.
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:28.800]  But what I know is that every high place eventually does will come down and they will be made
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:29.800]  low.
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:30.800]  Yeah, I agree.
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:31.800]  That's what I do.
[2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:34.240]  Good ultimately defeats evil every time.
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:37.000]  Sometimes it takes longer than other times.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:38.480]  That's because people are overall good.
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:40.480]  I do believe that.
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:46.200]  Now when you see stories like this and there's dozens of them now, man in Boston kicked off
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:52.160]  heart transplant lists for not being vaccinated, he literally cannot get the vaccine because
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:55.080]  of the side effects on the heart could kill him.
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:58.600]  So now he's been sentenced to death because he won't get the vaccine and now he doesn't
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:25:59.880]  get a heart transplant.
[2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:05.280]  I mean, aside from just the clear evil here, from a legal standpoint, what goes through
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:11.760]  your head as an attorney when you see such discrimination that every person involved
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:16.480]  in that situation are going to be held liable for whatever happens to that man.
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:18.320]  And I pray he makes it through.
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:24.440]  But every single person down to the doctor that refused to treat him will be held liable
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:29.120]  and they all need to be locked up in a prison and throw the key away because who in the
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:33.840]  world gave them the power and authority to decide who lives and who dies, who deserves
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:35.480]  life and who deserves death.
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:40.160]  We have lost our minds in this country and that's why we have to hold the line.
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:44.280]  And that's why we also have to unplug and pull out of their system.
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:52.120]  I met a doctor or two doctors last week and they had been terminated from their hospitals.
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:55.240]  And one person, I think, was terminated from Kaiser.
[2:26:55.240 --> 2:26:57.200]  And I said, well, go build a new Kaiser.
[2:26:57.200 --> 2:26:58.440]  We have to unplug.
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:02.320]  We need to, I tell people, don't go to the hospitals because once you go to the hospital,
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:05.320]  there's no guarantee that you'll come back out alive.
[2:27:05.320 --> 2:27:06.320]  So don't go.
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:08.280]  And unfortunately, that's where we are right now.
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:13.920]  So every doctor that has been separated from their institution, every nurse, every teacher,
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:18.520]  we now need to create our own institutions.
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:19.520]  Get back.
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:21.200]  Doctors need to start going to people's homes.
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:22.600]  You have a medical license to treat.
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:25.000]  You don't have to treat them in a hospital.
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  Treat them in their homes.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  Go and visit people.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:28.960]  Get back to grass roots.
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:30.040]  That's what we have to do.
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:31.160]  That's where medicine started.
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:33.280]  There's no problem with that right now.
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:34.560]  The wealthy do it all the time.
[2:27:34.560 --> 2:27:36.440]  They don't have to go to a hospital all the time.
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:40.040]  They have their medical doctors come and see them at home and they treat them at home.
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:41.240]  Let's figure something out.
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:47.160]  We are not slaves to the system, but we don't have to be slaves to the system.
[2:27:47.160 --> 2:27:50.320]  We can make a choice to do something different and to unplug.
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:52.280]  And that's what this is pushing us to do.
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:56.880]  Because when you see situations like that, who wants to go to a hospital where someone
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:59.120]  is going to look at you and say, you're unvaccinated.
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:01.520]  So now you cannot be treated.
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:03.040]  That's going back to the black codes.
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:04.720]  That's going back to the slave passport.
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:06.640]  That to me is going back to the Holocaust.
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:10.360]  And I don't care what the media wants to say that we're comparing this to the Holocaust.
[2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:11.600]  Read the history.
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:16.640]  Read what took place years ago in the history of this country and in Germany and everywhere
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:17.640]  else.
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:21.320]  And there is no one that can debate that this is very similar to what took place.
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:25.560]  No, that's why they say those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:28.800]  And we're in the process of repeating it all right now.
[2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:31.760]  Trisha Lindsay, I know you're obviously busy running your law practice there.
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:34.960]  Is there any way you could do one more segment with me?
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:35.960]  Sure.
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:40.280]  That would be wonderful because I'd also like to get into the crime spree that's happening
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:45.160]  in New York right now and get your take on that because that doesn't seem to be going
[2:28:45.160 --> 2:28:46.160]  away.
[2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:47.160]  All right.
[2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:48.160]  So Trisha Lindsay, a great interview.
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:49.800]  You're going to do one more segment with us on the other side folks.
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:51.640]  Tell your friends and family to tune in.
[2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:54.520]  I know you can't share all the links, but we got futurenews.news.
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:59.840]  You can still share that link to the live stream.
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:03.880]  This night seemed to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:06.480]  both at home and the world at large.
[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:11.680]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep
[2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:15.720]  support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[2:29:15.720 --> 2:29:20.440]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:23.240]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[2:29:23.240 --> 2:29:27.640]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now
[2:29:27.640 --> 2:29:33.160]  the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:37.640]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[2:29:37.640 --> 2:29:42.840]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:48.560]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:52.840]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will
[2:29:52.840 --> 2:29:54.720]  be down and out.

[2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:35.600]  salt.
[2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.360]  It even takes a better glass formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:45.400]  Again, it has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor
[2:30:45.400 --> 2:30:46.400]  and dissolvability.
[2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:50.120]  You're going to love this and when it does for your joints, what it does for your body,
[2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:51.120]  it does for your bones.

[2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:29.960]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep
[2:31:29.960 --> 2:31:31.040]  us on air.
[2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:38.560]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin
[2:31:38.560 --> 2:31:41.000]  and take vitamin C and take zinc.

[2:32:04.720 --> 2:32:08.640]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.
[2:32:08.640 --> 2:32:09.640]  Keep us on air.
[2:32:09.640 --> 2:32:10.640]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:15.240]  The new supplements that we have, the latest in the InfoWarsLive supplement line, the vitamin
[2:32:15.240 --> 2:32:20.440]  D3 with calcium gummies, the vitamin C with zinc from the Whole Food Multivitamins, or
[2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:24.200]  if you buy the Combo Pack with all three at infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:28.960]  And you know, I'm telling you, the vitamin D gummies, this is a great thing for your
[2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:29.960]  kids.
[2:32:29.960 --> 2:32:30.960]  They're going to love it.
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:31.960]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[2:32:31.960 --> 2:32:32.960]  It's healthy.
[2:32:32.960 --> 2:32:34.520]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[2:32:34.520 --> 2:32:36.240]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[2:32:36.240 --> 2:32:38.360]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:44.240]  Calcium good for them, the vitamin D. So that's at infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:44.240 --> 2:32:46.840]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[2:32:46.840 --> 2:32:52.080]  So the supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies,
[2:32:52.080 --> 2:32:55.120]  the emergency supplies at infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:55.120 --> 2:32:56.640]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[2:32:56.640 --> 2:32:59.080]  We cannot thank you enough.
[2:32:59.080 --> 2:33:24.880]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:29.360]  Dr. Lindsay is with us, she is an attorney based out of New York, she's been very outspoken
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:34.080]  against the medical tyranny that her state has been enduring.
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:40.120]  But I want to switch to another topic, which I think is very important as well, maybe not
[2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:45.480]  as important as the medical tyranny and the long-term precedence that could be set with
[2:33:45.480 --> 2:33:46.480]  that.
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:51.280]  But very important for the people of New York, specifically New York City, what they're
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:57.440]  going through with these crime rates right now, and it's so bad that you've now had an
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:02.920]  activist who has put fake blood outside New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg's
[2:34:02.920 --> 2:34:07.080]  Manhattan office to protest policies amid crime surge.
[2:34:07.080 --> 2:34:12.120]  Now, of course, that activist has now been arrested.
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:19.080]  I'm sure that that, or should I say, yeah, I'm sure that that didn't come directly from
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:24.400]  Alvin Bragg's office to have that individual arrested because, you know, when liberals
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:29.680]  and Democrats go out and do their protesting, nobody seems to mind, or when violent criminals
[2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:35.000]  go out and do their thing, the District Attorney Bragg doesn't seem to mind either.
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:40.960]  So what is your take on this rampant spike of crime in New York City?
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:46.000]  And the leaders there are the ones that are allowing this to happen.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:49.120]  I mean, it's their policies that are allowing this to happen.
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:53.520]  How do they not see that?
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.280]  How do they not see half of what's happening and what they've been doing for the past year
[2:34:58.280 --> 2:34:59.280]  and a half, two years, right?
[2:34:59.280 --> 2:35:02.160]  And even before that, let's be real.
[2:35:02.160 --> 2:35:06.800]  But the spike in the crime in New York, I think there are a number of things going on.
[2:35:06.800 --> 2:35:09.560]  The policies, of course, absolutely.
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:15.880]  But I also say that when you have now removed people from work, you've taken away their
[2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:20.960]  livelihood, you have shut schools down, you have shut down medical services, you've shut
[2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:27.200]  down people are not getting treated for psychological issues that they have.
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:31.080]  They are not being treated for their emotional disabilities that they have.
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:35.160]  And so you just have a population that's pretty much just gone wild.
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:43.640]  I know I knew of someone, he passed away maybe two months ago, I knew him for a brief time.
[2:35:43.640 --> 2:35:49.400]  And he was a young man who was actually one of the victims of a crime, a random crime.
[2:35:49.400 --> 2:35:50.400]  He became homeless.
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:53.760]  I didn't even know when he became homeless.
[2:35:53.760 --> 2:35:57.720]  And he was attacked on a train and stabbed while he was sleeping.
[2:35:57.720 --> 2:36:01.840]  He was going from, I think, going from one job to the next while asleep.
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:04.560]  And someone came in a train and stabbed him.
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:07.320]  And I believe they arrested the person that it was.
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:12.200]  And it was someone who suffered from psychological disabilities.
[2:36:12.200 --> 2:36:15.280]  But this person, when was the last time this person was treated?
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:19.440]  When was the last time this person received the services that they need to deal with their
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:20.440]  issues?
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:23.040]  And so you have a number of things that are happening.
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:28.240]  The entire state is upside down, or the city of New York is upside down.
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:31.960]  There's too much uncertainty, there's a lot of frustration, there's a lot of anger.
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:39.520]  The politicians, the leaders are not responding to the people's cries and what needs to happen.
[2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:42.080]  And so you're going to have a city in chaos.
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:48.080]  Not to mention, I think a lot of times, depending on who, what's going on, I believe sometimes
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:50.720]  the perception wants to be created as well.
[2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:55.280]  Because there's something going on in New York where I believe there is a push to get
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:37:00.720]  rid of the working class and the middle class families and population parts of New York
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:03.720]  and for the wealthy to take over certain areas.
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:09.760]  And so in order to do that, you have to create this perception and this heightened fear to
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:14.280]  get people to jump up and run and just to leave.
[2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:20.960]  And so I think there is some sort of property confiscation that's happening as well.
[2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:25.680]  So there are a number of things that are happening in my opinion, in my opinion.
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:31.360]  And we are seeing the mass exodus of New York City specifically, but obviously that results
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:36.240]  in the state losing mass numbers of their population.
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:39.800]  And for good reason, I would say, whether it's the medical tyranny or the violent crime
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:44.080]  specifically if you're in New York City, it's just completely unbearable.
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:49.000]  Now you as an attorney, obviously you understand criminal psychology.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:54.600]  So what do you think is going through criminals' minds for the last two to three years in New
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:59.960]  York City where they see, oh wow, it's easier for me to get away with a crime and even if
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:05.360]  I get caught, my punishment is less severe, therefore they're more motivated to do it.
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:09.480]  Do you see that playing out right now in New York City and, quite frankly, other American
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:10.480]  cities?
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:12.720]  I'm not sure if I see necessarily that.
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:20.200]  I'm sure that is part, you know, for some career criminals that, you know, recidivists
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:24.040]  that, you know, if that could be their mindset.
[2:38:24.040 --> 2:38:29.480]  But let me also say that with what's going on with the mandates in New York City and
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:36.360]  police officers walking off their jobs and this whole uproar that's happening behind
[2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:39.760]  these mandates, you have less and less people that are working, right?
[2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:43.720]  So you have less police officers that are on the street because of what's happening.
[2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:50.880]  And then again, with one moment, one judge stays or stops the mandates and then another
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:54.800]  judge comes in and lifts the stay, there's just this whole back and forth situation that's
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:38:55.800]  happening.
[2:38:55.800 --> 2:39:00.480]  There's no consistency happening in the city, people, everyone is distracted.
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:04.120]  And so there is an opportunity for those that would like to take advantage.
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:07.440]  So within risk, in light of that, absolutely.
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:14.320]  And then of course, with the, they have relaxed, you know, the criminal justice system with
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:18.720]  who's going to be held in custody versus who will be released depending on the type of
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:21.200]  crime that's committed and so on and so forth.
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:23.240]  Judges are inundated with what's happening.
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:26.520]  There's not enough staffing within the courts.
[2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:28.920]  And so it's just everything is swelling.
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:31.160]  It's just everything is boiling over.
[2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:32.160]  And that's what's happening.
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:38.080]  And when you have something like that, when you have chaos, of course it leaves open opportunity
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:42.200]  for those that would like to take advantage of the system to do so, absolutely.
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:47.760]  From an outsider's perspective, and I can understand how this perspective could be a
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:53.160]  little inaccurate, but from an outsider's perspective, from here in Texas, I'll say,
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:59.520]  it seems to me that there's more law enforcement or there's more willingness from law enforcement
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:04.200]  to go after people that go into buildings or museums or restaurants without a vaccine
[2:40:04.200 --> 2:40:09.080]  passport, then there is motivation to go after actual criminals that do harm to people.
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:11.080]  That's what it looks like from the rest of the country.
[2:40:11.080 --> 2:40:12.080]  Is that accurate?
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:15.200]  And that's what I'm saying, the distraction, right?
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:19.120]  We're worried more about that mass and vaccines than what's going on.
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:25.280]  So if I'm a criminal, this is prime opportunity for me to do whatever I need to do.
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:29.480]  Because like you said, if I get caught, depending on the crime that I've committed, I'm likely
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:35.760]  going to be released on my own recognices, or depending on the crime, I'm not even going
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:36.760]  to get bail, right?
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:40.640]  Because there's all these other alternatives, which does serve our criminal justice system
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:45.400]  in light of its inequities and disparities and things of that nature and the discrimination
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:48.400]  that is historical within our criminal justice system.
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:53.960]  But at this particular time, with the distractions, the lack of staffing.
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:58.520]  And then you have the distraction where police officers are responding to calls of people
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:05.400]  not wearing masks and not wanting to produce a vaccine passport.
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:09.760]  I mean, look at the lady who was arrested, I think it was last week or two weeks ago,
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:16.360]  in a wheelchair because she was going into bubblegum shrimp restaurant down in Manhattan.
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:22.200]  You're wasting resources going to arrest a woman in a wheelchair who is looking, who
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:29.600]  already has issues with accessibility to a number of facilities and places in the city.
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:35.440]  You're going to arrest her and you wasted resources, called for a van to come and pick her up because
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:41.960]  she's in a wheelchair to take her down and process her as a criminal because she failed
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:44.520]  to produce a vaccine passport.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:45.760]  This doesn't make any sense.
[2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:48.480]  So now those cops should have been doing something else.
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:52.280]  There was someone else getting hurt, someone else who really needed assistance, some other
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:56.720]  crime that was taking place, but instead they were taking care of this woman.
[2:41:56.720 --> 2:42:04.800]  Another mother who was trying to take her daughter to the Museum of Natural History,
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:08.960]  they arrested her and then took her and put her in a car, one police car, and then put
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:12.240]  her daughter in another police car, nine years old.
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:14.760]  Why would you traumatize a nine-year-old like that?
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:18.760]  You arrest her, you put her in a back of a police car and escort her down to police,
[2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:22.000]  one police plaza, or wherever they took her, that's ridiculous.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:26.720]  So again, if I'm a criminal and I'm watching all of this take place, this is wonderful
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:27.720]  opportunity.
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:31.600]  This is prime opportunity for me to do whatever it is that I didn't think to do before or
[2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:35.480]  to just continue to do what I'm doing because the police are completely distracted.
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:37.080]  Our mayor is completely distracted.
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:43.280]  They're running around trying to impose illegal mandates on the healthiest members of society.
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:44.280]  Thank you.
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:47.400]  And on members of the society, period, right, that's illegal.
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:52.280]  And then if they don't comply with these illegal mandates, then you're arresting them.
[2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:53.280]  Amazing.
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:55.280]  Tricia Lindsey, thank you so much.
[2:42:55.280 --> 2:43:00.560]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill, and it is the fastest growing market
[2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:04.160]  in supplements in the world for good reason.
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:10.000]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some non, that do incredible
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:14.560]  things in our brains, and we've tried them all, we've researched them all, and we will
[2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:20.360]  not sell you anything that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity or any type
[2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:21.360]  of extreme hangovers.
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:24.760]  I mean, because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:27.000]  of a let down once you take them, but that would just be a lie.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:30.920]  But these are very, very clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:36.640]  And one of our best sellers is back in stock, Brain Force Plus, a good, clean, neutropic,

[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:59.760]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[2:43:59.760 --> 2:44:03.520]  at World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group, he wasn't
[2:44:03.520 --> 2:44:06.600]  part of that group, so he didn't stand up, and then when they came for another group,
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:09.400]  he wasn't part of that group, so he didn't stand up.
[2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:12.960]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:16.600]  Oh, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people to three
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:21.520]  hours of video games a week, and if you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:26.920]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world, the guys with COVID vaccine passports,
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:27.920]  they even admit it.
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:32.960]  Now, there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it, and they're going to pay for it, and
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:36.880]  they're going to track where you go and what you do, and decide where you can go and what
[2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:37.880]  you can do.
[2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:39.680]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:42.280]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:46.440]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny, pretending
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:49.400]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:50.400]  nightmare as well.
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:54.520]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:44:58.080]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:44:59.440]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:01.280]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:02.280]  Welcome.
[2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:03.280]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:04.280]  All right.
[2:45:04.280 --> 2:45:07.280]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:12.360]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:15.080]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:16.080]  Mix those two together.
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:17.760]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:19.640]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:24.560]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:30.240]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well,
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:31.240]  but just aren't as strong.
[2:45:31.240 --> 2:45:33.120]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:35.560]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:36.560]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[2:45:36.560 --> 2:45:37.560]  Sometimes it's just OK.
[2:45:37.560 --> 2:45:41.040]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:42.040]  That's just how it is.
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:43.560]  It's how it works.
[2:45:43.560 --> 2:45:45.200]  So it's always good.
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:47.320]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:57.840]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:03.280]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply

[2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:56.000]  to chase down all the different supplements I take.
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:59.480]  People see my pill cabinet and they might think I'm a little nuts and I explain, I'm
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:03.760]  like no, this is actually smart to take supplements.
[2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:07.360]  I'm not saying that this is the be all end all for everything but why wouldn't you take
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:13.360]  advantage of this great new innovation in the field of health supplementation with all

[2:51:00.760 --> 2:51:05.120]  Okay, where to go from here?
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:07.760]  I got all these different stacks of news.
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:13.480]  Let's just go right into this one.
[2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:19.960]  Rand Paul was on, I guess it's officially the new show on Fox News now.
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:25.200]  I think it just launched this week.
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:28.840]  But I believe that Jesse Waters now has a new show.
[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:32.120]  I think it's called Jesse Waters Prime Time.
[2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:36.040]  I'm not sure where the schedule has been changed there.
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:43.160]  I know that they moved Janine Pirro to the five for all time and that Jesse Waters is
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:45.080]  now hosting a prime time show.
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:49.000]  I guess that was kind of the mixed bag that they were kind of rotating new talent in and
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  out of.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:53.040]  It's now going to be Jesse Waters Prime Time.
[2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:54.040]  Good for Jesse.
[2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:55.480]  Good for Jesse.
[2:51:55.480 --> 2:51:59.240]  And he had Rand Paul on last night.
[2:51:59.240 --> 2:52:04.760]  And Rand Paul gives advice on what to do when confronted by crazy lunatic mask people.
[2:52:04.760 --> 2:52:12.560]  Yeah, and of course he's seen the crazy lunatic liberal fringe assault him.
[2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:20.200]  And so now he sees kind of a new fringe of the fringe and that's the mask cultists.
[2:52:20.200 --> 2:52:31.240]  And you know, it's crazy folks because, you know, I mean, I'm on air six days a week.
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:38.480]  And we're cramming seven hours of content essentially into three hours on air.
[2:52:38.480 --> 2:52:43.960]  So you can imagine the amount of these videos that I've seen and if you watch every day
[2:52:43.960 --> 2:52:51.040]  that you've seen of these mask Nazis running around harassing people, I mean, I've got
[2:52:51.040 --> 2:52:52.040]  full videos.
[2:52:52.040 --> 2:52:59.280]  In fact, let me just let me just change lanes here because it ties into this.
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:05.240]  But aside from the insanity that you've seen with some of these videos of the mask Nazis
[2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:09.560]  harassing people in elevators, harassing people in grocery stores and restaurants and out
[2:53:09.560 --> 2:53:10.560]  on the streets.
[2:53:10.560 --> 2:53:16.400]  I mean, just psychotic behavior, I mean, again, a functioning civilization would recognize
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:23.840]  this as psychotic behavior and immediately institutionalize these people to get mental
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:24.840]  health treatment.
[2:53:24.840 --> 2:53:27.680]  But but see, then they'd all be overwhelmed with these liberals so we don't know what
[2:53:27.680 --> 2:53:29.440]  to do.
[2:53:29.440 --> 2:53:32.600]  But that's that's just one level of the mass Nazis folks.
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:33.680]  We have videos.
[2:53:33.680 --> 2:53:37.440]  There's now dozens of videos.
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:38.760]  And let's just call it what it is.
[2:53:38.760 --> 2:53:43.680]  They're liberal teachers that are torturing their students with the masks.
[2:53:43.680 --> 2:53:51.000]  The headline on info wars.com shock videos, teachers segregate and punish unmasked students
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:52.080]  in blue states.
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:58.840]  So now they're doing open segregation in the classrooms for kids to witness.
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:01.720]  But it's not just that.
[2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:04.680]  We've seen the videos.
[2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:06.400]  They're obviously Democrat liberals folks.
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:07.400]  It's just come on.
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:08.400]  Let's just call it what it is.
[2:54:08.400 --> 2:54:11.640]  Let's just call a spade a spade here.
[2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:16.400]  Democrat liberal teachers will go up to students who don't wear their masks properly and literally
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:19.720]  tape the mask to their face.
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:25.240]  I've seen this at least five times and it's on video.
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:29.600]  I mean that's that should be you should be fired immediately and never be allowed to
[2:54:29.600 --> 2:54:33.080]  teach in a school ever again when you do something like that.
[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:35.800]  That is so inhumane.
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:38.440]  But that's what liberal Democrat teachers are doing to kids that don't wear the mask
[2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:42.040]  properly and they harass little kids over their masks.
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:43.360]  Put it on right.
[2:54:43.360 --> 2:54:44.360]  Put it on right.
[2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:50.120]  Now I'm going to tape it to your face now now I'm going to come up and manhandle you
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:54.160]  and now they're segregating their students.
[2:54:54.160 --> 2:54:58.760]  And then you have these Democrat liberals that run these institutions at times not just
[2:54:58.760 --> 2:55:04.680]  engaging in the mask Nazi torture not just engaging in the segregation but they're also
[2:55:04.680 --> 2:55:14.340]  engaging in forced medication forced medication undercover footage students film as school
[2:55:14.340 --> 2:55:18.120]  COVID clinic vaccinate children without parental consent.
[2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:21.640]  This was in Colorado and look you know this is not an isolated incident you know this
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:29.360]  is happening at other schools run by these crooked illogical psychotic Democrats.
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:35.640]  And they told the parents because they heard about this and they said oh no no no we promise
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:40.200]  we're not vaccinating any kids at the school we're not doing it without your consent don't
[2:55:40.200 --> 2:55:46.040]  worry about that and then and then they're actually doing it the whole time and the children
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:48.040]  are filming undercover video of them doing it.
[2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:52.560]  I mean thank God for these kids that have the wherewithal not even trained as journalists
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:56.000]  but trained in technology you know growing up with the imperial probe droid in their
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  pocket with the camera.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:03.320]  I remember I mean I remember the first camera phone came out I was probably in high school
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:07.640]  and you know it was just horrible quality but you know you had it but it's like they've
[2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:11.880]  grown up with the super computer in their pocket with this technology so they had the
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:16.640]  wherewithal to say hey let's they said they weren't vaccinating us without the consent
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:21.080]  of the parents they are let's just go film it and show our parents what's going on.
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:28.200]  And so they caught him doing it I mean I was like think about how sick that is think about
[2:56:28.200 --> 2:56:34.040]  how sick these people are they torture kids with the masks they physically physically
[2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:39.600]  assault them with the masks they segregate their classrooms based on mask or vaccination
[2:56:39.600 --> 2:56:45.720]  status and then without parental consent they will give children vaccines.
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:50.440]  I mean that's like fire offense one fire offense two fire offense three like every offense
[2:56:50.440 --> 2:56:57.320]  is fireable like these people should not be allowed anywhere near hospitals.
[2:56:57.320 --> 2:57:01.160]  Yeah and you got all these crazed lunatic teachers that upload their videos to tiktok
[2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:06.440]  I don't even know what this one is just throw it into the stack of them all believe me you
[2:57:06.440 --> 2:57:10.320]  don't want these people anywhere near your children.
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:17.240]  Ohio school lunchroom monitor caught on camera bullying and forcing nine-year-old student
[2:57:17.240 --> 2:57:24.360]  to eat food taken out of the garbage as principal watched yeah who do you think they voted for
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:28.360]  how do you think they feel about masks and vaccines where do you think they fall in the
[2:57:28.360 --> 2:57:33.800]  political spectrum well given the circumstantial evidence and it's liberal democrats that are
[2:57:33.800 --> 2:57:39.880]  torturing kids in schools I'm gonna go ahead and make a safe bet here that these were liberals
[2:57:39.880 --> 2:57:48.360]  that were bullying a young student and made them eat trash because they love you so much.
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:52.080]  And for warriors if you're like me you've been a long time listener of this program
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:57.920]  you fed up with everything going on in the world inside you like me a fire is burned
[2:57:57.920 --> 2:58:02.880]  something needs to change and yet we feel helpless almost like we're stuck inside a
[2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:07.760]  system that someone else created for us it's time for us to break free from that system
[2:58:07.760 --> 2:58:14.000]  race at wars is a game changer you start to see yourself more as part of the solution
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:19.080]  instead of just as a victim so much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration low
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:23.600]  energy and makes us depressed and therefore we manifest as negative reality out there
[2:58:23.600 --> 2:58:28.960]  when they feel their lie cheat steel plan to enslave and rob the people there is an awakening
[2:58:28.960 --> 2:58:36.720]  reset wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock on to the deep rooted psychological
[2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:41.600]  tactics that were being used against me and now I'm not scared anymore I have to say I
[2:58:41.600 --> 2:58:47.200]  was blown away I feel so much better every day listening to it to Alex thank you very
[2:58:47.200 --> 2:58:52.480]  much for putting the course together you're absolutely right we are reflections of God
[2:58:52.480 --> 2:58:57.560]  we are emanations of that and we can use that God energy to do really anything we want
[2:58:57.560 --> 2:59:02.000]  to do in this life Romans chapter 12 Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:07.600]  of our mind and that's a process most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious most
[2:59:07.600 --> 2:59:11.200]  people go through their day and don't think about many things you can drive along a long
[2:59:11.200 --> 2:59:16.000]  journey and not even remember half the trip in this process we need to have a concerted
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:21.680]  active effort physically and mentally to reprogram that subconscious mind that's what this series
[2:59:21.680 --> 2:59:27.440]  is about is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our mind he's exactly right and
[2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:32.640]  he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening and I encourage
[2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:37.240]  everybody out there if you haven't gone there yet go to reset wars dot com that's where your
[2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:38.240]  journey begins.
[2:59:38.240 --> 3:00:06.120]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[3:00:06.120 --> 3:00:11.720]  So it's not just liberal democrats in the education system that want to force your kids to wear
[3:00:11.720 --> 3:00:17.680]  a mask all day and if they don't do it right they'll physically assault them they're now
[3:00:17.680 --> 3:00:22.000]  laughing as they make children eat garbage not even kidding you that's a real story we
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:27.920]  just covered it you can't even believe it but it's on the monitors it's on the cameras
[3:00:27.920 --> 3:00:32.680]  they're vaccinating children without the parental consent I mean that's that's I mean that's
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:37.640]  so illegal I don't know how people aren't being arrested for that they're segregating
[3:00:37.640 --> 3:00:42.680]  their classrooms based on vaccination and mask status this is what liberal democrats
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:50.840]  are doing to the education system and so but here's what here's what they do understand
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:58.440]  they need to target the youth they need to indoctrinate the youth because that's the
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:06.400]  only way their synthetic power structure can maintain and exist in the future is to brainwash
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:12.920]  the children and so this is now what they're doing the American Federation of teachers
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:21.640]  partners with news literacy tool for students to filter content and combat misinformation
[3:01:21.640 --> 3:01:27.760]  I mean we all know what that means right should I give you a translation liberals are partnering
[3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:35.680]  with liberals to brainwash and indoctrinate students of the American education system
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:42.960]  or you know I need to be better I'm bad because I told myself this consciously stop calling
[3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:48.440]  these people liberals they are not even in the modern day understanding of liberalism
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:54.600]  they're still beyond being liberals these are fascists these are authoritarians that's
[3:01:54.600 --> 3:02:02.400]  what they are so so let me just rephrase that of my own rephrasing fascists are teaming
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:09.200]  up with authoritarians to make sure they can indoctrinate students of Americans America's
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:19.520]  education system that's what's going on here now I I've been a little perturbed lately
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:26.640]  thinking about something because I've just been confused wondering you know where do
[3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:31.400]  these people get their information how did they end up so brainwash how did they end
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:36.640]  up with with no common sense or logic or reasoning left like how did they end up being complete
[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:42.640]  psychotic morons you know running around on the streets praising vaccines praising the
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:48.880]  masks hating their fellow humans hating Americans loving the lies that they fall for it's like
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:55.240]  how did they get like this because they're not watching the news you know what I'm saying
[3:02:55.240 --> 3:03:00.600]  like they're not they're not getting this from the news they're not they're not following
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:04.640]  news they're not tuning into CNN they're not tuning into MSNBC they're not tuning into
[3:03:04.640 --> 3:03:11.240]  nightly news how did they end up like this because because we all just assume it's the
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:14.840]  fake news indoctrination it's the fake news that's doing this to them because we just
[3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:22.680]  see the fake news and and make the the accurate connection of okay here's what the fake news
[3:03:22.680 --> 3:03:27.560]  is saying and then here's what the liberal left in America is doing okay there's two
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:31.480]  things are attached to the hip but they're not actually watching the news and this is
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:37.520]  something Darren McBreen has been saying for a while but it really hit me the other day
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:40.960]  where do these people get their information how do these people get so brainwashed it
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:49.000]  really is the celebrity culture is what it is they're tuning in to their favorite celebrities
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:55.240]  and that's where they get information they're tuning into the Hollywood liberal elite telling
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:01.640]  them a bunch of uninformed uneducated misinformed bull crap and they really believe it and they
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:07.960]  really suck it up because like the new studies have revealed people that follow celebrity
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:13.600]  lifestyles are the dumbest people on the planet so yeah they follow their favorite celebrities
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:20.720]  for news or they watch late night talk shows that's that's comedy pretending to be real
[3:04:20.720 --> 3:04:28.920]  news it's not even comedy or news it's propaganda and they really believe all of it and that's
[3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:35.920]  how they've gotten like this and it's just so sad to watch their demise and you know
[3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:40.220]  we've tried to help them long enough but eventually if somebody doesn't want help and they want
[3:04:40.220 --> 3:04:43.520]  to drown in the ocean I guess you just have to let them drown or do you still try to help
[3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:49.400]  them even though they might pull you down with them but I mean now they're involved in torturing
[3:04:49.400 --> 3:04:57.440]  children and brainwashing and propagandizing children so this they must be stopped I've
[3:04:57.440 --> 3:05:02.640]  been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist I wanted to
[3:05:02.640 --> 3:05:08.320]  stop their agenda I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:13.200]  they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting
[3:05:13.200 --> 3:05:19.360]  caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:24.240]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[3:05:24.240 --> 3:05:28.360]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[3:05:28.360 --> 3:05:32.680]  the truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda
[3:05:32.680 --> 3:05:36.040]  we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is
[3:05:36.040 --> 3:05:39.760]  high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable
[3:05:39.760 --> 3:05:45.320]  prices at infowarstore.com so whether it's a month or six month or a year supply or specialty

[3:06:03.520 --> 3:06:08.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Jr. guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:06:08.160 --> 3:06:13.640]  You know we've covered a lot of the writings of the elite and one thing that I did many
[3:06:13.640 --> 3:06:18.920]  many years ago back before I had to cover many more that I've covered since then was
[3:06:18.920 --> 3:06:26.080]  a ten commandments of the Luciferian elite yes what about the idea that helping us to
[3:06:26.080 --> 3:06:31.680]  understand their program through their own weird inverted version of the ten commandments
[3:06:31.680 --> 3:06:37.720]  so today's discussion we're going to kind of walk through dozens of these texts and look
[3:06:37.720 --> 3:06:43.800]  at what's the common ten point program the evil inverted Luciferian ten commandments
[3:06:43.800 --> 3:06:49.200]  that the global elite actually have that they're all united upon when we look back through
[3:06:49.200 --> 3:06:54.400]  a hundred years of their writings or so we find out there is a continuity of agenda a
[3:06:54.400 --> 3:07:01.960]  continuity of plan over those decades over that century amongst these texts and it kind
[3:07:01.960 --> 3:07:06.720]  of functions as a ten points that you can't disagree with there might be debates amongst
[3:07:06.720 --> 3:07:11.440]  the elite at the Bilderberg group at the steering committee meetings there might be discussions
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:16.480]  and arguments and different little mini factions vying for power in this and that but for the
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:22.280]  long-term goal for the long-term plan what are the ten agreement points the ten commandments
[3:07:22.280 --> 3:07:28.920]  the dogmas of the elite that you may not question you may not doubt and I put together what
[3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:36.400]  I think are about ten key points across dozens of texts that are undisputed they they're
[3:07:36.400 --> 3:07:41.840]  all there in every book right every text discusses these we're going to go go through these point
[3:07:41.840 --> 3:07:45.840]  by point and I'm going to pull out some of the main texts and show you but I'm not making
[3:07:45.840 --> 3:07:51.000]  this up it's all there it's all public and has been for a long time the first global
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:56.600]  commandment of the elite is what's one of the dogmas the the creed of the nice of the
[3:07:56.600 --> 3:08:04.800]  nice the Luciferian elite not the nicene creed the Luciferian elite number one is a global
[3:08:04.800 --> 3:08:12.680]  government yes the last hundred years global elite have openly advocated for in plan for
[3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:18.000]  a global government on model someone on the ashes of the British Empire so the old British
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:24.800]  imperial model which was at one point called I think Lord Lionel Curtis one of the global
[3:08:24.800 --> 3:08:30.760]  elites he wrote a book called the Commonwealth of God the idea here being that this common
[3:08:30.760 --> 3:08:36.400]  wealth you have to excuse me I've had a flu for the last week so I'm just getting over
[3:08:36.400 --> 3:08:41.720]  that but the idea was that we could have this common wealth of God I don't know what God
[3:08:41.720 --> 3:08:45.960]  he's talking about probably not the God of the Bible right some other kind of God the
[3:08:45.960 --> 3:08:51.160]  Luciferian God and this common wealth would be one which would take the ideas of liberal
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:08:56.880]  democracy as a cloak or as a cover and there's a famous book that discusses this written
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:02.600]  by none other than Dr. Carol Quigley not his big fat tragedy and hope that we've covered
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:07.280]  for many years but his other book that's equally as important that goes into the history of
[3:09:07.280 --> 3:09:12.440]  Chatham House and Pratt House and the the Rothschild Rhodes and Milner network of the
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:18.040]  Royal Institute for International Affairs the Anglo-American establishment in the Anglo-American
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:23.640]  establishment we have what is kind of the superstructure of how this conspiracy worked
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:28.520]  a hundred years ago now things are a little different nowadays we're not totally identical
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:34.960]  to this old British Imperial model it's morphed into the Pax Americana but this is the network
[3:09:34.960 --> 3:09:42.040]  that essentially reintegrated the United States into the Anglo-American establishment to create
[3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:48.960]  that Western power block which is right now what is essentially the New World Order and
[3:09:48.960 --> 3:09:57.320]  Quigley gives us a structure that is at the top you had a Rhodes Rothschild Milner elite
[3:09:57.320 --> 3:10:01.720]  and this is called the Society of the Elect and this was a secret society that Cecil Rhodes
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:07.520]  had kind of cooked up to be kind of modeled on something like Freemasonry and the Jesuits
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:13.320]  now I'm not saying that it's a Jesuit and Masonic conspiracy in this sense this is above
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:19.000]  that right these are people above the pay grade of those people who wanted to use this
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:27.160]  strategies and techniques and structure of that conspiracy which is a pyramidal model
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:33.880]  for the inner-party outer-party structure of their society and so there were a few people
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:41.880]  at the top the Society of the Elect some 12, 15, 20 people and included Lord the Astor's
[3:10:41.880 --> 3:10:50.120]  Lord Curtis Lord Balfour a lot of these lords Earl Gray Cecil Rhodes Lord Rothschild Alfred
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:56.520]  Milner Williamstead and then underneath them was an association of helpers and then underneath
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:11:01.920]  them was the outer circle so you see it was concentric circles and these concentric circles
[3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:07.880]  had need to know compartmentalized information and Quigley goes into this book discussing
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:12.440]  how they had basically taken over where they wanted to steer the British Empire and then
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:19.960]  it by extension the Anglo-American Empire and establishment so that's the superstructure
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:24.520]  you want to know who the real quote Illuminati is the real specter that's it right there
[3:11:24.520 --> 3:11:30.800]  publicly in Quigley's book and of course Quigley's other book discusses the American branch
[3:11:30.800 --> 3:11:37.280]  of this that's what tragedy and hope is about is it's a kind of a large apologetic treatise
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:43.600]  giving an account for why the CFR why the Rockefeller power structure in the U.S. which
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:49.080]  is allied with this British elite power structure in the U.K. how this superstructure wanted
[3:11:49.080 --> 3:11:57.200]  to reorganize the world into a global government it's very clear very public no doubt about
[3:11:57.200 --> 3:12:02.040]  it and that's just one key example of who was running the show a hundred years ago
[3:12:02.040 --> 3:12:07.520]  and what they had planned and it was to set up a global government so that's rule number
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:14.960]  one ten commandment number one thou shalt have no other entities or beliefs or governments
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:23.200]  or systems or allegiances other than ale hydra ale specter had specs up now what about other
[3:12:23.200 --> 3:12:29.720]  texts that align with this that show us the same idea well you probably heard me mention
[3:12:29.720 --> 3:12:36.640]  before David Rockefeller wrote a famous gigantic book called memoirs this is his whole autobiography
[3:12:36.640 --> 3:12:42.800]  of all the exploits and things that he did and how he went and did all these things in
[3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:48.920]  China when China was a communist country and how he set up the first chase bank in communist
[3:12:48.920 --> 3:12:53.080]  China and blah blah blah blah and then you probably heard of this but there's a famous
[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:57.360]  chapter towards the middle of a book called proud internationalist and proud internationalist
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:02.640]  is the chapter where he says that my whole family we were always dedicated to setting
[3:13:02.640 --> 3:13:07.440]  up a global government I'm proud of that and if you want to call it a conspiracy I don't
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:12.760]  really care it's not a conspiracy because it's open it's the open conspiracy he says
[3:13:12.760 --> 3:13:16.280]  that when you look at entities like the council in foreign relations when you look at entities
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:22.360]  like the builder bird group he says these are all part of the network that we set up indeed
[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:27.520]  his family donated the land for the United Nations and so everything that you're seeing
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:33.360]  come out of this these networks these global trilateral commission style networks these
[3:13:33.360 --> 3:13:40.400]  steering committees these groups this is the eastern seaboard elites branch of the same
[3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:44.840]  thing going on with what Quigley is talking about in the Anglo-American establishment
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:49.120]  and it's all there in those two books so we can see right away that there's clearly a
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:57.600]  call for an international global government run by this same power structure another text
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:04.600]  that we covered last time that talks about this was the HD Wells texts that you heard
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:13.640]  me doing all my rants about I was the neural order right in fact HD Wells was a propagandist
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:18.960]  for this same power structure right he was working as a propagandist at the best of this
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:24.640]  exact same elite in this case in the UK the UK branch of this superstructure that I was
[3:14:24.640 --> 3:14:29.800]  talking about and he was also very open about this this is not a conspiracy theory it's
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:36.960]  the what open conspiracy so when people try to understand geopolitics to try to understand
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:41.560]  how the world really works how are you going to do it if you don't know about this hundred
[3:14:41.560 --> 3:14:48.000]  plus year plan that is it right now being enacted in front of us if you've not read these books
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:51.480]  you wouldn't know that right and by the way people that go and study international relations
[3:14:51.480 --> 3:14:55.120]  they don't read these books they don't read David Rockefeller's memoirs they don't read
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:15:00.400]  Carol Quigley they read whatever they're told to read by their sanitized compartmentalized
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:07.760]  professors so here you have again people sort of in the outer sphere HD Wells would be one
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:12.400]  of the helpers of this elite right he's not at the top of the pyramid he's one of the
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:18.720]  helpers that would be committed to this number one commandment here the necessity to bring
[3:15:18.720 --> 3:15:24.800]  in a global government and you'll notice that at this level the allegiances transcend national
[3:15:24.800 --> 3:15:28.880]  boundaries or ideologies now there's some ideologies that's what we're doing here in
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:35.680]  the 10 points but the the allegiance here the ideology here is nothing parochial nothing
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:40.640]  provincial nothing religious except ultimately there is a kind of religion here which we'll
[3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:47.280]  see in a little bit but no it's number one you have to be committed to a global government
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:51.120]  and so when we come back we'll look at some more examples what are the other nine commandments
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:55.120]  here at the Alex Jones show don't go anywhere I'm your guest host J. Dyer J's analysis dot
[3:15:55.120 --> 3:16:01.680]  com the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:06.800]  poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[3:16:06.800 --> 3:16:12.400]  we're weak but because we're made the image of God the creator and we are powerful and the
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:18.000]  social engineers fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:25.760]  nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:31.920]  if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:38.960]  and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:43.520]  on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:48.000]  them full wars in the air now more than ever because even if you don't believe in God what the
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:53.440]  globalist are manifesting and setting up is J. Dyer and we are opposing the one world government
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:59.280]  and the mark of the beast they just announced the powerful combination of both vitamin c and

[3:20:12.640 --> 3:20:15.760]  welcome back to the alex jones from your guest host jen dyer of jason else's we're talking about
[3:20:15.760 --> 3:20:22.720]  the 10 commandments of the global elite how to accurately in a helpful way well a helpful way
[3:20:22.720 --> 3:20:30.880]  characterize the overall dogmas the 10 commandments that if you're a member of this nefarious click
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:39.280]  you cannot question what you must be in agreement with in the number two 10 commandment of the elite
[3:20:39.280 --> 3:20:46.560]  is global medicine there needs to be a global medical apparatus by which everybody's biosecurity
[3:20:46.560 --> 3:20:54.800]  can be controlled determined and even hacked and you could go back to writings like julian huxley of
[3:20:54.800 --> 3:21:00.720]  the huxley family he wrote the philosophy of unesco this is the essay that really sets forth the whole
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:07.440]  attitude of what this body this this cultural wrecking ball of the united nations this arm of
[3:21:07.440 --> 3:21:14.880]  the elite here its purpose and its philosophy he says is ultimately to kind of recast the bad
[3:21:14.880 --> 3:21:20.560]  propaganda light that eugenics got as a result of world war two since we can't really use that
[3:21:20.560 --> 3:21:27.120]  word anymore we'll move on to other ideas like biometrics right biosecurity ultimately which
[3:21:27.120 --> 3:21:33.760]  we just saw in the the document that we did on human augmentation last week now we're going to
[3:21:33.760 --> 3:21:42.640]  have a new approach to recasting eugenics as a kind of technocratic global health situation so now
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:49.520]  it's your your genome you're really this this virus machine right and that's what we've seen
[3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:54.000]  in the last couple years and that idea really goes back to what huxley's talking about here
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:22:02.560]  in rebranding eugenics into and racial hygiene into a biometrics biosecurity state that's also
[3:22:02.560 --> 3:22:07.120]  something that one of the global elite wrote in his books a long time ago that we talked about
[3:22:07.120 --> 3:22:12.560]  free tough cop right and turning point in multiple chapters in here discussing about about how the
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:19.840]  the medical system would really be the angle through which the the global elite would bring
[3:22:19.840 --> 3:22:25.200]  this world order in because it's another way if you think about you know the first global
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:28.960]  revolution which is one of these documents that the elite put out from the global realm talking
[3:22:28.960 --> 3:22:36.320]  about pollution right will invent and use this idea of pollution as the way to steer and change
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:43.520]  and alter human societies attitudes towards itself the same idea comes up in copra that now you begin
[3:22:43.520 --> 3:22:50.720]  to see that it's it's it's health that is the key fear factor here if we can make health all about
[3:22:51.360 --> 3:22:57.360]  fear make everybody into hypochondriacs basically then we'll have a key way to bring in this new
[3:22:57.360 --> 3:23:02.880]  world order through global medicine and remember what do we just see in that human augmentation
[3:23:02.880 --> 3:23:08.320]  document what did it say it said that in the future we're already here basically but in the future
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:16.960]  by 2030 2050 you'll have the idea of health will be subsumed under biosecurity and and that's another
[3:23:16.960 --> 3:23:22.240]  way to get rid of individual rights and medical freedom because now oh we just don't understand
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:26.400]  it that way anymore because you're part of a collective right you don't have a right to your
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:32.080]  own health because your health is now a potential bioweapon i'm not joking right so you want to
[3:23:32.080 --> 3:23:37.600]  understand a big part of what's going on right now with the last two years of stuff with the
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:45.600]  kufid and the stabby's it's part of that it's making human health part of biosecurity ultimately
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:51.760]  subsuming it and as the human augmentation document says we'll have to just alter everyone's ethic
[3:23:51.760 --> 3:23:57.760]  to understand that that's the old way of thinking everything has evolved and mutated now and we're
[3:23:57.760 --> 3:24:03.200]  all just you know we're all toxic avengers now we're all just mutants and we just can't have
[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:09.680]  mutants running around mutating everywhere you're a danger you're a potential risk what are the
[3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:14.320]  what are the nato cognitive warfare documents say remember that one it said oh well you might
[3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:18.880]  actually be an enemy combatant without even knowing it so if you've been exposed to things
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:25.120]  on the internet you're a potential enemy combatant by which the establishment must target you with
[3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:34.080]  disinformation and psyopsin psychological warfare so global medicine in its subsumes it being subsumed
[3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:42.080]  under things like big pharma was a key element a key angle in this medical tyranny to be brought in
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:46.400]  as one of the ten commandments of the global elite and they all discussed this by the way
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:55.360]  ten commandment number three what's one of the key commandments the dogmas that you cannot
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:25:00.240]  question if you want to join this nefarious elite key commandment number three would be
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:08.000]  the necessity for a global economy and a global currency and an end to individual enterprise
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:13.520]  and trade now you may say well wait a minute why would they want that because don't the don't the
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:19.680]  elite aren't they neoliberal free market proponents they were for a time period and once that built
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:25.920]  this giant engine this this big superstructure of a global economy that's when it needs to flip over
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:31.760]  into the lockdown phase so yes in a sense there was a long time period from you know Adam Smith
[3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:37.440]  on up to where we had this uh at least somewhat of an open market and somewhat of a freedom-based
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:44.160]  approach a lies a lies a fair boat a base approach at least in principle in theory to economics
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:51.520]  and that allowed for uh the interlocking global order that we now have but as hg well says and
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:55.600]  this is something a lot of people have overlooked they've missed this and it comes up in one of
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:26:00.960]  his other texts that i'm a covered here on uh alex's audience yet but i've covered it on other
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:09.040]  talks that i've done and that's in the book uh open conspiracy he talks about how the world
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:16.880]  government is really something beyond the libertarian versus communist dialectic and it's not that um
[3:26:17.760 --> 3:26:21.760]  libertarianism and the people involved in that were all bad and it's not that people who are
[3:26:21.760 --> 3:26:26.400]  opposed to it are all necessarily good or bad but rather that these are two systems built on
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:31.520]  materialism they're both systems that come out of and presuppose enlightenment materialism
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:39.440]  and so the danger here is that the power that you have within a libertarian lies a fair market
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:46.000]  is that it can or it can build it can it can construct these superstructures something like
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:53.520]  big tech that then can be turned into a means by which to enslave and hg wells although i
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:59.040]  completely disagree with him he was in terms of his philosophy his worldview he was uh
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:04.320]  insightful enough to understand and he actually rebuked the marxists of his of his day to say
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:09.280]  that don't you idiots understand that it's global capitalism that will build the superstructure
[3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:15.760]  that we will take over to then bring in the new world order the technocracy that's what he says
[3:27:15.760 --> 3:27:20.640]  he says don't worry so much about defeating the capitalists just let them build the superstructure
[3:27:20.640 --> 3:27:27.280]  and then we will just simply utilize the technocratic order from within exactly i mean why do you
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:33.840]  think again the wealthiest people on the planet support marxism socialism fascism and these control
[3:27:33.840 --> 3:27:38.320]  structures is precisely for the very things i'm telling you because there is a plan it's the
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:43.520]  same plan plow says the exact same things hg wells says a hundred years ago you'll own nothing you'll
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:49.280]  have nothing you'll be happy that's just basic bitch communism that's what hg wells said a hundred
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:56.640]  years ago right but you said but but they're not communists because the wealthiest people on the
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:03.520]  planet support communism just get that through your head okay so the global currency is absolutely
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:09.360]  necessary and this is another thing that we've seen in uh the writings like uh birch and rustle
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:14.480]  birch and rustle's books right he says that there'll be a global credit score he said this a hundred
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:19.040]  years ago back at the time of hg wells and his writings he says that you'll get a dole you'll
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:24.720]  be on the the global dole right mark zuckerberg will have you on the dole all you're gonna do is
[3:28:24.720 --> 3:28:30.000]  swipe your ebt it's gonna be great everything's free it's gonna be a great it's gonna be ubi
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:34.240]  that's my mark zuckerberg and he's just saying exactly what birch and rustle said a hundred years
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:41.040]  ago in the impact of science on society and in the scientific outlook that uh as the
[3:28:41.040 --> 3:28:46.320]  technocracy comes about the world government he says there will be a global economy that will
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:52.640]  restrict and prevent anyone from doing their own trade and their own economy there'll be a global
[3:28:52.640 --> 3:29:02.160]  economy well here we are in the year 2022 and info wars is now more important than it's ever been

[3:33:01.840 --> 3:33:14.960]  Alex Jones welcome back to the oxygen show on your guest host jdyer of jays analysis we're covering
[3:33:14.960 --> 3:33:19.360]  the 10 commandments of the global elite and we were just talking about the global currency
[3:33:20.080 --> 3:33:25.280]  the idea of a completely controlled tracked and traced economy which we had seen was spoken of
[3:33:25.280 --> 3:33:32.240]  back in the 20s and 30s by Bertrand Russell was identical to the very things that 100 years later
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:37.680]  right we see in claus's 2018 book shaping of the fourth industrial revolution where he talks about
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:44.640]  a completely tracked and traced and carbon allotment based economy which essentially shuts down
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:51.680]  production shuts down growth and that's because this is an austerity based model and that's the
[3:33:51.680 --> 3:33:57.680]  whole point of controlling the economy controlling the flow of energy because that's about reducing
[3:33:57.680 --> 3:34:03.280]  the population energy control the energy sector the climate control the climate lockdowns all
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:11.200]  that is is just another way to reduce population massively by 2030 to 2050 so what's the fifth
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:16.800]  global commandment after there excuse me the fourth the global brain the global skynet
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:25.120]  the interlinked human borg operation where everybody is part of this giant hive mind where
[3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:30.320]  have we seen that well we've actually seen that in many of these elite of course everybody knows
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:35.760]  about ray Kurzweil right ray Kurzweil wrote the singularity is near as well as the age of spiritual
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:41.280]  machines promoting transhumanism many years ago and then you know as we've covered here as Alex
[3:34:41.280 --> 3:34:47.040]  has covered for at least 20 years why the future doesn't need us by bill joy who went to one of
[3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:51.280]  these meetings at the silicon valley elite where they discussed the creation of this post human
[3:34:51.280 --> 3:34:56.720]  global brain order and that not everybody would be allowed into that future a lot of people have
[3:34:56.720 --> 3:35:03.440]  been gotten rid of a lot of people got got to be deleted and so this why the future doesn't need us
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:10.560]  texts from the year 2000 by bill joy is really again imperfect harmony with what claus writes
[3:35:10.560 --> 3:35:16.880]  about in 1820 years later in the fourth industrial revolution saying the exact same things and this
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:22.480]  whole idea of using brain chips integrating everybody into a global brain is something that
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:28.320]  other elites have written about many years ago in 2006 Jacques Attali the Kissinger of France he
[3:35:28.320 --> 3:35:33.600]  wrote brief history of the future and in this text Jacques Attali says all of humanity will
[3:35:33.600 --> 3:35:39.920]  be integrated into what he calls a golem brain hive mind he says the transhumanists are the
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:44.720]  vanguard of this new world order and really what they're preparing everybody for is the integration
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:53.120]  into this global brain this will be affected eventually by a global skynet basically he says
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:35:57.600]  that everybody will be a part of this and you won't be able to opt out because if you're
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:03.440]  allied by then it will be mandated remember what did the uk ministry of defense document that we
[3:36:03.440 --> 3:36:08.960]  just read the human augmentation document say it said it will be mandated governments will
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:14.480]  mandate it and they will have to just update their notion of ethics ethics will get a revision
[3:36:15.440 --> 3:36:20.000]  by just pointing out that will everything evolves ethics evolve so just tell that just
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:25.520]  tell the experts to tell everybody that the ethics have evolved and all the sheeple will believe it
[3:36:26.720 --> 3:36:30.000]  remember that's what this document says human augmentation dawn of new paradigm
[3:36:30.640 --> 3:36:37.200]  governments will mandate the microchipping or nano chipping of the population doesn't have to be a
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:44.880]  microchip doesn't have to be RFID can be something beyond that and yeah exactly that's when that's
[3:36:44.880 --> 3:36:48.640]  where this gets over into more of a religious commitment on the part of some of these people to
[3:36:48.640 --> 3:36:54.800]  a luciferian idea of transhumanism but as you can see multiple people even back to the 40s and 50s
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:37:00.640]  you had eyes you had Isaac Asimov talking about the global brain you have people like Philip K. Dick
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:05.200]  running science fiction because he was in the circles of the people in Silicon Valley about
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:12.640]  this global brain being linked into this matrix hive mind and that of course can overlap with the
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:19.840]  ideas of the metaverse number five what's the next global elite commandment that you must
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:26.400]  believe in you must submit to you must be a part of well in my list I included the idea of a global
[3:37:26.400 --> 3:37:33.520]  religion part of this superstructure here is the not just the rewrite of everybody's biology but
[3:37:33.520 --> 3:37:43.200]  every aspect of human society the human domain must be taken over and given a new overlay and that
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:48.640]  includes religion and really what's needed is a religion that's amenable to the elite themselves
[3:37:48.640 --> 3:37:55.120]  something that might in a subtle way promote transhumanism promote the depot promote the
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:00.160]  stabby's promote the mRNA experimentation all of these types of things need to be
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:09.520]  be in a subtle way promoted through the new global religion and when we go into works that have
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:14.960]  chronicled these same elite families we know that one of the families that comes to the fore in this
[3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:20.080]  is the Rockefellers themselves in their authorized biography there's multiple chapters where the
[3:38:20.080 --> 3:38:24.960]  Rockefellers essentially created the ecumenist movement they put the money the engine and the
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:32.160]  power into ecumenism to turn it into something that could be marshaled into a basically making
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:38.960]  religion into a form of an NGO how can we take the world religions and turn them into just
[3:38:39.760 --> 3:38:46.400]  just basically evangelists for the new world order well this is how right and this is what they did
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:38:50.400]  and many other books have been written but I mean this even comes up in brzezinski right
[3:38:50.400 --> 3:38:54.960]  brzezinski is between two ages he's got chapters in the beginning where he talks about using
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:39:01.360]  Roman Catholicism using the church using other religions as well as part of this global
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:09.120]  superstructure and unfortunately during the Cold War a big part of the co-opting of superstructures
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:15.360]  like the Roman Catholic religion as David Wim Hof notes in his book John Courtney Murray
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:21.120]  Time, Life and the American Proposition this is where the the CIA and the Jesuits have played a
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:28.560]  key role in co-opting a in large part the Roman Catholic infrastructure and superstructure to
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:34.720]  become an engine of Americanism under the guise of fighting the Soviets in the Cold War now again
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:38.960]  understand that I'm trying to be nuanced here that doesn't mean the Soviets are the good guys
[3:39:38.960 --> 3:39:47.200]  but the over emphasis on that the the power play of the Soviet Union is what allowed Reagan the
[3:39:47.200 --> 3:39:53.200]  moral majority a lot of these faux right wingers during these Cold Warriors to co-opt a lot of
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:59.280]  the American religious institutions into fighting on the side of the CIA and then becoming basically
[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:05.200]  subservient to their new masters the CIA so again it's not a good guy bad guy it's a power
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:13.120]  structure it's power dynamics that's all I'm saying and so what happens is that you get the
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:19.680]  co-opting of the religion to turn it into an engine of the state and that's the problem here is that
[3:40:20.320 --> 3:40:23.920]  it might have seemed good to a lot of people during the Cold War well shouldn't we fight the
[3:40:23.920 --> 3:40:29.520]  atheistic Soviet Empire okay but then what happens is that now you're under the superstructure that
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:37.120]  is just as atheistic just as globalist and just as committed to its version of a technocratic world
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:47.120]  order as the Soviets might have been so the false dialectic of the Cold War was also another way
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:54.480]  to get the religions onto the side of Western technocracy under the Anglo-American establishment
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:41:00.480]  and if you want to understand that the collapse of the religions in America in the 20th century
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:04.080]  you need to look no further than this the Rockefellers bought off all the Protestant
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:08.080]  seminaries and churches they poured millions and millions of dollars into the Protestant
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:12.480]  seminaries and churches through their entities like the World Council of Churches the National
[3:41:12.480 --> 3:41:18.720]  Council of Churches they created and funded and fostered this ecumenist movement which has now
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:26.880]  given way to the erection of that we're in the early the beta stages of this emerging global
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:32.800]  religion of as you saw earlier the Abrahamic faith house where Islam Judaism and Christianity oh
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:39.360]  they're actually all part of a giant perennialist super religion that's exactly the very thing
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:44.480]  that the the Rockefellers were had put millions and millions of dollars into a hundred years ago
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:50.080]  to getting this off the ground they even built their own cathedral committed to a global new
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:59.040]  religion Riverside Church so this global religion has to promote point number six in the in the
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:05.040]  Ten Commandments Malthusianism or depopulation now again we saw that rebranded that's a mean
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:09.920]  term we can't use those mean terms anymore out of World War two now we got to use words like
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:17.760]  biosecurity health biometrics that's all rebranding of dysgenics and eugenics and depopulation
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:24.480]  radical Malthusianism down to the point of 90 to 95 percent or all of the planet being removed
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:30.000]  in terms of humans let's get rid of all the humans okay that's point number six I don't
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:33.840]  don't think I should have to go into that I mean this one is so well known that it's literally in
[3:42:33.840 --> 3:42:41.200]  every global elite book I mean you couldn't find a single global elite writer who denies the necessity
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:47.360]  of mass depopulation great example of this is the next million years by Charles Galton Darwin a
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:52.880]  radical Malthusian in the same circles as Wells and Russell who says we got to kill everybody
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:42:58.240]  we got to kill everybody don't go anywhere this is the option whether they were present that day
[3:42:58.240 --> 3:43:04.640]  or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy insurrection we will follow
[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:12.720]  the facts wherever they lead domestic terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the
[3:43:12.720 --> 3:43:18.560]  government has made it illegal to oppose them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:24.560]  they want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly with practically half the population
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:30.080]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps the traders know they can shut us down by force
[3:43:30.720 --> 3:43:37.360]  but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially so be it make them silence us by force
[3:43:37.920 --> 3:43:45.760]  this is the final battle of the information war give now buy products donate before everything
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:55.200]  changes we need you to carry us through to the end victory or death go now to infowarstore.com
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:44:00.320]  the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:06.240]  free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:11.440]  trying to create a post-human world from the united states of brazil and of course triggered by the
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:16.800]  bricks in the uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government
[3:44:16.800 --> 3:44:22.720]  that's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of build back
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:29.280]  better this is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:34.560]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:40.240]  ideology of this world government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon on us
[3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:46.080]  now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't
[3:44:46.080 --> 3:44:50.480]  maybe it's because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate combine released
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:56.960]  COVID-19 and you know the rest is history expose this paradigm and we win reset war
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:08.160]  really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily
[3:45:08.160 --> 3:45:14.320]  go across political lines or religious lines but about all of us as a human species coming together
[3:45:14.320 --> 3:45:20.080]  i'm a combat veteran and i mean that brought me close to god but what alex goes through
[3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:25.520]  brought me even closer i can feel god in my life now the viruses that alex talks to you about that
[3:45:25.520 --> 3:45:31.600]  are subconsciously programmed into your brain and how to erase those programs and install new
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:36.800]  reset wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular info wars broadcasts it's an
[3:45:36.800 --> 3:45:41.600]  academic level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:46.240]  and self-determined life if you're on the fence about reset wars it's time to get off the fence
[3:45:46.240 --> 3:45:52.000]  join reset wars today
[3:45:55.360 --> 3:46:00.080]  let's go ahead take another call let's talk to malcom in tennessee welcome hello alex yes
[3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:04.320]  malcom all right i'll make this quick and real short where the other patricks can get on the
[3:46:04.320 --> 3:46:09.920]  line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host owin shroyer super male
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:15.440]  vitality and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank super
[3:46:15.440 --> 3:46:20.560]  male vitality really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:26.800]  never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:31.600]  work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:35.440]  each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like
[3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:38.720]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:44.640]  how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong
[3:46:44.640 --> 3:46:52.240]  but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it
[3:46:52.240 --> 3:47:03.120]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:17.600]  we were talking about the 10 commandments of the global elite and we'd gotten to number six the
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:22.960]  malthusian idea that we must write with the radical idea that we must kill off most of the
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:30.000]  population of the of the of the earth in order to save the planet and uh you know we we've done
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:34.320]  multiple examples of the father the father of inoculations himself for example right jones
[3:47:34.320 --> 3:47:39.760]  salt wrote the survival of the wisest where he posits that uh inoculation would would be a key
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:46.080]  way to experiment on the population and perhaps drastically reduce the population in the future
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:51.920]  so you can make of that what you will i think it's pretty obvious what's uh what's going on there
[3:47:54.560 --> 3:48:00.160]  and that's not unique to him obviously every you know the rockfiller foundation the population
[3:48:00.160 --> 3:48:05.360]  council that's all state department memorandum 200 i all of that comes out of the same superstructure
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:10.640]  which believes in just like the philosophy unesco said getting rid of most people on the earth
[3:48:10.640 --> 3:48:17.840]  and connected to that number commandment number six is the seventh commandment which is
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:25.200]  transhumanism or post humanism the idea that the future is not for everyone but in the next
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:30.080]  million years a million years like anybody knows what's happening in a million years right the
[3:48:30.080 --> 3:48:37.280]  arrogance of these people like charles galtin darwin said the future will be for the elite alone
[3:48:37.280 --> 3:48:42.720]  alone and they will evolve into being god beings okay this is where it starts to get religious
[3:48:42.720 --> 3:48:47.680]  and you can see why i call it the 10 commandments of the elite just like ray curtsvile right the
[3:48:47.680 --> 3:48:53.600]  singularity oh you see we will the elite will evolve into these ubermench these nichian ubermench
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:49:02.720]  the obermen through the secrets that we learn through darpa right darpa the uh advanced research
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:08.480]  projects agency agency which gives us really the internet the arpa net which becomes darpa net
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:13.280]  which becomes internet if you read you know mainline histories by people like n.e. jakison
[3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:18.400]  into the pentagon's brain you'll find out that really this was about transhumanism it was always
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:25.120]  about figuring out how to fix man and fix nature and when you understand that mad scientist kind of
[3:49:25.120 --> 3:49:29.840]  attitude towards not just man but the entire biosphere you can see why they would do the
[3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:34.640]  things they've been doing you can see why they would say we need synthetic biology to rewrite
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:40.800]  humanity we need to fix man man is the problem from their view but it's not man as the problem in a
[3:49:40.800 --> 3:49:47.120]  kind of a metaphysical religious or ethical view it's man is the problem in a physical chemical
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:53.280]  view man is just a bag of molecules and so the way that you fix a bag of molecules is by throwing
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:50:01.040]  more chemicals at it hence the idea as curtswell has that you can just tweak the machine to fix
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:07.520]  the machine and man can become this immortal machine all of which is clearly a dilution and
[3:50:07.520 --> 3:50:11.680]  based on all kinds of philosophical assumptions but these people don't they don't care about
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:19.200]  philosophy it's all about scientism and so again you can go from the history of uh you know science
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:23.840]  fiction writers a hundred years ago to what claus is saying nowadays and he's literally saying the
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:31.520]  last third of this book is about the integrating humans into skynet using the crisper gene technology
[3:50:31.520 --> 3:50:39.200]  to rewrite the human genome to fix it supposedly but this fixing it really just means integrating
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:45.520]  everybody into the global brain while the global elite themselves supposedly become gods i'm not
[3:50:45.520 --> 3:50:50.560]  joking so that's the belief that they have that's their attitude and it's a lucifering religious
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:55.840]  kind of attitude and that's why it's sometimes referred to as post humanism that's what we saw
[3:50:55.840 --> 3:51:02.480]  the the uh nato excuse me not nato the british minister of defense human augmentation document
[3:51:02.480 --> 3:51:08.880]  talked about altering humans to be part of the global brain and then ultimately this will be
[3:51:08.880 --> 3:51:14.800]  mandated and that this global machine this global this the borg basically the hive right if you
[3:51:14.800 --> 3:51:20.960]  watch star trek you know by the board this will be post human and the rest of humanity will be
[3:51:20.960 --> 3:51:27.520]  gotten rid of and so it's a synthetic replacement a silicon-based replacement of human beings and
[3:51:27.520 --> 3:51:34.400]  human biology with this new order and that comes up even decades ago in brzezinski's box it's in
[3:51:34.400 --> 3:51:38.640]  jocats elites and all of these people's writings arthur castler goes to the machine as well
[3:51:39.920 --> 3:51:43.840]  and that leads to number eight one of the key ways that they would get this through
[3:51:43.840 --> 3:51:50.080]  would be education we need global education education can't be had by families you can have
[3:51:50.080 --> 3:51:56.000]  homeschooling you can't have christian schools you can't have any of this kind of stuff you can't have
[3:51:56.800 --> 3:52:01.520]  religious education that isn't subservient to not just the state but the super state
[3:52:03.120 --> 3:52:09.600]  and they succeeded in co-opting and basically controlling american education long ago long
[3:52:09.600 --> 3:52:17.040]  ago in fact the very origins of american public education was all founded by socialists william
[3:52:17.040 --> 3:52:24.400]  james john dewey chris man all of those guys were avowed and they actually spoke of public
[3:52:24.400 --> 3:52:32.560]  education as a form of social of utopian socialism and their idea was that no longer should education
[3:52:32.560 --> 3:52:38.640]  be about teaching individuals to think to learn to become critical thinkers on their own education
[3:52:38.640 --> 3:52:45.280]  would have to be commandeered into a unesco style socializing operation and this was again
[3:52:45.280 --> 3:52:50.080]  this is not they didn't the liberals didn't just take over education 20 years ago 30 years ago
[3:52:50.080 --> 3:52:55.360]  this is 100 years ago the founders of public education said the purpose of public education
[3:52:55.360 --> 3:53:00.960]  is not education it's not reading writing an arithmetic it is socialization they all wrote
[3:53:00.960 --> 3:53:10.240]  books about it man dewey all of them the founder of kindergarten said that kindergarten is a penta
[3:53:10.240 --> 3:53:16.480]  cost to bring in a new world order i'm not joking and all kindergarten was was another way to have
[3:53:16.480 --> 3:53:23.200]  the state running and managing your kids from the earliest days now the answer is not it's not the
[3:53:23.200 --> 3:53:28.960]  state it's the private owned state this is where the libertarians can't figure this out when it when
[3:53:28.960 --> 3:53:34.640]  you hear the state that's the corporate owned state that's the Rockefeller bought off state
[3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:42.080]  many many 100 years ago so the answer is not just libertarianism then David Rockefeller's
[3:53:42.080 --> 3:53:48.000]  a libertarian he studied under von Hayek he wrote his thesis under von Hayek
[3:53:51.600 --> 3:53:56.640]  global education would be the key by which you could bring in this global order by
[3:53:56.640 --> 3:54:02.480]  every generation of youth getting a more radical update in their education and that's been going
[3:54:02.480 --> 3:54:07.440]  on for 100 years right every generation that's younger and younger and younger that comes on
[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:12.480]  to the scene has a more radical education and now when you look at education today you're just
[3:54:12.480 --> 3:54:18.480]  seeing the latest instantiation of the perpetual revolution to change the mind of the youth so
[3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:24.560]  that they grow up into being global citizens so education was crucial to this plan and they
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:31.120]  succeeded in doing that long before even Reagan and you know Charlotte Iservits works okay I'm not
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:36.240]  saying that she's wrong she's right right if you read Charlotte Iservits works about the
[3:54:36.240 --> 3:54:42.000]  subversion of the American education system even back in the 80s it was a but it was way longer
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:49.840]  earlier than that number nine the ninth commandment of the global elite and the family every elite
[3:54:49.840 --> 3:54:59.200]  writer every globalist says the family must go why well the family instills elements of nature
[3:54:59.200 --> 3:55:05.920]  into the child's relationship to society and to structures and to order so a mother and a father
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:12.800]  the mother archetype the father archetype instill into the child attitudes and normativity towards
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:18.640]  their own future and their own biological reproductive potentialities if you destroy the
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:23.280]  family what happens is that there were you don't get rid of the archetypes of mother and father
[3:55:23.280 --> 3:55:30.320]  the archetypes are replaced by the state the nanny state big brother they take the role
[3:55:31.120 --> 3:55:37.600]  of mom and dad and become the providers they become the new archetypal control structure and
[3:55:37.600 --> 3:55:43.920]  that's exactly why Orwell was so prescient to make big brother big brother and why there's that nanny
[3:55:43.920 --> 3:55:49.200]  state those are archetypes right of man and female mom and dad and if you remember when we
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:54.000]  covered the silent weapons for quiet wars document the very last section was all about
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:59.840]  how the draft was a classic example of the manipulation of archetypes to get boys to go
[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:04.800]  and die and for dads to give their sons up and for moms to give their sons and daughters up
[3:56:04.800 --> 3:56:11.840]  to war as a sacrifice to the god state and that then the state becomes the replacement
[3:56:11.840 --> 3:56:15.680]  mother and father figure especially when you look at things like the welfare state
[3:56:16.880 --> 3:56:22.240]  the document says that's the purpose of the welfare state is to ultimately erase the family
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:27.520]  and if you're going to get rid of mom and dad you just replace it with the state now that doesn't
[3:56:27.520 --> 3:56:32.480]  mean there can't be programs that help people out or something like that that could be done at a
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:37.360]  local level that could be the churches that do that kind of thing but this is much more sophisticated
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:41.920]  than that okay this is not a libertarian versus the state type of question it's way more sophisticated
[3:56:41.920 --> 3:56:46.400]  than that where it's about long-term social engineering to destroy the family something
[3:56:46.400 --> 3:56:52.400]  hd wells said a hundred years ago have to go and that gets to number 10 which is the control of
[3:56:52.400 --> 3:57:02.720]  bloodlines and genetics such that certain people and their progeny are ended and so the biometrics
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:08.160]  the biosecurity state i believe in terms of the document human augmentation right in terms of
[3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:14.480]  what claus talks about with gene editing and crisper that's to make sure that you can control
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:20.240]  and end not just this group or that group but ultimately all the groups so that there's only
[3:57:20.240 --> 3:57:24.720]  a very select few that go into the future and that's what we see in the georgia guide stones right
[3:57:24.720 --> 3:57:29.200]  it says down to 500 million and ultimately that's probably too many right they're going to get it
[3:57:29.200 --> 3:57:35.680]  smaller than that so controlling through biometrics in the biosecurity state the human genome is one
[3:57:35.680 --> 3:57:39.680]  of the top 10 commandments of the global league this is jay dyer of jays analysis you can go
