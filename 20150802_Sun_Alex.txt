[00:00.000 --> 00:27.840]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday August 2nd 2015 I'm David Knight I'll be your
[00:27.840 --> 00:32.880]  host today we're going to be joined by Alex Jones with some special reports coming up in the next
[00:32.880 --> 00:39.920]  segment as well as a special remembrance of Roddy Piper who died suddenly on Friday we're all very
[00:39.920 --> 00:46.960]  sad to hear that we're going to look at his impact on society the man was not only an entertainer
[00:46.960 --> 00:53.120]  he was also someone who was a patriot and also someone who was a family man beloved by his family
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.760]  and he loved his family we're going to look at those things Alex has a tribute to him and we're
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.800]  going to look at a special report about how selling baby parts is evidently the way the
[01:02.800 --> 01:08.160]  government is acting a state secret well it's no secret that they have a vested interest
[01:08.160 --> 01:11.840]  with Planned Parenthood those in the Obama administration we're going to look at articles
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.960]  from info wars exposing that and of course yesterday talking about financial hooks into
[01:16.960 --> 01:23.680]  politicians we had five GOP presidential hopefuls go hat in hand to the Koch brothers
[01:23.680 --> 01:31.680]  looking for money very interesting retort from Donald Trump calling them puppets we're
[01:31.680 --> 01:35.840]  going to take a look at that we're going to take a look at the presidential race along with
[01:36.400 --> 01:42.080]  the borders with immigration we're also going to look at some hopeful news about global warming
[01:43.600 --> 01:49.120]  now it's not that it's not happening but if it is happening one of the first places to go under
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.080]  is going to be Washington DC according to them so we can keep our fingers crossed I don't believe
[01:54.080 --> 01:57.840]  it for a moment we're going to expose some of the phony science behind it but we're also going to
[01:57.840 --> 02:03.680]  look at something that could be very good news it's just that it's going to take far too long
[02:03.680 --> 02:09.440]  according to their projections but when we go back and we look at the political race and we're
[02:09.440 --> 02:11.920]  talking about what's going to be coming up this week it's going to be you're going to hear a lot
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.720]  about this this week we're going to have not only the event that happened yesterday the Koch brothers
[02:16.720 --> 02:21.440]  but of course it's going to be the very first debate presidential debate on the Republican side
[02:21.440 --> 02:27.840]  this Thursday I believe it is but already many people as we talked about this last week I found
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.560]  many people were incredibly angry with what I had to say in terms of vetting Donald Trump you see
[02:33.360 --> 02:39.360]  the election in many people's eyes is already over and there's only one man who can be a savior
[02:39.920 --> 02:45.920]  have we heard this story before is this the song we heard with Barack Obama from the Democrats
[02:45.920 --> 02:54.560]  before this is a PSYOP test folks elections are a test of whether or not you're really capable
[02:54.560 --> 03:01.360]  of self-government can you see through this PSYOP can you see that they not only live but they lie
[03:01.360 --> 03:08.960]  we're talking about Roddy Piper the true thing to take away from this election is that they lie do
[03:08.960 --> 03:16.240]  you really think things would have been any different if we'd had Mitt Romney instead of Obama do you
[03:16.240 --> 03:20.640]  think we would have had Obamacare of course he would they would have just branded it Romney care
[03:20.640 --> 03:28.720]  the fix was in folks Romney had already worked with Ted Kennedy to get Romney care put in to
[03:28.720 --> 03:34.400]  Massachusetts when he was governor they patterned Obamacare after it they had already set up the
[03:34.400 --> 03:41.520]  system with a guy on both sides you want a black guy or you want a white guy do you want a woman
[03:41.520 --> 03:46.240]  do you want somebody else this is like the cast of Gilligan's Island when I look at these people
[03:46.240 --> 03:50.480]  that went to the Koch brothers when we're going to look at the debates that happen later this week
[03:50.480 --> 03:54.080]  it's time for you to take a look at what the candidates are saying it's time for you to like
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.360]  take a look at who they are but it's also time for us to grow up and understand that although we
[03:59.360 --> 04:04.720]  need to understand what's happening nationally and globally we need to think along those lines to
[04:04.720 --> 04:11.520]  see the big picture we can really only effectively work at the local level and so we're going to
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.960]  take a look at jury nullification a very important case happened I think this week it only affected
[04:16.960 --> 04:23.440]  the life of one family it was very important to them but I think it's another example of how people
[04:23.440 --> 04:29.360]  can take back their lives take back their communities stand up to the government and of course it's
[04:29.360 --> 04:35.200]  going to be not only jury nullification but it's going to be state nullification if we think that
[04:35.200 --> 04:41.280]  we're going to be carried on a feather bed to a state of liberty from a state of tyranny we are
[04:41.280 --> 04:57.600]  delusional they lie stay with us we'll be right back with Alex Jones with Roddy Piper tributes and more
[04:58.800 --> 05:04.480]  when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.680]  focuses directly on brain health nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy

[06:06.880 --> 06:18.880]  to god it's Alex Jones. Many historians have pointed out that history basically repeats itself
[06:18.880 --> 06:25.840]  or that it rhymes that humans go through cycles and that's why almost every historian political
[06:25.840 --> 06:32.480]  scientist on the left and the right transcending the spectrum talks about the fact that we see the
[06:32.480 --> 06:40.960]  very same build-ups that we saw before war war one and world war two and the napoleonic wars as well
[06:40.960 --> 06:46.880]  of 200 years ago but you add to that all the high tech developments and the large population
[06:47.920 --> 06:52.320]  the population back in napoleon's time wasn't even a billion it's seven and a half billion now
[06:52.320 --> 06:59.520]  you add the super weapons and some of the super technologies the equation humanity is coming to
[06:59.520 --> 07:08.560]  its Atlantis point whether Atlantis was real or not the allegory the the story is very useful to
[07:08.560 --> 07:15.840]  understand that in that legend that Plato wrote about more than 2000 years ago on an island humans
[07:15.840 --> 07:22.000]  had developed advanced technologies they'd harness gravity they could live longer they had incredible
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.960]  medicine incredible language they could basically just create things instantaneously and something
[07:28.960 --> 07:36.720]  happened and there was an explosion something much larger than Fukushima something much larger
[07:37.680 --> 07:43.600]  than what we know happened at Chernobyl or the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nakasaki
[07:44.560 --> 07:49.840]  now that said I just wanted to set the table to get folks thinking about the historical legendary
[07:49.840 --> 07:54.640]  epic moment we're reaching it's undoubtedly here and a lot of folks that haven't studied history
[07:54.640 --> 08:00.960]  sit back go oh yeah everything's fine well it's our concern about the future and trying to preserve
[08:00.960 --> 08:07.440]  peace and prosperity that keeps us from having world war three like we almost had during the
[08:07.440 --> 08:15.440]  Cuban Missile Crisis now that said we have gotten such a normalcy bias or we've gotten to where we
[08:15.440 --> 08:23.120]  are just just just so accepting that when China has mobile execution vans killing political
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.920]  dissidents and selling their organs on the world market it's not even the news issue now 20 years
[08:27.920 --> 08:37.200]  ago it was when humans are being crossed with cows and pigs so they can produce babies in utero
[08:37.200 --> 08:45.200]  inside cows to be harvested it's in academic papers it's not even in the news or it's buried in the
[08:45.200 --> 08:51.920]  BBC article and the public says that doesn't exist just like spider goats that existed for 20 years
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.360]  and they say they don't exist even though it's in the news part goat part spider we're light years
[08:57.360 --> 09:01.600]  past all that and that's one reason the elite is so arrogant as they think they're god but they're
[09:01.600 --> 09:06.080]  not now i wanted to set the table with that information because we're covering what's
[09:06.080 --> 09:09.920]  happening in europe and the police state that's sweeping it just as it's sweeping the united
[09:09.920 --> 09:14.800]  states we're going into italy today we'll be reporting live from there on the situation
[09:14.800 --> 09:22.800]  it's unfolding and the collapse of Rome as their own mayor is calling it but i wanted to talk about
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.640]  humanity and value in human life if we don't value human life nobody else will that goes without
[09:28.640 --> 09:34.960]  saying but the fact that Planned Parenthood three videos have been released admitting the buying
[09:34.960 --> 09:41.440]  and selling of baby parts and the harvesting of organs and the fact that we know that they're keeping
[09:41.440 --> 09:47.280]  from the reports we have partial birth abortion babies alive at at some clinics overseas and
[09:47.280 --> 09:53.360]  domestically and that new video was about to come out showing the vivisection of the living babies
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.000]  that could have been adopted right there that's you know the big prize of seven eight month
[09:58.880 --> 10:02.320]  pregnancy that comes in they don't tell the woman we're about to sell this for two or three or four
[10:02.320 --> 10:08.000]  thousand dollars we know some private clinics are connected to this researchers are infiltrating
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.200]  Planned Parenthood to prove they're involved and they've now gone to a federal judge appointed by
[10:13.200 --> 10:19.520]  Obama to block the release of this video so they sell it up as being about a woman's choice
[10:20.080 --> 10:25.040]  and being about you know not having overpopulation and at one level there's an argument there but
[10:25.040 --> 10:32.560]  overarching is the dehumanization overarching is the sale of organs overarching is the macabre of
[10:32.560 --> 10:40.000]  this that dehumanizes us all and the fact that it's illegal to harvest the organs of a baby and
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.960]  to sell them and I mean that's admitted and that the government's moving to block this
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.640]  and within this is a microcosm of how they would deny the Manhattan Project existed or they would
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.360]  deny La Cosa Nostra existed till the 50s everybody knows there's Italian mob now
[10:56.480 --> 11:00.640]  by calling it a conspiracy theory or they would deny that Roundup was giving people cancer
[11:00.640 --> 11:04.880]  uh life estate or they would deny that world government was being established and now we're
[11:04.880 --> 11:09.760]  under open world government with the pope announcing it one reason we're going to be going to Rome
[11:09.760 --> 11:16.160]  and talking to folks on the street people have to come to that moment and admit Alex Jones was
[11:16.160 --> 11:22.240]  right Ron Paul was right G. R. Griffin was right Aaron Russo was right Matt Drudge was right World
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.960]  Net Daily was right so many countless others that just did their research were right I don't want
[11:26.960 --> 11:34.240]  to be right I wish I was wrong but it's all true and it's worse than even we thought and where we're
[11:34.240 --> 11:39.520]  going is a very horrible place the reason they're banning free speech in areas like Spain the reason
[11:39.520 --> 11:46.160]  they're having capital controls in Italy and Greece is because the collapse is coming it's already
[11:46.160 --> 11:52.720]  here in many areas of the world and the public needs to make preparation in case we can't stop
[11:52.720 --> 11:59.120]  the collapse but also needs to work to try to stop it now we're going to be airing this today on the
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.320]  live radio show uh co-hosts with David Knight and I want to get his breakdown on all of this
[12:04.320 --> 12:10.320]  and how long have we been going here so I want to fit this into one segment and and then I'm
[12:10.320 --> 12:15.680]  going to do another report uh from the ground here on rowdy piper passing because it's important
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.320]  to remember patriots and he was a listener and aware of the new world order and help spread the
[12:20.320 --> 12:26.560]  word long before I was even involved with movies like they live but it is in celebrating humanity
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.840]  and celebrating human life that we're going to be able to turn the tide on this entire situation
[12:33.920 --> 12:38.720]  now contrasting the hypocrisy of the elite and how they're above the law tax exempt can
[12:38.720 --> 12:43.440]  commit all these crimes unless they commit crimes against themselves then they go to jail
[12:43.440 --> 12:51.600]  aka Bernie Madoff or Ken lay you remember the Chattanooga shooting a month ago well we knew
[12:51.600 --> 12:57.120]  this was coming we knew that it was actually marines that ended up driving the shooter off
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.040]  and then the police went and took him out and it turns out the lieutenant commander that ran the
[13:01.040 --> 13:08.480]  recruiting station got to his car got a firearm and shot at the killer to drive him off before he
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.800]  could kill more than the five people he was able to kill now it is on info wars dot com
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.600]  it's it's it's been announced by allen west and others who's talked to the folks that are involved
[13:20.480 --> 13:25.920]  that they are looking to indict the head of the recruiting station and one of the other marines
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.640]  that got to firearms and fought back you understand our marines at the white house
[13:31.280 --> 13:37.600]  protect the president our marines at our embassies protect us embassies which are basically seen as
[13:37.600 --> 13:43.600]  ships of the united states on land under international maritime law and the fact that they disarm the
[13:43.600 --> 13:47.760]  troops whenever the secretary of defense comes into a base just shows the attitude of this
[13:47.760 --> 13:53.040]  establishment sedam hussein certainly not a good guy could stand in front of 10 000 people with guns
[13:54.320 --> 13:59.120]  and they could all shoot him in the air and nobody'd kill him but here our establishment
[13:59.120 --> 14:03.760]  acts like we're the enemy because they are occupiers four foreign banks that have taken
[14:03.760 --> 14:09.840]  over the united states and the reason we see tyranny coming into place again is because
[14:09.840 --> 14:13.840]  that's the fallback historically and they'll want to start wars to take our anger at the
[14:13.840 --> 14:19.280]  corrupt establishment and focus it on some outside enemy so this is the upside down world we live in
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.720]  where the establishment can be armed but we can where babies can be harvested and killed
[14:24.720 --> 14:29.920]  and a judge appointed by obama blocks it and says you can't release those videos here's some news
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.880]  judge justice will be served whether you're up there in your robe or not there are some good
[14:34.880 --> 14:41.120]  judges there are some bad you clearly are bad and the public's losing faith faith in the judiciary
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.360]  and they're not going to put up with it anymore there will be more hacks obviously the videos
[14:45.360 --> 14:49.760]  will be released you're not going to be able to stop the defunding of your criminal organization
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.840]  that's at the heart of the eugenics program that i suppose in the film in game which is
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.240]  seminal for folks to watch we're going to throw it back to david night and then later in the
[14:58.240 --> 15:03.360]  transmission i'll be back with another special tape report shot for you uh so that while we're
[15:03.360 --> 15:06.960]  covering things in europe we're still able to cover what's happening here in north america
[15:06.960 --> 15:13.360]  but it's all interconnected all intertwined get upset have empathy for these babies have empathy
[15:13.360 --> 15:19.360]  for the troops on the don't treat list realize that dehumanizing these people is about dehumanizing
[15:19.360 --> 15:24.160]  you so that you can be enslaved so your bank accounts can be taken so you can be turned into

[20:04.640 --> 20:20.480]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[20:24.560 --> 20:30.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this sunday august 2nd 2015 we have a lot
[20:30.640 --> 20:38.480]  of news i want to cover some of that this particular segment and then we're going to have a memorial to
[20:38.480 --> 20:44.640]  roddy piper who died suddenly on friday alex jones has comments about that we're going to
[20:44.640 --> 20:50.000]  play you some snippets of his work that were put together by our editors here as well as some
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.560]  comments that he had just shortly before he died just a couple of months before he died someone
[20:54.560 --> 20:58.640]  caught him at an airport and he was talking about his family it was very touching i think
[20:58.640 --> 21:05.760]  one of the news articles that we've got today i think is absolutely outrageous the navy is going
[21:05.760 --> 21:10.640]  to charge the officer who fired fired on the islamists during the chattanooga terror attacks
[21:10.640 --> 21:15.280]  this is reported by ellen west and they're saying that lieutenant commander white who
[21:16.320 --> 21:23.120]  fired back at this shooter may be charged for disarming a firearm now ellen west reported this
[21:23.120 --> 21:27.920]  week that he will be charged for doing that and here's his comment he says secretary of the navy
[21:27.920 --> 21:36.720]  ray mavis is more concerned about lifting the ban on transgendered sailors than allowing the unarmed
[21:36.720 --> 21:41.360]  forces to protect themselves on military bases at recruitment centers at other places but of
[21:41.360 --> 21:46.880]  course the obama administration is telling us it was just merely coincidental that this attack
[21:46.880 --> 21:52.400]  was directed at military recruiting stations not one but two and it was just coincidental that this
[21:52.400 --> 21:57.440]  guy was a jihadi it wasn't an act of terrorism it had something to do with them smoking pot or
[21:57.440 --> 22:02.560]  something but ellen west goes on to say this knucklehead secretary of the navy ray mavis
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.600]  has no problem with the navy seeking to destroy the career of a sailor a commander of an installation
[22:07.600 --> 22:13.840]  returning fire against an islamic jihadist attack i do not care if it was his personal weapon he
[22:13.840 --> 22:22.160]  deserves a medal for facing the enemy absolutely right it's absolutely outrageous how they are
[22:22.160 --> 22:27.360]  still keeping soldiers disarmed how they went out even when you had citizens from the local
[22:27.360 --> 22:31.360]  area come out and say well if they're not going to be allowed to carry firearms without getting in
[22:31.360 --> 22:35.120]  trouble we're going to stand there and protect them job pigs went to one of the places he talked
[22:35.120 --> 22:39.200]  to other people that were there it's absolutely outrageous that the military that the pentagon
[22:39.200 --> 22:45.520]  would then say no you people have to leave are you going to be arrested so they threaten civilians
[22:45.520 --> 22:50.560]  who are there in a public place to protect the people that are not allowed to protect themselves
[22:50.560 --> 22:55.040]  these are people who are charged with protecting the nation these are people who are there to
[22:55.040 --> 23:00.240]  protect the government and yet that government that has trained them that government that they've
[23:00.240 --> 23:05.600]  sworn allegiance to that they're in uniform for does not trust them or allow them to protect
[23:05.600 --> 23:12.160]  themselves and of course it only gets worse when you become a veteran thus what has come up in
[23:12.160 --> 23:16.800]  these discussions going back and forth about senator mccain you know i made some comments i vetted
[23:17.920 --> 23:21.760]  donald trump this last week and we're going to have some more comments about that today
[23:21.760 --> 23:27.040]  and many people were totally outraged that i would criticize some things in his background
[23:27.040 --> 23:34.720]  that i would criticize policies that he has talked about has it come to this has it come to the point
[23:34.720 --> 23:40.880]  that even before the very first debate about 15 months before the election that the election
[23:40.880 --> 23:46.480]  is already over for many people that they have already put themselves in as camp followers
[23:46.480 --> 23:53.360]  of one individual that they follow this person this brand that they want to close their eyes
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.440]  stop their ears stamp their feet and say it's done if this individual isn't there then
[24:00.320 --> 24:06.000]  we're finished this country is finished i would remind you to go back and look at subsequent
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.880]  elections look at the people that we were offered like i mentioned in the very first segment do you
[24:10.880 --> 24:18.000]  think we would not have had nationalized forced insurance like obama care if we'd had mit romney
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.720]  he had already done something like that in massachusetts it was a template a model for what
[24:22.720 --> 24:29.680]  was going to be done at the national level the corporate cronies who are going to force that
[24:29.680 --> 24:36.080]  upon us had it set up it was a rigged game they had somebody in on both sides that's the way this
[24:36.080 --> 24:40.720]  is working you need to understand there is a fight to be made we need to talk about these issues
[24:40.720 --> 24:46.240]  we need to wake people up but the changes are going to be made at the local level and you
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.560]  are going to have to get involved it isn't something where you're going to be transported
[24:50.560 --> 24:55.760]  on a feather bed to a state of liberty that's merely a delusional dream they want you to
[24:55.760 --> 25:00.320]  believe that they want you to believe that everything depends on one person getting elected
[25:01.200 --> 25:07.520]  it is a phony system we just had an election 10 months ago where you were told that if you got
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.040]  the gopn they were going to change obama care they didn't make any changes in it they immediately
[25:13.040 --> 25:17.440]  showed their contempt for the people who had voted them at they don't care about immigration they
[25:17.440 --> 25:21.840]  don't care about any of this stuff that's why it is so powerful when somebody like donald trump
[25:22.400 --> 25:26.960]  rightfully comes out and says the very powerful things that he has and he has some interesting
[25:26.960 --> 25:33.760]  things to say about this event that happened i'm called an event that happened where you had five
[25:33.760 --> 25:39.520]  presidential hopefuls go to the coke brothers convention a private meeting looking for money
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.240]  he had some good comments we'll get to that in a moment first i want to go to some other news
[25:44.240 --> 25:52.080]  a judge who blocked Planned Parenthood videos is an obama appointee and raised $230,000 for obama
[25:52.960 --> 25:59.200]  now this is what alex jones was just talking about how it is a state secret we're not allowed to know
[25:59.200 --> 26:06.480]  what's going on and of course obama was telling us that it was simply a conspiracy theory all of
[26:06.480 --> 26:11.600]  these Planned Parenthood videos don't don't look at those the major media is telling us
[26:11.600 --> 26:17.840]  don't don't look at that don't think about that see they always want you to be compartmentalized
[26:17.840 --> 26:22.320]  to not look at the evidence that's why it's imperative for us to look at what they're trying
[26:22.320 --> 26:28.640]  to feed us if for no other reason than we know the battle plan of the people who are trying to
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.520]  establish a global government not that we're going to get somebody elected that's really going to
[26:33.520 --> 26:38.880]  change anything but we need to know what their direction is and you can discern that if you
[26:38.880 --> 26:44.720]  listen to what they're saying but of course they don't want us to even look at any of these videos
[26:44.720 --> 26:51.680]  that were taken undercover getting people to talk about how they are selling the body parts
[26:51.680 --> 26:57.120]  and according to obama it is all simply a conspiracy theory don't look at that closely
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.880]  well let's look at a real conspiracy theory let's look at what's going on with global warming
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.120]  now i said i'm going to have some good news and maybe this is the best news of the day
[27:07.920 --> 27:14.800]  washington dc is sinking into the ocean yes uh they're saying that it's not just metaphorically
[27:14.800 --> 27:20.560]  it's literally literally literally slinking into the ocean as we would say okay now they say according
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.880]  to new research the land in the chesapeake bay region including the nation's capital is sinking
[27:24.880 --> 27:30.240]  rapidly the sea level in the chesapeake is rising at twice the global average faster than anywhere
[27:30.240 --> 27:36.400]  else on the east coast which means that dc will sink six or more inches in the next hundred years
[27:37.360 --> 27:43.840]  say it's going to take a hundred years for them to go away it's just too gradual we need something
[27:43.840 --> 27:49.920]  that's going to get washington out of our life in a much more rapid way things like state nullification
[27:49.920 --> 27:55.440]  things like jury nullification but uh you know what we've always referred to as rome on the
[27:55.440 --> 28:01.280]  botomic if there's if what they're saying is true it could become venice on the botomic
[28:02.800 --> 28:09.040]  look i don't believe for a minute in global warming i don't believe especially in man-made
[28:09.040 --> 28:14.560]  global warming as we've pointed out many times they are messing with the data number one we tried
[28:14.560 --> 28:19.840]  for a very long time a group that i worked with to try to get the original data that they based
[28:19.840 --> 28:24.400]  their conclusions on when people like michael man at the university of virginia was coming out talking
[28:24.400 --> 28:31.360]  about climate change and using that to push a legislative agenda using that to push cap and tax
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.640]  an agenda that is global tax an agenda that is trying to take control of our lives we don't have
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.680]  time for it before the break but we're going to talk about some mind-blowing temperature fraud at
[28:43.680 --> 28:48.640]  noah where does this come from where does this phony agenda come from when we come back we're
[28:48.640 --> 28:54.400]  going to come in with a tribute to roddy piper and alex jones's tribute to him a man he knew we'll be

[33:02.480 --> 33:05.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:11.360 --> 33:15.120]  i feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people that they're being
[33:15.120 --> 33:20.400]  lied to that there's an agenda it's not left or right it's hey there's mind control going on
[33:20.400 --> 33:25.520]  the signals broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media just become aware of it and they'll
[33:25.520 --> 33:31.120]  say there's nothing going on and i want to say put on these glasses or start chewing concrete
[33:36.480 --> 33:43.680]  they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders they have recruited the rich and the
[33:43.680 --> 33:50.480]  powerful and they have blinded us to the truth the question is do we all work for central bankers
[33:50.480 --> 33:56.560]  that's what i want to address to our guests tonight our impulses are being redirected we
[33:56.560 --> 34:02.720]  are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep an estimated
[34:02.720 --> 34:10.240]  50 to 70 million americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation outside the limit
[34:10.240 --> 34:19.440]  of our sight feeding off this page on top of us from right to death are our owners latest census
[34:19.440 --> 34:24.880]  numbers prove the united states has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized
[34:24.880 --> 34:31.760]  countries today our projections show that by the year 2025 not only america but the entire planet
[34:32.400 --> 34:38.240]  will be under the protection and the dominion of this tower alliance the gains have been substantial
[34:38.240 --> 34:43.520]  both for ourselves and for you the human power elite
[34:48.480 --> 34:52.240]  and for the first time in all of human history
[34:54.640 --> 35:01.680]  mankind is politically awakened that's a total new reality i've got one that can see
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.920]  we can't be the only ones who can see unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.440]  that incessantly warn of government is nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's
[35:13.440 --> 35:20.400]  got him at the root of all our problems it's a new morning in america fresh mild the old
[35:20.400 --> 35:28.000]  cynicism is gone we have faith in our leaders we're optimistic as to what becomes of it all
[35:28.000 --> 35:37.120]  it really boils down to our ability to accept we don't need pessimism i have two words for you

[35:42.960 --> 35:49.520]  and who are you little cow we will never see it coming don't predict the first guy who uses a
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.400]  second amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is going to be a

[37:33.920 --> 37:38.320]  gotten to know a lot of the uh professional acrobats that are professional wrestlers
[37:38.320 --> 37:46.400]  and they're really interesting men jesse ventura and many others but from all the folks i've talked
[37:46.400 --> 37:51.440]  to rowdy piper they say was like the coolest most down-to-earth guy out there and he literally
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.960]  just came from nowhere very poor um and just basically got spotted for his talent and picked
[37:56.960 --> 38:03.520]  up and and got into wrestling and he died at 61 i learned from sean stone all over son's son
[38:03.520 --> 38:10.000]  years ago uh that uh mr piper was a listener and was really upset about the new world order and
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.120]  had been for decades and was aware of globalism and that's pretty obvious starring in a film like
[38:15.120 --> 38:19.600]  they live so i talked to sean stone i said let's get him on sometime and he called up and he said
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.400]  how about tomorrow so we did one interview with mr piper and a few months ago i was trying to get
[38:26.400 --> 38:30.480]  him back on and heard that he was having health issues and i thought oh well i'm sure he'll get
[38:30.480 --> 38:37.840]  better and he's gone um and it's not just that he was in some movies i liked that were all about
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.360]  waking up coming out of the cave plate us cave transcending the controlled paradigm coming out
[38:43.360 --> 38:50.080]  of the matrix it was that he was a guy who cared about freedom and was upset about what was happening
[38:50.080 --> 38:57.600]  in the world and he's gone now and so i i just wanted to celebrate rowdy rowdy piper and i wanted
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.680]  to celebrate all the other patriots whether they were famous or whether they weren't famous
[39:01.680 --> 39:07.040]  whether they'd be black white old or young northeast southwest who care about freedom
[39:07.920 --> 39:14.560]  and who strive to build and create and trailblaze and take action that's really what it's all about
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.200]  so i want to thank sean stone for getting me in touch with piper for letting me learn that another
[39:19.200 --> 39:24.160]  great person is aware of what's happening in the world so that he could share his ideas with the
[39:24.160 --> 39:30.160]  people later this week i'm going to have uh darin mcbreen one of our great editors edit down an hour
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.880]  and a half interview i did with piper to some highlights maybe 10 minutes to play that on the
[39:34.880 --> 39:41.040]  weekday show 11 a.m to 2 p.m we're going to be reporting obviously uh from uh italy now
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.400]  on the incredible situations there that's really the heart of the e u uh with the pope coming out
[39:46.400 --> 39:51.120]  and calling for world government and carbon taxes and a lot more but i wanted to just take some time
[39:51.120 --> 39:57.680]  out to celebrate these portable babies that never get to be outside the womb and and and realize
[39:57.680 --> 40:03.040]  they're human and also celebrate people that got a chance to come outside the womb uh like rowdy rowdy
[40:03.040 --> 40:08.240]  piper and to celebrate all of you out there that love beauty and love justice and want to stand
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.560]  against the forces of tyranny and death that are playing parenthood in the new world order all right
[40:12.560 --> 40:19.200]  i throw you back to austin texas and david night mr rowdy rowdy piper we love you we appreciate you
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.400]  and you live on in the hearts of minds of everybody out there that loves freedom and they live is
[40:24.400 --> 40:28.560]  probably more powerful than even the first episode of the matrix and getting people outside the box
[40:29.520 --> 40:35.040]  and uh we you will be sorely missed but uh i know you're going to be appreciated up there in heaven
[40:35.040 --> 40:41.120]  with all the host of the good souls god bless you thank you very much that's alex jones talking
[40:41.120 --> 40:46.400]  about rowdy piper who passed away on friday suddenly at the age of 61 if you want to see the tribute
[40:46.400 --> 40:52.640]  for that that we put together we started this segment with uh the collection of clips interspersed
[40:52.640 --> 40:59.200]  with reality because it was a very powerful metaphor that is very true today if you want to
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.760]  see that you can go to they lives rowdy rowdy piper dead at 61 at info wars dot com you can also see
[41:05.760 --> 41:11.520]  alex's tribute there embedded in that article as well as the full interview alex said it's going to
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.280]  be edited down into a shorter interview but you can also see the full interview uh interspersed in
[41:17.280 --> 41:23.600]  that embedded in that article now who was rowdy piper rowdy piper was somebody who was an entertainer
[41:23.600 --> 41:29.360]  but he was also somebody who really did put on the glasses somebody who could really see
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.720]  that's what we are trying to do here at info wars we're trying to get you to put on the glasses
[41:34.720 --> 41:39.760]  we want you to look at what's going on in the national stage and stage is an appropriate name
[41:39.760 --> 41:47.040]  for because it is a very well produced process it is a stage we want you to take a look at that we
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.240]  want you to look at what's going on globally think about that see the agenda see what is behind
[41:52.240 --> 41:58.000]  these politicians who are running for presidential office then we want you to act locally but part
[41:58.000 --> 42:05.440]  of that is being with the family and the friends that you have at a local level many times we look
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.400]  at people who are famous like rowdy piper we don't realize of course that they have a family that
[42:10.400 --> 42:15.760]  they love very much that loves them a great deal i want to play just a little bit of a spontaneous
[42:15.760 --> 42:21.040]  interview that he did with tmz they caught him at an airport where he was going between uh cities
[42:21.040 --> 42:25.040]  and talked to him about his family here's that clip also how are you kids doing that one of your

[43:01.680 --> 43:07.520]  to be right back a huge bronze baphomet statue is now funding a huge effort to undermine anti-abortion
[43:07.520 --> 43:14.000]  legislation the satanic temple says that proceeds from ticket sales from the largest public satanic
[43:14.000 --> 43:20.400]  ceremony in history will be used to support the reproductive rights legal action fund the cult
[43:20.400 --> 43:26.000]  which clearly aligns itself with the devil even though they claim not to believe you really exist
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.960]  has a questionable statement on its website suggesting that the reason they support abortion
[43:30.960 --> 43:37.600]  is to do with personal choice and women's rights not an identification with historical satanic
[43:37.600 --> 43:44.160]  child sacrifice or you know doing the evil bidding of the dark lord then the satanic temple recently
[43:44.160 --> 43:48.800]  launched a federal lawsuit against the state of missouri claiming that the state's laws restricting
[43:48.800 --> 43:55.760]  abortion violate their free exercise of satanism and that abortion is an essential religious duty

[49:52.560 --> 49:58.080]  been buying millions of doses of that but it's much better to take something that's going to be
[49:58.800 --> 50:03.120]  not a bad form of iodine like they're buying from an emergency situation but something that you can
[50:03.120 --> 50:10.000]  take on a regular basis that is going to help your body on a regular basis and fight low level
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.840]  accumulative radiation that you may be exposed to like fukushima radiation that type of thing so
[50:15.840 --> 50:21.200]  it's always something to keep in your store of preparedness products now in the last
[50:22.400 --> 50:28.720]  section we were talking about roddy piper again dead at 61 we're all very sad to see that happen
[50:28.720 --> 50:31.840]  and as we were going to the break we didn't quite have time to finish that clip
[50:31.840 --> 50:39.280]  but of course like all of us we have friends we have family he was very much loved by his family
[50:39.280 --> 50:43.920]  you could certainly see that in that clip he survived by his wife kitty four children including
[50:43.920 --> 50:49.200]  three daughters and his son colton who is pursuing a career in professional wrestling and as roddy
[50:49.200 --> 50:54.640]  piper said he's my best friend that was a clip from just a few months ago when he was caught at the
[50:54.640 --> 51:01.760]  airport by someone from tmz when i was talking earlier about taking the glasses off one of the
[51:01.760 --> 51:06.960]  reasons that we talk about roddy piper is not just that he was in a great metaphorical movie
[51:06.960 --> 51:14.560]  by john carpenter they live but because he actually in real life put on the glasses and as i said
[51:14.560 --> 51:18.960]  that's what we're trying to get you to do trying to get you to look closely at what's going on to
[51:18.960 --> 51:24.800]  try to discern and understand what's really behind it there's a lot of ways that they try to keep us
[51:24.800 --> 51:31.520]  from really understanding what's going on every time we have something where we start to uh get
[51:31.520 --> 51:35.520]  gain an understanding just as we saw these videos coming out about planned parenthood
[51:35.520 --> 51:42.080]  isn't it interesting that out of nowhere the president as well as all of the media goes
[51:42.080 --> 51:48.480]  into a frenzy about a lion that was shot on the other side of the planet about a poaching
[51:48.480 --> 51:53.040]  that was going on on the other side of the planet they say now of course this dentist had paid
[51:53.040 --> 52:01.680]  55 000 to robert mogabi but we're supposed to in the words of pierce morgan he wants to hunt
[52:01.680 --> 52:07.040]  quote fat greedy selfish murderous businessman like dr palmer well he's not fat he's not a
[52:07.040 --> 52:13.520]  businessman they point out in time magazine of all places defending what is going on and looking
[52:13.520 --> 52:19.600]  at what the real source is even of this problem who's really responsible for the killing of zimbabwe's
[52:19.600 --> 52:25.360]  lions another wildlife i would say to you that cesil the lion is not a lion cesil is a red herring
[52:26.080 --> 52:32.480]  and another hunting analogy it was the people in england who wanted to stop fox hunting and they would
[52:32.480 --> 52:37.280]  wait in the woods and as they were chasing the foxes and their ceremonial hunt they would run
[52:37.280 --> 52:45.360]  out from the cover with stinky fish red herring and they would drag them all across the track
[52:46.240 --> 52:52.720]  behind the fox so that the hounds would lose the scent that is precisely what this is about
[52:53.840 --> 53:00.880]  ignoring what's going on in zimbabwe but trying to distract us from what's going on with planned
[53:00.880 --> 53:06.000]  parenthood with these videos they don't want to talk about it but they will talk about the
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.400]  murder of one lion that's what we talked about many times last week and of course we pointed out
[53:10.960 --> 53:16.240]  that if you want to see where obama's policies are going in terms of growing the government
[53:16.240 --> 53:22.960]  shutting down private enterprise zimbabwe provides a perfect example of that you know they have so
[53:22.960 --> 53:28.000]  much unemployment there that only six percent of the people have a job in the private sector
[53:28.000 --> 53:36.000]  nine percent have a job with the government 85 percent have no job they're flocking into
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.920]  the city of harari the capital city they're bringing their goats to try to survive their
[53:39.920 --> 53:48.480]  bric-a-brac to try to sell and this dictator who's been there for 35 years comes in and tells them
[53:48.480 --> 53:52.880]  i don't want to see your goats get out of here go starve somewhere else this is a guy who throws
[53:52.880 --> 53:59.120]  himself a million dollar party feasts on baby elephant and other exotic animals just five
[53:59.120 --> 54:05.680]  months ago they were talking about how disgusting his birthday party was when he turned 91 he had
[54:05.680 --> 54:12.160]  a multi-million dollar party tens of thousands of people this excess and of course it's not just
[54:12.160 --> 54:17.200]  eating these animals he had trophy animals just like this one one of them was an old lion and
[54:17.200 --> 54:22.400]  as one of the farmers who actually was one of the six percent of the people who has a private sector
[54:22.400 --> 54:28.400]  operation very much afraid of the fact that he might get thrown off of his farm by Robert Mugabe
[54:29.120 --> 54:35.520]  went out and got this large banquet of zoo animals to give him killed and mounted a lion just like
[54:35.520 --> 54:40.000]  this dentist that were demonizing killed and mounted a crocodile for him but of course we're
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.520]  not supposed to pay attention to that we're not supposed to pay attention to the suffering of the
[54:43.520 --> 54:50.880]  people black and white you know he didn't just allow 80 percent of the animals the wildlife in
[54:50.880 --> 54:57.280]  that area to die out of mismanagement out of crony capitalism corruption ecliptocracy a marxist
[54:57.280 --> 55:03.280]  dictatorship if you want to know what's happening to the exotic wildlife in Zimbabwe it isn't that
[55:03.280 --> 55:08.560]  they're being lost to people like this dentist it's Robert Mugabe who's doing that and he pretty
[55:08.560 --> 55:15.040]  much hunted white landowners into extinction as well and the black people who were left behind
[55:15.040 --> 55:20.560]  suffered under 11 million percent inflation under this guy to give you an idea of what that is you
[55:20.560 --> 55:24.320]  got five percent inflation that means that next year something that you pay a hundred dollars for
[55:24.320 --> 55:29.760]  this year is going to be 105 dollars if you've got 11 million percent inflation if you've got
[55:29.760 --> 55:35.120]  something that cost a hundred dollars today next year it's going to cost 11 million they printed
[55:35.120 --> 55:40.560]  a one billion dollars in bob waynote i don't know this picture they put on it but it only survived
[55:40.560 --> 55:46.240]  for a few months because they had to completely abandon the currency destroying the private sector
[55:46.240 --> 55:53.840]  creating this kind of authoritarian crony system ecliptocracy which is what he got is that it's
[55:53.840 --> 56:01.680]  even beyond crony capitalism and dividing the country into racial groups like he did so that
[56:01.680 --> 56:07.680]  you can rule that is where we're headed with this government as well and i don't think it's going to
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.560]  stop with obama that's where you need to put the glasses on that's where you need to see that this
[56:12.560 --> 56:19.200]  is an agenda that is bigger than one man this is an agenda that is shared by the vast media
[56:19.200 --> 56:24.800]  empires that exist the handful of people that control all of our media essentially the people
[56:24.800 --> 56:29.280]  who control our educational system the bureaucracies that are in place these are all things that are
[56:29.280 --> 56:36.080]  going to remain in place regardless of which one of the gilligan island characters you choose to
[56:36.080 --> 56:43.520]  vote for it is simply identity politics that's all it is we're going to see that in spades when we
[56:43.520 --> 56:48.720]  have the very first debate this week but of course if we look at these candidates if we talk about
[56:48.720 --> 56:56.240]  their policies the people who love them are now so invested in them that they accuse me for example
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.360]  this last week i've gotten all this hate mail from people about the things that i pointed out about
[57:01.360 --> 57:06.400]  trump and other candidates but especially trump they say he's the only man who can save us you need
[57:06.400 --> 57:13.280]  to open your eyes you need to put on the glasses you need to look at these people how they are
[57:13.280 --> 57:20.240]  being used and understand that even if you buy into this horse race election it hasn't even started
[57:21.120 --> 57:25.920]  there isn't even hasn't even been a debate the first debate is going to be this thursday we're

[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:19.120]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.120]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host on this sunday august second
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.400]  2015 live edition we're going to cover news in this segment and of course earlier in the show
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:34.160]  we pointed out that the navy apparently is going to charge an officer who fired back against an
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:40.960]  islamic jihadist during these chattanooga terror attacks this is a story that is up on info wars.com
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.520]  this is based on a report from allen west there have been rumors that he would be charged for
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.480]  discharging a firearm on federal property because they're not even supposed to have weapons to
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.160]  protect themselves and even after this attack of course they were not allowed to get firearms
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.600]  because this is not anything new even on a military base we had nidal hasant kill many people at
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:08.400]  forehood they did not allow the soldiers there to arm themselves even after that this is a report
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.080]  from allen west saying that this knucklehead who runs the navy secretary of the navy ray
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:21.840]  maybes is more concerned about lifting the ban on transgendered sailors and he has no problem with
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.040]  the navy seeking to destroy the career of a sailor a commander of an installation he says even if it
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.800]  is his own private firearm he should get a medal for defending the people there absolutely right it
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.040]  is an outrage to see what is going on with this you can get more information about that story
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:43.440]  at info wars.com now when we look at things like gun control let's understand that that's not the
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.120]  only way of course they're trying to control us we talk about gun control constantly it's really
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.720]  about people control isn't it well there's another kind of control that is on the horizon
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.680]  coming at us very rapidly and it is transportation control like gun control transportation control
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:07.600]  is about controlling the people about controlling you look at one example here coming at us this
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.800]  is a new report coming out of cbs saying could boarding passes become a thing of the past
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:21.040]  another way to automate the vetting of everybody to allow us to have permission to travel by the tsa
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.840]  the transportation and that's all forms of transportation folks it's not the airport
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.160]  security administration it's a transport security administration i think you need to get rid of the
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.320]  idea that security understand they're coming after your liberty so this is the transportation
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:42.400]  liberty destroying administration they say our big picture dream is that anytime you have to prove
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.680]  who you are during any of the steps of air travel you could simply use your fingerprints instead
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:55.200]  we want this to be a curb to seat experience yeah it's become a curb to seat experience hasn't it
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.720]  a curb to seat experience of tyranny and that's where we're headed there's many different aspects
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.720]  of this but look at this scenario how they want to keep going with this this is a a product called
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:13.440]  clear a biometric secure identity company they did this test in april with alaska airlines
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.800]  and of course this is a biometric system they say they are delighted with the results say consumer
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.800]  news editor condi nas traveler said it's very very cool he said anytime an airline is making the
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.240]  travel process easier i'm in favor of that yes they make tyranny so easy don't they all you have
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:37.840]  to do is set back and let them do it to you they'll just make it very easy it's fighting the tyranny
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.840]  that is difficult they say well of course there's still some kinks to be worked out including
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.800]  security concerns that the system could be breached that the fingerprints could be spoofed you mean
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:54.800]  like those millions of fingerprints that they stole from federal employees out of their biometric
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:02.080]  database you mean that kind of problem so they can't even secure it but they're going to demand it
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.880]  from you here's another way they're going to control you a mileage tax being tested in the northeast
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.840]  this is in hartford connecticut a potential new tax to help pay for the governor's massive new
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.440]  transportation plans has started a firestorm of activity on the internet they say a special
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.680]  committee has point he's appointed to find a way to pay for the improvements is looking at a new
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.000]  tax on the number of miles you drive each year they say it's based kind of on a test program in
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.840]  oregon where volunteer drivers are paying a tax on the number of miles they drive as measured by a gps
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:39.680]  look this is something that is going to control you it is part of the agenda 21 environment if you
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:46.240]  want to know how this is going to work out it's about smart meters is one other aspect of how
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.640]  they're going to monitor you they want to keep you with this with the agenda 21 they want to
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:56.400]  confine you to a very small area into very small cities and they want to measure everything you do
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.040]  and control everything you do say what this will be right about mail vitality is info wars life

[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:26.720]  war welcome back to the alex jones show we're talking in the last segment about transportation
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.960]  control it's not just gun control they're looking to control you in a variety of ways gun control
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.240]  transportation control they're all about controlling people it's not about controlling cars it's not
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.760]  about controlling guns it's not about controlling the sale of guns it's about controlling you do
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:50.160]  you understand the agenda behind it have you put on the glasses do you see they live do you see
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.760]  that they are lying to you we had earlier in the program attribute to roddy piper who died
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.760]  friday at the age of 61 he was someone who had in real life put on the glasses he could see
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:08.000]  the agenda he knew what was behind this of course a large part of this is smart cities one of the
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.320]  reasons that they are doing the things like i mentioned about in the last segment proposing
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:17.200]  mileage taxes we've got tests being conducted in connecticut as well as oregon to charge you by the
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:24.160]  mile and of course that will require that they know how not only how much you drive but when and
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.280]  where you drive it's going to require total surveillance for them to collect their taxes
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.080]  it isn't like something that you pay at the pump where they don't have any control or knowledge
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:40.000]  of what you're doing they're going to have tax systems that will be there so that they can
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.280]  watch and control you very much like our income tax system you know the europeans pay a much higher
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:51.600]  taxes with a value added tax they pay a sales tax at every level of production so this
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.360]  cumulative tax can get quite expensive quite burdensome it's even difficult to calculate
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.240]  the entire amount of the tax which you would think the government would like because they'd like to
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.360]  hide how much tax they charge us they don't like it to be out there that's why they multiply the
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.080]  number of taxes that they apply to us putting them a little bit over here a little bit over there
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:17.920]  when it first comes in it's a very small tax then they ramp it up but we have an income tax that is
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:24.640]  very abusive that's very intrusive that's very controlling very difficult to comply with why
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.640]  would they do that you would think that that would annoy the people that it might even provoke a tax
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:38.240]  revolt evidently not in america but let me tell you that the point of the income tax is a couple
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.640]  of reasons first of all they want to have a means of control they want to manipulate you
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.920]  to buy the kinds of things that they want you to buy from their crony capitalist friends they
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.440]  want you to get a home mortgage they want you to do with other certain types of activities
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.480]  so they give you the carrot and the stick to make you do that but the other part of it we have seen
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:02.000]  in spades in the obama administration has always been a part of presidential administrations that
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.800]  they will use the income tax to attack their enemies or political enemies we've never seen it done
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:15.040]  as broadly as we've seen it done in the obama administration nor as openly as we've seen it
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:21.280]  done in the obama administration with a wholesale attack of a massive political movement at the
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:27.360]  ground level going after the donors to small government republican organizations and then
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.480]  getting away with it that's the amazing thing so there's an element of control in that and let
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.240]  me tell you when you look at these mileage taxes it's that type of thing because you could easily
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:44.640]  pay a sales tax and it could be anonymous they don't know what you're doing with that fuel they
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.000]  don't know where you're going when you're traveling and they have no capability to shut you down that's
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.840]  the next thing that is coming but of course this is all going to feed not only a an espionage
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.000]  agenda let's put it that way a control agenda big brother agenda looking at everything that
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.080]  you're doing but it's also another part of the way to force you into smart cities once they have
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.600]  computer driven government controlled cars they will be able to limit your movements they will
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.600]  be able to shut your car down at any time and confine you to the cities if you look at agenda 21
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:27.600]  which is a UN agenda they have as part of that agenda a way to confine almost everyone to a very
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.680]  small area of land and leave the vast areas of land off limits to you of course they will be able
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.200]  to enjoy it look at this story from Alex Newman this is about a week ago he says smart cities to
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.800]  spy on you in ways that Orwell never imagined this is from new american he says smart cities will
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.160]  be watching you in fact they already are watching you unless humanity takes action soon to reign
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.560]  in its would-be omniscient rulers the technological dystopia being erected all around you will ensure
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:02.400]  that governments and dictators know virtually everything about everyone a massive part of
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:08.800]  that is the transportation aspect but he's talking about the smart meters as well the plot to create
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.480]  a total surveillance state under the guise of making cities smart will cost taxpayers trillions
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.680]  of dollars too but the price tag in terms of lost privacy and liberty will be far higher
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.600]  so he's talking about the broad basis of the internet of things intelligent computer controlled
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.440]  surveillance devices being made out of everything out of every appliance out of every tool every
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.720]  camera everywhere one of those of course is smart meters look at this story from activist posts
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:42.400]  thousands of smart meter fires new whistleblowers and court evidence they say whistleblowers who
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.560]  wish to remain anonymous who contacted activist posts say that they have repaired over 200 000 meters
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.160]  in the field they've been warning their supervisors about smart meter problems for nearly a decade
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:59.200]  they've had enough of the lies and they want you to know what they know so they have a documentary
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.040]  that you can see there they say on top of the explosive new details they find that there are
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.880]  at least four major sources of vulnerability in these meters that cause arcing that would result
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.560]  in fires that's four failure modes that they have there so understand when we talk about smart meters
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.360]  we've always talked about how there's many different aspects that you should oppose these
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.280]  things on number one is this a way of charging you more for electricity they're going to use
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:31.280]  these smart meters to adjust the electrical rates for the time of day so you will pay more
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.600]  when you use this during rush hour for example or preparation for rush hour the early mornings
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.760]  everybody goes to work everybody goes to school at about the same time that's why we have rush hour
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:48.000]  and so there's a rush hour for electrical use as well a peak hour they're going to charge more for
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.720]  those hours but of course you don't have any control about that do you if you did you wouldn't
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.040]  get involved in the rush hour traffic but you don't have any control over that because somebody
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.680]  else tells you what time you need to be at work what time you need to be at school and now they're
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:08.080]  going to charge you for peak usage at a higher rate it's just a way of increasing the cost of
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.880]  your electricity but then of course there's also the privacy aspect that we talked about it and then
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.920]  there's the health aspect you know it was just on friday that yet another study came out actually
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:25.520]  it was kind of a meta study they looked at quite a few studies and looked at the results of the
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:33.760]  effect of cell phones on brain tumors found a 300 to 500 increase in brain tumors now you need to
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.480]  understand that these smart meters that we have in the united states are wireless they send out
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:44.560]  very powerful pulses wirelessly this is something that unlike a cell phone you have no control over
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.920]  this is demanded to be put on your house by the power company so you cannot turn this thing off
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.560]  very concerning when you look at this understand that in some places like idli when they wanted to
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:00.640]  put smart meters on of course they still had the problems of increasing your cost of invading your
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.320]  privacy but to get away from the health issue they didn't make them wireless and you have to ask
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.160]  yourself i've asked myself this question why is it that the electric power meters need to be
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:18.720]  wireless when there's a health concern from people they've got an electrical wire that they can
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.680]  wire that they can run the signal over already running to the house they can multiplex it over
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.360]  that wire why would they need to do that perhaps they have another agenda so you've got a cost
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.520]  issue you've got a privacy issue you've got the health concerns about the electromagnetic
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:39.680]  radiation and then now you have a new fire concern about this in terms of the way they're
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:45.520]  going to control our cars it's not just taxing us by every mile we drive now we've got a new york
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:51.520]  congresswoman kathleen rice who wants to force everyone to put breathalysers in all the cars
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:58.160]  you will be paid for yet another electronic device that most of us do not need it's been used as a
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.040]  punishment for people who are caught drunk driving people who cannot control their alcohol use or
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.480]  they're driving but now we're all going to be punished with this this is from dc clothesline
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.680]  they say as time goes on cars are becoming less of a symbol of freedom and status more like automated
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:18.880]  golf carts that coddle their drivers and every other year they add more features that take the
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:26.640]  driver's ability out of the loop and at the same time track everything you do now if this law goes
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:31.840]  through from new york congressman congresswoman kathleen rice what was once punishment of
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.400]  delinquent drivers may soon become a new standard she wants to force car manufacturers to install
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.000]  the breathalysers on all vehicles and understand you are going to be forced to pay for they don't
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.280]  mind putting that in that just ups their profit margin but you will be forced to pay to have that
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.480]  it'll raise the cost of your car it'll raise the cost of maintenance where does it all end
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.440]  we see that syspa is coming back yet again and when we look at the data that's being collected on

[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.240]  was an interesting day it's going to get interesting in terms of the presidential horse race this week
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:06.000]  we're going to have a debate later this week people are wondering who's going to make the cut
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:12.640]  i think there's going to be some kind of a junior varsity debate with the people who don't make the
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:17.440]  top 10 i'm not sure if that's still in the works i would imagine that fox news will milk that for
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.360]  everything that they can they're also going to have frank luntz there who will tell you what to
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:26.320]  think and how to interpret it tell you he'll have an audience there to model how you should
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.280]  respond to the candidates you understand how they manipulate you with this right i mean it's
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.600]  absolutely a joke this whole thing is a scyop folks you need to put on the glasses you need to
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.240]  take a look at what's going on they're going to have this debate and then afterwards fox news
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.360]  just like they do with all these other debates that they've had through the years they'll go through
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.920]  and they'll say oh look when this candidate said such and such the meter went way up we're
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.160]  measuring this audience response and look they they responded really favorably to that but then
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.400]  they responded very unfavorably to this and everybody's going to look there sit there like
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:03.200]  Homer Simpson in their couch and they're going to look at this and say oh yeah i think that way too
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.040]  subliminally folks that's how it's going to work you got to fight it you got to fight it okay now
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:16.480]  what happened yesterday we had five presidential hopefuls go to the Koch brothers and bow the knee
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.440]  you want to know why donald trump is a frontrunner here's what he had to say on twitter
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:28.240]  right to the point he said i wish good luck to all the republican candidates that travel to
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:35.280]  california to beg for money etc from the Koch brothers puppets question mark to the point
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:40.480]  that is great that's what donald trump put out on his on his twitter account and he's had
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:46.960]  the several thousand retweets of that very succinctly stated and exactly the issue and as
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:53.280]  they point out in this article from politics they say on politics they say trump who has focused
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:58.480]  relentlessly on illegal immigration does not appear to be viewed favorably by the coax why would that
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:06.800]  be uh well maybe they support open borders so who are the people that went to this Koch confab
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:15.120]  well we have jeb bush we have marco rubio we have scott walker ted cruz and carly fiorina
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.680]  they're all there looking for money looking for the approval of the Koch brothers and
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:28.400]  i gotta say when they go to this as its termed private event do they realize just how this
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.920]  looks going hat in hand to these guys i mean it is just pathetic to see this happening
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:41.280]  what is going on with the tpp or what is their position on that they say that the Koch brothers
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:48.240]  welcome donors and they encourage 450 like-minded business leaders there to stop crony capitalism
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.440]  even if those policies hurt their bottom lines really maybe with the trans specific transatlantic
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.600]  partnerships would they oppose that i haven't heard anything from the Koch brothers i know
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:05.360]  that some of the think tanks that they support support the secret corporate trade agreements
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.240]  saying that they're free trade look all you libertarian think tanks like kato and everything
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.480]  this is not free trade folks we can have that discussion about what free trade is these secretly
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.880]  negotiated agreements that are created by corporate lobbyists go way beyond free trade
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:28.640]  they affect our sovereignty senator sessions who looked at it said you are creating a transnational
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:34.720]  committee a transnational governance we're not going to be allowed he pointed out with the past
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.680]  trade promotion authority that has now passed and been signed they're not going to be allowed
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:44.640]  to amend this agreement that is presented to them by the corporate lobbyists it's going to be an
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:50.400]  up or down vote they're going to have 20 minutes of debate they cannot have a filibuster etc etc
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:56.160]  with no amendments but once it's passed this transnational governance committee that is
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.720]  going to be created by these treaties that group that council we don't know who's going
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.800]  to be there it's not going to be elected how does it come into being we don't know we haven't seen
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.840]  the details on this but that committee not the elected representatives of the different states
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:18.240]  that are involved in this that committee will then set new policy it's going to be something that
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.560]  they cannot amend they simply pass it and then once it's finished it's a living document as
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.560]  senator sessions point out so how do the Koch brothers feel about it how does donald trump
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.320]  feel about it for example donald trump has said that he didn't like the trade promotion authority
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:38.000]  and he didn't like the trans-pacific partnership these agreements because he didn't trust obama to
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:44.320]  get a good deal well it is far worse than that because as we've seen from the little bit of it
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:50.960]  that has been leaked by wiki leaks and others this is a sovereignty destroying agreement
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.720]  this is something that once it has passed even if obama got a good deal even if a president
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.800]  trump got a good deal that's not the point the point is is that this transnational committee
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.240]  will then be able to change it at will without any input or being able to stop it by these
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.680]  individual nations it is a way to do global governance we see that's what's happening
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.000]  in europe that's what alex has been reporting on and will be reporting on we know that they've
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.320]  created the european union and created economic crisis like we see in greece and elsewhere and
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:30.880]  out of that economic crisis they use that as an excuse to take sovereignty that was the solution
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.800]  that was put out by pimp co the largest bondholder about europe that was also the solution that was
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:39.440]  put out by ellen greenspan many people have said the only way to solve this problem in greece for
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:46.080]  example is for greece and the other european union countries to sacrifice their sovereignty so that
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.760]  they can maintain the euro see in order to keep from having an economic collapse they have to
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:56.720]  give up their own self-rule and we've seen that as part of the conditions that were put out by the
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.040]  troika and of course it's not a good enough deal for the troika they're now renegotiating that yet
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.760]  again but some of the things that they put in there were things that would require greek businesses
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.720]  to stay to work on sundays because you know we can't have these lazy serfs not paying the bankers
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:16.240]  on seven days a week they have laws at the current time that would give people at least one day a
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.520]  week rest but they would override those laws as they would many other things because they are
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.440]  taking their sovereignty they're going to create a political union they're going to unite these
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:35.040]  regions into a one world government or governance there's really a distinction without a difference
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.640]  it's something we've been told about for a very long time by his big new brzezinski the council
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.920]  on foreign relations has talked about the trilateral commission was set up on this blueprint stay with

[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:18.320]  owner of a Milwaukee based clothing store posted video of the encounter to the company's instagram

[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:36.160]  business and employees at any cost that's right and you can tell by the surveillance video that he
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.760]  wasn't messing around apparently the business had been previously hit by criminals multiple times
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:47.600]  and the business owner had enough and he put his ar-15 to good use you could see in the video how
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:53.120]  the criminals used a car to smash the doors open so the robbers could get in but they are quickly

[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:26.720]  man thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:40.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this sunday august 2nd 2015 i'm david knight
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.000]  this segment we're going to talk a little bit about politics of course we have the
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.600]  presidential debate coming up on thursday we still don't know who the 10 are going to be
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.480]  and that on the gop side let's talk a little bit about the democrat side let's talk about
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:58.240]  hillary clinton which seems to be the only viable frontrunner out there according to
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.960]  most of the horse race analysis you know they're this is really is a horse race they're handicapping
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:09.120]  all these people but of course she has a lot of money she and bill have raised 140 million dollars
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:16.560]  in the last seven years including up to 750 000 dollars for each public speech this is an article
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.840]  from the daily mail pointing that out and of course plan parented the story that we
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:26.480]  talked about earlier in the show a judge who blocked the planned parenthood videos putting
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.480]  an injunction against the release of any further sting videos from the center for medical progress
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:41.120]  that judge who blocked that video is an obama appointee and he raised 230 000 for obama
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:46.560]  now how does it work with hillary clinton she is also involved in this she's gotten a lot of money
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:51.280]  from plan parenthood ran paul has called her out on this the washington free beacon also
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.480]  has called her out on this they say planned parenthood received millions of dollars after
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:02.080]  lobbying clinton's state department while secretary of state they say plan parenthood lobbied the
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:09.440]  department of state got tens of millions of dollars from foreign policy agencies like us a id tied to
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:15.920]  the state department they steered more than 100 million dollars in funding to planned parenthood
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:24.000]  why did it cost them to get that it cost them 3.4 million dollars in lobbying spent during obama's
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.120]  first term so you spend 3.4 million dollars and you get hundreds more than 100 million dollars
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:36.320]  in funding that's why we have the problem in washington that we have because of that kind of
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:43.120]  return on investment it incentivizes corruption it incentivizes the very worst people to get
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.440]  into washington because for a little bit of money for 3 million dollars you can get over
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:52.720]  100 million dollars if you grease the right palms if you support the right party the right
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:59.520]  politicians right candidates that's the essence of what's wrong there and of course it isn't going
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.480]  to be stopped by some kind of campaign finance reform it's the amount of money that's there
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:09.520]  the money the power that is in washington is drawing that corruption in like a black hole
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.720]  i have very little good to say about chris christie but i'll say one thing about him he was able
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:24.560]  to reduce planned parenthood funding five times in four years now it wasn't just his strength of
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:32.720]  will going up against a democrat controlled house and senate it was the fact that the state of new
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:38.720]  jersey has to meet a budget washington does not have to meet a budget washington has this thing
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.480]  called the federal reserve that just prints all this paper money for them and we know how that
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:47.920]  eventually works out we talked about that earlier in zimbabwe where they eventually went into hyper
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:55.920]  inflation they went to 11 million percent inflation there there is no fiscal responsibility
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:03.200]  necessary for washington if we don't change the rules if we allow the federal reserve to
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:09.040]  continue to print this money and put us further and further into debt all they required to keep
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.520]  this happening is for us to pay the interest on the loan that's what the income tax is about
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.440]  that's why you suffer through that that's why they created it at about the same time they
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:23.440]  created the federal reserve it is an interest only loan it is a reverse mortgage on america for the
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:28.640]  bankers to take everything and one day it's going to turn into a balloon note like we have seen
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:34.720]  in greece and like we've seen in zimbabwe like we've seen in venezuela that day of reckoning
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.280]  is coming unless we can wake up that is the true benefit of these presidential campaigns
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.520]  ron paul ran twice he was completely shut out by the system but we learned two things from it
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:51.600]  number one we learned about the political corruption of the system didn't we if you
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.240]  didn't learn a lot about political corruption in the gop about the political corruption in the
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:00.880]  media from watching the ron paul campaign you don't have the glasses on okay you need to put
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.720]  them back on go back and look at that historically look at the many different caucuses and primaries
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:13.440]  and how they were rigged how they lied about it starting with the iowa caucus rick santorum
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.920]  was eventually declared the winner by three votes or something and this guy walked in the night
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.720]  before they had the iowa caucus he walked into a bar with a camera crew nobody even knew him they
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.960]  told him to shut down sit down and shut up they wanted to watch the game and then they want us
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.480]  to tell the very next day tell us get us to think the very next day that he somehow won that come
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.480]  on they were rigging that thing from the get go but the other thing that came out of that which
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:42.240]  is equally important to know is how the financial situation is being rigged by the federal reserve
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:49.760]  ron paul's campaigns educated a vast number of people in america about the true nature of the
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.720]  federal reserve the private federal reserve about the true nature of what's going on in this country
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.720]  it's very important to have those kinds of discussions you will still need to act primarily
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:06.160]  locally like i said but you need to understand what the agenda is nationally as well as globally
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.280]  and you need to understand that when we look at people like hillary clinton and these other
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.280]  people they have this money because they get that kind of leverage from the power that they have
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.360]  so what do we do to stop this as i've said before we've got to stop incentivizing it
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.360]  let's take a look at while we're on planned parenthood let's look at what another candidate
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:33.360]  mike huckabee said he was asked at a forum if he would use federal troops or the fbi
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.320]  to stop people from having abortions and this is what he said he said we'll see if i get to
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:44.000]  be president he said all americans should be protected in other words he's implying well
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.800]  yes i would he didn't say well we need to do something else no maybe i'll use federal troops
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.920]  to stop people from having an abortion now look at that and i say really is that the best solution
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:00.400]  you can come up with i don't want to see innocent children die either but to me i look at this and
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:07.360]  it is a poverty of ideas when you only have a hammer everything looks like a nail when the only
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:14.800]  thing you can think of for every problem is to make a federal law and to enforce it by a martial
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:20.240]  law approach that's why we are where we are because that's the kind of approach that many
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:25.600]  conservatives like huckabee who should know better this guy's a former pastor he should know that
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:32.000]  drug addiction is a spiritual problem or you can call it a psychological problem if you're not a
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.480]  believer it's a spiritual problem folks it needs to be handled in different ways rather than creating
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:45.520]  SWAT teams and jackbooted thugs to go kick in the doors of homes without warrants killing innocent
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:50.240]  people stopping people on the streets stealing people's cars without finding them guilty of
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:57.520]  anything without even charging them with a crime but that's where this kind of attitude leads what
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.480]  what could we do though to stop it well maybe we could stop subsidizing it i just told you
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.800]  about how the federal government just one department the state department gave hundreds
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.480]  over a hundred million dollars worth of funding to plan parenthood because they got three and a
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.840]  half million dollars worth of lobbying from plan parenthood so when you want to stop something
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:23.520]  the first thing you can do is stop subsidizing it cut the funding first that's what rand paul says
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:30.000]  in this video we've got it you can see this video on info wars dot com new rand paul video add a tax
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.440]  planned parenthood they say over a half a billion tax dollars every year they perform abortions they
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:41.360]  sell baby parts as a voice over in the video paul says that his campaign is planning to run hard
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.960]  hitting tv radio and internet ads if you guys got that ready i'd like to play that ad go ahead play
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:53.760]  that ad planned parenthood takes over a half a billion tax dollars every year they perform abortions
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:42:01.120]  and sell baby body parts rand paul is taking action as a pro-life doctor rand paul cared for
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:07.680]  premature babies to save their sight as a conservative leader rand is forcing the vote this week to end
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:15.200]  taxpayer funding of planned parenthood standing for life from day one dr rand paul for president
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:21.120]  i'm rand paul and i approve this message so there's different ways we can attack these
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:25.520]  these these problems one of the ways is to stop subsidizing it and as i've said before when you
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:30.880]  look at immigration one of the first things we need to do is to stop subsidizing it look at this
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:38.720]  report from the uk they say this is a global immigration crisis yes it is a problem it is
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:45.680]  to create a global economic crisis to usher in global government this is what the home secretary
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:51.280]  in the uk she said a first step to make is to make britain less attractive we'll talk about
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:56.240]  that when we come back they're going to stop subsidizing the welfare benefits to stop drawing

[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:08.080]  let's go back to the immigration news that we had oh before we do before we do there's an
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:13.600]  interesting story that came up in a report that alex filed about government targeting
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:19.680]  patriot lawmakers in a nationwide crackdown we have the attorney general here in texas that
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:26.400]  they're coming after and alex had filed this report it was over a month ago that info wars dot
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:32.880]  com first reported the world that the texas attorney general tea party rising star battling the
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:38.080]  globalists on every front being attacked by the establishment republican party was going to be
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:45.760]  indicted by texas grand jury we saw tom delay indicted similarly for raising money through
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.720]  political organizations it was completely legal we've also seen today's decisions of a filmmaker
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:55.840]  indicted and now under psychiatric evaluation by the government after nine months in prison
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:00.000]  for getting five friends to donate money the judge said it's mentally ill to donate money
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.680]  against hillary clinton he actually said that you can look it up yourself this is the same party
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:09.840]  that's now suppressing videos of the babies being born and then being kept alive so the organs can
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:14.320]  be properly taken that's in the news today but that's not a crime hillary taking money from foreign
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.440]  dictators at the state department to transfer arms isn't a crime the texas attorney general
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:25.040]  advised two investors to donate money the government claims to a texas company
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:31.520]  and he didn't supposedly disclose to them in writing that he was a representative of them
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:37.040]  okay maybe this is illegal in fact if he did something wrong put him in jail but what about
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:41.760]  fast and furious what about menganese what about all the political corruption we've been seeing
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:46.560]  and the fact that no one gets in trouble for the irs persecuting hundreds of thousands of people
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:52.480]  and it coming out that they lied i mean it'd be like if you executed some low-level german
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:58.240]  officer who wasn't even the ss at nuremberg and then let hitler go or herman gurring or hindry
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:03.360]  himler i mean it's it's just ridiculous and the republican leadership the ones that bring you
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:08.160]  obama care the ones that bring you open borders they're the ones of mum on this and basically
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.320]  attacking the attorney general because they're scared of a tea party movement led by rand paul and
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:18.080]  others taking it over so this is the establishment circling the wagons republican and democratic
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:22.720]  groups are giving massive money to defeat the tea party the libertarian movement not the tea party's
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:27.120]  perfect it's just that the establishment's attacking it because he doesn't want to bring
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:33.680]  the country down more reports coming at info wars dot com we're going to be in italy breaking
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:40.080]  everything down info wars dot com alex jones reporting from the front lines alex is absolutely
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:46.480]  right when you look at hillary clinton getting tens of millions of dollars bundled when you look at
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:51.680]  these five g.o.p presidential candidates going to the coke brothers for money for this confab
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.800]  and then you look at the next to susa bundled together 20 000 dollars of his own money didn't
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:02.000]  report it properly but he doesn't get a fine he gets a felony charge he gets a judge who wants
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.680]  to treat him as if he's some kind of a serial killer doing continual psychological evaluations
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:12.800]  of him come on this is incredible the corruption as alex pointed out look at fast and furious what
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:16.800]  are they doing about fast and furious they're not investigating that they're investigating people
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:21.680]  who are politically opposed to them this kind of political persecution now is coming out of the
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:27.120]  closet it's always been done secretly or a you know in kind of an indirect way so people didn't
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.680]  really see that could deny that was really what was happening now the gloves have come off they're
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:37.280]  doing it openly look at when we're talking about fast and furious look at this new article a garland
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:42.000]  the garland one of the garland shooters this of course was the situation near dallas where they
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.600]  had the draw mohammed contest one of these garland shooters got his pistol through fast and furious
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:53.760]  how about that they say a gunman killed during his attack on islamic prophet mohammed art show
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:59.280]  in garland texas reportedly bought a pistol through the botched federal firearm sting yeah you want
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:05.200]  to call it that this is a this is cbs doing that i'm sorry new york daily news doing this yeah you
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:10.480]  want to call fast and furious a botched federal firearm sting it was a sting to destroy the
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:17.520]  second amendment and it blew up in their face 1400 firearms went missing it was supposed to go into
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:23.280]  the hands of the drug cartel and they point out on the daily news they say it was a hiccup in the
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:29.520]  eric holder stent as attorney general yeah one of many little hiccups corruption is what i would
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.120]  call it open corruption now we were talking about immigration we were talking about how this is not
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.920]  just something that is happening in america this is something that is happening globally this is
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:47.600]  what the uk's home secretary teresa may and her french counterpart have said is a global migration
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:53.040]  crisis what is behind this you need to understand what is behind it it's the same thing the same
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:58.720]  people the same forces are behind this that are behind the secret trade agreement so transpacific
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:05.760]  transatlantic agreements they're trying to create an economic crisis they're trying to bring down the
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.800]  first world nations that's what these agreements are about that's what this mass migration is about
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.520]  they say the french and british governments have warned that the world is facing a global migration
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.320]  crisis and a dramatic joint intervention teresa may the home secretary of the uk and her french
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.440]  counterpart call on countries across europe and africa to help solve the emergency caused by thousands
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.000]  of migrants congregating at their borders what are they going to do are they going to build a massive
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.720]  berlin wall to keep people out no the first thing they're going to do is to stop incentivizing the
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.800]  immigration remove the incentives remove the subsidies for planned parenthood first before
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:47.760]  you call out the troops huckabee remove the incentives for people to come into this country
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:53.760]  the massive government incentives as well as go after some of the companies that are using them
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.560]  for cheap labor first now they say in a in a uh what they're suggesting is as a first step to make
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.920]  britain less attractive the home office announced plans to cut the weekly cash allowances that
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:13.600]  support thousands of failed asylum seekers with families they stop incentivizing it you cannot
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.320]  have this welfare state you eventually run out of other people's money and that's what we're running
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.040]  out of is other people's money look at this story out of texas mcallin the city of mcallin set up
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:28.000]  another tent outside of the sacred heart church more spaces needed as illegal crossers continue
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.720]  to be released catholic charities said federal authorities release the illegal crossovers
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:39.680]  without any travel documents we've seen almost a doubling of our numbers i would say in the last
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:43.840]  three to four weeks said the workers at the catholic church there's a number of refugees
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.720]  that are being released now without bus tickets in hand so when they come to the center you know we
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:52.880]  have to make arrangements for them so they're helping them they're facilitating it they're
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:59.200]  not doing what they're doing in the uk and in france at some point we have to do that
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:04.400]  listen to what they're saying in the uk and france i say bedford char police have reported a seven fold
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:10.960]  year on year increase in illegal entries in june and they say that european efforts so far this
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:18.560]  year have smashed 17 gangs who are trafficking people across the Mediterranean to europe you
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:24.080]  have to do something about this you cannot keep incentivizing it like we are in the united states
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.200]  they say we will run out of something and we're like oh my what are we going to do and then it
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.840]  almost seems like within an hour or two the door opens up and things suddenly appear well the days
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:39.280]  of that happening are numbered it cannot go on forever we cannot sustain massive immigration in
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:44.880]  the united states without doing something about it and the first thing we need to do is to stop
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:49.680]  incentivizing it we don't need to create a police state inside our borders or to create a berlin wall
