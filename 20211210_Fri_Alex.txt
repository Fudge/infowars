[00:00.000 --> 00:19.800]  I'm watching the midterms, man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:19.800 --> 00:27.520]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:27.520 --> 00:30.360]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:30.360 --> 00:34.360]  You want a drum?
[00:34.360 --> 00:37.360]  You want a drum?
[00:37.360 --> 00:38.360]  Yeah!
[00:38.360 --> 00:39.360]  What's up?
[00:39.360 --> 00:40.360]  What's up?
[00:40.360 --> 00:41.360]  What's up?
[00:41.360 --> 00:42.360]  What's up?
[00:42.360 --> 00:43.360]  You are the president.
[00:43.360 --> 00:44.860]  You're a support-
[00:44.860 --> 00:45.860]  Muscle.
[00:45.860 --> 00:46.860]  Muscle.
[00:46.860 --> 00:47.860]  Muscle.
[00:47.860 --> 01:09.260]  And then you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker
[01:17.860 --> 01:30.860]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one!
[01:30.860 --> 01:55.860]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00.860 --> 02:24.860]  It's Friday, December 10th, the year is 2021 and we are 33 days out from the midterm elections.
[02:24.860 --> 02:39.860]  The globalists are going to stage terror attacks, they're going to crash the economy, they're going to release new viruses, they're going to announce new lockdowns because they know humanity is struggling out of their filthy, murderous, mad scientist, pedophile grip.
[02:39.860 --> 02:59.860]  I tell you, I've seen our enemies at the highest levels and I've seen our enemies down at the low level and they're all imbued with a love of death, they're all physically ugly, they're all spiritually ugly, they know their scum and they want to take us with them.
[02:59.860 --> 03:15.860]  They're Antifa without their mask on. There's footage coming in from Germany, from the UK, from the US, from Australia, of Antifa beating people up that try to come outside and don't want to stay locked down in their homes as society collapses.
[03:15.860 --> 03:30.860]  And there's footage of Antifa bullying and physically attacking people that don't want to wear mask on trains and the Antifa is there as the enforcers to then force them off of the trains. They are the terrorist enforcers of the establishment.
[03:30.860 --> 03:39.860]  They're the ones working with the authoritarian police in places like Germany. This is a medical tyranny takeover.
[03:39.860 --> 03:45.860]  Okay, let me tell you what's happening here today. We've got another gigantic transmission lined up for you.
[03:45.860 --> 03:57.860]  Mike Adams privately called me a week ago and he said, watch next week, Evergrand, the big $300 billion Chinese Ponzi scheme, real estate scam.
[03:57.860 --> 04:13.860]  It's going to go belly up and then you're going to see X, Y, and Z. And right on time, what he talked about did unfold a few days later. And so I said, I really want you to come on the show. And he said, well, this, you know, news is so scary.
[04:13.860 --> 04:21.860]  I don't want to be the one breaking it. And I said, you know, Mike, we have a responsibility and I'm not lecturing him. This is what happened. Just go ahead and tell people.
[04:21.860 --> 04:35.860]  And I respect your view. And if people know what's coming, they have a chance to stop it or at least get ready for it. So I don't like to be the bearer of bad news, as they say, but it's better to know the bad news is coming than to not know it's coming.
[04:35.860 --> 04:44.860]  You know, it's nice that we had the advent of radar and things like that. So we know when tornadoes were coming, at least get a 30 minute or an hour head start on them.
[04:44.860 --> 04:55.860]  So as you suddenly they come out of nowhere and you're you're dead. So we're going to give you that tornado storm report coming up the third hour as well. So much more today. It's going to be another very historic transmission.
[04:55.860 --> 05:15.860]  Please stay with us. Alex Jones here. Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic and the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee.
[05:15.860 --> 05:25.860]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that the media calls communist, but really they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[05:25.860 --> 05:34.860]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[05:34.860 --> 05:44.860]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally. In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[05:44.860 --> 05:55.860]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[06:14.860 --> 06:37.860]  It is a big victory against the cultural Marxist and the social engineers using liberation theology to divide and conquer the United States of America.
[06:37.860 --> 07:01.860]  A jury found Jussie, the race, hoax, terrorist, small it, guilty of staging the hate crime on himself. And it was really another in cap or demonstration piece with how he defended himself saying that the judge tried to physically attack him in the courtroom, even though that wasn't true,
[07:01.860 --> 07:17.860]  saying that everyone was racist and homophobic, including black people, and that he was a victim. But it turns out he wanted more money and more security, and it wasn't even about boosting the ratings for the flagging show empire.
[07:17.860 --> 07:29.860]  He, of course, was only thinking about himself, because I thought they may have staged the false flag to make hundreds of millions of dollars, but no, they're not even that sophisticated, plus Hollywood wouldn't go out and have a risk like that.
[07:29.860 --> 07:43.860]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it was all about him, all about his power, all about him getting to play the part of the victim all over international news and worldwide.
[07:43.860 --> 08:12.860]  And so we probably should sometime today go back and get the TV interviews he did where he broke down and cried and talked about what a victim he was, just so we can rub this in the face of the establishment of the Hollywood globalist scum that just sit back cold bloodedly and use all of this divide and conquer garbage on us.
[08:12.860 --> 08:24.860]  Guilty, smollet, guilty of hate crime hoax, jury, convicts on five counts.
[08:24.860 --> 08:35.860]  A terrible, terrible actor. I mean, I saw that guy on a soap opera crying like that. I said, this is a terrible actor.
[08:35.860 --> 08:43.860]  Absolutely terrible, but that was his job. And he saw all the other hoaxes getting all that attention.
[08:43.860 --> 08:49.860]  And so he got on board with it and the entire media in Hollywood got behind him.
[08:49.860 --> 09:07.860]  And they had news articles out there talking about maybe we should sue Alex Jones. He's questioning this as well, why Jones just questioned so much of what happens. And I do question what corporate media runs with because most of the time it's as fake as a $3 bill.
[09:07.860 --> 09:22.860]  In fact, almost all these big events, almost all hate crimes, almost all of the attacks on synagogues and the attacks on black churches, almost all of them have been staged by the left themselves.
[09:22.860 --> 09:35.860]  And in the few cases where you've had mass shootings where it's an actual white supremacist goes and kills nine black people at church, he was mentally ill, he was making threats, they knew about it and did nothing.
[09:35.860 --> 09:42.860]  Same thing with the whole Parkland situation. So they want you to forget about what happened with Jesse Small. They want to just move on from this.
[09:42.860 --> 09:54.860]  But just like with the Kyle Rittenhouse case, it shows the power of a jury and it shows the power of that institution in our country when you're able to actually put on the evidence.
[09:54.860 --> 10:09.860]  And it's why the establishment fears the jury. And it's why in the kangaroo trials they're having with these corrupt district judges in Connecticut and Texas, corrupt in my view, you can judge them.
[10:09.860 --> 10:18.860]  They don't want me to have a jury trial on whether I'm guilty of defaming Sandy Hook people for questioning what happened because the things they say I said I didn't even say.
[10:18.860 --> 10:28.860]  And so, oh no, juries will just decide how much money you owe because you are guilty. They just decide how guilty it's all preposterous.
[10:28.860 --> 10:34.860]  But this is the death rows of the corrupt establishment. Everything they're doing is not a sign of the global strength.
[10:34.860 --> 10:44.860]  It's not a sign of the establishment's power. The lockdowns, the forced inoculations, all of it is a total indicator of them losing control.
[10:44.860 --> 10:58.860]  In fact, the LA Sheriff's Department has come out and warned people not to come to Los Angeles saying that it's more dangerous than Mexico City per capita now.
[10:58.860 --> 11:13.860]  So the police department, the sheriff's department is coming out saying you cannot come here and be safe because they have a moral responsibility to tell you that you have a very good chance of being mugged or robbed or killed or kidnapped if you go to Los Angeles.
[11:13.860 --> 11:19.860]  Even the richest neighborhoods now are falling apart with crime.
[11:19.860 --> 11:26.860]  But that's what evil does. It undermines and it collapses and that's where it always takes the general population.
[11:26.860 --> 11:38.860]  And the declassified globalist plan, the leaked globalist plan, and so many different permutations is undermined society, destroyed people's will, destroyed the family, make people all alone,
[11:38.860 --> 11:57.860]  depress them, dumb them down, destroy the language, destroy any culture of strength or honor so you can completely, absolutely dominate and control the chattel minions.
[11:57.860 --> 12:08.860]  The renaissance and education and being informed and being classically liberal and valuing freedom is an obstacle to global corporate government.
[12:08.860 --> 12:23.860]  It's an obstacle to scientific tyranny. It's an obstacle to the absolute complete takeover of the human processes of life to make us a corporate commodity.
[12:23.860 --> 12:33.860]  This is the globalist final revolution, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:33.860 --> 12:41.860]  And if they succeed, they will truly be the rulers and we will be the animals. Those of us that are even alive.
[12:41.860 --> 12:50.860]  This is a total takeover of free will, a total assault on all that is decent, a total assault on all that is good.
[12:50.860 --> 13:05.860]  Now, we've got the just small news, ladies and gentlemen, but we also have the incredible next phase of the COVID-19 tyranny.
[13:05.860 --> 13:19.860]  And the way the behavioral psychologist operate is they bring up their tightening of the news in increments so that as it gets tighter and tighter and tighter, you don't notice it.
[13:19.860 --> 13:34.860]  But if you sit back and look at it in hindsight, they are really tightening down the news around our throats as we prepared just a few weeks to enter the third year of the restrictions and the mask and the inoculations.
[13:34.860 --> 13:43.860]  And in Israel, they're already up to the fifth shot. And now the Pfizer CEO has announced that everybody needs a fourth.
[13:43.860 --> 13:50.860]  So Israel's the beta test and then next it's rolled out in Europe, then the U.S. and across the world.
[13:50.860 --> 13:55.860]  And he says, oh, if you have two more shots, it'll give you the protection you had earlier.
[13:55.860 --> 14:03.860]  A real inoculation teaches your body how to beat something. And so it's basically 100% if the inoculation works, it does have side effects.
[14:03.860 --> 14:10.860]  And they can also spike the shot, which the U.N. and globalists have been caught doing many times around the world in the last 100 years.
[14:10.860 --> 14:23.860]  But this is even a vaccine. We all know that now, but the public doesn't. And so it's a gene therapy that does indeed in some cases block replication of similar viruses.
[14:23.860 --> 14:31.860]  But in many cases, creates massive autoimmune responses and blood clots and inserts, eating holes in your body.
[14:31.860 --> 14:36.860]  And then within six months, you have negative immunity compared to what you had before.
[14:36.860 --> 14:51.860]  Worse than before you took the shot, but his answer is, oh, now you'll get, they announced the BBC yesterday, seven shots, ladies and gentlemen, seven shots a year.
[14:51.860 --> 15:03.860]  Now, you notice Bill Gates said 10 shots a year 20 months ago. He loves to brag. He loves to tell you what he's going to do to you and smile at you.
[15:03.860 --> 15:13.860]  And they've even had big scientists from Pfizer on TV saying,
[15:13.860 --> 15:23.860]  we are going to erase people's immune systems and they're going to have to have us every month for every cold virus, for every flu virus, for every pneumonia virus.
[15:23.860 --> 15:30.860]  It's going to be constant. Hill, some people are going to be taking shots every couple of days.
[15:30.860 --> 15:34.860]  And it's all being announced right now.
[15:34.860 --> 15:43.860]  And then now the massive cancers, massive heart attacks, massive miscarriages, which they don't call spontaneous abortions.
[15:43.860 --> 15:48.860]  I've got it all coming up next segment. We've got to expose this. We've got to warn the world. We've got to stop them.
[15:48.860 --> 15:54.860]  They're now admitting twice as many people are dying this year than died last year of this garbage because it's from the shot.
[15:54.860 --> 15:57.860]  This is it. They're killing us.
[15:57.860 --> 16:03.860]  If you're concerned about the Alex Jones here with a very important announcement to all of our listeners, viewers and supporters,
[16:03.860 --> 16:13.860]  we are attempting to develop and deploy systems that allow the American people, not just info wars to get around corporate sensors
[16:13.860 --> 16:18.860]  and get the truth out about the New World Order's agenda so we can stop it dead in its tracks.

[16:39.860 --> 16:41.860]  So I want to thank you all for your past support.
[16:41.860 --> 16:47.860]  I want to encourage you now to not wait, do not procrastinate and to go to 1776coin.com.

[16:58.860 --> 17:02.860]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in info wars live products.
[17:02.860 --> 17:09.860]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of ultimate bone broth and we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[17:09.860 --> 17:15.860]  And we have reformulated and not just use the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[17:15.860 --> 17:19.860]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you this is next level.
[17:19.860 --> 17:20.860]  Let's know what it's got in it.
[17:20.860 --> 17:25.860]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[17:25.860 --> 17:35.860]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[17:35.860 --> 17:39.860]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium added.
[17:39.860 --> 17:41.860]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[17:41.860 --> 17:48.860]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt and it just goes on and on.
[17:48.860 --> 17:49.860]  It is now back in stock.
[17:49.860 --> 18:15.860]  Ultimate bone broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[18:20.860 --> 18:27.860]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[18:27.860 --> 18:30.860]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[18:30.860 --> 18:37.860]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[18:37.860 --> 18:39.860]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[18:39.860 --> 18:43.860]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[18:43.860 --> 18:44.860]  It's amazing.
[18:44.860 --> 18:45.860]  It works.
[18:45.860 --> 18:49.860]  So the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of the globalist system.
[18:49.860 --> 18:53.860]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[18:53.860 --> 18:54.860]  Beautifully said, brother.
[18:54.860 --> 19:23.860]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[19:25.860 --> 19:27.860]  Build back better.
[19:27.860 --> 19:33.860]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[19:33.860 --> 19:41.860]  Because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win.
[19:41.860 --> 19:44.860]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[19:44.860 --> 19:48.860]  Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[19:48.860 --> 19:55.860]  It's that simple, they can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[19:55.860 --> 19:57.860]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[19:57.860 --> 20:26.860]  We're going to get on and we win.
[20:28.860 --> 20:31.860]  You know, it's just an incredible time to be alive right now.
[20:31.860 --> 20:33.860]  That's the only way to say it.
[20:33.860 --> 20:47.860]  The only way to deal with the reality of it is that we are living in end of days revelations type times.
[20:47.860 --> 20:49.860]  And just look at these headlines video.
[20:49.860 --> 20:55.860]  Pfizer CEO declares fourth COVID shot needed sooner rather than later.
[20:55.860 --> 20:59.860]  Well, you always knew that was coming.
[20:59.860 --> 21:00.860]  Think about it.
[21:00.860 --> 21:03.860]  They roll something out that erases your immune system that doesn't work.
[21:03.860 --> 21:12.860]  And it then kills you later when you come in contact with similar viruses with ADE, antibody dependency enhancement.
[21:12.860 --> 21:18.860]  And then Pfizer spends billions in quote sponsoring all the major news pays them.
[21:18.860 --> 21:23.860]  And that's not even a conflict of interest when by the way, it's completely illegal.
[21:23.860 --> 21:26.860]  But so is authorizing and unauthorized gene therapy.
[21:26.860 --> 21:30.860]  It's a revolution by the ruling class against the people.
[21:30.860 --> 21:36.860]  They're just arrogantly up there gaslighting everybody.
[21:36.860 --> 21:37.860]  Here's another one.
[21:37.860 --> 21:42.860]  Unvaxxed in Austria could be imprisoned for a year.
[21:42.860 --> 21:46.860]  And now Fauci is talking about jail time and forced inoculation.
[21:46.860 --> 21:51.860]  And starting in a month and a half in Germany forced inoculations began.
[21:51.860 --> 21:54.860]  It's been announced.
[21:54.860 --> 22:01.860]  Bill that would have forced unvaxxed to pay their own medical costs pulled in Illinois.
[22:01.860 --> 22:06.860]  South African scientists share positive news that Omicron isn't causing a spike in deaths.
[22:06.860 --> 22:09.860]  No, the vaccines are the least vaccinated.
[22:09.860 --> 22:12.860]  You are the lower the death nation by nation.
[22:12.860 --> 22:16.860]  That's real numbers.
[22:16.860 --> 22:17.860]  Let's play this clip.
[22:17.860 --> 22:22.860]  Health Minister questioned. This is a fact in every western country taking the Pfizer and Moderna shots.
[22:22.860 --> 22:25.860]  Massive increases in miscarriages.
[22:25.860 --> 22:34.860]  Health Minister questioned about reported explosion in fully vaccinated mothers experiencing still births.
[22:34.860 --> 22:35.860]  Here it is.
[22:35.860 --> 22:39.860]  Thanks, Speaker.
[22:39.860 --> 22:41.860]  My questions to the Minister of Health.
[22:41.860 --> 22:44.860]  Late last year, my daughter was expecting her first child.
[22:44.860 --> 22:48.860]  Initially doctors had recommended against expecting women getting vaccinated.
[22:48.860 --> 22:52.860]  As any dad should do, I told her not to get the vaccine and she complied.
[22:52.860 --> 22:57.860]  Thankfully on Valentine's Day, she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Shiloh.
[22:57.860 --> 22:59.860]  I shed tears of joy.
[22:59.860 --> 23:04.860]  But a few months later, doctors said it was okay to get the vaccine while pregnant.
[23:04.860 --> 23:08.860]  What testing had been done to ensure the safety of both the mother and their unborn baby?
[23:08.860 --> 23:11.860]  But now, Minister, I shed tears of sorrow.
[23:11.860 --> 23:16.860]  In the Waterloo area, 86 stillbirths have occurred from January to July.
[23:16.860 --> 23:20.860]  And normally it's roughly one stillbirth every two months.
[23:20.860 --> 23:22.860]  But here's the kicker.
[23:22.860 --> 23:25.860]  Mothers of stillbirth babies were fully vaccinated.
[23:25.860 --> 23:29.860]  And you have clearly said on numerous occasions that the vaccines are safe.
[23:29.860 --> 23:35.860]  So, Minister, what do you say to the doctors who told expecting women it was okay to get fully vaccinated?
[23:35.860 --> 23:40.860]  And what should they tell the mothers who deliver a stillborn baby?
[23:40.860 --> 23:44.860]  Minister of Health.
[23:44.860 --> 23:46.860]  Thank you very much.
[23:46.860 --> 23:50.860]  Congratulations to you for the birth of your grandchild.
[23:50.860 --> 23:53.860]  That is wonderful news, but it is also safe.
[23:53.860 --> 23:55.860]  It has been tested.
[23:55.860 --> 24:00.860]  We are recommending that women who are pregnant do receive the vaccine for the protection of themselves,
[24:00.860 --> 24:02.860]  protection of their baby as well.
[24:02.860 --> 24:04.860]  And that has been proven.
[24:04.860 --> 24:12.860]  It has been accepted by the Health Canada, by the World Health Organization, by the FDA.
[24:12.860 --> 24:16.860]  And this is something that we want to make sure that we can protect everyone,
[24:16.860 --> 24:19.860]  women who are pregnant and is entirely safe,
[24:19.860 --> 24:24.860]  and recommended for them to receive the vaccine for themselves, their own protection,
[24:24.860 --> 24:27.860]  the safety of their loved ones, and the safety of their community.
[24:27.860 --> 24:33.860]  And if you're a radio listener, she's there with all these people in the Parliament
[24:33.860 --> 24:37.860]  wearing masks.
[24:37.860 --> 24:39.860]  Oh, but I thought you had the shot.
[24:39.860 --> 24:40.860]  I thought you're protected.
[24:40.860 --> 24:41.860]  Oh, no.
[24:41.860 --> 24:42.860]  Now you need more.
[24:42.860 --> 24:46.860]  Again, this is a planned takeover.
[24:46.860 --> 24:51.860]  The scientists that literally created this weapon are in charge of the global response.
[24:51.860 --> 25:00.860]  And there's the Health Minister lying to the public and saying it's been tested.
[25:00.860 --> 25:05.860]  No, it was tested on the public, skipping trials, and then it caused mass deaths
[25:05.860 --> 25:07.860]  and stillbirths everywhere it happened.
[25:07.860 --> 25:13.860]  And then the FDA tried to block the numbers coming out, but now the documents are out.
[25:13.860 --> 25:16.860]  And the same thing is in the UK, the same thing in Germany, the same thing in Canada.
[25:16.860 --> 25:20.860]  And she just smiles and says, Health Canada has approved this.
[25:20.860 --> 25:22.860]  Yes, without any testing.
[25:22.860 --> 25:27.860]  And now in the general public, they're hiding the real numbers coming in.
[25:27.860 --> 25:30.860]  But they've all doubled down, you see.
[25:30.860 --> 25:32.860]  They've now signed on to the evil.
[25:32.860 --> 25:36.860]  And so now they're going to cover up like their lives depend on it.
[25:36.860 --> 25:37.860]  That's how corruption works.
[25:37.860 --> 25:40.860]  That's how the pedophile rings took over the Vatican.
[25:40.860 --> 25:48.860]  It's how they took over so many other institutions is they go, oh, hey, one of the priests abused a 10-year-old.
[25:48.860 --> 25:54.860]  And if we say something about this, it's going to bring down the local parish and it'll break up the church.
[25:54.860 --> 26:01.860]  So we better just send this priest to another town.
[26:01.860 --> 26:05.860]  And then they come back later and say, oh, remember, you helped cover up that pedophilia.
[26:05.860 --> 26:09.860]  Now you owe us some political favors.
[26:09.860 --> 26:10.860]  That's the same thing with this lady.
[26:10.860 --> 26:11.860]  Oh, it's safe.
[26:11.860 --> 26:13.860]  Nobody's hurt.
[26:13.860 --> 26:21.860]  It doesn't matter if there's a 20-fold or 30 times in some countries fold increase in stillbirths,
[26:21.860 --> 26:24.860]  in spontaneous abortions of women that take the shot.
[26:24.860 --> 26:35.860]  Hell, they had a New England Medical Journal report that said an 84% spontaneous abortion rate in first trimesters.
[26:35.860 --> 26:39.860]  And then it was only 20-something had miscarriages in the second or third.
[26:39.860 --> 26:45.860]  Still a massive, massive, multi-thousand percent increase.
[26:45.860 --> 26:48.860]  I got a clip of a medical doctor talking about it when we come back.
[26:48.860 --> 26:58.860]  We need more legislators and more leaders and more parliamentarians to come out and just keep magnifying these numbers
[26:58.860 --> 27:04.860]  because they just want to brainwash the public.
[27:04.860 --> 27:08.860]  And then we've got the real numbers showing that it's massively increasing.
[27:08.860 --> 27:11.860]  And that's even in the CDC's own documents and the FDA's own documents.
[27:11.860 --> 27:18.860]  But then they run headlines saying, oh, stillbirth rates not increasing in the regional recording systems.
[27:18.860 --> 27:23.860]  Stillbirth rates not increasing in the region according to hospital officials.
[27:23.860 --> 27:27.860]  Oh, the officials say they don't cite any documents.
[27:27.860 --> 27:28.860]  They don't show any proof.
[27:28.860 --> 27:35.860]  They don't show you the FDA documents and the CDC documents and the UK government documents.
[27:35.860 --> 27:38.860]  National Health Service.
[27:38.860 --> 27:42.860]  They just tell you, oh, we talked to a doctor.
[27:42.860 --> 27:44.860]  Remember the headlines a few months ago?
[27:44.860 --> 27:48.860]  A doctor in Oklahoma says thousands have died.
[27:48.860 --> 27:55.860]  Thousands and thousands sick from ivermectin hospitals around the block from people sick on ivermectin.
[27:55.860 --> 27:58.860]  And they went and called the hospitals and they said, no, nobody.
[27:58.860 --> 28:02.860]  We only had one person in here sick from ivermectin.
[28:02.860 --> 28:07.860]  Just like Fauci said, oh, if you take the shot, you're 99% protected.
[28:07.860 --> 28:09.860]  All lies.
[28:09.860 --> 28:14.860]  Oh, 99% of people in the hospitals haven't been vaccinated.
[28:14.860 --> 28:16.860]  And people said, where did that number come from?
[28:16.860 --> 28:20.860]  It was just made up.
[28:20.860 --> 28:25.860]  And so they sit up there and they tell you everywhere, oh, we talked to a doctor.
[28:25.860 --> 28:27.860]  Everybody's dying from the horse paste.
[28:27.860 --> 28:28.860]  They go check the doctor.
[28:28.860 --> 28:29.860]  Doesn't work there.
[28:29.860 --> 28:30.860]  Made it up.
[28:30.860 --> 28:31.860]  Total lie.
[28:31.860 --> 28:34.860]  Democrat operative.
[28:34.860 --> 28:38.860]  In here, oh, a hospital says that there's no increases.
[28:38.860 --> 28:46.860]  No, no, no.
[28:46.860 --> 28:51.860]  Politifact report finds increased risk of spontaneous abortion following COVID-19 vaccine during
[28:51.860 --> 28:55.860]  pregnancy after correcting major error in CDC study.
[28:55.860 --> 28:57.860]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[28:57.860 --> 28:58.860]  Hey, everybody.
[28:58.860 --> 29:03.860]  Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our amazing listeners and viewers.
[29:03.860 --> 29:08.860]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special.
[29:08.860 --> 29:12.860]  It's the 1776 founder coin.
[29:12.860 --> 29:14.860]  You've got to see this coin for yourself.
[29:14.860 --> 29:18.860]  It's at 1776coin.com.
[29:18.860 --> 29:27.860]  And this coin makes you a founding member of a very exciting group of projects that we're going to be launching in the very new future.

[29:45.860 --> 29:58.860]  That's why you're called a founding member because the funding from this is going to go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[29:58.860 --> 30:14.860]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[30:14.860 --> 30:18.860]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[30:18.860 --> 30:25.860]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[30:25.860 --> 30:29.860]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[30:29.860 --> 30:32.860]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[30:32.860 --> 30:33.860]  It's high quality.
[30:33.860 --> 30:43.860]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[30:43.860 --> 30:49.860]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[30:49.860 --> 30:54.860]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.

[31:25.860 --> 31:28.860]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[31:28.860 --> 31:35.860]  It's got a real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[31:35.860 --> 31:39.860]  It even takes better than the last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[31:39.860 --> 31:46.860]  Again, it has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and solvability.
[31:46.860 --> 31:51.860]  You're going to love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your bones.
[31:51.860 --> 31:53.860]  It's simply amazing and it helps find the info war.

[32:24.860 --> 32:31.860]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[32:31.860 --> 32:38.860]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[32:38.860 --> 32:44.860]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[32:44.860 --> 32:51.860]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[32:51.860 --> 32:58.860]  It's all there at infowarstore.com, so protect your privacy today and support the info war at infowarstore.com.
[33:22.860 --> 33:39.860]  I want to know about the rest of the worldwide medical UN martial law takeover that's taking place here on The Alex Jones Show.
[33:39.860 --> 33:50.860]  But since we mentioned it, here is a medical doctor speaking about the increase in miscarriages being seen again in Canada.
[33:50.860 --> 34:00.860]  But this is all over the world and then you see the different federal agencies trying to block the release of their own internal numbers
[34:00.860 --> 34:07.860]  because they've been caught, they're killing people, this is happening.
[34:07.860 --> 34:16.860]  And it really is surreal and it really makes me physically sick
[34:16.860 --> 34:24.860]  to know that we're in the middle of a ruling class and their minions really trying to kill and maim and collapse western society
[34:24.860 --> 34:28.860]  so that world government can take over and then really start exterminating people
[34:28.860 --> 34:35.860]  once they've taken out the once free nations that they've got to get rid of so that their flank is covered
[34:35.860 --> 34:43.860]  and protected while they engage in their main depopulation.
[34:43.860 --> 34:47.860]  You don't need to mark my words anymore.
[34:47.860 --> 34:52.860]  It was 22 months ago that we laid out this entire agenda and where it was going to be going
[34:52.860 --> 34:56.860]  and that it would be never ending, that we'd be here in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years
[34:56.860 --> 34:59.860]  and by then almost everyone would be dead.
[34:59.860 --> 35:04.860]  And I'm just calmly on the radio in Austin, Texas talking about this.
[35:04.860 --> 35:13.860]  And I talk to scientists and top military people and former heads of US agencies and top podcasters and top TV host and top news anchors
[35:13.860 --> 35:22.860]  and they all totally agree with me and are trying to get their audience ready to deal with this incrementally.
[35:22.860 --> 35:26.860]  You can't bring this out slowly to the public.
[35:26.860 --> 35:32.860]  The globalists have this designed where if this incrementally comes out, we just become acclimated to it and accept it.
[35:32.860 --> 35:35.860]  We need to be shocked. We need to be freaked out.
[35:35.860 --> 35:43.860]  We need to be peacefully taking over live TV programs and radio programs when they're in public and not hurting anybody
[35:43.860 --> 35:50.860]  but making major scenes like we did back during the election in 2016 taking over the Hillary events.
[35:50.860 --> 35:52.860]  We're talking about the children here.
[35:52.860 --> 35:54.860]  We need to be handing out flyers everywhere.
[35:54.860 --> 35:58.860]  We need to be going and protesting places where the deadly shots are being given.
[35:58.860 --> 36:01.860]  We need to be going to school boards and standing up against the attack on our children.
[36:01.860 --> 36:04.860]  This is the big New World Order assault, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:04.860 --> 36:07.860]  And I'm going to explain this to everybody one more time.
[36:07.860 --> 36:12.860]  Submission equals death.
[36:12.860 --> 36:15.860]  Going along with this only makes it worse.
[36:15.860 --> 36:24.860]  But they know the behavioral psychologist that the average person is in a trance-like state between sleeping and waking
[36:24.860 --> 36:33.860]  from the TVs, from the flicker rates, from their little globalist mind control devices known as iPhones and droids.
[36:33.860 --> 36:40.860]  And they know the average person is in a spectator stance where people receive things like a dream.
[36:40.860 --> 36:46.860]  Their subconscious minds aren't differentiating the real world versus fantasy.
[36:46.860 --> 36:54.860]  And so they see so much science fiction and so much dystopia and so much horror and so many zombie apocalypse on television
[36:54.860 --> 37:02.860]  and so many shoot-em-up video games that they cannot differentiate what's currently happening to them in the real world.
[37:02.860 --> 37:09.860]  And the media and the fat checkers are there saying nobody dies that gets the vaccine.
[37:09.860 --> 37:11.860]  The vaccine's 100 percent.
[37:11.860 --> 37:14.860]  If you get it, you're protected.
[37:14.860 --> 37:17.860]  That's why you still got to wear a mask and take more shots.
[37:17.860 --> 37:19.860]  You're like, that doesn't make sense.
[37:19.860 --> 37:25.860]  To someone in a trance, you're just giving them the programming.
[37:25.860 --> 37:29.860]  You're giving them the brainwashing of this totally protects you.
[37:29.860 --> 37:32.860]  That's why you've got to take more shots and wear a mask.
[37:32.860 --> 37:36.860]  And it's the fault of people that didn't take it that you're sick because you're totally protected by the shot,
[37:36.860 --> 37:39.860]  but those that didn't take the shot didn't protect you.
[37:39.860 --> 37:43.860]  I mean, a five-year-old knows logically that's BS.
[37:43.860 --> 37:47.860]  But someone in a trance, someone in spiritual darkness,
[37:47.860 --> 37:59.860]  someone who is not aware of what's going on around them can be put deeper and deeper and deeper into the hypnosis.
[37:59.860 --> 38:05.860]  I want to play this clip of the doctor talking about what happened and we'll do that next segment.
[38:05.860 --> 38:16.860]  I'm not saying at this point that I'm going to take any time off, but the stuff going on has gotten to me as well.
[38:16.860 --> 38:22.860]  It's everybody needs to take as much time as you need out in your lives to just get right with God,
[38:22.860 --> 38:28.860]  get right with your family and everything else because all the crap about bills and what your neighbors think
[38:28.860 --> 38:34.860]  and football games and acting cool and just stupid stuff does not matter.
[38:34.860 --> 38:40.860]  This is an attack, this is a takeover, and this is very, very real.
[38:40.860 --> 38:49.860]  And I just have to remember to be calm and not be angry because this makes me physically so angry I want to throw up.
[38:49.860 --> 38:53.860]  When I look at the New World Order and I look at their operations and I see what they're doing
[38:53.860 --> 38:59.860]  and I see all the talking heads who know what they're part of going along with this because they feel like they're on the winning team
[38:59.860 --> 39:04.860]  and they see you as an animal that deserves to die.
[39:04.860 --> 39:14.860]  As they pose as the liberals, as they pose as the savers, as they pose as the good guys, it is just disgusting to behold.
[39:14.860 --> 39:17.860]  But we've got to continue to fight back.
[39:17.860 --> 39:19.860]  Speaking of that, everything I do is symbiotic.
[39:19.860 --> 39:24.860]  Everything I promote is meant to empower others and then they can empower me and then vice versa.
[39:24.860 --> 39:28.860]  That's how we create that connection, that 360 win that I talk so much about.
[39:28.860 --> 39:35.860]  Cobalt Land Part 2, Part 1 is excellent, gives you the history and the lies and reminds people how we were inducted into the fraud
[39:35.860 --> 39:40.860]  with 15 days to flatten the curve and the predictions of what would come in the future.
[39:40.860 --> 39:46.860]  But Part 2, I don't want to say it's even more powerful, but it just is powerful when it destroys the mask
[39:46.860 --> 39:52.860]  and the fact that it doesn't protect you and that it's a cult programming system of mind control.
[39:52.860 --> 40:02.860]  Part 2 is now out. Cobalt Land the Mask with Dr. Lee Merritt, Alex Newman, Peggy Hall,
[40:02.860 --> 40:10.860]  Dwight Stovall, Tammy Clark, Narita by Alex Jones, and so many others.
[40:10.860 --> 40:12.860]  A symbol of fear and bondage.
[40:12.860 --> 40:13.860]  What a great job they did.
[40:13.860 --> 40:18.860]  We're very blessed to be part of it and be able to help produce it and get it out to the wider public.
[40:18.860 --> 40:24.860]  It's available at infowarstore.com and it is an absolute must Christmas gift.
[40:24.860 --> 40:29.860]  And when you get the film, if you don't already have Part 1, be sure and get that.
[40:29.860 --> 40:31.860]  We've got more of those that came in.
[40:31.860 --> 40:33.860]  It was out of stock for a while.
[40:33.860 --> 40:41.860]  But when you get Part 2, the Mask of Cobalt Land, you get two incredible films on one DVD,
[40:41.860 --> 40:46.860]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death.
[40:46.860 --> 40:51.860]  This is a very, very important film and people can say, well, why do we want a DVD?
[40:51.860 --> 40:55.860]  Well, with all the censorship and all the control and all the memory-holing,
[40:55.860 --> 40:59.860]  it's more important than ever to get something on DVD for your library, to burn copies of it,
[40:59.860 --> 41:00.860]  to share it.
[41:00.860 --> 41:02.860]  These don't have copy protection on it.
[41:02.860 --> 41:06.860]  And in the future, more and more with this takeover, if we fail to back them off,
[41:06.860 --> 41:11.860]  it's going to be hand-to-hand information warfare where you're going to have to make copies of these
[41:11.860 --> 41:13.860]  and get these out to people in the underground.
[41:13.860 --> 41:17.860]  But then when things are so horrible, it'll be even more precious.
[41:17.860 --> 41:21.860]  There'll be underground churches just full of people watching every bit of this
[41:21.860 --> 41:25.860]  and just realizing how wrong they were and how it was long-term total control.
[41:25.860 --> 41:27.860]  There'll be billions dead by then.
[41:27.860 --> 41:30.860]  But then that's how we form the resistance that had defeated them.
[41:30.860 --> 41:32.860]  This has all been a long-term process, folks.
[41:32.860 --> 41:33.860]  We knew this was coming.
[41:33.860 --> 41:37.860]  And most of us fighting now won't be here for the victory, but we will win in the end.
[41:37.860 --> 41:39.860]  But they're going to kill billions of people.
[41:39.860 --> 41:42.860]  A lot of your friends and neighbors are going to be dead soon from the injections.
[41:42.860 --> 41:43.860]  I'm sorry to have to tell them.
[41:43.860 --> 41:45.860]  So, and I'm not trying to be dramatic.
[41:45.860 --> 41:46.860]  I mean, this is real, okay?
[41:46.860 --> 41:47.860]  This is happening.
[41:47.860 --> 41:48.860]  You know it is.
[41:48.860 --> 41:49.860]  You've seen the facts.
[41:49.860 --> 41:51.860]  It's very, very sad.
[41:51.860 --> 41:54.860]  So everyone needs to get your underground libraries ready now.
[41:54.860 --> 41:59.860]  Dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove, the order of death.
[41:59.860 --> 42:05.860]  And the Dark Secrets of Bohemian Grove film, those two DVDs, or one DVD with two films,
[42:05.860 --> 42:11.860]  is free when you get Covenland Part II, The Mask.
[42:11.860 --> 42:18.860]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com, or triple-eight, 2533139.
[42:18.860 --> 42:24.860]  This is a absolute must-have for Christmas.
[42:24.860 --> 42:28.860]  I know it's a very dark time and a very dark Christmas, but we've got to be the light in the world.
[42:28.860 --> 42:30.860]  And this is the truth about what's going on.
[42:30.860 --> 42:34.860]  So I would get the films and then give them to your friends and family, order some extras,
[42:34.860 --> 42:37.860]  donate them to your local library, to your local school.
[42:37.860 --> 42:42.860]  You never know who you're going to wake up, and each soul, each mind is so incredibly precious
[42:42.860 --> 42:47.860]  that we get out of this matrix system, because it is about the soul realizing this is a test
[42:47.860 --> 42:49.860]  and not being captured by the globalist.
[42:49.860 --> 42:54.860]  So get the new film, Covenland Part II with the free films at infowarstore.com.
[42:54.860 --> 42:57.860]  Well, there I am back, stay with us.
[42:57.860 --> 43:01.860]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[43:01.860 --> 43:03.860]  Get our great bag of it here.
[43:03.860 --> 43:08.860]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[43:08.860 --> 43:13.860]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[43:13.860 --> 43:15.860]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[43:15.860 --> 43:19.860]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[43:19.860 --> 43:20.860]  but really, they're just a commune.
[43:20.860 --> 43:23.860]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it.
[43:23.860 --> 43:25.860]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[43:25.860 --> 43:28.860]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years,
[43:28.860 --> 43:30.860]  and the price has never gone up.
[43:30.860 --> 43:34.860]  They've sold it Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[43:34.860 --> 43:37.860]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[43:37.860 --> 43:41.860]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[43:41.860 --> 43:46.860]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[43:46.860 --> 43:47.860]  Yeah, I'd like to.
[43:47.860 --> 43:48.860]  You won't believe it.
[43:48.860 --> 43:53.860]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[43:53.860 --> 44:00.860]  If you don't find us and don't want us here, that's fine.
[44:00.860 --> 44:05.860]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[44:05.860 --> 44:07.860]  what's happening in the atmosphere.
[44:07.860 --> 44:11.860]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments
[44:11.860 --> 44:15.860]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[44:15.860 --> 44:21.860]  The only constant, the only great truth is, change is the only constant.
[44:21.860 --> 44:24.860]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[44:24.860 --> 44:27.860]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s,
[44:27.860 --> 44:31.860]  and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[44:31.860 --> 44:33.860]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[44:33.860 --> 44:39.860]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations
[44:39.860 --> 44:42.860]  and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[44:42.860 --> 44:43.860]  They have.
[44:43.860 --> 44:45.860]  Weather control trees from 1979.
[44:45.860 --> 44:49.860]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[44:49.860 --> 44:53.860]  In fact, back in 1984, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for it out of spring,
[44:53.860 --> 44:56.860]  different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[44:56.860 --> 44:59.860]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[44:59.860 --> 45:05.860]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by Infowars Life.

[45:09.860 --> 45:17.860]  most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[45:17.860 --> 45:24.860]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[45:58.860 --> 46:03.860]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[46:03.860 --> 46:04.860]  I like going to concerts.
[46:04.860 --> 46:05.860]  I like going to play golf.
[46:05.860 --> 46:07.860]  I like going out to dinner.
[46:07.860 --> 46:09.860]  I like the metropolitan life.
[46:09.860 --> 46:11.860]  I like everything that comes with this.
[46:11.860 --> 46:17.860]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities,
[46:17.860 --> 46:23.860]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[46:23.860 --> 46:27.860]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods,
[46:27.860 --> 46:31.860]  and just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[46:31.860 --> 46:32.860]  That's the survival instinct.
[46:32.860 --> 46:37.860]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:37.860 --> 46:38.860]  Stay in the city.
[46:38.860 --> 46:43.860]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[46:43.860 --> 46:49.860]  That's the internal struggle that, my guess is, a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[46:49.860 --> 46:54.860]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies,
[46:54.860 --> 46:57.860]  and so we have the best ones at InfowarsStore.com.
[46:57.860 --> 47:02.860]  Infowars.
[47:28.860 --> 47:32.860]  That's what the evidence showed, and now it's happening, but you're under Stockholm syndrome,
[47:32.860 --> 47:37.860]  and can't believe that the system at the top's evil run by Bill Gates, who admits he wants you dead,
[47:37.860 --> 47:59.860]  and you're still wearing your little mask even though you're getting ready to take your fourth shots, hospital workers.
[47:59.860 --> 48:04.860]  The mask has been used for millennia to subjugate the human spirit.
[48:04.860 --> 48:12.860]  It hides the endlessly changing expressions that allow us to express our emotions and empathize with one another.
[48:12.860 --> 48:15.860]  The mask becomes our only expression.
[48:15.860 --> 48:17.860]  It is fixed and unchanging.
[48:17.860 --> 48:24.860]  This is the purpose of the mask, to turn us into expressionless animals and submissive slaves.
[48:24.860 --> 48:35.860]  This is why they've mandated them after first telling us they're useless against COVID, to make us submit and prepare us for total subjugation and death.
[48:35.860 --> 48:43.860]  Get your copy of COVID Land Part 2, The Mask, and support the Infowar.
[48:43.860 --> 48:55.860]  And get a free copy of my two films on Bohemian Grove, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and The Order of Death, with your purchase of the film.
[48:55.860 --> 48:58.860]  And all we care about is you getting the film.
[48:58.860 --> 49:07.860]  It's authorized to make copies, burn CDs, and explain to people that these DVDs are forbidden, they are verboten, they are underground,
[49:07.860 --> 49:13.860]  and people will appreciate that more and watch it and then tell them to make copies of the copies and share it as well.
[49:13.860 --> 49:21.860]  We got millions and millions and millions of films out, copies of documentaries back during the age of the DVD.
[49:21.860 --> 49:24.860]  It had a huge effect with my underground films.
[49:24.860 --> 49:27.860]  And now as the censorship kicks in, it's more important than ever.
[49:27.860 --> 49:34.860]  I'm going to stop belaboring that now in FullWarStore.com.
[49:34.860 --> 49:40.860]  High-budget film needs to be seen.
[49:40.860 --> 49:47.860]  Here is a doctor in Canada talking about the massive increases in miscarriages.
[49:47.860 --> 49:56.860]  Dr. Daniel Nagase, the very famous doctor who treated three of his patients with ivermectin and they survived.
[49:56.860 --> 50:01.860]  He is a hero for all Canadians right now and we are so very fortunate to have him here.
[50:01.860 --> 50:10.860]  Dr. Nagase, we noticed that you were creating some attention in North Vancouver a couple of days ago with these stillborn babies in the hospital there.
[50:10.860 --> 50:14.860]  Can you tell us a little bit about the outcome of that?
[50:14.860 --> 50:21.860]  From one of the local doctors in North Vancouver, Dr. Mel Bruchet, he has contacts all through Vancouver.
[50:21.860 --> 50:29.860]  And some doulas who work in Women and Children's Hospital, which isn't in North Vancouver, it's in Vancouver, Vancouver.
[50:29.860 --> 50:36.860]  They had 13 stillbirths in a 24-hour period. That was what I heard.
[50:36.860 --> 50:41.860]  But the thing is, I've also heard a similar story out in Waterloo, Ontario.
[50:41.860 --> 50:51.860]  So in Waterloo, Ontario, I have a more reliable statistic that there were 86 stillbirths between January and July.
[50:51.860 --> 50:57.860]  And normally it's only five or six stillbirths every year.
[50:57.860 --> 51:02.860]  So about one stillbirth every two months is the usual rate.
[51:02.860 --> 51:09.860]  So to suddenly get to 86 stillbirths in six months, that's highly unusual.
[51:09.860 --> 51:21.860]  But the confirmation, the most important confirmation that we have from the Waterloo, Ontario report was that all of the 86 stillbirths were fully vaccinated.
[51:21.860 --> 51:23.860]  Fully vaccinated mothers.
[51:23.860 --> 51:24.860]  That's right.
[51:24.860 --> 51:26.860]  So we're seeing a correlation.
[51:26.860 --> 51:36.860]  And certainly when you see a correlation, then you have to start asking in the water in Waterloo, is there something, you know, is there something in the air?
[51:36.860 --> 51:39.860]  Is there some toxin in the food supply?
[51:39.860 --> 51:50.860]  But when you see the same correlation in different parts of the country in Vancouver and then in Waterloo, and you see an increase in stillbirths,
[51:50.860 --> 52:08.860]  you have to ask yourself what is going on that is both in Waterloo, Ontario and Vancouver, BC that is suddenly causing an increase in stillbirths?
[52:08.860 --> 52:23.860]  All right, the full video is up on infowars.com in this article. Health Minister questioned about reported explosion in fully vaccinated mothers experiencing stillbirths at a massively increased rate.
[52:23.860 --> 52:26.860]  And she just says, no, government says it's totally safe.
[52:26.860 --> 52:28.860]  Pregnant women should take these shots.
[52:28.860 --> 52:37.860]  Until about 10 years ago, every major government in the world said a pregnant woman should never take a vaccine because it can cause an autoimmune response and make the woman reject the baby.
[52:37.860 --> 52:46.860]  This is even a vaccine. And they know in animal studies with mRNA vaccines, it causes massive, massive rejections of the fetus.
[52:46.860 --> 52:54.860]  There's also studies out saying if you've had a liver transplant or kidney transplant recently, you don't want to take a vaccine because it'll make you reject it.
[52:54.860 --> 52:58.860]  This is like mainline known stuff, okay?
[52:58.860 --> 53:06.860]  Like mothers shouldn't drink, you know, bottles of Jack Daniels every night, you might get fetal infant alcohol syndrome.
[53:06.860 --> 53:14.860]  Or, hey, you might not want to shoot yourself in the head with a shotgun, it might kill you. This is known information.
[53:14.860 --> 53:16.860]  Here's some more of the headlines.
[53:16.860 --> 53:26.860]  Traveling nurses triple salaries as hospitals struggle with national staffing crisis.
[53:26.860 --> 53:34.860]  The hospitals are struggling, they're having to call in the National Guard because they fired the uninjected.
[53:34.860 --> 53:42.860]  But it is true what CNN says, because I've looked at the actual numbers and called hospitals, they are full of people dying who are the vaccinated.
[53:42.860 --> 53:47.860]  And that's confirmed from Israel to the U.K., to the United States, to Canada, to Australia.
[53:47.860 --> 53:55.860]  I can play you. The Canadian Health Minister is saying, we've got 74 people in the province here who have COVID.
[53:55.860 --> 54:10.860]  And 71, no, excuse me, it was only one, was it vaccinated? I'm going from memory. The point was, they put out this big number, 70 something, and then only one was it vaccinated.
[54:10.860 --> 54:22.860]  And then almost everyone dying hasn't had the shots. I mean, it's just, it's mind blowing to see them on the news saying, if you've had the shot, you're protected.
[54:22.860 --> 54:25.860]  That's why people that don't have the shot are going to infect you.
[54:25.860 --> 54:32.860]  Immunity means your body knows how to beat it. It doesn't matter if somebody's got it next to you. That's 100%.
[54:32.860 --> 54:36.860]  That's facts. That's science. That's reality.
[54:36.860 --> 54:45.860]  COVID-19 patients at the hospital are dying at a rate we've never seen die before, and it's taking a toll on healthcare workers.
[54:45.860 --> 54:55.860]  But then you don't ask, I mean, even NPR did ask a few months ago, record numbers of people dying of strange cold-like illness, and they don't have COVID.
[54:55.860 --> 55:03.860]  Same thing in the UK. Super cold, killing record numbers, twice as many as in hospital as last year. No one knows why.
[55:03.860 --> 55:11.860]  Gee, wonder why there's suddenly, in every major city of the Western world, increases in miscarriages.
[55:11.860 --> 55:20.860]  It's not a toxic waste dump in one town. It's not something that fell out of the sky in one city. It's everywhere.
[55:20.860 --> 55:30.860]  And we know what it is. It's this injection that makes people create new viruses, that makes people create new variants, and that erases your immune system.
[55:30.860 --> 55:39.860]  And, I mean, that's why it's hard for me to even celebrate Smollett, you know, getting convicted or Rittenhouse being acquitted or any of this, because that's all important.
[55:39.860 --> 55:49.860]  But at the end of the day, folks, the entire thrust of the takeover is this medical tyranny with a medical ID for the medical social credit score, the carbon tax, and they get that in place.
[55:49.860 --> 55:59.860]  And it's going in place all over the world right now. We are now inside the Mark of the Beast.
[55:59.860 --> 56:05.860]  So have you ever wondered how is the devil, how is this world government he runs going to get everybody to do this?
[56:05.860 --> 56:18.860]  And now you know, saying it's to stop a virus, saying it's to make you safe and getting you to sign on, then you wear the mask, you take the shots, they go, sorry, you got to take more.
[56:18.860 --> 56:28.860]  And again, on its face, it's not even what they say it is. All the experts that looked at it last year said, this is going to erase your immune system.
[56:28.860 --> 56:42.860]  And Pfizer is like, yeah, that's the point. And now they think they're just going to get away with this by censoring everybody and shutting down people speaking about it.
[56:42.860 --> 56:49.860]  That's why this broadcast is a life and death situation. That's why keeping this on air as long as we possibly can is so important.
[56:49.860 --> 56:53.860]  And that's why your support and your prayers and your word of mouth is everything.
[56:53.860 --> 57:01.860]  You know, we're going to end up selling out about this weekend. I want to thank everybody for their support. That will really help us stay on air and launch some really new important initiatives.

[57:09.860 --> 57:18.860]  And it is an original silver round coin that has a substantive markup on it to pay for the operation.

[57:33.860 --> 57:40.860]  There are only 3,400 left as of this morning. So if you want to have this historic coin, I'd order it now at 1776coin.com.

[57:53.860 --> 58:03.860]  We are attempting to develop and deploy systems that allow the American people, not just InfoWars, to get around corporate sensors
[58:03.860 --> 58:08.860]  and get the truth out about the New World Order's agenda so we can stop it dead in its tracks.
[58:08.860 --> 58:17.860]  And so when you visit 1776coin.com, you don't just have the opportunity to get an amazing one run limited edition silver coin

[58:29.860 --> 58:37.860]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and I want to encourage you now to not wait, do not procrastinate and to go to 1776coin.com.

[58:50.860 --> 58:55.860]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[58:55.860 --> 59:01.860]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[59:01.860 --> 59:12.860]  xת-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9 x8-2-5-3-3-3-1-3-9 is the InfoWars Store Hotline
[59:12.860 --> 59:20.860]  x8-2-5-3-3-3-1-3-9 is the InfoWars Store Hotline
[59:20.860 --> 59:34.740]  If a war store dot com is simply the best If a war store dot com beats out all the rest
[59:34.740 --> 1:00:00.660]  of the world, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:00.660 --> 1:00:15.180]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:22.180]  I'm going to open the phones up in the shower to take your calls and then Mike Adams is
[1:00:22.180 --> 1:00:26.660]  going to join us in the third hour today and then I'm going to interview Dr. Zelenko in
[1:00:26.660 --> 1:00:32.820]  a commercial free interview that will be part of a raft of doctors, obviously it's a Sabbath
[1:00:32.820 --> 1:00:38.100]  for him at sundown which we totally understand and don't want to violate that.
[1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:41.740]  So we're interviewing the other doctors tomorrow in a big huge emergency broadcast, we're interviewing
[1:00:41.740 --> 1:00:46.380]  Zelenko today after I'm off air, that will be commercial free, I say commercial free
[1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:49.380]  and we're talking 30 minutes an hour before we take a break.
[1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:52.500]  It's not like a normal set clock.
[1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:57.020]  So I'm interviewing Zelenko and a bunch of other people today and tomorrow and then we
[1:00:57.020 --> 1:01:00.420]  also have another big part of the emergency broadcast that's going to be coming out.
[1:01:00.420 --> 1:01:05.020]  I just really appreciate the crew and all the great work they do and all the great listeners.
[1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:11.940]  Today I am particularly upset and I'm not standing on air and people feel sorry for
[1:01:11.940 --> 1:01:12.940]  me.
[1:01:12.940 --> 1:01:17.780]  I just, these people are killing us.
[1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:24.420]  I mean we're under attack and I can be a Christ-like person myself, I can physically be attacked
[1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:28.780]  and lay down if it's the right place and time because it destroys our enemies, I understand
[1:01:28.780 --> 1:01:33.100]  that works that way, Gandhi did it, Martin Luther King Jr. did it, but I got a real problem
[1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:39.100]  with the kids and that's why they're attacking them folks, they want a war and Jesus Christ
[1:01:39.100 --> 1:01:43.020]  wouldn't sit there and let them kill children, he said I'll destroy you, I'll kill you.
[1:01:43.020 --> 1:01:45.980]  He said the number one thing is you hurt these innocent children, you better just tie a rope
[1:01:45.980 --> 1:01:49.100]  around your neck and tie it to a boulder and throw it in the ocean because that would
[1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:51.540]  be a lot better than what I'm going to do to you.
[1:01:51.540 --> 1:01:55.780]  And so this isn't me up here acting tough, I know you're in the same way, you're not
[1:01:55.780 --> 1:02:02.340]  trying to look for trouble man, these people are out of control and the worst part about
[1:02:02.340 --> 1:02:06.100]  it is it's like stepping on a cockroach, you got to clean it up.
[1:02:06.100 --> 1:02:11.540]  These people are such wicked, ugly filth and they know they are and that's why they want
[1:02:11.540 --> 1:02:14.700]  to hurt our children made in God's image.
[1:02:14.700 --> 1:02:18.900]  And so let's just work really hard to wake people up and really hard to resist them and
[1:02:18.900 --> 1:02:23.940]  let's just start having more civil disobedience, I went out last weekend, I went out last weekend
[1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:30.140]  civil disobedience stuff and you just, you've got to do it yourselves too and we've just
[1:02:30.140 --> 1:02:35.220]  got to create such a crescendo and such a noise at city councils and county commissions
[1:02:35.220 --> 1:02:42.780]  and at school boards and on talk radio and at your churches and at your bit, your synagogues,
[1:02:42.780 --> 1:02:52.540]  your mosque, doesn't matter, you better understand you're under attack and I'll be honest with
[1:02:52.540 --> 1:03:00.340]  you, I made some big mistakes, I really underestimated the new world order, we knew they planned
[1:03:00.340 --> 1:03:05.580]  the viral release and then the extermination vaccines later, I thought they would have
[1:03:05.580 --> 1:03:10.660]  a placebo injection to get the precedent set but no they're not doing that, they're
[1:03:10.660 --> 1:03:15.980]  just going ahead with the extermination, I mean people are dying all over the place
[1:03:15.980 --> 1:03:26.700]  from these injections and I mean but it makes sense, they were behind schedule and so if
[1:03:26.700 --> 1:03:35.020]  you're behind schedule, you jam on the accelerator, you don't drive slower, you drive faster and
[1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:37.580]  that's what's so crazy is they're desperate, they're scared, they're acting like there's
[1:03:37.580 --> 1:03:41.260]  a gun to their head, like aliens told them, hey we're going to blow the planet up if you
[1:03:41.260 --> 1:03:45.220]  don't kill 90% of the people, I mean that's how they act, they're gulping, they look totally
[1:03:45.220 --> 1:03:50.220]  freaked out on TV, they look like somebody's got a gun to their head and they're up there
[1:03:50.220 --> 1:03:56.660]  lying to everybody doing this but then I see some of their minions that are all have the
[1:03:56.660 --> 1:04:04.260]  same look, I saw a black YouTuber and I think I sent it to the guys last week but I forgot
[1:04:04.260 --> 1:04:09.060]  to ever play it so I forget his name now but he did a whole rant about liberals and he
[1:04:09.060 --> 1:04:14.500]  called them dusty white people and there's some black and some Hispanic but they all
[1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:19.020]  look like green skin, like white, I'm not going to white people, I'm saying these white
[1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:28.020]  people all look real ashen and it's like they're not there, they're like wraiths and I've seen
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:33.740]  my enemies when I'm around them, that's what they look like, like dirty evil little devils
[1:04:33.740 --> 1:04:38.860]  and dusty white people and they want to kill kids, I mean look at that one, oh my god,
[1:04:38.860 --> 1:04:42.500]  I mean look at her, man she looks like she's about to have a damn horror movie, Ryan Stelter
[1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:49.060]  all of them, holy hell, good god save me, sign of the cross on her, you know what I do when
[1:04:49.060 --> 1:04:54.180]  MSM gets my number, it calls me now, I send them a sign of the cross, I send the crucifix
[1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:57.620]  back at their damn ass.
[1:04:57.620 --> 1:05:03.700]  Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our amazing listeners and viewers.
[1:05:03.700 --> 1:05:13.300]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special, it's the 1776 founder coin,
[1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:20.500]  you've got to see this coin for yourself, it's at 1776coin.com and this coin makes you
[1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:26.740]  a founding member of a very exciting group of projects that we're going to be launching
[1:05:26.740 --> 1:05:33.820]  in the very new future, become a founding member today, learn more at 1776coin.com or
[1:05:33.820 --> 1:05:38.220]  call toll free, triple eight, two five three, three one three nine.
[1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:43.100]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle, continuing the fight against
[1:05:43.100 --> 1:05:47.940]  the globalist new world order, that's why you're called a founding member because the
[1:05:47.940 --> 1:05:53.220]  funding from this is going to go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower
[1:05:53.220 --> 1:05:57.820]  the American people to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next
[1:05:57.820 --> 1:06:00.100]  level.
[1:06:00.100 --> 1:06:21.340]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from the info wars.com
[1:06:21.340 --> 1:06:26.020]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:26.020 --> 1:06:32.500]  When you study warfare, both ancient and modern, you learn that bio warfare has been a favorite
[1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:35.660]  for thousands of years.
[1:06:35.660 --> 1:06:42.260]  The Mongols and the Huns would take a body that was decomposing or freshly died, a person
[1:06:42.260 --> 1:06:48.660]  that had just passed away from smallpox or the bubonic plague, the black plague, and
[1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:54.980]  they would catapult that body over the wall into a town or city, a citadel, a fortress
[1:06:54.980 --> 1:07:01.540]  that they were besieging or had under siege.
[1:07:01.540 --> 1:07:05.980]  And that's what's happened to us now, but then when you take the shot, it gives you
[1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:11.180]  exactly what the virus does, but even worse, and then if you survive it, it begins permanently
[1:07:11.180 --> 1:07:19.220]  infecting your body and eating holes in capillaries all over.
[1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:26.700]  And then now, two weeks ago, we got two different data dumps now from the FDA that they tried
[1:07:26.700 --> 1:07:31.980]  to block, and at the rate the judge has ordered it released, it will take 75 years, it was
[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:34.380]  announced yesterday, to release it.
[1:07:34.380 --> 1:07:43.540]  The first couple groups of documents confirmed multi thousand times increases in blood clots,
[1:07:43.540 --> 1:07:49.340]  and heart attacks in myocarditis, and in cancers.
[1:07:49.340 --> 1:07:55.460]  I mean, people get cancer immediately, and they have NBC and ABC headlines going, oh,
[1:07:55.460 --> 1:08:01.100]  the vaccine, Moderna and Pfizer will make your tumors get bigger, and it'll look like
[1:08:01.100 --> 1:08:12.420]  that they're cancerous, it'll look like that they're not benign, but that's okay, just
[1:08:12.420 --> 1:08:14.140]  don't do surgery on it, you'll be fine.
[1:08:14.140 --> 1:08:18.100]  I mean, they actually say that, it's like a Monty Python skit or something.
[1:08:18.100 --> 1:08:20.580]  Would you like to donate your organs?
[1:08:20.580 --> 1:08:24.420]  The woman says yes, they killed her out on the spot and cut her organs out, and Monty
[1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:29.220]  Python, the meaning of life, and you laugh at that, but that's how they treat the health
[1:08:29.220 --> 1:08:31.860]  authorities now with the Stockholm syndrome.
[1:08:31.860 --> 1:08:37.260]  And look at this headline here, you know, we forget about this, study, age, two percent
[1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:42.260]  of pregnant women who get vaccinated for COVID during first or second trimesters suffered
[1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:51.180]  miscarriage, and natural news links directly to, it's also on enforce.com, the New England
[1:08:51.180 --> 1:08:55.780]  Medical Journal, and that was back in July.
[1:08:55.780 --> 1:09:01.020]  Now the numbers are coming in all over the world, in towns, small towns that don't have
[1:09:01.020 --> 1:09:05.380]  a miscarriage a year, they'll have 20 or 30, in big cities they're having hundreds when
[1:09:05.380 --> 1:09:09.100]  they normally just have a few dozen.
[1:09:09.100 --> 1:09:13.420]  Numbers of magnitude worse, and it's just being normalized, so I'm gonna open the phones
[1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:19.740]  up today for people that love the shots, no one's ever called that does, people that hate
[1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:23.260]  the shot, people that took it and didn't get sick, people that took it and did, we don't
[1:09:23.260 --> 1:09:27.740]  censor your calls, all we ask for is a good, clean phone line and that you're ready to
[1:09:27.740 --> 1:09:28.740]  speak.
[1:09:28.740 --> 1:09:34.580]  So I'm gonna open the phones up in the next four segments, next three segments, specifically
[1:09:34.580 --> 1:09:39.900]  to take your phone calls here today with your story and your report, we'll give each person
[1:09:39.900 --> 1:09:50.540]  about a minute, so we get to the next person, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex.
[1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:56.100]  They wanna silence you, we wanna empower you because I need you to beat these people and
[1:09:56.100 --> 1:10:00.380]  you need me, we're in this together, and I know we can do it together.
[1:10:00.380 --> 1:10:04.740]  One of our people's got more power than ten of their maggots, but we've handed our power
[1:10:04.740 --> 1:10:10.580]  over to these devils.
[1:10:10.580 --> 1:10:13.220]  Spiritual wickedness of them attacking our children and killing so many of them right
[1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:19.260]  now creates a very serious disturbance in the force, if you wanna use that analogy,
[1:10:19.260 --> 1:10:28.140]  and I just, I demand Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Trump and everybody, don't just come out
[1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:32.380]  against Fauci cooking it up at the Wuhan lab or Fauci line of people, come out and say,
[1:10:32.380 --> 1:10:39.220]  we were wrong, the shot doesn't work, why are they saying we need 3, 4, 5, 6 shots?
[1:10:39.220 --> 1:10:42.420]  Rand Paul hasn't come out and done that yet because he thought, oh, surely they're not
[1:10:42.420 --> 1:10:47.260]  gonna put out a shot that makes people sick, surely if I sign on to warp speed we can reopen
[1:10:47.260 --> 1:10:51.900]  the economy and give people confidence the same reason Trump did, but now Paul, we're
[1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:54.540]  a year and a half into this.
[1:10:54.540 --> 1:10:59.940]  We're now 11 months into the shots here in the U.S. and the damage is massive and I don't
[1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:05.780]  want you to be my enemy, but you are rapidly, all of you Republican leadership are rapidly
[1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:09.500]  becoming an enemy as well.
[1:11:09.500 --> 1:11:17.180]  I just cannot abide, I know my listeners will not abide this, I did a report on this earlier
[1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:22.860]  in the week, it's up on infowars.com and man dot video, Dr. Rand Paul knows the COVID
[1:11:22.860 --> 1:11:28.780]  vaccine is poison, he knows it, the numbers are all in, the facts are all in, it erases
[1:11:28.780 --> 1:11:30.060]  your immune system.
[1:11:30.060 --> 1:11:35.100]  The first time you take the shot, within 8 months you lose about half your immunity.
[1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:40.020]  The second booster makes you lose all of your immunity below what you had before the shot
[1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:45.860]  within 6 months, that's with the Pfizer, it's worse with Moderna.
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:51.060]  The Moderna works more intensely and then erases your immune system and now they've
[1:11:51.060 --> 1:11:55.260]  got numbers out of Israel where they're starting the fourth shots that it massive increases
[1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:56.260]  in death.
[1:11:56.260 --> 1:12:00.860]  Dr. Peter McCullough was on Joe Rogan here today, it's very powerful, I watched part
[1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:04.980]  of it this morning, but you can go see the whole thing and he laid it all out the latest
[1:12:04.980 --> 1:12:05.980]  numbers.
[1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:09.180]  He was here a few weeks ago in studio, he'll be back with us soon, I may be able to give
[1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:17.260]  him tomorrow, but this is an insane time to be alive ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:17.260 --> 1:12:21.220]  And all of these are life and death articles.
[1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:26.700]  This must watch story from yesterday, now archive at infowars.com, NIH playing joint
[1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:32.020]  ownership of Moderna NMRA vaccines began development, it's actually months ahead of the release
[1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:37.780]  of COVID-19 because they already had it ready, already had it in the pipeline, already had
[1:12:37.780 --> 1:12:43.820]  it prepared, but don't try to be caught outside without your mask on, Antifa will force you
[1:12:43.820 --> 1:12:45.420]  off the train or beat you up.
[1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:50.580]  Don't try to protest lockdowns, they're for the little people like Big Pharma and they're
[1:12:50.580 --> 1:12:54.620]  going to stop, you remember they were wearing masks before it was mandatory, it's their
[1:12:54.620 --> 1:13:00.540]  world now, see, they serve the system, they get to be thugs now, they're protected in
[1:13:00.540 --> 1:13:04.620]  the thousands of jurisdictions around the world controlled by George Soros, not us here
[1:13:04.620 --> 1:13:05.620]  in America.
[1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:11.420]  What a nightmare prison we're being herded into and being prepared with, and then told
[1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:17.540]  turn your guns in, roll over to tyranny or you're a racist, all cultural Marxist garbage.
[1:13:17.540 --> 1:13:21.660]  I've actually got that in my Jesse Smollett, I'm going to hit some of that when we come
[1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:30.540]  back and then go to your phone calls, 877-789-2539-877-789, Alex, and like I said, we've taken thousands
[1:13:30.540 --> 1:13:36.500]  of calls in the last couple of years on this, nobody's ever called in that liked the shot.
[1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:39.980]  Maybe today they're going to call in and tell us how much they liked the shot, but I want
[1:13:39.980 --> 1:13:44.180]  all the evil people going along with the system to remember something.
[1:13:44.180 --> 1:13:48.980]  You can pretend all day long that you're part of the establishment or that this isn't really
[1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:52.820]  happening or that you're part of the ruling class because you're waging war on people
[1:13:52.820 --> 1:13:56.900]  and there's too many people, so you're just survival of fittest, you're not survival
[1:13:56.900 --> 1:14:03.740]  of fittest, you have an evil spirit, you are twisted, you are fallen, and you will be destroyed.
[1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:08.580]  Some of you may still have some soul, some connection to God left in you, and if you're
[1:14:08.580 --> 1:14:12.140]  going to be awakened from your trance, you can get out of the spiritual bondage you're
[1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:16.340]  in, but you first got to admit that you love death.
[1:14:16.340 --> 1:14:19.380]  You first got to admit you're brainwashed by the system.
[1:14:19.380 --> 1:14:23.140]  You first got to admit that you've been going the wrong direction and asked God to come
[1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:25.120]  help you turn back.
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:31.940]  Only God can get you out of the jam you're in.
[1:14:31.940 --> 1:14:37.620]  I mean, I would be a king amongst these idiotic Satanists, but a king of the Satanists is the
[1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:39.500]  poorest man around.
[1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:45.740]  I do not want to be a general of evil, so I can pretend like I'm in charge and I'm
[1:14:45.740 --> 1:14:46.740]  God.
[1:14:46.740 --> 1:14:47.740]  I'm not.
[1:14:47.740 --> 1:14:54.580]  I'm a mortal made by God who can experience God and know God, but I am not a God.
[1:14:54.580 --> 1:15:02.980]  And all of you pretending to be God are going to cut yourself off from the Godhead and remove
[1:15:02.980 --> 1:15:09.820]  yourself from that great covenant that you could have been part of.
[1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:18.020]  But I do realize that for most of you, this is an ancestral issue, and though you could
[1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:23.260]  have been sanctified, you chose to go with your bloodline, and there's evil people that
[1:15:23.260 --> 1:15:27.700]  come from black bloodlines, white bloodlines, Asian, it's all this, you know, but it's definitely
[1:15:27.700 --> 1:15:32.860]  evil does get in certain bloodlines and people are more predisposed to Satanism.
[1:15:32.860 --> 1:15:33.860]  And that's what we're dealing with.
[1:15:33.860 --> 1:15:36.940]  These people just aren't going to stop till they kill us.
[1:15:36.940 --> 1:15:38.820]  That's all they know is we're superior to them.
[1:15:38.820 --> 1:15:39.820]  We're better than them.
[1:15:39.820 --> 1:15:44.420]  They have a connection to God and they have one mission, kill, kill, poison, rape, murder,
[1:15:44.420 --> 1:15:49.620]  pedophilia, death, death, death, kill, murder, poison, destroy, destroy pretty things, burn
[1:15:49.620 --> 1:15:50.620]  down pretty things.
[1:15:50.620 --> 1:16:00.660]  You know, that's their, that's all they hear 24-7 is kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[1:16:00.660 --> 1:16:02.900]  They are great and a bag of it here.
[1:16:02.900 --> 1:16:06.900]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:16:06.900 --> 1:16:12.100]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:16:12.100 --> 1:16:14.660]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:16:14.660 --> 1:16:17.980]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:19.420]  but really they're just a commune.
[1:16:19.420 --> 1:16:22.420]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[1:16:22.420 --> 1:16:24.620]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:16:24.620 --> 1:16:27.820]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[1:16:27.820 --> 1:16:29.020]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:16:29.020 --> 1:16:33.420]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[1:16:33.420 --> 1:16:35.900]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:16:35.900 --> 1:16:39.420]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:16:39.420 --> 1:16:42.460]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:16:42.460 --> 1:16:47.500]  We had like that, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:52.060]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:16:52.060 --> 1:16:58.260]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[1:16:58.260 --> 1:17:05.180]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[1:17:05.180 --> 1:17:11.420]  the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:14.540]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:17:14.540 --> 1:17:17.700]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:18.700]  have.
[1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:23.300]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[1:17:23.300 --> 1:17:25.580]  self-defense and a relationship with God.
[1:17:25.580 --> 1:17:29.020]  And now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.

[1:17:38.100 --> 1:17:42.380]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[1:17:42.380 --> 1:17:43.740]  already taking place.
[1:17:43.740 --> 1:17:50.020]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:50.020 --> 1:17:54.660]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[1:17:54.660 --> 1:17:58.020]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:58.020 --> 1:18:02.860]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:18:02.860 --> 1:18:04.900]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:18:04.900 --> 1:18:10.620]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:11.620]  But we failed.
[1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:13.100]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:18.860]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:18:18.860 --> 1:18:21.220]  deindustrialization great reset.
[1:18:21.220 --> 1:18:25.500]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[1:18:25.500 --> 1:18:30.100]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:18:30.100 --> 1:18:33.020]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[1:18:33.020 --> 1:18:35.220]  But we've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:18:35.220 --> 1:18:37.940]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality storable food.
[1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:42.940]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:35.380]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[1:19:35.380 --> 1:19:40.180]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.

[1:19:43.540 --> 1:19:44.940]  And I keep one on my car.
[1:19:44.940 --> 1:19:48.180]  I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[1:19:48.180 --> 1:19:49.180]  don't work.
[1:19:49.180 --> 1:19:50.180]  They work.
[1:19:50.180 --> 1:19:59.180]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[1:19:59.180 --> 1:20:05.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.220 --> 1:20:19.460]  Well, you can say whatever you want about Benjamin yet and yahoo.
[1:20:19.460 --> 1:20:20.460]  Was he good?
[1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:21.460]  Was he bad?
[1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:23.980]  We now know he was bad.
[1:20:23.980 --> 1:20:25.460]  Sold Israel out to big pharma.
[1:20:25.460 --> 1:20:30.620]  They're now going on their fifth shot, martial law, absolute tyranny.
[1:20:30.620 --> 1:20:39.580]  Now Benjamin yet and yahoo has been told by Trump, F-U. F-U-C, you know what him, Trump
[1:20:39.580 --> 1:20:45.780]  rips former ally Netanyahu for disloyalty, full article on Infowars.com.
[1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:46.780]  Yep.
[1:20:46.780 --> 1:20:51.660]  Millie's an effing idiot, Smollett's an effing idiot.
[1:20:51.660 --> 1:20:56.660]  Netanyahu is a betrayer of his own people and a betrayer of Trump that really went to
[1:20:56.660 --> 1:21:01.260]  bat for him hardcore and for Israel.
[1:21:01.260 --> 1:21:07.660]  But the same evil globalist front at all, folks, and I'm explaining this about eugenics.
[1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:12.220]  They sell eugenics at the liberal university level that, oh, we're just going to kill the
[1:21:12.220 --> 1:21:16.940]  Down syndrome children and you can argue, and I don't agree with it, well, they'll just
[1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:19.540]  have a law where you've got to abort a Down syndrome child.
[1:21:19.540 --> 1:21:24.220]  You know, Europe's trying to put that in law right now, China has it, but they don't want
[1:21:24.220 --> 1:21:26.100]  to get the Down syndrome people.
[1:21:26.100 --> 1:21:30.180]  They want to get the smartest people.
[1:21:30.180 --> 1:21:34.620]  I've told people this thousands of times, it's in my film in-game, and yes, Jews have
[1:21:34.620 --> 1:21:36.260]  amongst the highest IQs.
[1:21:36.260 --> 1:21:37.260]  You're dead.
[1:21:37.260 --> 1:21:38.260]  The Neuval Order is going to kill you.
[1:21:38.260 --> 1:21:39.260]  You understand that?
[1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:40.820]  You're a Northern European?
[1:21:40.820 --> 1:21:42.420]  Got a super high IQ?
[1:21:42.420 --> 1:21:43.420]  You're dead.
[1:21:43.420 --> 1:21:44.420]  You're Japanese?
[1:21:44.420 --> 1:21:45.420]  You're dead.
[1:21:45.420 --> 1:21:48.940]  The globalists don't want people with super high IQs, and it's true, folks, we're not all
[1:21:48.940 --> 1:21:50.780]  created equal.
[1:21:50.780 --> 1:21:56.060]  There are super high IQs in every group everywhere, but statistically there are much higher percentages
[1:21:56.060 --> 1:22:05.060]  of higher IQs in certain racial groups, and the spikes in the IQs, and that's only one
[1:22:05.060 --> 1:22:11.500]  measurement I understand, go up into the hundreds, the two hundreds, but most people
[1:22:11.500 --> 1:22:16.500]  that go above 150, 160 become autistic in their design because their brain just can't
[1:22:16.500 --> 1:22:17.500]  handle it all.
[1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:27.980]  That's where you get the savants, and this anti-human program wants to kill every Jew
[1:22:27.980 --> 1:22:37.020]  on earth, and it's going to come to kill you in the guise of a Jew.
[1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:45.020]  I mean, you look at the ADL giving awards to George Soros when George Soros cut his
[1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:52.700]  teeth, rounding up fellow Jews to send them to the death camps.
[1:22:52.700 --> 1:22:57.420]  That's fact, and I got told five years ago, you know, Soros is going to sue you if you
[1:22:57.420 --> 1:22:58.420]  keep talking about it.
[1:22:58.420 --> 1:23:01.420]  I just increased the amount I did, and I know he financed these lawsuits against me.
[1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:02.420]  Good.
[1:23:02.420 --> 1:23:03.420]  Burn in hell.
[1:23:03.420 --> 1:23:08.020]  I'll never be like you, you maggot.
[1:23:08.020 --> 1:23:14.460]  So I want everybody to get this straight and understand this, one trillion percent.
[1:23:14.460 --> 1:23:18.820]  It doesn't matter if you're a Jew, it doesn't matter if you're a Christian, it doesn't matter
[1:23:18.820 --> 1:23:21.940]  if you're a Buddhist, it doesn't matter if you're black, it doesn't matter if you're
[1:23:21.940 --> 1:23:25.860]  white, it doesn't matter if you're from Germany or Mexico or where you're from.
[1:23:25.860 --> 1:23:35.980]  The devil wants to destroy you, and the devil is very real.
[1:23:35.980 --> 1:23:40.420]  And if you look at the Rothschilds setting up the state of Israel, and they totally control
[1:23:40.420 --> 1:23:45.620]  that man on screen right there, Soros, telling 60 minutes the best time of his life was
[1:23:45.620 --> 1:23:53.140]  working for the Nazis, if you don't understand that Israel has been set up to bring in this
[1:23:53.140 --> 1:24:00.380]  whole global collapse and to bring in this whole battle of the gods in the Middle East,
[1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:06.500]  the good or the wrong, then you're not studying what the New World Order is up to.
[1:24:06.500 --> 1:24:12.860]  And so what we see is prophecy being fulfilled, and I'm going to explain this again.
[1:24:12.860 --> 1:24:17.180]  The globalists know there's a global collapse coming of their systems, so they collapse
[1:24:17.180 --> 1:24:19.860]  it beforehand to be on top of the collapse.
[1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:21.020]  It's the same thing.
[1:24:21.020 --> 1:24:28.100]  God knows the plan of the universe, he already made it, but he gave us free will.
[1:24:28.100 --> 1:24:36.660]  These evildoers also get a good idea about where things are going, and so they are again
[1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:38.620]  playing God.
[1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:40.540]  They know that the Messiah is going to come.
[1:24:40.540 --> 1:24:42.580]  They know a new temple is going to be built.
[1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:46.700]  They know Christ is going to rule for a thousand years from Jerusalem before this reality is
[1:24:46.700 --> 1:24:49.700]  destroyed, this simulation.
[1:24:49.700 --> 1:24:51.580]  And they're going to do it all beforehand.
[1:24:51.580 --> 1:24:55.260]  That's what the Antichrist is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:24:55.260 --> 1:24:58.820]  You can sit there and think, oh, that's just Christian cosmology.
[1:24:58.820 --> 1:24:59.820]  That's just your religion.
[1:24:59.820 --> 1:25:06.620]  Yeah, well, watch it all happen, because it isn't just my religion.
[1:25:06.620 --> 1:25:11.940]  There's a struggle between good and evil going on in all of us, and it's particularly going
[1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:13.540]  on in the Jews.
[1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:15.500]  Some of the best people you're ever going to meet are Jews.
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:17.700]  Some of the worst people you're ever going to meet are going to be Jews.
[1:25:17.700 --> 1:25:23.700]  And that's the same advice for any group, but it's particularly true with them.
[1:25:23.700 --> 1:25:30.420]  And so what you're about to see unfold and what you're about to see go on is very serious
[1:25:30.420 --> 1:25:35.180]  and very real.
[1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:37.980]  So Trump thought, oh, I'll actually help Israel, help them have security.
[1:25:37.980 --> 1:25:40.980]  They deserve to have a place, you know?
[1:25:40.980 --> 1:25:43.820]  His son-in-law is Jewish.
[1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:46.460]  And where did that get him, betrayed?
[1:25:46.460 --> 1:25:50.460]  And where did it get the Jews in Israel, trusting Benjamin Netanyahu when he handed them over
[1:25:50.460 --> 1:25:54.580]  to Big Pharma and handed them over to martial law?
[1:25:54.580 --> 1:25:56.260]  It got Trump nowhere, did it?
[1:25:56.260 --> 1:26:01.340]  It got the Jews nowhere, because men aren't going to fix this problem.
[1:26:01.340 --> 1:26:03.820]  Alex Jones isn't going to fix this problem.
[1:26:03.820 --> 1:26:06.340]  Benjamin Netanyahu is not going to fix this problem.
[1:26:06.340 --> 1:26:08.940]  Donald Trump's not going to fix this problem.
[1:26:08.940 --> 1:26:11.620]  God is going to have to fix this problem.
[1:26:11.620 --> 1:26:16.220]  And we're going to have to admit God's real and God's in charge and ask the Holy Spirit,
[1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:20.620]  God consciousness, that Dr. Zelinko talks about, into us, and then we're all brothers
[1:26:20.620 --> 1:26:23.660]  and sisters and the killing can stop and the idiocy can stop.
[1:26:23.660 --> 1:26:27.540]  But only God can do that.
[1:26:27.540 --> 1:26:31.620]  That's why I can finish Zelinko's sentences, he can finish mine, because he's not copying
[1:26:31.620 --> 1:26:32.900]  me and not copying him.
[1:26:32.900 --> 1:26:34.540]  We see the same thing.
[1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:35.960]  We have the same spirit.
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:42.020]  We are brothers, not because I'm a Christian, he's a Jew, Zelinko said, he transcends that.
[1:26:42.020 --> 1:26:44.540]  This is God consciousness.
[1:26:44.540 --> 1:26:53.020]  The one God has got the one plan for us.
[1:26:53.020 --> 1:26:54.780]  The devil wants your soul.
[1:26:54.780 --> 1:27:01.140]  The devil wants to bind your energy to him and take you to his system, his own private
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:02.140]  hell.
[1:27:02.140 --> 1:27:03.140]  He's built it.
[1:27:03.140 --> 1:27:04.140]  It's his.
[1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:05.140]  God isn't there.
[1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:06.140]  That's why it's hell.
[1:27:06.140 --> 1:27:08.220]  I'm going to break into your calls.
[1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:09.700]  I'm sorry I said I'd go to him this segment.
[1:27:09.700 --> 1:27:12.420]  I'm sure Michael would be cool to take calls, he's come home with such huge news.
[1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:15.220]  I'm going to write to your calls.
[1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:20.780]  Christian and Kyle and Josh and Alan and Mike and Mitchell and Brandon and Beefy, when we
[1:27:20.780 --> 1:27:28.180]  come right back on the other side of this break, please don't forget that I cannot keep
[1:27:28.180 --> 1:27:33.940]  this operation on air unless you support us.

[1:27:37.580 --> 1:27:39.660]  But we have products you really need.

[1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:47.900]  body.
[1:27:47.900 --> 1:27:49.540]  Great for adults, children, old people, you name it.
[1:27:49.540 --> 1:27:50.540]  It's 40% off.
[1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:57.100]  We still got a lot of big deals on the site, DNA force plus, lung cleanse, prostate guard,
[1:27:57.100 --> 1:28:03.300]  alpha powers back in stock, infowarstore.com, all apparel is still being sold at cost.
[1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:04.820]  I'm just liquidating everything.
[1:28:04.820 --> 1:28:09.460]  We've got the great activated charcoal toothpaste and we've got the tooth whitening toothpaste
[1:28:09.460 --> 1:28:14.060]  with the iodine and the tea tree oil that's so powerful, doesn't have any fillers.
[1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:17.460]  X2, X3, we've got the arrest foul, she engaged shirts.
[1:28:17.460 --> 1:28:21.140]  We've got the Betsy Ross American flag shirt.
[1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:22.900]  We've got the Biden for nursing home shirts.
[1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:26.660]  We've got the summit new shirts.
[1:28:26.660 --> 1:28:34.740]  We've got the baby lives matter shirts infowarstore.com and we've got the 1776 coin at infowarstore.com.
[1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:41.740]  We're by going to 1776coin.com and they will be sold out, I predict, by tomorrow afternoon.
[1:28:41.740 --> 1:28:46.500]  So if you want to have one of these historic coins and also be let in on the next level

[1:28:56.460 --> 1:29:00.500]  So many people say to me, Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our
[1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:02.980]  amazing listeners and viewers.

[1:29:41.900 --> 1:29:44.100]  the globalist New World Order.

[1:29:53.220 --> 1:29:57.460]  to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[1:29:57.460 --> 1:30:02.900]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement to all of our listeners, viewers, and supporters.
[1:30:02.900 --> 1:30:09.700]  We are attempting to develop and deploy systems that allow the American people, not just InfoWars,
[1:30:09.700 --> 1:30:15.020]  to get around corporate censors and get the truth out about the New World Order's agenda
[1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:17.260]  so we can stop at deadness tracks.

[1:30:29.180 --> 1:30:30.180]  artwork on it.
[1:30:30.180 --> 1:30:37.380]  You will also be funding a very serious, focused information warfare operation against the
[1:30:37.380 --> 1:30:38.380]  New World Order.

[1:30:51.100 --> 1:30:57.740]  weeks, maybe a few days, so secure your coin now at 1776coin.com.
[1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:07.340]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[1:31:07.340 --> 1:31:11.780]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[1:31:11.780 --> 1:31:12.780]  in place.
[1:31:12.780 --> 1:31:18.300]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:23.740]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:31:23.740 --> 1:31:26.620]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:31:26.620 --> 1:31:34.820]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:31:34.820 --> 1:31:39.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:31:39.260 --> 1:31:42.300]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[1:31:42.300 --> 1:31:46.180]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:48.980]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[1:31:48.980 --> 1:31:51.140]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:31:51.140 --> 1:31:57.340]  They only get better if we resist and say no, non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[1:31:57.340 --> 1:32:01.980]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've
[1:32:01.980 --> 1:32:07.580]  got their World ID and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[1:32:07.580 --> 1:32:13.020]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that
[1:32:13.020 --> 1:32:18.140]  once they've gotten you with that system then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere
[1:32:18.140 --> 1:32:23.100]  you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're going to decide when
[1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:28.420]  you can travel and when you can't travel and MasterCard and then all the other big companies
[1:32:28.420 --> 1:32:32.460]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax
[1:32:32.460 --> 1:32:34.860]  you with a carbon tax for it.
[1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:38.460]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:32:38.460 --> 1:32:39.460]  This is the takeover.
[1:32:39.460 --> 1:32:43.420]  The humanity better wake up and say no, finally folks are starting to wake up.
[1:32:43.420 --> 1:32:47.140]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others will leave the charts along with them fours, but it's
[1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:48.140]  not enough.
[1:32:48.140 --> 1:32:51.940]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalists
[1:32:51.940 --> 1:32:52.940]  to justice.
[1:32:52.940 --> 1:32:59.860]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[1:32:59.860 --> 1:33:11.900]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:11.900 --> 1:33:27.700]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:27.700 --> 1:33:33.420]  Well, the LA police union leader has a warning for terrorists.
[1:33:33.420 --> 1:33:34.420]  Don't come to LA.
[1:33:34.420 --> 1:33:37.580]  It's one of the most dangerous cities in the country now.
[1:33:37.580 --> 1:33:43.900]  Meanwhile, a migrant truck, not any legal alien invader truck, crashes killing 53 on
[1:33:43.900 --> 1:33:49.100]  its way to the wide open United States border, very, very sad.
[1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:52.780]  That happened to those people, but they're being brought in by the globalist to be farmed
[1:33:52.780 --> 1:33:53.780]  politically.
[1:33:53.780 --> 1:33:55.860]  So I'm very sad for those that died.
[1:33:55.860 --> 1:33:59.140]  I'm very sad that they've been living under lockdowns in Latin America that the globalist
[1:33:59.140 --> 1:34:00.140]  put in place.
[1:34:00.140 --> 1:34:05.060]  But nevertheless, they're being used as a political weapon to collapse the United States.
[1:34:05.060 --> 1:34:06.060]  That's not going to help them.
[1:34:06.060 --> 1:34:07.060]  It's not going to help us.
[1:34:07.060 --> 1:34:08.980]  I'm not going to use the word migrant.
[1:34:08.980 --> 1:34:12.420]  They told you to call them migrants or you're a racist and now in the UK they're saying
[1:34:12.420 --> 1:34:14.220]  don't even call them migrants, call them nothing.
[1:34:14.220 --> 1:34:15.940]  You're not allowed to call them anything.
[1:34:15.940 --> 1:34:19.980]  It's how they train you with language to totally be censored.
[1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:25.140]  For TV viewers, here's a new take on hard times, create strong men, strong men create
[1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:29.100]  good times, good times, create weak men, weak men create hard times.
[1:34:29.100 --> 1:34:38.580]  Look at this photo, got 1970, easy writer, what a great movie.
[1:34:38.580 --> 1:34:40.860]  And then you've got modern times here.
[1:34:40.860 --> 1:34:45.260]  Think those guys are going to stand up for themselves?
[1:34:45.260 --> 1:34:51.380]  No, they're domesticated, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what they've been trained to think
[1:34:51.380 --> 1:34:52.380]  is cool.
[1:34:52.380 --> 1:34:55.380]  What they've been told is the way to go.
[1:34:55.380 --> 1:34:57.380]  Very, very sad.
[1:34:57.380 --> 1:35:02.500]  Yeah, I think the criminals are scared of those guys in Los Angeles or the criminals
[1:35:02.500 --> 1:35:03.500]  going to do to them.
[1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:04.500]  They're going to capture them.
[1:35:04.500 --> 1:35:07.260]  They're going to control them because there's no men to stand up for anybody.
[1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:13.420]  There's just evil men in control of the system who they think are doing the world of favor
[1:35:13.420 --> 1:35:16.580]  by culling off the poor people and the dumb people.
[1:35:16.580 --> 1:35:18.940]  And I tell you, it's paradoxical.
[1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:22.220]  The globalists are worse than those they're killing, but those they're killing and they
[1:35:22.220 --> 1:35:24.340]  don't stand up for the children deserve to die as well.
[1:35:24.340 --> 1:35:25.940]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[1:35:25.940 --> 1:35:29.060]  Let's talk to Kyle in the great state of Nebraska.
[1:35:29.060 --> 1:35:30.900]  Kyle, you're on the air, sir.
[1:35:30.900 --> 1:35:31.900]  Thanks for calling.
[1:35:31.900 --> 1:35:34.420]  Alex, thanks for taking the call.
[1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:36.420]  Yes, sir.
[1:35:36.420 --> 1:35:44.780]  Wednesday, I went to 1776coin.com and I think I was the first order through, I'd have to
[1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:45.780]  assume.
[1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:47.580]  Well, thanks for the support, brother.
[1:35:47.580 --> 1:35:49.780]  It's going to really help us do some exciting things.
[1:35:49.780 --> 1:35:51.180]  Yes, sir.
[1:35:51.180 --> 1:35:58.380]  So my friend, growing up childhood friend, he's in a hospital in Omaha right now currently
[1:35:58.380 --> 1:36:06.540]  on the COVID protocol on a ventilator and his brother, Maracos, they got ahold of somebody
[1:36:06.540 --> 1:36:13.900]  on the East Coast, one of the intervenious vitamin C doctors, one of the top ones.
[1:36:13.900 --> 1:36:18.820]  And they put him on a four day protocol because he was getting worse on the ventilator, of
[1:36:18.820 --> 1:36:19.820]  course.
[1:36:19.820 --> 1:36:26.740]  They put him on a four day protocol with the vitamin C stuff and he got better and stable.
[1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:29.300]  After four days, they took him off.
[1:36:29.300 --> 1:36:34.820]  He's been off for like six days and getting worse and worse by the day.
[1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:40.380]  And I've been scrambling, my friend, his brother has been scrambling trying to get ahold
[1:36:40.380 --> 1:36:46.980]  of someone here in the Omaha area, like a doctor or somebody that can help us.
[1:36:46.980 --> 1:36:49.060]  And it's just been hell, brother.
[1:36:49.060 --> 1:36:54.300]  There have been a bunch of cases in Texas and Illinois and New York and Florida and
[1:36:54.300 --> 1:36:59.660]  a bunch of them, so many more than 10 cases we've seen, where the hospital will not put
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:03.500]  somebody on ivermectin when they're on a ventilator and in every case, when they put
[1:37:03.500 --> 1:37:07.100]  them on ivermectin, they get better.
[1:37:07.100 --> 1:37:12.180]  And the majority of cases, they got released, but in a couple, the hospitals went to court
[1:37:12.180 --> 1:37:15.020]  to block it and then they killed them.
[1:37:15.020 --> 1:37:16.580]  And so that's what this sounds like with you.
[1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:19.700]  Yeah, vitamin C treatment is one of the recommended things.
[1:37:19.700 --> 1:37:23.060]  I know my parents, my dad almost died.
[1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:26.500]  He got on ivermectin and the inhalable steroids.
[1:37:26.500 --> 1:37:30.260]  Instantly physically was a lot better and his oxygen shot up, but his brain was hit
[1:37:30.260 --> 1:37:35.620]  by the prions and I mean, it was like he had a shock therapy or something.
[1:37:35.620 --> 1:37:39.780]  I mean, he literally was like a moron for about two, three weeks.
[1:37:39.780 --> 1:37:46.380]  Now he's almost back, but the prions stay in you for over a year and it was just devastating.
[1:37:46.380 --> 1:37:50.620]  But then we did vitamin C and some other stuff and glutathione and his brain bounced back
[1:37:50.620 --> 1:37:57.380]  a lot and he's 90% back where he was, but I mean, he was like retarded, okay, for about
[1:37:57.380 --> 1:37:58.380]  a month.
[1:37:58.380 --> 1:37:59.380]  He'll tell you that.
[1:37:59.380 --> 1:38:04.220]  This is serious business and we're just very blessed he's still alive, but vitamin C really
[1:38:04.220 --> 1:38:05.220]  helped him.
[1:38:05.220 --> 1:38:09.820]  Now the glutathione's helping clear him out and I've got other friends that had felt
[1:38:09.820 --> 1:38:13.580]  it really bad who have not bounced back yet mentally and they're not even that old.
[1:38:13.580 --> 1:38:17.380]  You know, they're about the same age as me, I know two people that are same age as I am
[1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:21.220]  that got it and they're just not the same person anymore.
[1:38:21.220 --> 1:38:24.900]  It's a very, very serious situation and the fact that they're trying to block your friend,
[1:38:24.900 --> 1:38:33.380]  your childhood friend, you know, there are a, you know, there are online pharmacies,
[1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:37.300]  there are doctors, Dr. Marble is awesome.
[1:38:37.300 --> 1:38:42.100]  You know what, sir, give me your name and number and I will, I'll get it to Dr. Marble
[1:38:42.100 --> 1:38:45.660]  and I'm sure he can get you in touch with somebody, but you need to have a treating physician
[1:38:45.660 --> 1:38:50.380]  meaning they're able to treat at that hospital so they can go in there and the family needs
[1:38:50.380 --> 1:38:55.820]  to call around to MDs and people and say, we'll pay you whatever you want.
[1:38:55.820 --> 1:38:59.020]  We want you to go give them these treatments and a lot of times you'll find private doctors
[1:38:59.020 --> 1:39:00.020]  that are awake.
[1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:01.420]  They'll say, no, no, I don't even want any money.
[1:39:01.420 --> 1:39:03.940]  I'll go in and take care of them, but that's what you're going to need to do.
[1:39:03.940 --> 1:39:04.940]  Does that make sense?
[1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:07.380]  Thanks very much for doing that, brother.
[1:39:07.380 --> 1:39:08.380]  It means the world.
[1:39:08.380 --> 1:39:10.540]  Well, I appreciate you.
[1:39:10.540 --> 1:39:12.700]  Just get his name and number and give it to me and make sure I don't forget to do it
[1:39:12.700 --> 1:39:18.100]  and I'll give it to Dr. Marble and there's also Dr. Bartlett, but I mean, I've given
[1:39:18.100 --> 1:39:19.700]  his number out over 300 times.
[1:39:19.700 --> 1:39:20.700]  Good God.
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:23.300]  That kind of works so hard.
[1:39:23.300 --> 1:39:26.780]  So I'm going to, I'm going to give him a break for a while and I'll call Dr. Marble who
[1:39:26.780 --> 1:39:30.700]  is, who is licensed to treat by the way in all 50 states and everything else, but he's
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:34.980]  able to get into that hospital or get some money he knows in there.
[1:39:34.980 --> 1:39:38.740]  It's such an incredible time to be alive, folks, such an incredible time to be alive.
[1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:41.380]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:45.260]  Let's talk to Mitchell in Oregon.
[1:39:45.260 --> 1:39:46.260]  Welcome Mitchell.
[1:39:46.260 --> 1:39:47.260]  Yeah.
[1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:53.820]  So I'm fully vaccinated and I've been sick COVID for the last six weeks.
[1:39:53.820 --> 1:39:59.740]  I can tell you it's definitely much higher risk living in the city.
[1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:06.660]  Just a quick timeline, I moved into the municipality around December, 2020.
[1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:10.860]  Last then I'd been sick twice, I'm pretty sure with COVID because I had the sandpaper
[1:40:10.860 --> 1:40:15.180]  throat version, which I think was a Delta variant and then the one before that.
[1:40:15.180 --> 1:40:19.900]  Anyway, in July, I decided to just go ahead and get the vaccine because I had murmurings
[1:40:19.900 --> 1:40:20.900]  that they're being mandates.
[1:40:20.900 --> 1:40:26.500]  Got my first shot July 28th, second shot August 28th.
[1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:32.860]  Then in September, my employer required everyone to sign an attestation to having been vaccinated.
[1:40:32.860 --> 1:40:38.340]  And then in October, they put out the mandate that they need your shot records by November
[1:40:38.340 --> 1:40:39.340]  19th.
[1:40:39.340 --> 1:40:44.220]  Then in November, they put out a memo saying, you must have your first shot or scheduled
[1:40:44.220 --> 1:40:46.780]  appointment by December 19th to get a shot.
[1:40:46.780 --> 1:40:48.380]  So that's how the mandates are coming down.
[1:40:48.380 --> 1:40:52.580]  Now, what's funny is my employer, I worked for an IT contractor that provides services
[1:40:52.580 --> 1:40:54.060]  to the military.
[1:40:54.060 --> 1:41:01.860]  And actually this IT contractor is owned by entities of the Native Americans, the reservations
[1:41:01.860 --> 1:41:02.860]  around here.
[1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:08.940]  So, my particular employer falls under so many different jurisdictions, it's making
[1:41:08.940 --> 1:41:09.940]  my head spin.
[1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:15.340]  But I can tell you the vaccines don't work and I am overweight and I have some other
[1:41:15.340 --> 1:41:16.340]  health problems.
[1:41:16.340 --> 1:41:21.060]  But since getting vaccinated and being sick these past six weeks, I've also been diagnosed
[1:41:21.060 --> 1:41:24.060]  now with diabetes and high blood pressure.
[1:41:24.060 --> 1:41:28.980]  Well, sir, I'm really sorry to hear that, but yes, COVID attacks the pancreas and so
[1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:30.420]  does the injection.
[1:41:30.420 --> 1:41:35.660]  But again, a real inoculation would cover you for all the COVID variants.
[1:41:35.660 --> 1:41:39.460]  It's prions that are reinfecting that are a form of nanotech.
[1:41:39.460 --> 1:41:42.140]  This is for medical doctors and top scientists.
[1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:46.740]  And so this is a whole class of things they're attacking us with, they're just calling COVID,
[1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:49.580]  but that's why you're seeing the reinfections.
[1:41:49.580 --> 1:41:53.700]  And I've got that from former head of defense intelligence agency.
[1:41:53.700 --> 1:41:58.100]  I've got that from other high level sources that told me we can't tell you the specifics.
[1:41:58.100 --> 1:42:09.380]  It's classified, but now we know why Peter Dasik and Bill Gates and Fauci in 2018, 2017
[1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:15.700]  approached the Pentagon with the synthetic spike protein weapons and basically tried
[1:42:15.700 --> 1:42:19.500]  to sell it to the Pentagon and they wanted to give the Pentagon a cover story to release
[1:42:19.500 --> 1:42:20.500]  it on the Chinese.
[1:42:20.500 --> 1:42:22.460]  And of course, the Pentagon said, that's insane.
[1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:23.460]  You're trying to start a war.
[1:42:23.460 --> 1:42:25.580]  And of course, you now know that's public knowledge.
[1:42:25.580 --> 1:42:31.340]  So the military industrial complex is one of the globals at the top.
[1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:32.340]  It hates our military.
[1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:33.340]  It hates our police.
[1:42:33.340 --> 1:42:34.340]  It hates our republic.
[1:42:34.340 --> 1:42:37.500]  It wants to get rid of its opposition and fully take over the country.
[1:42:37.500 --> 1:42:41.940]  And so particularly in the type of jurisdictions you're in, they are running around spraying
[1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:43.380]  these into the ventilation systems.
[1:42:43.380 --> 1:42:44.380]  God bless you.
[1:42:44.380 --> 1:42:45.940]  I appreciate your call.
[1:42:45.940 --> 1:42:46.940]  But that's going on.
[1:42:46.940 --> 1:42:48.860]  We're under bio weapon attack.
[1:42:48.860 --> 1:42:53.580]  It's a synthetic nanotech crystalline prion spike protein.
[1:42:53.580 --> 1:42:57.180]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:42:57.180 --> 1:42:58.180]  The Technicor.
[1:42:58.180 --> 1:43:02.580]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in M4's live products and that's why
[1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:06.740]  for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never
[1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:09.380]  get the ingredients again until now.
[1:43:09.380 --> 1:43:12.820]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients.
[1:43:12.820 --> 1:43:15.460]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[1:43:15.460 --> 1:43:19.300]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[1:43:19.300 --> 1:43:20.580]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[1:43:20.580 --> 1:43:25.660]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[1:43:25.660 --> 1:43:30.580]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[1:43:30.580 --> 1:43:35.180]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[1:43:35.180 --> 1:43:38.540]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:39.540]  added.
[1:43:39.540 --> 1:43:41.780]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:46.500]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea
[1:43:46.500 --> 1:43:48.220]  salt and it just goes on and on.
[1:43:48.220 --> 1:43:54.020]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping
[1:43:54.020 --> 1:43:58.020]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:58.020 --> 1:44:03.380]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[1:44:03.380 --> 1:44:08.660]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:44:08.660 --> 1:44:15.580]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:44:15.580 --> 1:44:21.540]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[1:44:21.540 --> 1:44:24.340]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:29.900]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[1:44:29.900 --> 1:44:36.500]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:44:36.500 --> 1:44:38.780]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[1:44:38.780 --> 1:44:39.780]  It is not an antihistamine.
[1:44:39.780 --> 1:44:46.100]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[1:44:46.100 --> 1:44:50.260]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:44:50.260 --> 1:44:52.980]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:44:52.980 --> 1:45:19.980]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block, chewable tablets.
[1:45:19.980 --> 1:45:24.620]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist
[1:45:24.620 --> 1:45:29.500]  China and many other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through
[1:45:29.500 --> 1:45:32.380]  the big tech of the central banks and other zone.
[1:45:32.380 --> 1:45:39.020]  So this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians,
[1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:43.700]  it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress,
[1:45:43.700 --> 1:45:47.860]  it's their staff, and their families, it's the White House, hell, it's postal workers
[1:45:47.860 --> 1:45:53.700]  who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else
[1:45:53.700 --> 1:45:55.380]  through corporate rule.
[1:45:55.380 --> 1:45:58.380]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[1:45:58.380 --> 1:46:03.980]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity.
[1:46:03.980 --> 1:46:12.380]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe,
[1:46:12.380 --> 1:46:15.380]  but the injection is not ready yet.
[1:46:15.380 --> 1:46:24.380]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[1:46:24.380 --> 1:46:32.380]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:46:32.380 --> 1:46:40.380]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[1:46:40.380 --> 1:46:46.380]  only I own profitable, you will then be my slaves.
[1:46:46.380 --> 1:46:53.380]  And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra who will move your immune system
[1:46:53.380 --> 1:47:21.380]  so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:25.220]  Thank you so much for joining us today and thank you for holding callers.
[1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:28.700]  Let's go ahead and go to Christian in Florida.
[1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:29.700]  You're on the air.
[1:47:29.700 --> 1:47:30.700]  Welcome.
[1:47:30.700 --> 1:47:35.100]  Hi, I'm calling out because I've got some information that I'm hoping you can put in
[1:47:35.100 --> 1:47:38.300]  front of some of your medical experts.
[1:47:38.300 --> 1:47:43.300]  I really think this vaccine is kind of a phase one sort of thing.
[1:47:43.300 --> 1:47:48.820]  And when I was looking into everybody was talking about graphene oxide, I was researching
[1:47:48.820 --> 1:47:49.820]  it.
[1:47:49.820 --> 1:47:54.220]  And I come to find out I was skeptical that it was in there and I was reading about an
[1:47:54.220 --> 1:47:59.780]  enzyme that the human body makes is called NPO myeloperoxidase and it actually breaks
[1:47:59.780 --> 1:48:03.140]  down graphene oxide in the body.
[1:48:03.140 --> 1:48:08.540]  I think that eventually they do want to build this nano medicine platform and they want
[1:48:08.540 --> 1:48:13.220]  to have implantables and they want to have nano delivery and a lot of that depends on
[1:48:13.220 --> 1:48:15.740]  the graphene oxide.
[1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:24.620]  When I was looking into it, I also found that both AstraZeneca and Merck have anti-NPO drugs
[1:48:24.620 --> 1:48:27.220]  in clinical trials.
[1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:33.060]  So while I agree with you that the vaccine is basically a target for our immune system,
[1:48:33.060 --> 1:48:38.140]  it seems like the way it's going to go is we're going to come into a lot of massive
[1:48:38.140 --> 1:48:45.300]  inflammation and then we're going to be offered these anti-NPO anti-inflammation drugs and
[1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:49.500]  that's going to be the final thing that is going to take the stop-gap measure away from
[1:48:49.500 --> 1:48:50.500]  our innate immune system.
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:51.500]  Oh, I totally agree.
[1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.900]  It's going to be gene therapies.
[1:48:53.900 --> 1:48:56.500]  No one knows why everyone's immune system is gone.
[1:48:56.500 --> 1:48:59.620]  Don't worry, we've got this gene therapy that brings it back.
[1:48:59.620 --> 1:49:00.620]  They say that.
[1:49:00.620 --> 1:49:06.900]  I've played the Pfizer executives clips a year ago laughing and saying this.
[1:49:06.900 --> 1:49:11.940]  They're admitting the giant criminal takeover and they think the public's so dumbed down
[1:49:11.940 --> 1:49:14.900]  that they've bought off all the regulators that they're going to get away with it.
[1:49:14.900 --> 1:49:16.820]  It's just insane.
[1:49:16.820 --> 1:49:20.660]  I really hope that if people are getting sick, they're starting to look into some natural
[1:49:20.660 --> 1:49:24.340]  anti-inflammatories and they really start to research these drugs.
[1:49:24.340 --> 1:49:29.540]  I'm terrified that these anti-NPO drugs are going to start getting emergency use authorization.
[1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:33.540]  I'm not sure if that's the case because I believe that drugs are under a completely
[1:49:33.540 --> 1:49:37.660]  different set of regulations outside of the like my logic.
[1:49:37.660 --> 1:49:38.660]  No, no, no, no.
[1:49:38.660 --> 1:49:39.660]  You just said it.
[1:49:39.660 --> 1:49:42.780]  I don't know if you've seen the report we did a few months ago, but turns out all the
[1:49:42.780 --> 1:49:47.820]  different regulators, including Fauci were on C-SPAN and they said we want to get rid
[1:49:47.820 --> 1:49:51.500]  of drug regulation, the fact it takes five years on average.
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:55.300]  We're going to just call everything a vaccine because that bypasses it and quote, blow
[1:49:55.300 --> 1:49:57.260]  up the old existing system.
[1:49:57.260 --> 1:50:02.860]  So this is a drug, the mRNA is a drug, and so exactly what you're saying is what they're
[1:50:02.860 --> 1:50:03.860]  doing.
[1:50:03.860 --> 1:50:07.380]  They're blowing up the old system to roll out whatever they want and have no surveillance
[1:50:07.380 --> 1:50:10.020]  or no background reporting and just have a free for all.
[1:50:10.020 --> 1:50:14.700]  And if they can get away with killing tens of millions of people with these injections
[1:50:14.700 --> 1:50:18.420]  and tens of millions of miscarriages, then they can get away with anything.
[1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:19.420]  Does that make sense?
[1:50:19.420 --> 1:50:21.020]  It totally makes sense.
[1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:24.620]  And I hope that when people start, I really do think that there's going to be massive
[1:50:24.620 --> 1:50:28.780]  information and I hope that people start to look into some natural anti-inflammatories
[1:50:28.780 --> 1:50:32.460]  in ways that they can keep inflammation down in their body and please, please, please look
[1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:37.260]  into the drugs if they're suggested to you for this inflammation that I'm seeing rolling
[1:50:37.260 --> 1:50:40.260]  down the hill, it's frightening.
[1:50:40.260 --> 1:50:42.420]  Well there's a lot of smart people like you out there.
[1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:44.020]  Have a great weekend, Christian.
[1:50:44.020 --> 1:50:45.020]  Thank you.
[1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:46.020]  Okay.
[1:50:46.020 --> 1:50:52.260]  Next up in the order the calls were received would be Josh in Texas.
[1:50:52.260 --> 1:50:53.260]  Welcome, Josh.
[1:50:53.260 --> 1:50:54.260]  Hey, Alex.
[1:50:54.260 --> 1:50:59.300]  First off, I want to give a shout out to my beautiful family, Samantha, Emery and little
[1:50:59.300 --> 1:51:05.700]  Josh and I'm calling today to ask you what are we supposed to do whenever they come and
[1:51:05.700 --> 1:51:07.980]  basically try to mandate these vaccines.
[1:51:07.980 --> 1:51:13.340]  My daughter's three, my son's two and they say that we're neglecting our children and
[1:51:13.340 --> 1:51:16.780]  so therefore they have to be taken from our custody and put into state custody.
[1:51:16.780 --> 1:51:20.980]  You need to be involved at the county level, the state level.
[1:51:20.980 --> 1:51:26.900]  You need to be involved with who is you need to start a coalition of parents rights now
[1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.740]  so that you've got a support group of people ahead of that.
[1:51:29.740 --> 1:51:30.740]  That's why they don't want families.
[1:51:30.740 --> 1:51:32.140]  They don't want fathers.
[1:51:32.140 --> 1:51:34.860]  They certainly don't want families getting together.
[1:51:34.860 --> 1:51:37.260]  And so what you're saying is going to be the whole future.
[1:51:37.260 --> 1:51:40.860]  It's already happening in Australia, already happening in Europe, forced inoculation start
[1:51:40.860 --> 1:51:43.900]  in five, six weeks in Germany.
[1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:46.560]  They're already rounding folks up, taking them to camps.
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:47.660]  But these people are weak.
[1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:55.340]  I've seen new newscast and new reports of the Australian prime minister attacking us and
[1:51:55.340 --> 1:52:00.820]  national TV saying how evil I am and showing edited clips of me out of context.
[1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:02.700]  That's how weak they are.
[1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:05.580]  That's how weak these criminals carrying this out are.
[1:52:05.580 --> 1:52:06.940]  We have the facts, brother.
[1:52:06.940 --> 1:52:12.540]  We have to defend our children, you know, any means necessary.
[1:52:12.540 --> 1:52:17.260]  Also the medical industry has already discredited itself so far to the point to where I'm afraid
[1:52:17.260 --> 1:52:21.340]  to even take my children into, you know, in the future if they break a bone or they need
[1:52:21.340 --> 1:52:26.820]  a surgery and they don't allow a parent in the back that they're just going to vaccinate.
[1:52:26.820 --> 1:52:30.620]  And you know, we've already heard of, you know, in schools where these teachers are
[1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:34.540]  giving their kids pizza and they give them a vaccine.
[1:52:34.540 --> 1:52:39.060]  And that's what the drag queen pedophile story times about and in Europe, Canada and
[1:52:39.060 --> 1:52:44.380]  the U.S. and Blue City areas in the U.S., they are children as young as eight, they're
[1:52:44.380 --> 1:52:47.700]  giving them deadly injections without parental consent.
[1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:52.180]  I mean, and I'm not saying it's, it'd be better that the teacher rape your child than
[1:52:52.180 --> 1:52:56.540]  injected this in my opinion, in which they should be executed for both.
[1:52:56.540 --> 1:52:59.860]  But after they're tried and everything for Nuremberg violations, I mean, think about
[1:52:59.860 --> 1:53:00.860]  it.
[1:53:00.860 --> 1:53:02.100]  This is rape.
[1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:06.140]  This is medical rape of your rights and they're just doing it.
[1:53:06.140 --> 1:53:07.140]  Yes, sir.
[1:53:07.140 --> 1:53:08.140]  God bless you.
[1:53:08.140 --> 1:53:09.140]  I appreciate your call.
[1:53:09.140 --> 1:53:10.140]  But we're not going to be violent.
[1:53:10.140 --> 1:53:11.260]  They want to start violence.
[1:53:11.260 --> 1:53:15.460]  They want to push us so they can then try to come after us and start a full-scale war.
[1:53:15.460 --> 1:53:19.660]  We're not going to start the war, but we're getting ready for the war.
[1:53:19.660 --> 1:53:23.740]  Now it's a war they want, it's the one they're going to get, but they're going to blow up
[1:53:23.740 --> 1:53:25.500]  their own facilities and blame us.
[1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:28.100]  We don't want to offensively go out and do anything.
[1:53:28.100 --> 1:53:34.660]  We are against offensive violence.
[1:53:34.660 --> 1:53:36.100]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:53:36.100 --> 1:53:38.460]  Let's talk to Brandon in California.
[1:53:38.460 --> 1:53:39.460]  Let's go, Brandon.
[1:53:39.460 --> 1:53:40.460]  Hey, sir.
[1:53:40.460 --> 1:53:41.460]  How you doing?
[1:53:41.460 --> 1:53:42.460]  Good, man.
[1:53:42.460 --> 1:53:43.460]  Go ahead.
[1:53:43.460 --> 1:53:44.460]  Kudos to you.
[1:53:44.460 --> 1:53:52.180]  I just want to talk about, I had to be forced vaccinated at my hospital.
[1:53:52.180 --> 1:54:00.340]  And it was the hardest decision of my life.
[1:54:00.340 --> 1:54:08.220]  And well, I just want to talk about everyone that's coming in the hospital, because I worked
[1:54:08.220 --> 1:54:13.980]  in the ER and the ICU, everyone in the hospital is mostly vaccinated.
[1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:19.740]  And when they come in, they get on oxygen and then they get intubated and then they
[1:54:19.740 --> 1:54:22.140]  die a week later.
[1:54:22.140 --> 1:54:23.580]  Every single one of them.
[1:54:23.580 --> 1:54:30.700]  They all have core mobilities like chronic kidney disease, heart disease.
[1:54:30.700 --> 1:54:31.700]  You name it.
[1:54:31.700 --> 1:54:33.740]  But every single one of them, they've died.
[1:54:33.740 --> 1:54:39.700]  And I wanted to voice my opinion to one of the doctors, the intent of this, that worked
[1:54:39.700 --> 1:54:41.700]  there at the ICU.
[1:54:41.700 --> 1:54:46.780]  And he pulled me aside and he was like, hey, you know, you shouldn't be saying these things
[1:54:46.780 --> 1:54:48.780]  out loud because you could get fired.
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:50.300]  And I was like, what are you talking about?
[1:54:50.300 --> 1:54:52.940]  And he was like, we have protocols we have to go through.
[1:54:52.940 --> 1:54:55.820]  We can't really give our own medicines.
[1:54:55.820 --> 1:54:59.860]  We have to go through these protocols through the hospital.
[1:54:59.860 --> 1:55:01.820]  And it's just crazy.
[1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:02.820]  It's just crazy.
[1:55:02.820 --> 1:55:07.780]  I see all these people, they're coming in these families that want these medicines,
[1:55:07.780 --> 1:55:09.660]  but they're not giving it to them.
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:14.820]  Well, brother, I'm sorry to hear that as a hospital worker, you're saying you would
[1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:15.900]  have lost your job.
[1:55:15.900 --> 1:55:18.140]  That basically is a forced injection.
[1:55:18.140 --> 1:55:23.020]  According to the Nuremberg code, that's a serious war crime, what they did to you.
[1:55:23.020 --> 1:55:27.340]  But yes, it is forced to say, I'll take your livelihood, I'll take your food away, I'll
[1:55:27.340 --> 1:55:30.220]  take your house away, I'll take your child away.
[1:55:30.220 --> 1:55:32.260]  This is terrorism.
[1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:35.540]  And even if this shot worked wonderfully, this would be wrong because it would set the
[1:55:35.540 --> 1:55:38.700]  precedent for them to put in our bodies what they want, when they want.
[1:55:38.700 --> 1:55:40.060]  But it doesn't even work.
[1:55:40.060 --> 1:55:44.140]  In fact, in a racist art immune system, it's serious assault.
[1:55:44.140 --> 1:55:47.820]  But we're not used to being assaulted with a needle so we don't have any history of fighting
[1:55:47.820 --> 1:55:48.820]  it.
[1:55:48.820 --> 1:55:53.740]  If they had guns or knives, we would know to resist, but instead they come with a mask
[1:55:53.740 --> 1:55:58.620]  on and a medical outfit, with a Stockholm syndrome idiot following their orders.
[1:55:58.620 --> 1:56:01.020]  It is, man.
[1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:02.740]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[1:56:02.740 --> 1:56:03.740]  Sorry to hear that's happening.
[1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:09.500]  All right, we're going to go to break and come back with beefy and Mike and others.
[1:56:09.500 --> 1:56:13.220]  Listen, now more than ever, people are ready to hear the truth.
[1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:17.300]  So please support our local AMN FM stations.
[1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:19.180]  Please tell people about the stations.
[1:56:19.180 --> 1:56:20.180]  Become a sponsor.
[1:56:20.180 --> 1:56:21.180]  Support the sponsors.
[1:56:21.180 --> 1:56:24.140]  If it's a small mom and pop, send them 50 bucks a month.
[1:56:24.140 --> 1:56:27.980]  I mean, tithe to the truth.
[1:56:27.980 --> 1:56:31.420]  This show does a lot more for pro-life and anti-Satanism than your average church.
[1:56:31.420 --> 1:56:34.780]  And I'm not knocking on little churches that have been trained to be cowardly and follow
[1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:35.780]  orders.
[1:56:35.780 --> 1:56:38.460]  And that's between them and God.
[1:56:38.460 --> 1:56:42.380]  The point is, we aren't up here like Pharisees saying how perfect we are.
[1:56:42.380 --> 1:56:46.380]  We're just saying God's the only way and we're fighting as hard as we can.
[1:56:46.380 --> 1:56:48.740]  Support our local radio stations.
[1:56:48.740 --> 1:56:52.380]  It's such a big deal when you do so many stations, put us on at night and then a few years later
[1:56:52.380 --> 1:56:53.380]  because of support.
[1:56:53.380 --> 1:56:55.700]  They put us on during the day and we reach so many people.
[1:56:55.700 --> 1:56:58.340]  So tell folks about your local stations, promote that.
[1:56:58.340 --> 1:56:59.980]  Tell folks about Band-Aid video.
[1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:02.260]  Tell folks about freeworldnews.tv.
[1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:05.940]  And then please don't forget, we have the new film, COVID Land 2, The Mask.
[1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:10.060]  And when you get the film at infowarstore.com, you get dark secrets of cyber-ohemian grove
[1:57:10.060 --> 1:57:15.980]  and the order of death, two films on one DVD about the globalist, skull and bones satanic
[1:57:15.980 --> 1:57:20.460]  secret society systems, makes an excellent Christmas gift to wake people up and you're
[1:57:20.460 --> 1:57:26.100]  authorized to make copies of both films, all three films that I produced, two DVDs, three
[1:57:26.100 --> 1:57:27.100]  films.
[1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:32.060]  Infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:57:32.060 --> 1:57:34.380]  And also, it'll be sold out I think by tomorrow night.
[1:57:34.380 --> 1:57:35.380]  Thank you for your support.
[1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:37.500]  We really needed to do these new projects.
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:46.580]  Find out about the member coin and the little secrets of that and more at 1776coin.com.
[1:57:46.580 --> 1:57:51.780]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:57:51.780 --> 1:57:56.100]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:57:56.100 --> 1:58:00.420]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[1:58:00.420 --> 1:58:04.980]  organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[1:58:04.980 --> 1:58:08.940]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever
[1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:12.500]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[1:58:12.500 --> 1:58:13.500]  Mexican government take over.
[1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:16.940]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[1:58:16.940 --> 1:58:18.140]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:22.860]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[1:58:22.860 --> 1:58:25.020]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:28.700]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:58:28.700 --> 1:58:36.100]  Um, in fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, um, we had like that, okay, you wouldn't
[1:58:36.100 --> 1:58:37.100]  believe it.
[1:58:37.100 --> 1:58:41.580]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[1:58:41.580 --> 1:58:47.820]  find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:58:47.820 --> 1:58:49.180]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:58:49.180 --> 1:58:51.100]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:52.100]  Welcome.
[1:58:52.100 --> 1:58:53.100]  Hello, Alex.
[1:58:53.100 --> 1:58:54.100]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:58:54.100 --> 1:58:56.460]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on
[1:58:56.460 --> 1:58:57.460]  the line.
[1:58:57.460 --> 1:59:03.260]  I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMell Vitality
[1:59:03.260 --> 1:59:04.860]  and Brainforce Plus.
[1:59:04.860 --> 1:59:07.620]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:59:07.620 --> 1:59:09.420]  SuperMell Vitality really, really works.
[1:59:09.420 --> 1:59:15.580]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[1:59:15.580 --> 1:59:18.540]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:59:18.540 --> 1:59:20.940]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[1:59:20.940 --> 1:59:22.900]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:59:22.900 --> 1:59:25.300]  It's, it's, it's, in fact, each batch is different.
[1:59:25.300 --> 1:59:27.380]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:59:27.380 --> 1:59:30.820]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:59:30.820 --> 1:59:31.820]  That's just how it is.
[1:59:31.820 --> 1:59:32.820]  It's how it works.
[1:59:32.820 --> 1:59:34.980]  Uh, so it's always good.
[1:59:34.980 --> 1:59:39.140]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a
[1:59:39.140 --> 1:59:49.180]  decent price, then this is it.
[1:59:49.180 --> 2:00:17.220]  You know, I used to read globalist documents 28 years ago when I first got on air 20 years
[2:00:17.220 --> 2:00:23.340]  ago, 10 years ago, and I, you know, I felt guilty a little bit when I would read operation
[2:00:23.340 --> 2:00:26.540]  lockstep documents 12 years ago and predict all this.
[2:00:26.540 --> 2:00:27.540]  You've all seen those videos.
[2:00:27.540 --> 2:00:31.180]  They've gone viral since then because I knew it was real.
[2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:37.620]  I knew it was their plan, but I still just, it felt weird to be saying all this.
[2:00:37.620 --> 2:00:42.140]  And now we're in the middle of all this and it's really happening in depopulation.
[2:00:42.140 --> 2:00:43.140]  I don't feel guilty.
[2:00:43.140 --> 2:00:48.820]  I just feel sad and nauseous, but it still kind of feels weird to be telling people
[2:00:48.820 --> 2:00:52.860]  this is happening because it just doesn't make sense unless you're a psychotic globalist.
[2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:56.140]  Mike Adams has got a huge economic and COVID news coming up for the rest of the hour.
[2:00:56.140 --> 2:00:59.940]  Here in just a few minutes, I'm going to be taking with Dr. Zalinko and others for a
[2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:04.700]  big special emergency broadcast tomorrow that's going to be about three to four hours long.
[2:01:04.700 --> 2:01:05.700]  Okay.
[2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:06.700]  So be ready for that.
[2:01:06.700 --> 2:01:08.380]  And again, I know as an audience, you're just like me.
[2:01:08.380 --> 2:01:09.620]  You're tired of all this news.
[2:01:09.620 --> 2:01:12.780]  You're sick of it, but you can't turn away because you care.
[2:01:12.780 --> 2:01:16.300]  Get that energy and spread the word and spread the links and spread the articles and we're
[2:01:16.300 --> 2:01:17.300]  going to win.
[2:01:17.300 --> 2:01:20.220]  And if you've got a neighbor and you find out she's pregnant, bring them an actual news
[2:01:20.220 --> 2:01:24.620]  article with links to the American Medical Association or the New England Medical Journal
[2:01:24.620 --> 2:01:31.260]  where they admitted 82% increase in spontaneous miscarriages and you're going to save a baby.
[2:01:31.260 --> 2:01:35.060]  And you got to just get in people's business because believe me, I'm the type of guy.
[2:01:35.060 --> 2:01:38.540]  I don't want to say something at the grocery store line to a pregnant woman.
[2:01:38.540 --> 2:01:40.420]  I don't, I want to, I've got my own life.
[2:01:40.420 --> 2:01:41.420]  I don't want to be in people's business.
[2:01:41.420 --> 2:01:42.540]  But you know what?
[2:01:42.540 --> 2:01:46.100]  If you don't get in other people's business, you're letting the globalists kill them.
[2:01:46.100 --> 2:01:49.180]  So if you knew your neighbor was going to get robbed one night and you didn't go tell
[2:01:49.180 --> 2:01:51.660]  them, that's now on you.
[2:01:51.660 --> 2:01:53.700]  So see, it's not busy body now.
[2:01:53.700 --> 2:01:58.340]  And that's the problem with Christians and conservatives and the rest of us that love
[2:01:58.340 --> 2:01:59.340]  God and justice.
[2:01:59.340 --> 2:02:00.340]  This is true.
[2:02:00.340 --> 2:02:01.340]  We got our own lives.
[2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:03.220]  I got all my own stuff to deal with.
[2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:04.860]  I don't want to know what you're doing.
[2:02:04.860 --> 2:02:07.580]  I don't want to tell you what to do because I'm confident.
[2:02:07.580 --> 2:02:09.180]  I'm, I'm strong.
[2:02:09.180 --> 2:02:10.180]  I don't want your wife.
[2:02:10.180 --> 2:02:11.180]  I got my wife.
[2:02:11.180 --> 2:02:12.180]  I don't want your farm.
[2:02:12.180 --> 2:02:13.180]  I got my farm.
[2:02:13.180 --> 2:02:14.180]  I don't want your car.
[2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:15.180]  I got my car.
[2:02:15.180 --> 2:02:16.180]  I don't want your kids.
[2:02:16.180 --> 2:02:17.180]  I got my kids.
[2:02:17.180 --> 2:02:21.340]  The left doesn't have any of that and they're missing something.
[2:02:21.340 --> 2:02:24.660]  So that's why you have the archetype of the zombies.
[2:02:24.660 --> 2:02:27.820]  They're not real, but they're an archetype like vampires.
[2:02:27.820 --> 2:02:30.380]  There aren't people that live forever, but there are crazy people that kidnap folks and
[2:02:30.380 --> 2:02:31.380]  drink their blood.
[2:02:31.380 --> 2:02:32.380]  Satanist.
[2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:35.540]  It's the same thing with zombies.
[2:02:35.540 --> 2:02:36.540]  They're mindless.
[2:02:36.540 --> 2:02:37.540]  They're dumb.
[2:02:37.540 --> 2:02:38.540]  They're in giant packs.
[2:02:38.540 --> 2:02:42.300]  What they don't have brains.
[2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:43.300]  That's the archetype.
[2:02:43.300 --> 2:02:47.580]  They want to kill you because you've got something they don't have.
[2:02:47.580 --> 2:02:49.340]  You have consciousness.
[2:02:49.340 --> 2:02:50.540]  You're connected to the universe.
[2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:52.220]  You're connected to God.
[2:02:52.220 --> 2:02:56.460]  You're tuned into that frequency that you were designed by.
[2:02:56.460 --> 2:02:59.340]  These people got stuck on the wrong radio station, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:03.780]  This is literally a spiritual transmission that that is what consciousness is.
[2:03:03.780 --> 2:03:13.140]  And they are signed up with people that don't act like any animals in the animal kingdom.
[2:03:13.140 --> 2:03:15.900]  They act like something out of biblical demons.
[2:03:15.900 --> 2:03:18.460]  And I'm telling you, it's a transmission.
[2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:19.940]  It's not even a creature.
[2:03:19.940 --> 2:03:20.940]  It is a wavelength.
[2:03:20.940 --> 2:03:23.900]  I don't know if there's something parked behind the moon broadcasting and I don't know what's
[2:03:23.900 --> 2:03:29.140]  going on, but it's like the Kingsman movie that came out 10 years ago now, where the
[2:03:29.140 --> 2:03:32.940]  billionaire crazies get together to send out a signal to the cell phones and everybody
[2:03:32.940 --> 2:03:34.380]  starts killing each other.
[2:03:34.380 --> 2:03:36.300]  They're telling you what they're doing.
[2:03:36.300 --> 2:03:39.380]  You got to ask yourself, why are they telling you?
[2:03:39.380 --> 2:03:42.580]  Because there are metaphysical rules of the universe that we've all been able to observe.
[2:03:42.580 --> 2:03:48.020]  And as you get older, you realize, wow, this is really the rules of the universe.
[2:03:48.020 --> 2:03:53.300]  They must tell you what they're going to do to you in fine print.
[2:03:53.300 --> 2:03:57.740]  Remember the old saying, the devil's in the details.
[2:03:57.740 --> 2:04:01.980]  So when Fauci goes, 99% of people dying are unvaccinated.
[2:04:01.980 --> 2:04:05.500]  This is the used numbers before vaccination started to tell a lie.
[2:04:05.500 --> 2:04:08.100]  But is the average person going to get into the details?
[2:04:08.100 --> 2:04:09.100]  No.
[2:04:09.100 --> 2:04:11.660]  Well, that's where the devil's at.
[2:04:11.660 --> 2:04:17.820]  And so Mike Adams and I get into the details where the devil's at.
[2:04:17.820 --> 2:04:19.500]  And that's what we're about to do on the other side.
[2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:27.620]  And then we will, one way or another, I'll get to Savannah and Mike in New York and beefy
[2:04:27.620 --> 2:04:32.380]  and Nancy and James and summer and everybody else here today, you've all got comments on
[2:04:32.380 --> 2:04:33.380]  the vaccine.
[2:04:33.380 --> 2:04:34.380]  So those will be quick.
[2:04:34.380 --> 2:04:40.980]  But Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is our guest and he called me last week and said this,
[2:04:40.980 --> 2:04:45.060]  you know, big Chinese $300 billion company thing is about to go under next week.
[2:04:45.060 --> 2:04:46.060]  I said, well, come on.
[2:04:46.060 --> 2:04:47.700]  He goes, well, I don't want to be part of it going down.
[2:04:47.700 --> 2:04:48.700]  I don't want to be part of scaring people.
[2:04:48.700 --> 2:04:49.820]  I'll come on once it happens.
[2:04:49.820 --> 2:04:53.340]  So here he is joining us today after what he said last week to me happened.
[2:04:53.340 --> 2:04:54.340]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:54.340 --> 2:04:55.340]  Stay with us.
[2:04:55.340 --> 2:05:02.060]  Alex Jones here with a very Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our
[2:05:02.060 --> 2:05:04.500]  amazing listeners and viewers.
[2:05:04.500 --> 2:05:09.820]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special.
[2:05:09.820 --> 2:05:13.660]  It's the 1776 founder coin.
[2:05:13.660 --> 2:05:15.460]  You've got to see this coin for yourself.
[2:05:15.460 --> 2:05:19.260]  It's at 1776coin.com.
[2:05:19.260 --> 2:05:25.860]  And this coin makes you a founding member of a very exciting group of projects that
[2:05:25.860 --> 2:05:28.860]  we're going to be launching in the very new future.
[2:05:28.860 --> 2:05:31.140]  Become a founding member today.
[2:05:31.140 --> 2:05:37.780]  Learn more at 1776coin.com or call toll free triple eight two five three three one three
[2:05:37.780 --> 2:05:39.860]  nine as a founding member.
[2:05:39.860 --> 2:05:45.620]  You become part of an elite circle continuing the fight against the globalist new world order.
[2:05:45.620 --> 2:05:49.660]  That's why you're called a founding member because the funding from this is going to
[2:05:49.660 --> 2:05:54.820]  go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people
[2:05:54.820 --> 2:06:09.180]  to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[2:06:09.180 --> 2:06:19.020]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance you're listening to Alex
[2:06:19.020 --> 2:06:21.260]  Jones.
[2:06:21.260 --> 2:06:31.140]  Well, we've all been watching Evergrande the 300 million dollar pumped up zombie globalist
[2:06:31.140 --> 2:06:36.660]  company in China and saying it could trigger the next big financial collapse.
[2:06:36.660 --> 2:06:39.660]  But Mike Adams last week, we talked and he said, I think it's imminent.
[2:06:39.660 --> 2:06:41.540]  I think it's going to happen by next week.
[2:06:41.540 --> 2:06:42.740]  And I'm like, OK, well, come on.
[2:06:42.740 --> 2:06:44.740]  He goes, no, I don't want to be part of it going down.
[2:06:44.740 --> 2:06:46.420]  He goes, I'll come on once it goes down.
[2:06:46.420 --> 2:06:50.620]  But he goes, I'd look for that next week and sure as hell, it happened.
[2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:51.620]  So Mike's here.
[2:06:51.620 --> 2:06:53.180]  But he's also got a lot of other huge news.
[2:06:53.180 --> 2:06:56.440]  Mike Adams from naturalnews.com here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:56.440 --> 2:06:57.940]  This is a big game changer.
[2:06:57.940 --> 2:07:03.100]  And I covered this Wednesday night some and I covered it Thursday only for about five
[2:07:03.100 --> 2:07:04.100]  minutes.
[2:07:04.100 --> 2:07:07.180]  That's when I feel guilty is I listened to rebroadcast part of it last night and I'm
[2:07:07.180 --> 2:07:09.660]  like, you spent like five minutes, Jones, on this.
[2:07:09.660 --> 2:07:10.660]  You should have spent an hour.
[2:07:10.660 --> 2:07:13.980]  This is big because they can try to ignore the general public.
[2:07:13.980 --> 2:07:16.780]  They can ignore this scientist, this doctor, this study.
[2:07:16.780 --> 2:07:21.420]  But when you have a major respect government, the Japanese are as smart as you get.
[2:07:21.420 --> 2:07:24.940]  Say, OK, this is causing heart attacks and microcarditis at a very high level.
[2:07:24.940 --> 2:07:25.940]  It's not rare.
[2:07:25.940 --> 2:07:27.980]  That validates the mountains of other evidence.
[2:07:27.980 --> 2:07:31.940]  So we've got that naturalnews.com article, Japan Health Ministry issues, heart warning
[2:07:31.940 --> 2:07:36.820]  for Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines, molecular biologists, we could potentially be sterilizing
[2:07:36.820 --> 2:07:38.540]  an entire generation with COVID vaccines.
[2:07:38.540 --> 2:07:40.340]  Yeah, that's what we know it's doing.
[2:07:40.340 --> 2:07:41.780]  Now it's all confirmed.
[2:07:41.780 --> 2:07:47.420]  First batch of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine documents revealed 42,000 reaction reports,
[2:07:47.420 --> 2:07:53.740]  101,223 deaths just in the first few weeks of it.
[2:07:53.740 --> 2:07:58.860]  That's all going to be broken down with Mike Adams, the Jesse Smollett situation, the economy,
[2:07:58.860 --> 2:07:59.860]  all of it.
[2:07:59.860 --> 2:08:02.220]  And to have you again, where do you want to start first?
[2:08:02.220 --> 2:08:05.340]  Well, I would say, Alex, thank you for having me on.
[2:08:05.340 --> 2:08:09.300]  And we need to start with the fact that we're into the dark winter phase now.
[2:08:09.300 --> 2:08:10.980]  The die-offs are accelerating.
[2:08:10.980 --> 2:08:13.180]  The stillbirths are accelerating.
[2:08:13.180 --> 2:08:18.900]  The establishment hasn't been able to achieve what they wanted with the Omicron hysteria.
[2:08:18.900 --> 2:08:21.460]  And so they're going to play another card.
[2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:27.180]  And the card that it looks like they're going to play sometime in 2022 is the false flag
[2:08:27.180 --> 2:08:30.300]  cyber attack on the financial infrastructure.
[2:08:30.300 --> 2:08:36.220]  And Israel has been running a 10-nation simulation on exactly that scenario.
[2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:39.120]  And by the way, I mean, this is speculation that that's their next card.
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:40.540]  They could play another bio weapon.
[2:08:40.540 --> 2:08:42.020]  They could start war with Russia.
[2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:44.180]  They're obviously trying to do that right now.
[2:08:44.180 --> 2:08:45.820]  There are many things they could do.
[2:08:45.820 --> 2:08:52.500]  But you got to add to your Rolodex of options here cyber warfare assault on the U.S. financial
[2:08:52.500 --> 2:08:53.860]  system.
[2:08:53.860 --> 2:08:57.900]  And what most people aren't thinking about that's on my mind right now, Alex, is the
[2:08:57.900 --> 2:09:04.580]  social chaos implications of the freezing of the financial infrastructure in America.
[2:09:04.580 --> 2:09:05.980]  And you covered it today already.
[2:09:05.980 --> 2:09:11.860]  The LA, I think it's the union leader for the LA police saying, don't come to LA.
[2:09:11.860 --> 2:09:16.460]  That's the beginning of what's going to be really no-go zones or no-police zones.
[2:09:16.460 --> 2:09:17.900]  You said that on my show a month ago.
[2:09:17.900 --> 2:09:23.820]  You said the next big trend will be no-go zones in blue cities and then a huge exodus.
[2:09:23.820 --> 2:09:24.820]  Wow.
[2:09:24.820 --> 2:09:25.820]  You have a good memory.
[2:09:25.820 --> 2:09:26.820]  You're right.
[2:09:26.820 --> 2:09:29.020]  I did say that on your show and we're seeing it confirmed.
[2:09:29.020 --> 2:09:33.500]  But it's going to get far worse where police will literally, they may at some point tweet
[2:09:33.500 --> 2:09:39.940]  out a map of LA and they'll just draw, you know, 50 square blocks and say, these are
[2:09:39.940 --> 2:09:41.440]  no-police zones.
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:42.740]  Don't even think about going there.
[2:09:42.740 --> 2:09:47.780]  And if you're there now, get out while you can, escape from LA, Kurt Russell movie becoming
[2:09:47.780 --> 2:09:48.940]  a reality.
[2:09:48.940 --> 2:09:53.780]  But what's going to trigger that is the freezing of the financial system, which could be engineered
[2:09:53.780 --> 2:09:59.480]  and it could be used to blame it on China so that Biden can then go ahead and stage
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:04.340]  some kind of conflict with China and use that to declare domestic martial law under
[2:10:04.340 --> 2:10:05.860]  a wartime emergency.
[2:10:05.860 --> 2:10:09.420]  Remember, they have to have perpetual emergencies.
[2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:13.740]  And since the COVID emergency is kind of petering out, you know, people just aren't buying
[2:10:13.740 --> 2:10:14.860]  it anymore.
[2:10:14.860 --> 2:10:18.740]  They need another bigger emergency in order to keep people in line.
[2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:23.740]  And so war is one, financial collapse is one, but Alex, and you know this very well, you're
[2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:24.920]  audience knows this.
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:30.060]  What happens when the food stamps stop working, when the ATMs stop working, when all transactions
[2:10:30.060 --> 2:10:36.460]  are frozen and you have an ice nine type of scenario of cascading freezing of the banking
[2:10:36.460 --> 2:10:41.620]  system, people don't get paid about 40% of America's living paycheck to paycheck.
[2:10:41.620 --> 2:10:45.340]  They can't survive one weekend without their Friday paycheck.
[2:10:45.340 --> 2:10:49.460]  And we're going to see massive social chaos across America.
[2:10:49.460 --> 2:10:55.740]  Now psychologically, the average, the typical law-abiding polite American is not ready for
[2:10:55.740 --> 2:10:56.740]  that.
[2:10:56.740 --> 2:11:04.740]  Whereas the hardened criminals, the convicted cons, the people who did time in federal pen,
[2:11:04.740 --> 2:11:11.380]  they are psychologically primed for surviving chaos and mayhem and even exploiting in some
[2:11:11.380 --> 2:11:16.340]  cases those situations for their own personal protection or gain.
[2:11:16.340 --> 2:11:22.300]  So the collapse of polite society is coming and the only way to survive this is to either
[2:11:22.300 --> 2:11:27.420]  get incredibly well tactically trained in self-defense or get out of these cities while
[2:11:27.420 --> 2:11:28.420]  you can.
[2:11:28.420 --> 2:11:32.220]  So Alex, that's what's on my mind right now because I see what's coming.
[2:11:32.220 --> 2:11:37.740]  Well, I totally agree with you and we're talking about escape from New York scenario, which
[2:11:37.740 --> 2:11:41.260]  is the globalist plan to make much of the West no go zones.
[2:11:41.260 --> 2:11:42.260]  This has been planned.
[2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:43.940]  Now the police aren't in on this.
[2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:47.180]  They're just going to be put in a position where this is what's going to happen.
[2:11:47.180 --> 2:11:48.180]  They're being cut in half.
[2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:49.180]  They're being defunded.
[2:11:49.180 --> 2:11:52.300]  They're being told pullback and this has all been part of the larger plan to collapse
[2:11:52.300 --> 2:11:53.300]  the country.
[2:11:53.300 --> 2:11:55.900]  And then the globalists go, oh, look, you collapsed on your own.
[2:11:55.900 --> 2:12:00.700]  As you mentioned or gave a little prelude to, the Communist Chinese dailies are all
[2:12:00.700 --> 2:12:01.940]  like, America's a race war.
[2:12:01.940 --> 2:12:02.940]  They're a failure.
[2:12:02.940 --> 2:12:03.940]  They're cities of collapse.
[2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:04.940]  They're a joke.
[2:12:04.940 --> 2:12:11.820]  And then their clients, Bill Gates and their minions, like President Biden, are doing this.
[2:12:11.820 --> 2:12:17.060]  So this is a war and COVID's a war and the devaluing our currencies a war and annihilating
[2:12:17.060 --> 2:12:18.260]  our borders is a war.
[2:12:18.260 --> 2:12:20.500]  I mean, the country is going down.
[2:12:20.500 --> 2:12:23.860]  And if we don't get Senator Paul and people to realize that it's over, I mean, thank God
[2:12:23.860 --> 2:12:28.940]  Tucker Carlson gets it and Joe Rogan started to get it, but there's not time to just sit
[2:12:28.940 --> 2:12:30.740]  here and kind of eat around the edges.
[2:12:30.740 --> 2:12:34.140]  You've got to go all the way out and expose the whole thing or we'll lose it all.
[2:12:34.140 --> 2:12:36.180]  I told Joe Rogan at dinner the other night.
[2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:39.660]  I said, listen, you think you just escaped LA.
[2:12:39.660 --> 2:12:40.860]  This is going nationwide.
[2:12:40.860 --> 2:12:43.420]  We got to stop it in LA if we're going to stop it here.
[2:12:43.420 --> 2:12:45.140]  That's what's so dangerous about this.
[2:12:45.140 --> 2:12:48.500]  Yeah, Joe, Joe Rogan totally gets it and Tucker gets it.
[2:12:48.500 --> 2:12:52.620]  So many people are really waking up to the kinds of things that you've been warning about
[2:12:52.620 --> 2:12:53.620]  for many years.
[2:12:53.620 --> 2:12:59.100]  And I got to say, if anything, the only mistake that you and I have both made is that we underestimated
[2:12:59.100 --> 2:13:06.060]  the ferocity of the globalists and how quickly they would move on depopulation and collapse
[2:13:06.060 --> 2:13:08.980]  because it's accelerating all around us right now.
[2:13:08.980 --> 2:13:14.540]  Now, the situation with Evergrande, we got to touch on that at least a little bit because
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:22.380]  we're going to see cascading financial default over the entire year of 2022 among the various
[2:13:22.380 --> 2:13:27.820]  institutions, could be insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds, and so on that
[2:13:27.820 --> 2:13:33.540]  held the paper debt of the Evergrande corporation, which is now in what's called a restricted
[2:13:33.540 --> 2:13:34.540]  default.
[2:13:34.540 --> 2:13:36.700]  It's going to be total default.
[2:13:36.700 --> 2:13:37.980]  That's actually what it is.
[2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:42.940]  It's just currently labeled restricted default by Fitch and other ratings agencies.
[2:13:42.940 --> 2:13:48.060]  So again, a giant property developer Ponzi scheme that has collapsed is not just Evergrande,
[2:13:48.060 --> 2:13:54.060]  it's also Kaiser and other companies in China that were in the same game and they built
[2:13:54.060 --> 2:13:59.340]  up massive amounts of debt and then a lot of institutions around the world bought into
[2:13:59.340 --> 2:14:01.060]  that debt.
[2:14:01.060 --> 2:14:08.220]  Then we think there are implications for the crypto ecosystem, which also needs a little
[2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:14.420]  bit of house cleaning so that it can be prepared to really go mainstream in the future.
[2:14:14.420 --> 2:14:18.460]  The crypto leaders were testifying before Congress two days ago, I believe, and really
[2:14:18.460 --> 2:14:26.700]  asking, begging for regulations so that they can clean up that whole ecosystem and launch
[2:14:26.700 --> 2:14:29.380]  crypto into mainstream acceptance.
[2:14:29.380 --> 2:14:31.300]  I agree, I think that's necessary.
[2:14:31.300 --> 2:14:35.900]  There have to be some ground rules for crypto, but also even outside of crypto, we're going
[2:14:35.900 --> 2:14:41.380]  to see cascading financial failures throughout 2022.
[2:14:41.380 --> 2:14:46.340]  And probably then a cyber attack on the banking system would help cover up all of that and
[2:14:46.340 --> 2:14:51.300]  create an excuse for the failure of Joe Biden's policies on the economy as well.
[2:14:51.300 --> 2:14:53.540]  So watch for all of that coming.
[2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:54.540]  It's going to be a mess.
[2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:58.420]  Well, Evergrande is $300 billion, looks like they're going to default on all of it.
[2:14:58.420 --> 2:15:00.300]  They've just been building insane ghost cities.
[2:15:00.300 --> 2:15:07.060]  We're talking like 50, 100 skyscrapers, 20, 30, 40-story buildings with no one in them.
[2:15:07.060 --> 2:15:08.060]  That's just insane.
[2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:12.500]  Well, yeah, I mean, they built entire cities.
[2:15:12.500 --> 2:15:16.500]  Individual investors in China believe this is their retirement because they don't have
[2:15:16.500 --> 2:15:19.260]  retirement systems like we have in the U.S., like Social Security.
[2:15:19.260 --> 2:15:24.660]  So they invested in real estate, and then their money is mostly lost, although China,
[2:15:24.660 --> 2:15:29.500]  the government has ordered Evergrande to pay back local domestic individual investors first,
[2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:32.900]  which means the foreign bondholders, like U.S. bondholders, are going to be left holding
[2:15:32.900 --> 2:15:34.820]  the bag and getting virtually nothing.
[2:15:34.820 --> 2:15:37.380]  So we can talk about that more when we come back.
[2:15:37.380 --> 2:15:38.380]  That's right.
[2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:40.360]  Mike Adams, naturalnews.com, Alex Jones.
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:41.700]  This is the reality, folks.
[2:15:41.700 --> 2:15:42.820]  We're not trying to scare you.
[2:15:42.820 --> 2:15:45.980]  We're trying to get you ready to brace for impact.
[2:15:45.980 --> 2:15:47.620]  Believe me, I got four children.
[2:15:47.620 --> 2:15:48.620]  I got a wife.
[2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:52.140]  I'm so sad for this whole country and the world, but facing the truth is our only way
[2:15:52.140 --> 2:15:53.140]  out of this.
[2:15:53.140 --> 2:15:54.780] 焦
[2:15:54.780 --> 2:16:03.240]  Ultimate bone broth is back and better than ever, and 20 percent off plus free shipping

[2:16:20.460 --> 2:16:26.060]  chaga musher, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, then it's got added magnesium
[2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:28.140]  and potassium for electrolytes.
[2:16:28.140 --> 2:16:34.100]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea
[2:16:34.100 --> 2:16:35.100]  salt.
[2:16:35.100 --> 2:16:38.860]  It even takes better to the last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:16:38.860 --> 2:16:45.260]  Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor and
[2:16:45.260 --> 2:16:46.260]  dissolvability.

[2:16:58.060 --> 2:17:02.740]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[2:17:02.740 --> 2:17:08.020]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[2:17:08.020 --> 2:17:11.980]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[2:17:11.980 --> 2:17:16.180]  The United States of Brazil, and of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[2:17:16.180 --> 2:17:19.860]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[2:17:19.860 --> 2:17:25.260]  That's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of Build
[2:17:25.260 --> 2:17:27.060]  Back Better.
[2:17:27.060 --> 2:17:33.060]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because
[2:17:33.060 --> 2:17:37.380]  they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the
[2:17:37.380 --> 2:17:42.660]  ideology of this world government system, could win, they released a biological weapon
[2:17:42.660 --> 2:17:43.660]  on us.
[2:17:43.660 --> 2:17:47.580]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[2:17:47.580 --> 2:17:52.260]  It's that simple, they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global
[2:17:52.260 --> 2:17:56.260]  corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[2:17:56.260 --> 2:17:57.940]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:17:57.940 --> 2:18:03.540]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[2:18:03.540 --> 2:18:05.940]  the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[2:18:05.940 --> 2:18:09.420]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your
[2:18:09.420 --> 2:18:15.140]  house and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their
[2:18:15.140 --> 2:18:16.140]  facilities.
[2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:20.740]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and
[2:18:20.740 --> 2:18:24.900]  take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:18:24.900 --> 2:18:26.700]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:18:26.700 --> 2:18:30.940]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many
[2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:35.220]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning US government military

[2:19:56.380 --> 2:19:57.380]  Special.
[2:19:57.380 --> 2:20:07.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:07.380 --> 2:20:29.060]  All right, welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host, Mike Adams, riding the shotgun with
[2:20:29.060 --> 2:20:34.260]  us the rest of the hour, but Mike, before we get into cryptocurrency and your next prediction
[2:20:34.260 --> 2:20:39.540]  on the economy and other geopolitical news and U.S. senators saying we need to nuke Russia
[2:20:39.540 --> 2:20:45.660]  first, I mean, just incredible times to be alive, go back because you're the guy that's
[2:20:45.660 --> 2:20:50.100]  been harping the last few years about U.S. cities becoming no-go zones and then there
[2:20:50.100 --> 2:20:53.940]  being a mass exodus and that being part of the plan to collapse the country.
[2:20:53.940 --> 2:20:59.060]  Explain to people what's been going on for those that may not know and then why the globalists
[2:20:59.060 --> 2:21:03.100]  would want that, because I know you're really well-versed on this and the way you break
[2:21:03.100 --> 2:21:08.100]  it down, I think's the best out there, so spend a few more minutes on that, please.
[2:21:08.100 --> 2:21:13.460]  Okay, sure, well, the supply chain failures are already feeding into this, but it's also,
[2:21:13.460 --> 2:21:17.020]  of course, high taxation in these cities causing a lot of people to flee.
[2:21:17.020 --> 2:21:23.340]  What they want is for productive citizens to be gone and the actual income earners and
[2:21:23.340 --> 2:21:27.420]  producers in cities to flee and that's happening right now.
[2:21:27.420 --> 2:21:32.460]  They're all moving to taxes or Arizona, places or Florida, places like that, because what
[2:21:32.460 --> 2:21:40.060]  they want left behind is a controllable, collapsed subclass of citizens who will vote the way
[2:21:40.060 --> 2:21:46.980]  Democrats want them to vote, but who have no ability to produce or to think for themselves
[2:21:46.980 --> 2:21:52.700]  or even to function in society and then in that criminal class system, which resembles
[2:21:52.700 --> 2:21:56.860]  a lot of third world nations, and by the way, you're seeing drive-by shootings now, executions
[2:21:56.860 --> 2:22:03.500]  on the streets of New York City, I think InfoWars covered that yesterday, then they have the
[2:22:03.500 --> 2:22:09.820]  perfect scenario for the child trafficking, the drug smuggling, the gun-running that Democrats
[2:22:09.820 --> 2:22:15.060]  routinely carry out as forms of fundraising and control of bribery and kickbacks for their
[2:22:15.060 --> 2:22:16.740]  political power.
[2:22:16.740 --> 2:22:22.700]  Once they control a key number of states, such as California, then they can conspire together
[2:22:22.700 --> 2:22:28.380]  as they're doing with the electoral college agreements to rig every future election.
[2:22:28.380 --> 2:22:33.260]  No matter what happens in the red states, the blue states have sufficient control to
[2:22:33.260 --> 2:22:35.460]  rig absolutely everything.
[2:22:35.460 --> 2:22:40.140]  So it all goes hand in hand with political power, also by the way, I should mention Newsom
[2:22:40.140 --> 2:22:45.180]  working with the Communist Chinese, having CCP influence throughout California, but also
[2:22:45.180 --> 2:22:53.180]  even as a military option for the landing of PLA troops on the coast of California, literally.
[2:22:53.180 --> 2:22:59.700]  And I almost, I need to apologize, I should have said this first, but the entire, I'm
[2:22:59.700 --> 2:23:03.980]  changing the topic just a little bit, but the entire situation with Russia in my view
[2:23:03.980 --> 2:23:11.460]  is designed to destroy U.S. military assets in a Russian counterattack in order to weaken
[2:23:11.460 --> 2:23:16.340]  the United States military at the same time vaccines are murdering active duty troops
[2:23:16.340 --> 2:23:19.660]  so that America is vulnerable to a Chinese invasion.
[2:23:19.660 --> 2:23:20.660]  Exactly.
[2:23:20.660 --> 2:23:21.660]  It's a two-front war.
[2:23:21.660 --> 2:23:25.140]  The globalists are getting ready by running our government in the ground to tie us down
[2:23:25.140 --> 2:23:30.260]  in Eastern Europe while China makes its move on Hong Kong, Taiwan, into the Philippines,
[2:23:30.260 --> 2:23:31.260]  into Northern Vietnam.
[2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:35.660]  Non, they claim control of, and with their operatives and then using the crime and the
[2:23:35.660 --> 2:23:40.540]  control of those fallen cities, they can use that basically as the launch point with our
[2:23:40.540 --> 2:23:45.180]  own corporate media saying it's a race war as the cover for the Chai comms to come in.
[2:23:45.180 --> 2:23:48.540]  And now you already have the Democrats saying we're going to have U.N. and U.N. troops and
[2:23:48.540 --> 2:23:53.500]  most of the U.N. troops are Chinese occupying the U.S. I mean, they're actually doing it.
[2:23:53.500 --> 2:23:55.260]  It's actually happening.
[2:23:55.260 --> 2:23:56.260]  You got it.
[2:23:56.260 --> 2:23:59.540]  And when the starvation gets so horrible in these cities, then they can claim there's
[2:23:59.540 --> 2:24:05.140]  a U.N. rescue mission that's going to be communist Chinese troops coming in to, quote,
[2:24:05.140 --> 2:24:06.140]  feed the people.
[2:24:06.140 --> 2:24:09.140]  And I want to be clear, Mike, you've been talking on my show for four or five years
[2:24:09.140 --> 2:24:10.900]  about this before anybody else.
[2:24:10.900 --> 2:24:11.900]  You saw this out long-term.
[2:24:11.900 --> 2:24:16.100]  I want to just say, I believe what you're saying, I know that's their plan.
[2:24:16.100 --> 2:24:18.020]  That's one of the main scenarios they want to get to.
[2:24:18.020 --> 2:24:20.540]  If they can't get to that point, they've got other plans.
[2:24:20.540 --> 2:24:21.700]  But I agree.
[2:24:21.700 --> 2:24:26.020]  What you just said is what all the facts show, this country is under World War III attack
[2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:30.580]  right now and we have traders that run the executive branch who can't make it too obvious
[2:24:30.580 --> 2:24:34.220]  till we fully collapse that they're working with the Chai comms trying to use a Russia
[2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:36.740]  war on our flank to distract us.
[2:24:36.740 --> 2:24:40.500]  Well, right, they know America can't fight a two-front war.
[2:24:40.500 --> 2:24:44.900]  And they also know that the longer they wait, the more servicemen and women will be murdered
[2:24:44.900 --> 2:24:48.580]  by the spike protein vaccines, thereby weakening the entire system.
[2:24:48.580 --> 2:24:54.380]  Don't forget about the U.S. submarine that we now believe was actually hit by a Chinese
[2:24:54.380 --> 2:24:58.140]  underwater drone or submarine from China.
[2:24:58.140 --> 2:25:03.100]  So this was a direct attack on the United States Navy in the underwater war and it
[2:25:03.100 --> 2:25:09.300]  shows that the U.S. Navy has insane vulnerabilities where they don't even know when they're being
[2:25:09.300 --> 2:25:13.100]  approached and touched by a Chinese weapons system.
[2:25:13.100 --> 2:25:17.340]  And if you look at the weapons superiority of Russia with its hypersonic missiles that
[2:25:17.340 --> 2:25:23.100]  are now very active, they just did a test, 400 kilometer range of a hypersonic missile
[2:25:23.100 --> 2:25:29.020]  striking its target, Alex, I'm sorry to say this, but the United States military, if they
[2:25:29.020 --> 2:25:33.100]  end up provoking some kind of response, a military response from Russia, which seems
[2:25:33.100 --> 2:25:35.020]  to be what they're trying to do.
[2:25:35.020 --> 2:25:42.180]  If Russia launches those hypersonic missiles, most U.S. military assets near Ukraine will
[2:25:42.180 --> 2:25:45.500]  be destroyed in under 15 minutes.
[2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:51.980]  And I mean that under 15 minutes, the entire future will change because then the U.S. will
[2:25:51.980 --> 2:25:54.340]  not be able to project power.
[2:25:54.340 --> 2:25:58.940]  And notice exactly Pearl Harbor on steroids, but notice ahead of that they purge the military
[2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:01.660]  with shots, with critical race theory.
[2:26:01.660 --> 2:26:06.140]  I mean, everything you do to take the country down they're doing, I mean, this is it.
[2:26:06.140 --> 2:26:08.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:26:08.060 --> 2:26:12.820]  And understand too that when the U.S. is perceived globally as being unable to project its military
[2:26:12.820 --> 2:26:19.700]  power, then of course the global recognition of the petrodollar status will collapse rapidly.
[2:26:19.700 --> 2:26:24.780]  Over 100 countries will instantly say, well, gosh, why should we agree to the petrodollar
[2:26:24.780 --> 2:26:29.420]  arrangement when the U.S. can't even protect its own military, assert power, withdraw from
[2:26:29.420 --> 2:26:30.540]  Afghanistan.
[2:26:30.540 --> 2:26:32.900]  The president is a dementia patient and so on.
[2:26:32.900 --> 2:26:33.900]  These are all designs.
[2:26:33.900 --> 2:26:34.900]  Exactly.
[2:26:34.900 --> 2:26:39.820]  All design, all scripted, blue cities, fentanyl, drag queen story time.
[2:26:39.820 --> 2:26:44.540]  The world is watching women bring their children into fat bloated pedophiles to put them on
[2:26:44.540 --> 2:26:45.540]  their laps.
[2:26:45.540 --> 2:26:46.660]  I mean, people see this.
[2:26:46.660 --> 2:26:51.300]  This is designed to destroy us for everyone to see us as sick and evil, instead of seeing
[2:26:51.300 --> 2:26:54.860]  those that are doing this to us as the enemy.
[2:26:54.860 --> 2:26:58.060]  And by the way, I know you have callers and I don't mind taking calls, by the way, if
[2:26:58.060 --> 2:27:00.580]  you want to get to those, especially in the next segment.
[2:27:00.580 --> 2:27:07.900]  And if you don't mind, I have an important message about a fellow liberty lover, a great
[2:27:07.900 --> 2:27:10.580]  person, Greg Caten.
[2:27:10.580 --> 2:27:12.660]  He's on life support, folks.
[2:27:12.660 --> 2:27:14.100]  He's had a severe heart attack.
[2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:18.980]  He's in a hospital in Ecuador and his family, they're going to be launching, I think, like
[2:27:18.980 --> 2:27:21.420]  a give send go fundraiser.
[2:27:21.420 --> 2:27:22.420]  Tell us about him.
[2:27:22.420 --> 2:27:23.420]  Absolutely.
[2:27:23.420 --> 2:27:24.420]  Tell us what happened.
[2:27:24.420 --> 2:27:27.620]  Well, he, he, he suffered a severe four hour heart attack.
[2:27:27.620 --> 2:27:28.980]  I spoke with his family today.
[2:27:28.980 --> 2:27:31.540]  You know, he's a, he's a wonderful person.
[2:27:31.540 --> 2:27:35.460]  He's, he's been preaching the awakening and he's been exposing the deep state globally.
[2:27:35.460 --> 2:27:39.500]  I interviewed him, I think four months ago and I put that up on my site.
[2:27:39.500 --> 2:27:41.100]  He did not take the vaccine.
[2:27:41.100 --> 2:27:45.300]  There is no foul play suspected, but you know, he's, he's a wonderful person.
[2:27:45.300 --> 2:27:51.340]  He's a, he's a gem for humanity and he, he's right on the edge right now and he may not
[2:27:51.340 --> 2:27:52.340]  make it.
[2:27:52.340 --> 2:27:56.020]  His heart is destroyed and we're not sure how we're going to bring him back from that.
[2:27:56.020 --> 2:28:01.260]  So your prayers are certainly needed folks and thank you, Alex, for allowing me to, to
[2:28:01.260 --> 2:28:02.260]  share that.
[2:28:02.260 --> 2:28:03.260]  Well, that's another subject.
[2:28:03.260 --> 2:28:07.220]  General Flynn and others said that they've got simulant spike protein that's spreading
[2:28:07.220 --> 2:28:12.220]  everywhere and then now that's confirmed that Fauci developed that in 2017, tried to
[2:28:12.220 --> 2:28:13.220]  sell to the Pentagon.
[2:28:13.220 --> 2:28:14.460]  They said no way.
[2:28:14.460 --> 2:28:19.420]  I mean, that's really what's going on here with massive increases in heart attacks, even
[2:28:19.420 --> 2:28:21.820]  in those that haven't been injected.
[2:28:21.820 --> 2:28:25.540]  Well I know, and, and I've heard from so many people who, who have been attacked as speakers
[2:28:25.540 --> 2:28:31.160]  at many of these public events and not, you know, I've spoken at some and I got symptomatic
[2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:32.160]  after those events.
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:37.020]  Other people have become very, very sick after, after being exposed to the, what, what you've
[2:28:37.020 --> 2:28:41.420]  said, it's aerosol, aerosolized skin penetrating toxic nanoparticles.
[2:28:41.420 --> 2:28:44.620]  There's a bio weapons attack happening across America right now.
[2:28:44.620 --> 2:28:49.620]  We're going to come back and get into the future of crypto and then your phone calls
[2:28:49.620 --> 2:28:56.660]  with Mike Adams and so much more info wars.com tomorrow's news today.

[2:29:14.900 --> 2:29:17.940]  agenda so we can stop it dead in its tracks.

[2:29:38.020 --> 2:29:39.500]  new world order.
[2:29:39.500 --> 2:29:41.180]  So I want to thank you all for your past support.

[2:29:52.500 --> 2:29:53.660]  maybe a few days.

[2:29:58.420 --> 2:30:07.300]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[2:30:07.300 --> 2:30:12.460]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[2:30:12.460 --> 2:30:13.460]  in place.
[2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:18.940]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[2:30:18.940 --> 2:30:24.460]  It is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[2:30:24.460 --> 2:30:27.260]  faces from the light of the sun.
[2:30:27.260 --> 2:30:35.540]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[2:30:35.540 --> 2:30:41.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now, the entire future destiny of humanity
[2:30:41.900 --> 2:30:42.900]  is upon us.
[2:30:42.900 --> 2:30:46.860]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they are coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[2:30:46.860 --> 2:30:49.660]  the world ID and carbon taxes.
[2:30:49.660 --> 2:30:54.420]  Things only get worse from here if we submit, they only get better if we resist and say
[2:30:54.420 --> 2:30:55.420]  no.
[2:30:55.420 --> 2:30:58.060]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[2:30:58.060 --> 2:31:03.580]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:31:03.580 --> 2:31:09.260]  Most the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[2:31:09.260 --> 2:31:13.500]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:31:13.500 --> 2:31:18.620]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[2:31:18.620 --> 2:31:23.460]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:31:23.460 --> 2:31:27.900]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[2:31:27.900 --> 2:31:32.180]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[2:31:32.180 --> 2:31:35.900]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:31:35.900 --> 2:31:39.260]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:31:39.260 --> 2:31:43.900]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[2:31:43.900 --> 2:31:44.900]  an end.
[2:31:44.900 --> 2:31:50.260]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[2:31:50.260 --> 2:31:58.380]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.

[2:32:59.180 --> 2:33:05.020]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:05.020 --> 2:33:21.020]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:21.020 --> 2:33:27.420]  There's a big article up on infowars.com.
[2:33:27.420 --> 2:33:32.660]  General Flynn's prediction comes true of the globalist triggering a worldwide financial
[2:33:32.660 --> 2:33:35.620]  collapse to bring in their agenda.
[2:33:35.620 --> 2:33:36.820]  Mike Adams is our guest.
[2:33:36.820 --> 2:33:40.780]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[2:33:40.780 --> 2:33:43.940]  But Mike, getting into crypto, again, you and I believe in it.
[2:33:43.940 --> 2:33:45.300]  We want alternative systems.
[2:33:45.300 --> 2:33:49.380]  It's great, but it's also been a while while West and it's been connected to some of the
[2:33:49.380 --> 2:33:53.580]  things that are happening with the Chinese housing market.
[2:33:53.580 --> 2:33:56.740]  Give folks your concerns that you privately gave me a week ago.
[2:33:56.740 --> 2:33:58.820]  Well, thank you for clarifying.
[2:33:58.820 --> 2:34:06.980]  I am 100% pro-crypto and we need a decentralized non-Federal Reserve run system that promotes
[2:34:06.980 --> 2:34:08.740]  freedom.
[2:34:08.740 --> 2:34:13.740]  What we're seeing though right now is that there are a couple of methods of attack on
[2:34:13.740 --> 2:34:17.780]  the crypto ecosystem that can discredit it.
[2:34:17.780 --> 2:34:23.900]  These modes are being, I think, run by a globalist central bank interest because what they
[2:34:23.900 --> 2:34:27.860]  want is a digital wallet system, of course, that they control.
[2:34:27.860 --> 2:34:30.340]  And you've covered this a thousand times.
[2:34:30.340 --> 2:34:34.140]  Once you have, let's say, Fedcoin or something like that, some digital wallet from the Federal
[2:34:34.140 --> 2:34:36.620]  Reserve, then they have social credit scores.
[2:34:36.620 --> 2:34:38.100]  It's a vaccine passport.
[2:34:38.100 --> 2:34:39.540]  They could cut off your expenditures.
[2:34:39.540 --> 2:34:40.580]  They can automatically tax you.
[2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:43.020]  They can have negative interest rates, all those things.
[2:34:43.020 --> 2:34:47.300]  So crypto outside that system is what needs to succeed in order for us to have freedom
[2:34:47.300 --> 2:34:48.380]  and liberty.
[2:34:48.380 --> 2:34:55.020]  The concern, and this is what ties into Evergrande, is that certain popular stable coins in the
[2:34:55.020 --> 2:35:00.260]  ecosystem, and I'm not going to mention any names because I'm not trying to throw anything
[2:35:00.260 --> 2:35:05.980]  at any one company, but that some of these stable coins had a lot of Evergrande paper.
[2:35:05.980 --> 2:35:10.060]  And thus, with Evergrande in default, there could be tens of billions of dollars of really
[2:35:10.060 --> 2:35:13.580]  collapsed assets held by the stable coins.
[2:35:13.580 --> 2:35:18.900]  And that that needs to be addressed, and since one of the most prominent stable coin companies
[2:35:18.900 --> 2:35:24.340]  has not submitted to any kind of legitimate audit yet, there's a lot of concern.
[2:35:24.340 --> 2:35:30.300]  And what everybody who's pro-crypto wants to see is a true free market system that's
[2:35:30.300 --> 2:35:36.900]  100% honest that people can trust so that we can take crypto into the future and make
[2:35:36.900 --> 2:35:41.460]  it so mainstream that the Federal Reserve and the central banks will never have a chance
[2:35:41.460 --> 2:35:42.460]  for the future.
[2:35:42.460 --> 2:35:48.900]  And the people's digital money, in essence, but the system has to be kind of cleaned up.
[2:35:48.900 --> 2:35:52.460]  There has to be really more rigorous standards in this system.
[2:35:52.460 --> 2:35:53.460]  Well, that's right.
[2:35:53.460 --> 2:35:56.700]  If we don't police ourselves, that's the American model.
[2:35:56.700 --> 2:36:00.180]  If we don't police ourselves, somebody else will, and obviously the systems letting us
[2:36:00.180 --> 2:36:05.780]  all be wall-wall-west to give it a bad name later than bring in their system using blockchain
[2:36:05.780 --> 2:36:11.700]  for control, I'd rather see dozens of independent currencies that are built on credibility and
[2:36:11.700 --> 2:36:16.340]  that also give us privacy and portability and real ability to have commerce.
[2:36:16.340 --> 2:36:17.340]  We need this.
[2:36:17.340 --> 2:36:23.340]  It's an amazing technology, but, again, we can't endorse bad examples of it because
[2:36:23.340 --> 2:36:27.820]  then it'll be used to basically radiate politically the entire technology.
[2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:28.820]  Well, right.
[2:36:28.820 --> 2:36:33.020]  And I think a lot of these meme coins that are just kind of get-rich-quick schemes are
[2:36:33.020 --> 2:36:38.940]  really discrediting the long-term utility of this transactional system and the entire
[2:36:38.940 --> 2:36:39.940]  blockchain technology.
[2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:43.180]  They have currencies outside of government and corporate control that are independent.
[2:36:43.180 --> 2:36:45.940]  I don't like the pump-and-dump aspect.
[2:36:45.940 --> 2:36:48.700]  I don't like, no, I want the utility.
[2:36:48.700 --> 2:36:50.220]  I'm right with you.
[2:36:50.220 --> 2:36:56.060]  The most successful and most widely accepted crypto would be one that is entirely stable.
[2:36:56.060 --> 2:36:57.060]  It's not speculative.
[2:36:57.060 --> 2:36:59.060]  It doesn't go through booms and busts.
[2:36:59.060 --> 2:37:03.020]  It's just kind of boring, which is what merchants need.
[2:37:03.020 --> 2:37:07.300]  For you to accept, even in your own store, Alex, for you to accept crypto right now,
[2:37:07.300 --> 2:37:12.660]  you're taking some kind of a risk that you accept, let's say, Bitcoin and Bitcoin could
[2:37:12.660 --> 2:37:16.100]  rise or fall 15% in one hour.
[2:37:16.100 --> 2:37:20.700]  That's a merchant risk that if we can eliminate that risk with some real stability, then more
[2:37:20.700 --> 2:37:23.380]  merchants are going to come on board and accept all of this.
[2:37:23.380 --> 2:37:28.780]  And then we can really begin to, let's say, overthrow their traditional payment system
[2:37:28.780 --> 2:37:30.860]  that's a control grid.
[2:37:30.860 --> 2:37:35.100]  So this is the big news on this, and I hope we see some cleaning up.
[2:37:35.100 --> 2:37:39.460]  And by the way, crypto, even think about in the future, could it be backed by other physical
[2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:40.460]  things?
[2:37:40.460 --> 2:37:45.060]  Could there be crypto backed by gold or silver or oil or even food output?
[2:37:45.060 --> 2:37:49.220]  What if there was like a farming co-op crypto that's backed by actual food like you can
[2:37:49.220 --> 2:37:50.220]  trade coins for food?
[2:37:50.220 --> 2:37:51.220]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[2:37:51.220 --> 2:37:55.820]  And then you get real farmers and real certification and real organics, and then your money actually
[2:37:55.820 --> 2:37:57.340]  helps create a good environment.
[2:37:57.340 --> 2:37:58.340]  Yeah.
[2:37:58.340 --> 2:38:00.940]  I mean, think about in that kind of a system, and I don't know if anything like that exists.
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:03.340]  I kind of doubt it, but maybe someone will create one.
[2:38:03.340 --> 2:38:06.660]  You're kind of like buying future food output.
[2:38:06.660 --> 2:38:07.780]  And who wouldn't want to do that?
[2:38:07.780 --> 2:38:13.340]  Who wouldn't want to bank on future food or future oil for that matter or future gold
[2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:14.340]  mining or whatever?
[2:38:14.340 --> 2:38:15.340]  But people need.
[2:38:15.340 --> 2:38:19.060]  I was about to say, that's what the globalists are doing is trying to cut off all money for
[2:38:19.060 --> 2:38:24.300]  oil and gas exploration and coal so that even if governments don't ban it, no one will get
[2:38:24.300 --> 2:38:25.300]  a loan for it.
[2:38:25.300 --> 2:38:26.980]  That will cause billions to die, they estimate.
[2:38:26.980 --> 2:38:30.540]  That will collapse civilization, but that's what they're doing.
[2:38:30.540 --> 2:38:32.020]  Well, that's exactly what they're doing.
[2:38:32.020 --> 2:38:36.060]  And as you know very well, the ultimate goal is to collapse every system of freedom.
[2:38:36.060 --> 2:38:38.780]  They've already done it with big tech collapsing free speech.
[2:38:38.780 --> 2:38:40.980]  They want to collapse financial freedom.
[2:38:40.980 --> 2:38:42.180]  They want to end cash.
[2:38:42.180 --> 2:38:46.540]  They want to suck you into their system of total digital wallet control.
[2:38:46.540 --> 2:38:50.260]  And from there, then no one can fight back against tyranny because once they can track
[2:38:50.260 --> 2:38:56.420]  all your purchases and assets, then good luck stockpiling AMO at that point, they just won't
[2:38:56.420 --> 2:38:57.420]  allow it.
[2:38:57.420 --> 2:39:03.220]  They'll have an AMO purchase limit of 100 rounds a month or something, which in Texas,
[2:39:03.220 --> 2:39:07.580]  that's only like the warm-up round on Saturday afternoon at the range.
[2:39:07.580 --> 2:39:09.180]  We make larger AMO purchases.
[2:39:09.180 --> 2:39:13.260]  So this gives them total surveillance and control of every level of society.
[2:39:13.260 --> 2:39:17.060]  The whole cashless society social credit score is their holy grail.
[2:39:17.060 --> 2:39:18.060]  It is the tyrant's dream.
[2:39:18.060 --> 2:39:19.060]  We must stop it.
[2:39:19.060 --> 2:39:20.660]  Let's take calls for Mike Adams.
[2:39:20.660 --> 2:39:22.540]  Let's talk to Mike in New York.
[2:39:22.540 --> 2:39:24.300]  Mike in New York, thanks for holding.
[2:39:24.300 --> 2:39:25.300]  Welcome.
[2:39:25.300 --> 2:39:31.060]  Hey, guys, Mike, Alex, love you guys, praying for you, Alex, you're doing a great job.
[2:39:31.060 --> 2:39:32.060]  Thank you, brother.
[2:39:32.060 --> 2:39:37.300]  I just wanted to say, I'm in the globalist hell here in New York City.
[2:39:37.300 --> 2:39:38.300]  You were here recently.
[2:39:38.300 --> 2:39:39.700]  You see what's going on here.
[2:39:39.700 --> 2:39:43.460]  People are out of their minds.
[2:39:43.460 --> 2:39:48.340]  Now we got this tyrant, DeBlasio, who's only got a few weeks left in office, and he thinks
[2:39:48.340 --> 2:39:54.020]  he's going to leave us with some parting shots by giving a five-year-old vaccine mandate
[2:39:54.020 --> 2:39:55.900]  out of control.
[2:39:55.900 --> 2:40:02.860]  And we need to do this mass non-compliance and fight back and get away from this stuff.
[2:40:02.860 --> 2:40:03.860]  I totally agree.
[2:40:03.860 --> 2:40:08.620]  And again, it's globalist cities around the world that are following the UN directive.
[2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:12.540]  This is such an example of what the UN calls communalization, Mike Adams.
[2:40:12.540 --> 2:40:17.220]  Well, this is, you know, they try it first in Australia and New Zealand.
[2:40:17.220 --> 2:40:21.140]  And when they get away with it there, it goes to Governor Hochul of New York, and then she
[2:40:21.140 --> 2:40:25.140]  rolls something out that's totally crazy, and then Newsom picks it up, and then they're
[2:40:25.140 --> 2:40:28.140]  going to try to bleed those policies into middle America.
[2:40:28.140 --> 2:40:30.820]  So your caller's absolutely right, Mike.
[2:40:30.820 --> 2:40:34.220]  It's time to peacefully stand up, resist this, and just say absolutely no.
[2:40:34.220 --> 2:40:35.220]  Say no.
[2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:41.260]  These are the blue cities, totally weaponized, like suicide bombers, their politicians, blowing
[2:40:41.260 --> 2:40:44.860]  them up and blowing their citizens up to try to bring down the rest of the country.
[2:40:44.860 --> 2:40:45.860]  This is war.
[2:40:45.860 --> 2:40:47.380]  Mike, thank you so much for the call.
[2:40:47.380 --> 2:40:48.380]  Thanks for holding.
[2:40:48.380 --> 2:40:52.420]  Let's talk to Savannah in Pennsylvania, Savannah, you're on the air.
[2:40:52.420 --> 2:40:53.420]  Yes.
[2:40:53.420 --> 2:40:54.420]  Hi, Alex.
[2:40:54.420 --> 2:41:01.300]  I wanted to talk to you about an incident that we had on Sunday at a CVS here in Pittsburgh
[2:41:01.300 --> 2:41:02.300]  area.
[2:41:02.300 --> 2:41:06.540]  I took my son, he was a little bit sick, nothing big.
[2:41:06.540 --> 2:41:11.340]  So we're sitting there waiting for a prescription, and there's like all these little areas set
[2:41:11.340 --> 2:41:13.540]  up for people who have just gotten their vaccine.
[2:41:13.540 --> 2:41:17.220]  There's like a 15 minute waiting period where you have to be observed.
[2:41:17.220 --> 2:41:20.980]  They had all these kids there with their parents.
[2:41:20.980 --> 2:41:29.260]  It was insane that you can go to a CVS, get a vaccine, that's not a vaccine.
[2:41:29.260 --> 2:41:34.180]  Have to be sit there and wait and observe for 15 minutes.
[2:41:34.180 --> 2:41:36.780]  Like meanwhile, nobody was actually observing the kids.
[2:41:36.780 --> 2:41:40.060]  They're just sitting there on their parent phones or something.
[2:41:40.060 --> 2:41:44.580]  And this pharmacist is like administering these vaccines that nobody knows about.
[2:41:44.580 --> 2:41:49.020]  Well, like why doesn't a doctor have to administer these vaccines?
[2:41:49.020 --> 2:41:50.020]  What is a pharmacist?
[2:41:50.020 --> 2:41:54.380]  Oh, notice the doctors won't do it because deals were done with big pharma and then only
[2:41:54.380 --> 2:41:56.100]  a few box stores to do it.
[2:41:56.100 --> 2:41:58.020]  That's a very telling point, Mike Adams.
[2:41:58.020 --> 2:42:01.500]  Why don't doctors give you the vaccine like they always did?
[2:42:01.500 --> 2:42:05.220]  Well this reminds me of that original Star Trek episode where there was a simulated war
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:09.140]  and if you died in the simulation, you had to physically show up for the euthanasia chamber.
[2:42:09.140 --> 2:42:10.380]  Remember that episode?
[2:42:10.380 --> 2:42:11.540]  And that's what's happening.
[2:42:11.540 --> 2:42:17.820]  These pharmacies are being turned into euthanasia centers and this is the Holocaust of 2020.
[2:42:17.820 --> 2:42:23.220]  The vaccine Holocaust right in front of our eyes, the caller just described it.
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:26.460]  And Mike, why did they have, stay there, Saman, I'm coming back to a final comment
[2:42:26.460 --> 2:42:30.100]  from you next segment if you got more to say.
[2:42:30.100 --> 2:42:31.100]  This is a question for the break.
[2:42:31.100 --> 2:42:33.660]  We'll come back and get Mike's take on this and I'll give you mine.
[2:42:33.660 --> 2:42:39.780]  Why did they bake into it 22 months ago, Gates said, oh, you'll need six, seven shots a year.
[2:42:39.780 --> 2:42:41.100]  And then now they admit that.
[2:42:41.100 --> 2:42:42.780]  Why was it always a bunch of shots?
[2:42:42.780 --> 2:42:46.660]  Why did they give you one right up front and just mess you up with the dose?
[2:42:46.660 --> 2:42:50.300]  Is it like fun to watch you submit over and over again or they might make more money off
[2:42:50.300 --> 2:42:51.300]  of that?
[2:42:51.300 --> 2:42:52.380]  Or why is that?
[2:42:52.380 --> 2:42:56.900]  We'll talk about it straight ahead and stay with us.
[2:42:56.900 --> 2:43:01.380]  For a fraction of the call, Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our
[2:43:01.380 --> 2:43:03.860]  amazing listeners and viewers.
[2:43:03.860 --> 2:43:09.180]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special.
[2:43:09.180 --> 2:43:13.060]  It's the 1776 founder coin.
[2:43:13.060 --> 2:43:14.860]  You've got to see this coin for yourself.
[2:43:14.860 --> 2:43:24.380]  It's at 1776coin.com and this coin makes you a founding member of a very exciting group
[2:43:24.380 --> 2:43:28.260]  of projects that we're going to be launching in the very new future.
[2:43:28.260 --> 2:43:30.500]  Become a founding member today.

[2:43:42.820 --> 2:43:45.020]  the globalist new world order.
[2:43:45.020 --> 2:43:49.020]  That's why you're called a founding member because the funding from this is going to
[2:43:49.020 --> 2:43:54.180]  go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people
[2:43:54.180 --> 2:44:19.180]  to take free speech in the face of censoring
[2:44:19.180 --> 2:44:37.860]  and
[2:44:37.860 --> 2:44:42.580]  The evidence is overwhelming and out in the open, we really deserve what's happened to
[2:44:42.580 --> 2:44:43.580]  us.
[2:44:43.580 --> 2:44:50.220]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[2:44:50.220 --> 2:44:54.060]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[2:44:54.060 --> 2:44:58.260]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[2:44:58.260 --> 2:45:01.100]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:45:01.100 --> 2:45:05.460]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:45:05.460 --> 2:45:11.380]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[2:45:11.380 --> 2:45:15.060]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[2:45:15.060 --> 2:45:20.020]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:45:20.020 --> 2:45:24.220]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[2:45:24.220 --> 2:45:27.860]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:45:27.860 --> 2:45:31.100]  That's why everybody should visit infowarsstore.com.

[2:46:03.500 --> 2:46:04.860]  I like going to play golf.
[2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:06.260]  I like going out to dinner.
[2:46:06.260 --> 2:46:08.300]  I like the metropolitan life.
[2:46:08.300 --> 2:46:10.740]  I like everything that comes with this.
[2:46:10.740 --> 2:46:16.820]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities,
[2:46:16.820 --> 2:46:21.420]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's
[2:46:21.420 --> 2:46:22.420]  all crashing down.
[2:46:22.420 --> 2:46:24.700]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[2:46:24.700 --> 2:46:28.260]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the
[2:46:28.260 --> 2:46:30.660]  emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[2:46:30.660 --> 2:46:31.900]  That's the survival instinct.
[2:46:31.900 --> 2:46:35.740]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no,
[2:46:35.740 --> 2:46:36.820]  no, no, no, no.
[2:46:36.820 --> 2:46:37.820]  Stay in the city.
[2:46:37.820 --> 2:46:41.020]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you
[2:46:41.020 --> 2:46:42.820]  need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[2:46:42.820 --> 2:46:48.300]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[2:46:48.300 --> 2:46:49.300]  as well.
[2:46:49.300 --> 2:46:53.900]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[2:46:53.900 --> 2:46:59.340]  And so we have the best ones at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:46:59.340 --> 2:47:26.460]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:30.700]  You know, Mike Adams, don't take a few final calls here with you, go back to Savannah and
[2:47:30.700 --> 2:47:32.460]  then beefy and others.
[2:47:32.460 --> 2:47:36.700]  But there is a paradox here in that you're awake, you're involved, you're ready, you
[2:47:36.700 --> 2:47:38.980]  knew it was coming.
[2:47:38.980 --> 2:47:44.460]  But then the general public with just the culture and the cell phones and the way everybody's
[2:47:44.460 --> 2:47:49.860]  memories are broken up and the way people can't communicate, I mean, really it is kind
[2:47:49.860 --> 2:47:51.100]  of a psychological test.
[2:47:51.100 --> 2:47:55.020]  If the public doesn't say no to this, it's not that they deserve to die, but they are
[2:47:55.020 --> 2:47:56.900]  going to die.
[2:47:56.900 --> 2:48:01.820]  And so I notice people can't follow through on tasks.
[2:48:01.820 --> 2:48:04.900]  They can't remember two or three things in a row.
[2:48:04.900 --> 2:48:10.100]  And I don't think of myself as super smart, but I know some of the globalists, they're
[2:48:10.100 --> 2:48:11.460]  like horrible pedophiles.
[2:48:11.460 --> 2:48:14.620]  So it's not like they have a right to rule and kill everybody, but they're predators
[2:48:14.620 --> 2:48:19.740]  and they see the weakness of the public and they can't help it.
[2:48:19.740 --> 2:48:22.460]  And so paradoxically, how do we deal with that?
[2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:26.260]  Because we don't want to join the globalist and help kill everybody, but at the same time
[2:48:26.260 --> 2:48:29.820]  the general public doesn't even want to help themselves.
[2:48:29.820 --> 2:48:34.540]  There is a mass calling and we can't stop it.
[2:48:34.540 --> 2:48:39.620]  And you know this, I know this, all we can do is survive it and then get to the other
[2:48:39.620 --> 2:48:45.140]  side and hope that with the right people, the right allies and with God on our side
[2:48:45.140 --> 2:48:51.580]  that we can defeat the globalist, defeat the evil and then build America up from the collapse.
[2:48:51.580 --> 2:48:59.460]  And the world in the light of freedom, frankly, I mean God's light, the light of truth.
[2:48:59.460 --> 2:49:06.060]  And so doing this, we have to understand that there is a neurological attack, the spike
[2:49:06.060 --> 2:49:11.580]  protein is damaging brains, the loss of cognitive function is in fact one of the vectors of
[2:49:11.580 --> 2:49:13.220]  attack and you're right.
[2:49:13.220 --> 2:49:18.460]  People can't do tasks, their memories are failing, they can't do math anymore, these
[2:49:18.460 --> 2:49:23.100]  people that are taking the vaccine, they're suffering also micro blood clots in their
[2:49:23.100 --> 2:49:26.140]  brains that's causing a loss of cognitive function.
[2:49:26.140 --> 2:49:32.340]  If you interact with anybody in a bank or in any company, almost it seems like a customer
[2:49:32.340 --> 2:49:37.780]  service person, they often don't have the cognitive capabilities they once had.
[2:49:37.780 --> 2:49:42.500]  And you know this as an employer, it's very hard to employ people, especially for example
[2:49:42.500 --> 2:49:46.660]  in warehouse or fulfillment operations that we both run.
[2:49:46.660 --> 2:49:51.620]  It's very difficult to get somebody who can do that task, I mean just pack a box, count
[2:49:51.620 --> 2:49:55.180]  products, drive a forklift, it's very difficult now.
[2:49:55.180 --> 2:50:01.780]  So we're going to suffer a cultural cognitive collapse followed by mass death and to answer
[2:50:01.780 --> 2:50:05.420]  the question that you asked before the break, the reason they're stretching this out over
[2:50:05.420 --> 2:50:13.180]  so many vaccines is because they want to milk the profits while they're killing people slowly.
[2:50:13.180 --> 2:50:17.060]  They also didn't want to kill people too quickly because people would notice, I think they
[2:50:17.060 --> 2:50:21.900]  messed up, they became overzealous, it's killing far more people early on than what they wanted
[2:50:21.900 --> 2:50:23.940]  so they have to use the media to cover it up.
[2:50:23.940 --> 2:50:28.500]  But they wanted this to take about 8 shots or 10 shots to actually kill people.
[2:50:28.500 --> 2:50:29.500]  That's their plan.
[2:50:29.500 --> 2:50:33.420]  And that's why Gates said almost 2 years ago, oh don't worry you'll get 6, 7, 8 shots a
[2:50:33.420 --> 2:50:34.420]  year and giggled.
[2:50:34.420 --> 2:50:38.140]  He said we've got to help you in like 3 videos, he touches his heart.
[2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:41.060]  We've got to help you, help you.
[2:50:41.060 --> 2:50:43.260]  He's so sick.
[2:50:43.260 --> 2:50:45.500]  Oh no question about it.
[2:50:45.500 --> 2:50:48.260]  And remember, Alex they've already succeeded.
[2:50:48.260 --> 2:50:54.460]  So from here forward as this plays out, even if every vaccine were stopped right now, they've
[2:50:54.460 --> 2:50:59.540]  already killed at least a billion people, maybe a couple of billion by the time you add
[2:50:59.540 --> 2:51:03.620]  in the war and the economic collapse and the poverty and starvation and everything else.
[2:51:03.620 --> 2:51:07.820]  So they've already done at least a lot of the damage they wanted to do, now we're just
[2:51:07.820 --> 2:51:09.300]  watching the dominoes fall.
[2:51:09.300 --> 2:51:12.100]  We can't stop that.
[2:51:12.100 --> 2:51:13.300]  The dominoes are already falling.
[2:51:13.300 --> 2:51:16.580]  They admit all over the western world, double the death this year, last year.
[2:51:16.580 --> 2:51:21.020]  Last year it was exaggerated, you know, now it's just everywhere and it's the vaccinated
[2:51:21.020 --> 2:51:26.860]  dying and the vaccinated can't admit they've been lied to, they just keep agreeing with
[2:51:26.860 --> 2:51:27.860]  it.
[2:51:27.860 --> 2:51:29.340]  Well, right.
[2:51:29.340 --> 2:51:31.660]  And they will say that all the way to their deaths.
[2:51:31.660 --> 2:51:35.700]  They will think that even as they're dying, they'll probably tell themselves gosh dying
[2:51:35.700 --> 2:51:37.740]  would have been worse if I hadn't been vaccinated.
[2:51:37.740 --> 2:51:42.220]  You know, some, some crazy thing like, Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a woman vaccinated both
[2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:44.460]  her parents and they both died right after.
[2:51:44.460 --> 2:51:48.380]  And she said, well, they had better deaths because of this.
[2:51:48.380 --> 2:51:49.380]  Right.
[2:51:49.380 --> 2:51:51.500]  No, it's, it's completely insane.
[2:51:51.500 --> 2:51:53.220]  They're, they're indoctrinated.
[2:51:53.220 --> 2:51:59.300]  Look, what the recent poll, 80% or so, four out of five Democrats would gladly wear masks
[2:51:59.300 --> 2:52:02.700]  indoors forever if told to do so.
[2:52:02.700 --> 2:52:05.820]  What kind of obedience cult is that?
[2:52:05.820 --> 2:52:07.140]  And do they do those?
[2:52:07.140 --> 2:52:10.940]  Do people who operate that way really have any hope of surviving this?
[2:52:10.940 --> 2:52:12.420]  And the answer is no.
[2:52:12.420 --> 2:52:13.420]  Not at all.
[2:52:13.420 --> 2:52:14.420]  No, they don't.
[2:52:14.420 --> 2:52:17.660]  Well, but then you subconsciously they associate their power with the system.
[2:52:17.660 --> 2:52:19.580]  So they like making everyone wear it.
[2:52:19.580 --> 2:52:20.780]  They like the power.
[2:52:20.780 --> 2:52:24.020]  They feel like they're part of it, even though they're being abused by it.
[2:52:24.020 --> 2:52:32.380]  Uh, Savannah, anything else you'd like to add as she was giving them injections and
[2:52:32.380 --> 2:52:34.940]  she's like, Oh, we're doing our part.
[2:52:34.940 --> 2:52:36.220]  Like we're all in this together.
[2:52:36.220 --> 2:52:38.460]  Like it takes a village and like, I hate that thing.
[2:52:38.460 --> 2:52:40.300]  Like it takes a village because guess what?
[2:52:40.300 --> 2:52:44.740]  The village is crazy and I want them as far away from me and my family as possible.
[2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:47.420]  Like it's just not, it's not funny anymore.
[2:52:47.420 --> 2:52:51.420]  And so those are just joined as you and a CBS this weekend watching them inject her
[2:52:51.420 --> 2:52:54.940]  body while you're getting a prescription.
[2:52:54.940 --> 2:52:57.020]  And exactly we're doing this to end it.
[2:52:57.020 --> 2:52:58.420]  We're doing it to stop it.
[2:52:58.420 --> 2:53:01.380]  No, your compliance is what makes it go on forever.
[2:53:01.380 --> 2:53:06.020]  So like my eight year old son, my eight year old son, he gives me a hug and he's like,
[2:53:06.020 --> 2:53:09.900]  Oh, don't keep people know that the shop killed people.
[2:53:09.900 --> 2:53:10.900]  Wow.
[2:53:10.900 --> 2:53:14.820]  And I'm like, I don't know.
[2:53:14.820 --> 2:53:17.380]  I don't know how they can at this point.
[2:53:17.380 --> 2:53:20.820]  Well thank God your son's got a parent that'll warn them because you know, I've had guests
[2:53:20.820 --> 2:53:23.140]  on the say, what do you do with your children?
[2:53:23.140 --> 2:53:24.580]  I mean, you tell them.
[2:53:24.580 --> 2:53:29.380]  I mean, just like you tell your child, child 5,000 years ago, Hey, you know, don't go out
[2:53:29.380 --> 2:53:30.380]  at night.
[2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:31.380]  The wolves might eat you by the barn.
[2:53:31.380 --> 2:53:33.300]  I mean, you're not scaring them.
[2:53:33.300 --> 2:53:34.780]  You're telling them don't go out at night.
[2:53:34.780 --> 2:53:39.060]  Just the fire, there's wolves out there or, you know, I'm, you know, or look, don't go
[2:53:39.060 --> 2:53:40.060]  to the edge of the cave.
[2:53:40.060 --> 2:53:41.580]  A saber tooth cat might eat you.
[2:53:41.580 --> 2:53:42.580]  You're not scaring your child.
[2:53:42.580 --> 2:53:43.580]  You're telling the truth.
[2:53:43.580 --> 2:53:44.580]  Thank you, Savannah.
[2:53:44.580 --> 2:53:45.580]  Mike.
[2:53:45.580 --> 2:53:46.580]  Well, yeah.
[2:53:46.580 --> 2:53:50.780]  And I would say that the children that are being homeschooled and raised by parents like
[2:53:50.780 --> 2:53:55.860]  Savannah, these are these are the future of the human race, frankly, those on the other
[2:53:55.860 --> 2:54:00.380]  side, those who are taking the vaccines, if they survive the spike protein themselves,
[2:54:00.380 --> 2:54:04.940]  they will become infertile and they, they will remove themselves from the human gene
[2:54:04.940 --> 2:54:05.940]  pool.
[2:54:05.940 --> 2:54:11.260]  So this is a pivotal point, a big change in the future of human civilization.
[2:54:11.260 --> 2:54:15.700]  And if there's any silver lining to it, not that we hope anybody dies from this, but there's
[2:54:15.700 --> 2:54:17.100]  any silver lining.
[2:54:17.100 --> 2:54:21.980]  It's that those psychotic mass obedience will be the first to go.
[2:54:21.980 --> 2:54:22.980]  Just bluntly stated.
[2:54:22.980 --> 2:54:28.820]  Well, historically, we know that evil get in line, destroy themselves beefy in Virginia.
[2:54:28.820 --> 2:54:30.980]  You're on the air with Mike Adams.
[2:54:30.980 --> 2:54:31.980]  Go ahead.
[2:54:31.980 --> 2:54:32.980]  Alex.
[2:54:32.980 --> 2:54:33.980]  Can you hear me, sir?
[2:54:33.980 --> 2:54:34.980]  I can beefy.
[2:54:34.980 --> 2:54:35.980]  Go ahead.
[2:54:35.980 --> 2:54:36.980]  Yeah.
[2:54:36.980 --> 2:54:40.420]  I want to, I want to be quick because I would like to hear one of your, your famous outros
[2:54:40.420 --> 2:54:42.900]  as a, as you get out of here today.
[2:54:42.900 --> 2:54:46.980]  You know, I've, I also want to say thank you for telling us the truth when no one else
[2:54:46.980 --> 2:54:47.980]  will.
[2:54:47.980 --> 2:54:53.140]  Um, you know, every, everyone has to respect that, you know, but, uh, I mean, I'm just
[2:54:53.140 --> 2:54:54.140]  trying to survive, brother.
[2:54:54.140 --> 2:54:55.140]  That's the truth.
[2:54:55.140 --> 2:54:56.820]  It's going to get us out of this.
[2:54:56.820 --> 2:54:59.260]  You know, on, on the topic of the vaccinations, right?
[2:54:59.260 --> 2:55:02.740]  The reason I'm calling is to tell you about this and ask you a quick question.
[2:55:02.740 --> 2:55:09.100]  Uh, my dad was forcefully inoculated, um, with the recent mandate, uh, where he faced
[2:55:09.100 --> 2:55:14.820]  termination, uh, high income position, all that healthy guy, young forties, uh, in shape,
[2:55:14.820 --> 2:55:18.900]  never had serious medical issues within two days of being inoculated.
[2:55:18.900 --> 2:55:24.300]  He was hospitalized and within five days he was told he needed his gallbladder removed
[2:55:24.300 --> 2:55:26.900]  and, and they surgically removed his gallbladder.
[2:55:26.900 --> 2:55:29.940]  Um, he's recovering, but he's still not himself.
[2:55:29.940 --> 2:55:34.700]  So you know, this, this inoculation is, is pretty, pretty dangerous.
[2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:39.980]  Um, you know, and I wanted to give a quick shout out to hammer, hail, dill and roof,
[2:55:39.980 --> 2:55:42.580]  buck niggers, buck hikes, uh, you know, is real.
[2:55:42.580 --> 2:55:43.580]  Thanks for the call.
[2:55:43.580 --> 2:55:47.740]  We got a leftist calling in, you know, the, you know, the, the, uh, leftist couldn't call
[2:55:47.740 --> 2:55:48.740]  in today.
[2:55:48.740 --> 2:55:49.740]  We delayed that out.
[2:55:49.740 --> 2:55:52.300]  Someone's been hearing and, and, and defend the shot.
[2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:56.060]  They just want to call in and create racial division because they want to kill us all.
[2:55:56.060 --> 2:55:57.060]  They don't want us together.
[2:55:57.060 --> 2:55:58.260]  Mike, you want to comment on that?
[2:55:58.260 --> 2:55:59.260]  Yeah.
[2:55:59.260 --> 2:56:00.260]  Well, that's their plan.
[2:56:00.260 --> 2:56:01.260]  They want racial division.
[2:56:01.260 --> 2:56:04.260]  They want to race war in America to cover up for their failed policies.
[2:56:04.260 --> 2:56:09.900]  So what we've all got to realize is that we, the people, whether we're black, white, Latino,
[2:56:09.900 --> 2:56:16.300]  Asian, Native American, whatever, we are all in the same fight to save humanity here.
[2:56:16.300 --> 2:56:20.300]  And so, uh, and I think you would agree with me, Alex, I, I, it doesn't matter to me what
[2:56:20.300 --> 2:56:25.260]  your, your nation of origin is, what your skin color is, what your religion is, even
[2:56:25.260 --> 2:56:26.980]  your sexual orientation.
[2:56:26.980 --> 2:56:31.260]  I tell you what, we, we all have to stand up right now and fight against this in order
[2:56:31.260 --> 2:56:32.500]  to save humanity.
[2:56:32.500 --> 2:56:36.620]  And you know, people like that caller probably lined up and took, you know, a couple of booster
[2:56:36.620 --> 2:56:39.700]  shots and they gladly just won't be around that long.
[2:56:39.700 --> 2:56:41.500]  And that's really what's going to happen.
[2:56:41.500 --> 2:56:42.500]  I mean, it is happening.
[2:56:42.500 --> 2:56:46.300]  Now, you can hear the slime and the hate in that leftist voice, that anti-foot person's
[2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:47.300]  voice.
[2:56:47.300 --> 2:56:50.780]  And I recognize that voice, it's called before and does the same thing.
[2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:53.980]  That's not even somebody that actually hates black people or Jews.
[2:56:53.980 --> 2:56:57.460]  They're literally just trying to make people hear that and hate us so that we can all be
[2:56:57.460 --> 2:56:59.220]  killed together.
[2:56:59.220 --> 2:57:01.860]  That person's pretending might be part of the power structure.
[2:57:01.860 --> 2:57:02.860]  Right.
[2:57:02.860 --> 2:57:03.860]  Right.
[2:57:03.860 --> 2:57:04.860]  Exactly.
[2:57:04.860 --> 2:57:08.160]  Well, that little pretend game is going to meet reality very quickly for a lot of people
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:09.160]  like that.
[2:57:09.160 --> 2:57:12.020]  And they, they, they won't be around much longer because of the spike protein.
[2:57:12.020 --> 2:57:14.180]  It's just, again, it's cause and effect, Alex.
[2:57:14.180 --> 2:57:18.300]  You can't deny cause and effect and people who are signing up for vaccine suicide are
[2:57:18.300 --> 2:57:19.660]  going to be suicided.
[2:57:19.660 --> 2:57:20.660]  Well, that's right.
[2:57:20.660 --> 2:57:25.540]  So beefy, beefy, we've warned you, but you be sure and take your shots now if you want
[2:57:25.540 --> 2:57:26.540]  to go.
[2:57:26.540 --> 2:57:27.540]  Bye-bye.
[2:57:27.540 --> 2:57:29.700]  Mike Adams, amazing interview, natural news.com.
[2:57:29.700 --> 2:57:31.380]  Thank you for coming on, my friend.

[2:57:33.380 --> 2:57:34.380]  God bless you all.

[3:00:01.700 --> 3:00:06.220]  All right, Owen Schreuer said to take over in T minus five minutes, Nancy, you're up
[3:00:06.220 --> 3:00:11.380]  first and then James and Summer and Trent, he'll be taking your calls next segment.
[3:00:11.380 --> 3:00:16.500]  You can go right to you and he's going to be hosting the war over three hours.
[3:00:16.500 --> 3:00:24.140]  After that, I need to talk about a couple issues here and then we'll in my little part
[3:00:24.140 --> 3:00:29.380]  of the broadcast today.
[3:00:29.380 --> 3:00:32.820]  We are no doubt in the middle global extermination operation.
[3:00:32.820 --> 3:00:33.820]  We know that now.
[3:00:33.820 --> 3:00:37.100]  We've really got to understand that they're going to make their major move.
[3:00:37.100 --> 3:00:40.500]  They could release a super deadly weapon any day now.
[3:00:40.500 --> 3:00:43.620]  I'm not going to happen, but that's definitely in the cards.
[3:00:43.620 --> 3:00:47.980]  The cards in the enemy's hand run from two armageddon.
[3:00:47.980 --> 3:00:53.260]  They run from seriously horrible and able to just end of the world type of stuff.
[3:00:53.260 --> 3:00:57.460]  So look, I'm not going to lie to you.
[3:00:57.460 --> 3:01:01.060]  I'm pissed off because I'm ready to die.
[3:01:01.060 --> 3:01:02.060]  I don't want to die.
[3:01:02.060 --> 3:01:03.140]  I'm not going to commit suicide.
[3:01:03.140 --> 3:01:08.060]  But my children don't deserve this and your children don't deserve it as well.
[3:01:08.060 --> 3:01:16.100]  So I just hope you all realize how much I appreciate you and how much I know in my heart
[3:01:16.100 --> 3:01:19.580]  that you've really been a game changer in the whole fight against tyranny.
[3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:24.300]  And I just want to ask you all to just be more conscious.
[3:01:24.300 --> 3:01:32.340]  Just be more awake, just be more follow through and be more detail oriented and kind of wake
[3:01:32.340 --> 3:01:38.100]  up and get into the real world.
[3:01:38.100 --> 3:01:40.140]  And that doesn't just mean be aware of all the evil.
[3:01:40.140 --> 3:01:46.900]  I mean, it means so many people are too optimistic about, oh, just lead a good life, ignore the
[3:01:46.900 --> 3:01:49.220]  corruption, be happy, it'll go away.
[3:01:49.220 --> 3:01:51.740]  No, that might have worked the last 30 years.
[3:01:51.740 --> 3:01:54.820]  That got us where we are.
[3:01:54.820 --> 3:02:03.340]  If you're not upset, if you're not sick about what's happening, you're part of the problem.
[3:02:03.340 --> 3:02:07.460]  Two years ago, we had an 80% chance to turn us around.
[3:02:07.460 --> 3:02:12.860]  We've got about a 50% chance right now.
[3:02:12.860 --> 3:02:17.740]  And every month that goes by, the things get worse, it lowers.
[3:02:17.740 --> 3:02:21.700]  And I'm going to sit here right to the end, even if we've got a 1% chance to turn us around.
[3:02:21.700 --> 3:02:32.580]  But it makes me physically sick because everybody's going to pay back.
[3:02:32.580 --> 3:02:35.740]  And there's no consolation in the leftist and all these people that will be destroyed
[3:02:35.740 --> 3:02:36.980]  first.
[3:02:36.980 --> 3:02:45.060]  That's a failure that we let our fellow humans turn into this and have this happen to them.
[3:02:45.060 --> 3:02:48.460]  So I want you to take over here in about three minutes, you're going to write to your phone
[3:02:48.460 --> 3:02:49.460]  calls.
[3:02:49.460 --> 3:02:52.260]  It's a whole free number to join us, we'll just take more calls, you want to take calls
[3:02:52.260 --> 3:03:01.420]  next hour, 877-789-2539-877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539.
[3:03:01.420 --> 3:03:05.980]  And separately, it's a nice vote of confidence you guys give us with the 1776 coin that's
[3:03:05.980 --> 3:03:10.300]  got a big mark up on it because it's a founding member like buying a war bond to fund us in
[3:03:10.300 --> 3:03:11.900]  the future and launch new projects.
[3:03:11.900 --> 3:03:14.420]  And yeah, we're able to stay on air, which we'll probably be able to do.
[3:03:14.420 --> 3:03:17.260]  But who knows, they're going to have a nuclear war next week with Russia.
[3:03:17.260 --> 3:03:20.140]  And those that are founding members with the email, we're going to send you exclusive deals
[3:03:20.140 --> 3:03:26.340]  and we were able to make more films, a free DVD in the mail, a membership to a new thing
[3:03:26.340 --> 3:03:27.340]  we're going to do.
[3:03:27.340 --> 3:03:28.340]  I mean, that's there.
[3:03:28.340 --> 3:03:31.340]  It's a fun thing to do and I appreciate all of you.
[3:03:31.340 --> 3:03:38.180]  It's going to sell out the next day or two, 1776coin.com or infowarstore.com and you know,

[3:03:41.940 --> 3:03:43.340]  Get your family, get yourself ready.
[3:03:43.340 --> 3:03:47.220]  But if you're going to do Christmas shopping, you should do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com

[3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:32.020]  wow, Jones feel sorry for you.
[3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:35.420]  That means that means you're going to be in a bio nuclear war.
[3:04:35.420 --> 3:04:38.180]  I mean, you understand, like, I'm like, yeah, it could be our last days here.
[3:04:38.180 --> 3:04:41.020]  Yeah, all of us together.
[3:04:41.020 --> 3:04:42.700]  That's why all my enemies think they're destroying me.
[3:04:42.700 --> 3:04:43.700]  They have no idea.
[3:04:43.700 --> 3:04:45.900]  They're destroyed by their master, not me.
[3:04:45.900 --> 3:04:46.900]  All right.
[3:04:46.900 --> 3:04:48.400]  God bless you all.
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:55.580]  We'll be right back with Owen Shroyer.
[3:04:55.580 --> 3:04:57.100]  Alex Jones here to make it.
[3:04:57.100 --> 3:05:01.900]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[3:05:01.900 --> 3:05:04.300]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:05:04.300 --> 3:05:08.820]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:05:08.820 --> 3:05:13.420]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[3:05:13.420 --> 3:05:17.260]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know, with a deep burn source,
[3:05:17.260 --> 3:05:18.700]  you know, and I got really excited about that.
[3:05:18.700 --> 3:05:23.780]  So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[3:05:23.780 --> 3:05:29.020]  brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[3:05:29.020 --> 3:05:33.460]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[3:05:33.460 --> 3:05:35.580]  take basically all of your supplements.
[3:05:35.580 --> 3:05:37.460]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:05:37.460 --> 3:05:41.900]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:05:41.900 --> 3:05:42.900]  It's amazing.
[3:05:42.900 --> 3:05:47.060]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[3:05:47.060 --> 3:05:48.060]  the globalist system.
[3:05:48.060 --> 3:05:51.820]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[3:05:51.820 --> 3:05:52.940]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:05:52.940 --> 3:06:00.340]  I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[3:06:00.340 --> 3:06:06.980]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:06:06.980 --> 3:06:14.060]  the info war and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[3:06:14.060 --> 3:06:17.340]  All right, here's how it's going to go.
[3:06:17.340 --> 3:06:24.540]  I'm going to take phone calls for this entire fourth hour of the Alex Jones show, then we're
[3:06:24.540 --> 3:06:34.660]  going to close the lines and we're going to start the war room where I will get into all
[3:06:34.660 --> 3:06:40.060]  of this news that I have in front of me on my desk and then reopen the phone lines for
[3:06:40.060 --> 3:06:41.220]  more callers.
[3:06:41.220 --> 3:06:45.740]  But we are going to take calls here on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and we'll
[3:06:45.740 --> 3:06:49.380]  hit the reset button on the war room right after that.
[3:06:49.380 --> 3:06:54.980]  So, right now we have Summer, who is calling in from Colorado, Summer, you're on the Alex
[3:06:54.980 --> 3:06:55.980]  Jones show.
[3:06:55.980 --> 3:06:56.980]  Go ahead.
[3:06:56.980 --> 3:06:57.980]  Hi, Owen.
[3:06:57.980 --> 3:07:02.900]  First, I want to say George Washington slaying the dragon, that image is absolutely brilliant
[3:07:02.900 --> 3:07:07.420]  and I would love to have a founding member long-sleeved shirt for my husband.
[3:07:07.420 --> 3:07:13.140]  And second, I need to talk about two massive dangers to children from the mask and from
[3:07:13.140 --> 3:07:16.420]  a dangerous vaccine component.
[3:07:16.420 --> 3:07:21.340]  First of all, masks increase the danger of children become habitual mouth breathers.
[3:07:21.340 --> 3:07:27.020]  Mouth breathing is extremely dangerous because not only does it nose breathing, the only
[3:07:27.020 --> 3:07:34.460]  way your body produces nitric oxide and natural anti-inflammatory is an antiviral and antibacterial
[3:07:34.460 --> 3:07:39.700]  that's required for cognition and your body's first initial defense against viruses and
[3:07:39.700 --> 3:07:40.700]  bacteria.
[3:07:40.700 --> 3:07:46.500]  But also, if you don't have the proper palate formation from nose breathing by keeping your
[3:07:46.500 --> 3:07:53.380]  mouth closed, mouth breathing with your mouth hanging open can cause permanent mouth formation
[3:07:53.380 --> 3:07:55.060]  of the cranial facial structure.
[3:07:55.060 --> 3:08:00.700]  This is so dangerous because it's offsetting their chin, jaw, skull, and will misalign
[3:08:00.700 --> 3:08:01.700]  their brain.
[3:08:01.700 --> 3:08:05.620]  Well, you know, that's one point that I didn't, you know, you bring up so many good points
[3:08:05.620 --> 3:08:07.180]  there and I want you to continue.
[3:08:07.180 --> 3:08:10.100]  But you know, that's one thing you said there at the end that I didn't hear many other people
[3:08:10.100 --> 3:08:15.140]  talk about either was it definitely, whenever I was forced to put on the mask, even if it
[3:08:15.140 --> 3:08:19.660]  was like just for ceremony and you keep it under your chin, whatever the case, I could
[3:08:19.660 --> 3:08:25.140]  feel that it was just, I could feel that it was messing with my chin, messing with my
[3:08:25.140 --> 3:08:29.860]  jaw, messing with the natural, you know, movement of my jaw when I'm talking, when
[3:08:29.860 --> 3:08:30.860]  I'm breathing.
[3:08:30.860 --> 3:08:35.380]  I mean, these are the things we don't think about and it's just, it's beyond ridiculous
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:37.300]  that we're wearing the mask to begin with.
[3:08:37.300 --> 3:08:42.060]  But when you think about how it's a negative health thing, wearing the mask and all the
[3:08:42.060 --> 3:08:46.060]  different ones you brought up and so many more, and we still force ourselves and our
[3:08:46.060 --> 3:08:47.060]  kids to do this.
[3:08:47.060 --> 3:08:51.740]  Yeah, and the children that are going to suffer from facial deformities because of wearing
[3:08:51.740 --> 3:08:56.500]  the mask and then have this habitual mouth breathing for potentially the rest of their
[3:08:56.500 --> 3:08:57.500]  life.
[3:08:57.500 --> 3:09:06.980]  This is known from Dennis North Adonis that mouth breathing makes you need orthodontics,
[3:09:06.980 --> 3:09:14.500]  need teeth help and realignment because nasal breathing is the way we're supposed to breathe
[3:09:14.500 --> 3:09:20.420]  and not only that, but I also want to remind your listeners of an MIT article that was
[3:09:20.420 --> 3:09:27.940]  posted on September 14, 2017, titled One Vaccine Injection Could Carry Many Doses, while this
[3:09:27.940 --> 3:09:32.540]  technology was actually funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[3:09:32.540 --> 3:09:38.260]  And in their article, they say, MIT engineers have invented a 3D fabrication method that
[3:09:38.260 --> 3:09:44.220]  can generate a drug carrying microstructure that could allow multiple doses of a drug
[3:09:44.220 --> 3:09:51.340]  or vaccine to be delivered over an extended period of time with just one injection.
[3:09:51.340 --> 3:09:58.540]  So that's like a birth control technology where they put the things in the girl's arms?
[3:09:58.540 --> 3:10:02.220]  It was meant to be for vaccines.
[3:10:02.220 --> 3:10:06.540]  But I'm saying it's like, oh, you get this and oh, I've got my birth control for a year
[3:10:06.540 --> 3:10:08.380]  or whatever the length of time is.
[3:10:08.380 --> 3:10:09.900]  Yeah, delay release.
[3:10:09.900 --> 3:10:14.420]  And it's supposed to be delay release at a specific time just like that.
[3:10:14.420 --> 3:10:15.740]  Oh, how convenient.
[3:10:15.740 --> 3:10:17.740]  Oh, it's technology.
[3:10:17.740 --> 3:10:18.740]  Yes.
[3:10:18.740 --> 3:10:23.100]  From MIT, funded by Bill and Melinda Gates, and it's supposed to have these little cups
[3:10:23.100 --> 3:10:26.700]  that can be put into different structures.
[3:10:26.700 --> 3:10:28.340]  And the whole article goes into it.
[3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:32.740]  I'd love for it to be read on the air at some time because it is crazy what they have
[3:10:32.740 --> 3:10:33.740]  done.
[3:10:33.740 --> 3:10:38.060]  Well, and just to kind of get into, you get into this and it kind of puts into a different
[3:10:38.060 --> 3:10:45.380]  lane to me, too, is technology has advanced so quickly in really the 20th and 21st century
[3:10:45.380 --> 3:10:52.460]  that humans haven't really developed an awareness in response, at least a quick enough awareness
[3:10:52.460 --> 3:10:55.300]  in response to the rapid development of new technologies.
[3:10:55.300 --> 3:10:57.860]  Well, we're starting to kind of develop that awareness.
[3:10:57.860 --> 3:11:03.780]  So we can look back now and see how the internet has hurt us or how cell phones have hurt us.
[3:11:03.780 --> 3:11:05.700]  I think we're learning more about that every day.
[3:11:05.700 --> 3:11:09.980]  But it's kind of here and it's now part of the fabric of our society and we can't really
[3:11:09.980 --> 3:11:12.980]  roll it back and we kind of just accept it as a necessary evil.
[3:11:12.980 --> 3:11:18.980]  But we have this awareness now of new technology to where we can start to say, okay, there
[3:11:18.980 --> 3:11:24.740]  might be benefits here, it is a new technology, it is an advancement, but what are going to
[3:11:24.740 --> 3:11:25.740]  be the negative things?
[3:11:25.740 --> 3:11:27.980]  Do we really want to roll it out now?
[3:11:27.980 --> 3:11:31.580]  So now we kind of have this awareness and we so we need to think about these future
[3:11:31.580 --> 3:11:32.580]  technologies.
[3:11:32.580 --> 3:11:36.940]  So if we can put something on the brain that makes a blind man see that I'm all for it
[3:11:36.940 --> 3:11:40.380]  or you know, I mean, I'm all for advancing, but there's going to be things that we need
[3:11:40.380 --> 3:11:44.820]  to be careful of like the microchipping, the nanotechnology, the smart blood, all this
[3:11:44.820 --> 3:11:47.180]  stuff we need to be very careful with.
[3:11:47.180 --> 3:11:48.180]  Definitely.
[3:11:48.180 --> 3:11:53.220]  Yeah, we definitely need to also be looking through other patents and technology to make
[3:11:53.220 --> 3:12:00.220]  sure that we're being careful about what their next move is because this having a delay
[3:12:00.220 --> 3:12:05.420]  release, it could already be in all of the vaccines given out or maybe in some batches
[3:12:05.420 --> 3:12:11.780]  because this is as soon as they have this and some of the other like glowing technology
[3:12:11.780 --> 3:12:13.340]  that could make people glow.
[3:12:13.340 --> 3:12:14.340]  That's another MIT.
[3:12:14.340 --> 3:12:16.340]  Oh yeah, they have that with pets now too.
[3:12:16.340 --> 3:12:17.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:12:17.340 --> 3:12:21.540]  And you know, here's the thing, whenever somebody lies to you, why would they buy it and not
[3:12:21.540 --> 3:12:22.540]  use it?
[3:12:22.540 --> 3:12:25.980]  You know, and whenever somebody lies to you too, like Bill Gates and Melinda Gates, I
[3:12:25.980 --> 3:12:29.380]  think they were both on an interview one time and they said, oh, we don't know anything
[3:12:29.380 --> 3:12:32.780]  about microchips or implantable microchips.
[3:12:32.780 --> 3:12:36.660]  And of course, they knew all about it, Microsoft has already proposed patents, it was already
[3:12:36.660 --> 3:12:38.180]  mainstream news reports.
[3:12:38.180 --> 3:12:41.820]  Summer, thank you so much, excellent call.
[3:12:41.820 --> 3:12:42.820]  So yeah, exactly.
[3:12:42.820 --> 3:12:45.820]  They wouldn't get technology if they don't plan on using it and then they wouldn't be
[3:12:45.820 --> 3:12:54.020]  lying about it on nationally televised interviews if they didn't have some sordid agenda.
[3:12:54.020 --> 3:12:59.620]  All right, let's now go to Trent in Nevada, Trent, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:12:59.620 --> 3:13:00.620]  Go ahead.
[3:13:00.620 --> 3:13:01.620]  What's going on, Owen?
[3:13:01.620 --> 3:13:02.620]  Hello.
[3:13:02.620 --> 3:13:03.620]  I just want to see.
[3:13:03.620 --> 3:13:04.620]  I just want to see.
[3:13:04.620 --> 3:13:05.620]  Can you hear me?
[3:13:05.620 --> 3:13:06.620]  Oh, yes.
[3:13:06.620 --> 3:13:07.620]  Right on.
[3:13:07.620 --> 3:13:12.260]  I got a couple of family members that got the shots and they're just like in complete
[3:13:12.260 --> 3:13:19.700]  absolute denial about about it and like the technology is just like over people's head.
[3:13:19.700 --> 3:13:27.540]  I just come across this Harvard article that says team builds first living robots that
[3:13:27.540 --> 3:13:28.540]  can reproduce.
[3:13:28.540 --> 3:13:33.660]  And it's like, it's like, it's like a micro robot, it's like a tiny nanobot, right?
[3:13:33.660 --> 3:13:36.180]  And it has like that spiral shape.
[3:13:36.180 --> 3:13:41.620]  Yes, yes, it does have a spiral in it.
[3:13:41.620 --> 3:13:45.820]  But it's just it's absolutely insane what is going on.
[3:13:45.820 --> 3:13:51.860]  But also I just wanted to my step that has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's like 10 years
[3:13:51.860 --> 3:13:57.260]  ago, but it sent me on an absolute journey.
[3:13:57.260 --> 3:14:05.100]  And anyways, mercury poisoning has identical lesions in the brain, identical loss of motor
[3:14:05.100 --> 3:14:09.380]  skills, just identical symptoms.
[3:14:09.380 --> 3:14:18.060]  And there is articles out there that confirm that the ADA and the government know this,
[3:14:18.060 --> 3:14:25.100]  but they can't they can't agree with it because then it would leave dentists liable for lawsuit
[3:14:25.100 --> 3:14:28.620]  insurance companies would have to pay out and then it would completely bankrupt the
[3:14:28.620 --> 3:14:38.100]  whole system and the education system would have to be completely, you know, retaught.
[3:14:38.100 --> 3:14:44.140]  And it goes along with like every other neurological disease as well.
[3:14:44.140 --> 3:14:50.100]  Like the first case of MS was diagnosed in Paris in 1832 and mercury is one of the most
[3:14:50.100 --> 3:14:53.740]  well studied elements on the periodic table.
[3:14:53.740 --> 3:14:59.180]  And they knew that we've known for a long time how bad it is for humans.
[3:14:59.180 --> 3:15:03.940]  And I remember that they used to they used to do reports, infowars used to cover this
[3:15:03.940 --> 3:15:05.740]  is long before I worked here.
[3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:10.580]  And you'd have ABC News reports and others saying mercury is good for you because people
[3:15:10.580 --> 3:15:12.660]  found out it was an adjuvant in the vaccines.
[3:15:12.660 --> 3:15:15.420]  And it's just again, mercury very well studied, horrible for humans.
[3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:18.540]  And they say mercury is good for you.
[3:15:18.540 --> 3:15:22.540]  Oh, it's, it's, you know, Ivermectin is for horses only.
[3:15:22.540 --> 3:15:23.700]  It's just it's the mainstream news.
[3:15:23.700 --> 3:15:26.060]  They're lying to us no matter what, no matter when.
[3:15:26.060 --> 3:15:27.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:15:27.060 --> 3:15:31.420]  And they even have a 60 minutes episode called smoking teeth.
[3:15:31.420 --> 3:15:35.380]  And it just seems like you can show this stuff to people and it just seems like they're
[3:15:35.380 --> 3:15:38.300]  just like like you guys say they're in a trance.
[3:15:38.300 --> 3:15:43.620]  I think there's more to it than a trance because I think it's more of a spiritual thing because
[3:15:43.620 --> 3:15:48.700]  you can show these people what's going on and they just write back to mainstream media
[3:15:48.700 --> 3:15:53.620]  even though they've been caught lying over and over and over right back into the trance
[3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:54.820]  right back asleep.
[3:15:54.820 --> 3:16:00.420]  What if you could it was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in game blueprint
[3:16:00.420 --> 3:16:05.300]  for global enslavement and that documentary I predicted the globalists would establish
[3:16:05.300 --> 3:16:11.460]  world government of releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then
[3:16:11.460 --> 3:16:14.500]  triggering a collapse of our industrial society.
[3:16:14.500 --> 3:16:15.500]  And now they've done it.
[3:16:15.500 --> 3:16:17.580]  How did I know they would do it?
[3:16:17.580 --> 3:16:21.980]  Because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal
[3:16:21.980 --> 3:16:22.980]  meetings were leaked.
[3:16:22.980 --> 3:16:28.100]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group whose head at the time was Klaus Schwab
[3:16:28.100 --> 3:16:32.660]  and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this
[3:16:32.660 --> 3:16:33.660]  great reset.
[3:16:33.660 --> 3:16:37.740]  Well, we're now living in the purposeful collapse of the third world and the first
[3:16:37.740 --> 3:16:42.620]  world, not attached to the tyrannical corporate world government, the total censorship, no
[3:16:42.620 --> 3:16:48.860]  due process, destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[3:16:48.860 --> 3:16:53.180]  of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us in the populace.
[3:16:53.180 --> 3:16:55.860]  This is what Info Wars is fighting, we're fighting for the future.
[3:16:55.860 --> 3:17:02.620]  In late August, Info Wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[3:17:02.620 --> 3:17:08.980]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[3:17:08.980 --> 3:17:12.100]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:17:12.100 --> 3:17:15.140]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[3:17:15.140 --> 3:17:16.140]  have.
[3:17:16.140 --> 3:17:19.260]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[3:17:19.260 --> 3:17:23.140]  filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[3:17:23.140 --> 3:17:26.540]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.

[3:17:35.700 --> 3:17:40.020]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[3:17:40.020 --> 3:17:41.340]  already taking place.
[3:17:41.340 --> 3:17:47.620]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:17:47.620 --> 3:17:51.500]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[3:17:51.500 --> 3:17:52.500]  control.
[3:17:52.500 --> 3:17:55.020]  So get prepared now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[3:21:06.780 --> 3:21:11.340]  Jazzy Jazzy is called in she's in the United States of America Jazzy thank
[3:21:11.340 --> 3:21:17.580]  you for calling go ahead hi Owen hey I just want to say that my first time
[3:21:17.580 --> 3:21:24.180]  calling in I'm a little nervous and I wanted to say the lady who was just
[3:21:24.180 --> 3:21:33.660]  talking about wearing a mask I worked in a doctor's office and had to wear a mask
[3:21:33.660 --> 3:21:44.500]  10 hours a day and I ended up getting three staff infections on my chin and it
[3:21:44.500 --> 3:21:51.820]  got to the point where I had enough of it and then they had to mandate the
[3:21:51.820 --> 3:22:01.900]  vaccine and I just I just had to quit and leave there and so after I left there
[3:22:01.900 --> 3:22:10.980]  it's been a year now my chin has finally gone back to normal but when I had the
[3:22:10.980 --> 3:22:17.580]  staff infection on my chin it looks like I had a great big golf ball on my chin
[3:22:17.580 --> 3:22:22.740]  because it was so infected well were they were they telling you to wear the
[3:22:22.740 --> 3:22:28.380]  same mask for 10 hours or did they allow you like you know to wear 20 masks so you
[3:22:28.380 --> 3:22:35.500]  could not have that problem yeah well it was it was yes I could switch it out
[3:22:35.500 --> 3:22:44.340]  like every hour if I wanted to but I still and I did but I still got the
[3:22:44.340 --> 3:22:47.680]  infection because don't surgeons I mean isn't it kind of like protocol like
[3:22:47.680 --> 3:22:50.660]  surgeons have to replace their mask like every 30 minutes or something because
[3:22:50.660 --> 3:22:57.580]  of these issues are well known exactly yes right and I also just wanted to say
[3:22:57.580 --> 3:23:04.700]  that I like it when you bring out bozo the clown bozo Biden the clown I'm the

[3:25:07.980 --> 3:25:13.060]  pond he's over in England jolly old England Nick go ahead hey oh I'm great
[3:25:13.060 --> 3:25:17.100]  to talk to you first I'm caller thanks in England for five years my wife's
[3:25:17.100 --> 3:25:21.580]  English but eight weeks ago I had to go back to Tennessee to get my mom into an
[3:25:21.580 --> 3:25:25.980]  assisted living center she had a non-covid issue and had to go to the
[3:25:25.980 --> 3:25:30.980]  hospital and I followed the ambulance I told the MTS said no shots and no
[3:25:30.980 --> 3:25:36.300]  ventilator I went into the waiting room I waited two hours I was I was reasonable
[3:25:36.300 --> 3:25:40.700]  every 45 minutes said any updates can I go back in the back see my mom after two
[3:25:40.700 --> 3:25:44.460]  hours they came out and told me that my mom had COVID I was not gonna be able to
[3:25:44.460 --> 3:25:47.700]  see my mom and they suggested that I leave I told him no I'm not leaving I
[3:25:47.700 --> 3:25:51.180]  said she goes well you can't see your mom I said well I don't want to see my
[3:25:51.180 --> 3:25:56.540]  mom I want to see the doctor so long story short after five hours they came
[3:25:56.540 --> 3:25:59.700]  over and told me we're releasing your mom I said how can you do that when you
[3:25:59.700 --> 3:26:04.180]  said she had COVID she goes I don't know and so the nurse came oh that's
[3:26:04.180 --> 3:26:09.740]  reassuring I know we're nurse comes out in the wheelchair I asked her I said well
[3:26:09.740 --> 3:26:14.700]  how do you know that she has COVID did you run a antigen or PCR test she said I
[3:26:14.700 --> 3:26:18.980]  ran a PCR test I said really I said tell me what the cycle count what was the
[3:26:18.980 --> 3:26:24.060]  amplification on it was it 28 or 40 she goes that's above my pay grade she goes
[3:26:24.060 --> 3:26:27.980]  I have no idea that's all lab I said you know that's really a shame that you
[3:26:27.980 --> 3:26:30.060]  don't know because Dr. Kerry Mullison vented it
[3:26:30.060 --> 3:26:36.180]  unfortunately died just before COVID came out and and and he said he said once
[3:26:36.180 --> 3:26:41.260]  you put that application anywhere near 40 you're gonna get a 97% false positive
[3:26:41.260 --> 3:26:45.300]  she said sir I have no idea by any of that so that's a shame they dumped her
[3:26:45.300 --> 3:26:48.460]  out on the side I'm trying to get her into the assisted living center the
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:52.900]  next day so but she had COVID she was contagious they put her out on the
[3:26:52.900 --> 3:26:58.180]  curb two hours so I went merely from there to one of these urgent care that
[3:26:58.180 --> 3:27:03.820]  does a PCR test and net net is after an hour of doing that PCR test they gave
[3:27:03.820 --> 3:27:07.340]  her a clean bill of health it was fine I emailed that to the assisted living
[3:27:07.340 --> 3:27:10.980]  center they said she let me email that to the director of nursing this is at
[3:27:10.980 --> 3:27:15.060]  seven o'clock at night they said bring her in tomorrow 11 will do the medical
[3:27:15.060 --> 3:27:19.500]  assessment and got her in she never had any COVID anything I hope that this
[3:27:19.500 --> 3:27:23.500]  just helps anybody but I think you're the greatest I think info wars are the
[3:27:23.500 --> 3:27:27.700]  greatest and together we will win I just thank you for your time oh thank you
[3:27:27.700 --> 3:27:31.500]  Nick Nick kind of sound like a cowboy for somebody over there in England I
[3:27:31.500 --> 3:27:35.820]  don't think you're from there no I'm from I'm from Tennessee actually from
[3:27:35.820 --> 3:27:39.540]  Memphis sounds about right well hey thanks for calling God bless your brother

[3:28:02.820 --> 3:28:09.020]  gonna say that I love your show and Alex and Harrison all you guys are but I
[3:28:09.020 --> 3:28:16.340]  think people here in Alabama starting to wake up I'm a truck driver and on the
[3:28:16.340 --> 3:28:22.700]  interstate you know what and the other day it's down around Birmingham I think I
[3:28:22.700 --> 3:28:31.740]  saw one of the big huge digital billboards it said vaccine to kill and it
[3:28:31.740 --> 3:28:41.540]  had a website on it the website was vaccine police calm and I had I had
[3:28:41.540 --> 3:28:44.780]  checked it out a little bit last night but I'm gonna have to go back on there
[3:28:44.780 --> 3:28:50.300]  we'll pull it up we got to go to a break but vaccine dash police calm and you
[3:28:50.300 --> 3:28:53.580]  say you saw it on a big digital billboard that's good to hear people are
[3:28:53.580 --> 3:28:58.340]  waking up you know listeners call the purpose of fear is to call us into
[3:28:58.340 --> 3:29:03.180]  action and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined
[3:29:03.180 --> 3:29:07.220]  up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[3:29:07.220 --> 3:29:11.740]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the
[3:29:11.740 --> 3:29:15.980]  perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the
[3:29:15.980 --> 3:29:20.580]  population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine
[3:29:20.580 --> 3:29:24.780]  years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all
[3:29:24.780 --> 3:29:29.140]  really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two
[3:29:29.140 --> 3:29:34.100]  things to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if
[3:29:34.100 --> 3:29:38.940]  enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we
[3:29:38.940 --> 3:29:43.660]  eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must

[3:31:52.540 --> 3:32:01.060]  ask the Alex Jones special get our great bag of it here I mean this is from
[3:32:01.060 --> 3:32:05.740]  people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communist well that's where some of
[3:32:05.740 --> 3:32:09.860]  the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the
[3:32:09.860 --> 3:32:13.340]  volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the
[3:32:13.340 --> 3:32:16.260]  little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really they're just
[3:32:16.260 --> 3:32:19.860]  a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it
[3:32:19.860 --> 3:32:22.700]  and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so I actually buy
[3:32:22.700 --> 3:32:25.620]  this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the
[3:32:25.620 --> 3:32:28.500]  price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:32:28.500 --> 3:32:32.460]  for about 50% more per pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're
[3:32:32.460 --> 3:32:35.940]  gonna find anywhere it's wake up America Patriot blend from the Chiapas
[3:32:35.940 --> 3:32:41.580]  rebels literally in fact I'm gonna tell you a little story

[3:32:50.740 --> 3:32:53.180]  say that's fine
[3:32:56.180 --> 3:33:04.700]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[3:33:04.700 --> 3:33:23.500]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer
[3:33:23.500 --> 3:33:27.140]  all right we're taking phone calls for two more segments here I'm gonna try to

[3:33:39.660 --> 3:33:46.420]  dash police calm did we end up finding that in the break okay we couldn't find
[3:33:46.420 --> 3:33:51.580]  it but maybe we'll keep looking maybe we got the name wrong there but let's go
[3:33:51.580 --> 3:33:56.020]  back out to the phone lines now let's go to Melissa dialed in from Arkansas
[3:33:56.020 --> 3:34:02.860]  Melissa you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead hi can you hear me yes I'm a
[3:34:02.860 --> 3:34:07.060]  first-time caller and I just want to try to get to this information quickly so I
[3:34:07.060 --> 3:34:12.700]  you know you can move on but I've been a nurse for 12 years and I worked in all
[3:34:12.700 --> 3:34:17.380]  areas of nursing and I just I can't believe what's happening to the point
[3:34:17.380 --> 3:34:23.180]  that I don't even trust any medicine from anything in the last 50 years or
[3:34:23.180 --> 3:34:27.460]  more I've stopped all my medications and everything because I just don't trust it
[3:34:27.460 --> 3:34:34.740]  anymore but I came across an interview on YouTube called the website or the
[3:34:34.740 --> 3:34:41.500]  channel is called the portal and it's episode 19 with Brett Weinstein and it's
[3:34:41.500 --> 3:34:49.300]  his brother that he's interviewing on his show and this guy goes on into
[3:34:49.300 --> 3:34:54.620]  detail how the rats that they use for medication experiments are so perfect
[3:34:54.620 --> 3:35:00.380]  genetically that they can take massive amounts of toxic doses and they can fight
[3:35:00.380 --> 3:35:05.500]  off cancer way longer than any other animal because they've been bred so
[3:35:05.500 --> 3:35:12.380]  perfectly that they have nothing wrong with them and if you use that based on
[3:35:12.380 --> 3:35:17.380]  anything that's what they use for long-term effects for medications so if
[3:35:17.380 --> 3:35:22.140]  these rats are so perfect then how on earth can they even tell us it's safe
[3:35:22.140 --> 3:35:27.500]  because there's just no way and he goes in so detail about how like all medicine
[3:35:27.500 --> 3:35:34.220]  is wrong even over the counter so I just I sent this information to all the house
[3:35:34.220 --> 3:35:40.620]  and Senate doctors I sent a letter to all of them and Trump and to Fox News
[3:35:40.620 --> 3:35:44.980]  people and everybody I everyone needs to go and watch this interview and he
[3:35:44.980 --> 3:35:52.100]  explains how it's wrong and how the pharmacies ignored it so so basically the
[3:35:52.100 --> 3:35:58.700]  testing that's done on rats is not a good standard for testing these drugs
[3:35:58.700 --> 3:36:04.820]  because the rats have been bred to be so what would be the right word I mean not
[3:36:04.820 --> 3:36:10.740]  immune but I guess resistant to certain diseases. Telemyrs they have their
[3:36:10.740 --> 3:36:15.380]  spread so perfect that their telomeres are so insanely long that they can take
[3:36:15.380 --> 3:36:20.100]  insane amounts of toxic doses and he says that that's why so many medicines
[3:36:20.100 --> 3:36:25.220]  go on the market and get recalled within five years because there's no way to do
[3:36:25.220 --> 3:36:30.980]  real long-term studies on humans it would take 50 60 70 years so they use
[3:36:30.980 --> 3:36:36.340]  these rats to predict what will happen to humans so if they're using these rats
[3:36:36.340 --> 3:36:40.140]  to predict what's going to happen to humans what if they base their whole
[3:36:40.140 --> 3:36:44.820]  agenda off of these rats and it's supposed to kill humans off in 10 years
[3:36:44.820 --> 3:36:50.260]  but it's killing them way faster because the one-week link and the chain is the
[3:36:50.260 --> 3:36:54.540]  rat because every lab in the United States gets their rats from one place
[3:36:54.540 --> 3:37:01.740]  every lab in Europe gets their rats from one place they're tainted well not to
[3:37:01.740 --> 3:37:05.980]  play spoiler here but that's actually the moral dilemma at the end of the new
[3:37:05.980 --> 3:37:10.580]  M. Night Shyamalan movie old I'll just leave it right there not to play spoiler
[3:37:10.580 --> 3:37:13.740]  for anybody that's gonna watch it but that's kind of the the end of the
[3:37:13.740 --> 3:37:19.300]  dilemma is well what do we do about how do we fast-track human trials for drugs
[3:37:19.300 --> 3:37:23.540]  so that we don't have to wait 70 years to find a drug that's gonna cure a
[3:37:23.540 --> 3:37:28.180]  seizure or beat cancer anything like that Melissa thank you so much for that
[3:37:28.180 --> 3:37:33.420]  call we'll upload this segment separately and it'll be nurse explains why
[3:37:33.420 --> 3:37:38.740]  she no longer trusts modern medicine and then would you say that that's a fair
[3:37:38.740 --> 3:37:44.820]  headline exactly that's exactly it and I've cried per month morning my entire
[3:37:44.820 --> 3:37:50.420]  career is a lie well God bless you Melissa thank you for calling in and
[3:37:50.420 --> 3:37:54.540]  sharing that information with us and as I said we'll upload this separately to
[3:37:54.540 --> 3:37:59.180]  band-odd video so other people can get this message let's now go to Christine
[3:37:59.180 --> 3:38:08.100]  in New Jersey you're on the Alex Jones show Christine go ahead hi hi so I
[3:38:08.100 --> 3:38:14.460]  wanted to tell you guys that the New Jersey Department of Health is targeting
[3:38:14.460 --> 3:38:20.980]  children on tick-tock there they promote in an ad on tick-tock promoting the
[3:38:20.980 --> 3:38:25.940]  experimental COVID vaccine to children and the ad was I tried to send it to you
[3:38:25.940 --> 3:38:29.820]  guys but I couldn't find like an email address anything the ad is like a 9 to
[3:38:29.820 --> 3:38:35.100]  11 year old kid sitting there saying dear Santa I don't want games for
[3:38:35.100 --> 3:38:40.100]  Christmas he crosses out of games I don't want toys for Christmas he crosses
[3:38:40.100 --> 3:38:44.980]  off toys he goes just give me the COVID vaccine and then he circles vaccine on
[3:38:44.980 --> 3:38:52.100]  the Christmas list it is disgusting it is absolutely disgusting it's just as bad
[3:38:52.100 --> 3:38:57.020]  as the Big Bird Sesame Street I mean these I don't even know what to do I'm
[3:38:57.020 --> 3:39:00.020]  like sick to my stomach and then I want to tell you one other thing so the
[3:39:00.020 --> 3:39:04.820]  Governor Murphy at the State House in New Jersey the Democrats made a new
[3:39:04.820 --> 3:39:08.820]  rule you have to show your papers in order to enter so any legislators
[3:39:08.820 --> 3:39:14.740]  assemblymen that need to go in and vote have to show papers so the Republicans
[3:39:14.740 --> 3:39:18.540]  weren't having it and this happened last Monday he actually the governor had
[3:39:18.540 --> 3:39:23.060]  state troopers standing there trying to block the doors so the Republicans
[3:39:23.060 --> 3:39:27.020]  happened to just walk in they said no we're not having they walked in the next
[3:39:27.020 --> 3:39:31.940]  day Governor Murphy had for some reason the National Guard at this at the
[3:39:31.940 --> 3:39:36.500]  State House now I don't know what's gonna happen I believe this Monday coming up
[3:39:36.500 --> 3:39:41.900]  there's going to be another vote and I don't know what's gonna happen but I mean
[3:39:41.900 --> 3:39:46.380]  I don't know what what they're gonna try to do it's it's not a law it's
[3:39:46.380 --> 3:39:52.500]  unconstitutional so I mean they're gonna be there again Monday well it's just like
[3:39:52.500 --> 3:39:56.900]  Jane Fonda said COVID has been a gift to the Democrats COVID has been a gift to
[3:39:56.900 --> 3:40:01.900]  the left they've been able to get so many power grabs and and accomplish just
[3:40:01.900 --> 3:40:06.340]  so much so much even little things like the one you're describing to just even
[3:40:06.340 --> 3:40:11.300]  get little tiny power grabs I mean just it every element I mean it's just
[3:40:11.300 --> 3:40:15.580]  amazing to watch these people seize so much power from what they claim is such
[3:40:15.580 --> 3:40:19.180]  a tragedy and it just goes to show you it was never about COVID for the
[3:40:19.180 --> 3:40:22.620]  Democrat Party the only reason they're promoting all these things is because
[3:40:22.620 --> 3:40:27.020]  they love the power they're able to seize from it and they're getting away
[3:40:27.020 --> 3:40:30.140]  with it here in New Jersey and I think that cat that state capital thing is
[3:40:30.140 --> 3:40:34.940]  like a test run because if you should watch actually Governor Murphy's COVID
[3:40:34.940 --> 3:40:38.980]  briefings because they're very cultish I mean you should watch the most recent
[3:40:38.980 --> 3:40:44.300]  one from this past Monday we even say even talk about it on there I think it's
[3:40:44.300 --> 3:40:47.900]  a test run because Governor Murphy did say in previous COVID briefings that he
[3:40:47.900 --> 3:40:53.420]  was gonna file the footsteps of New York Colorado and California so I think it's
[3:40:53.420 --> 3:40:57.780]  a test run here at the Capitol I you know I do think he's gonna start trying
[3:40:57.780 --> 3:41:02.860]  to implement you can't go into like a restaurant without this past well they
[3:41:02.860 --> 3:41:07.180]  got in New York City they they they try they try to claim the Democrats in New
[3:41:07.180 --> 3:41:10.980]  York try to claim that they have laws where you have to show a vaccine
[3:41:10.980 --> 3:41:14.300]  passport to go anywhere and now you also have to have a mask so you have to
[3:41:14.300 --> 3:41:20.500]  have a vaccine passport proof of oxidation and a mask now in New York the
[3:41:20.500 --> 3:41:25.500]  law it's not a law actually well the one the court had already shut down the
[3:41:25.500 --> 3:41:29.500]  Blasio's first mandate I just read an article the other day oh yeah oh they
[3:41:29.500 --> 3:41:33.020]  have all been struck down previous ones done yes or what you know they think
[3:41:33.020 --> 3:41:37.500]  people are dumb oh I I said you have to do this now you have to go do this and it
[3:41:37.500 --> 3:41:41.780]  does get people to go out and do this unfortunately you know I've had I've
[3:41:41.780 --> 3:41:46.500]  had like two situations here in Texas where I try to go into a building or
[3:41:46.500 --> 3:41:49.940]  something and they they asked me about a mask I've never been asked about a
[3:41:49.940 --> 3:41:52.900]  vaccine or a vaccine card but I have been asked about a mask and when I
[3:41:52.900 --> 3:41:55.940]  explain I'm like that's that's illegal there's laws you can't make me wear a
[3:41:55.940 --> 3:42:01.580]  mask a couple times they backed off the other was in a or I'll just leave the
[3:42:01.580 --> 3:42:05.140]  other was in a federal building and they wouldn't back off and I mean I had to
[3:42:05.140 --> 3:42:09.580]  go in so I had to put on a mask it's you know that's that's what they do doesn't
[3:42:09.580 --> 3:42:13.420]  matter that's illegal doesn't matter that there's no law they just enforce it
[3:42:13.420 --> 3:42:17.520]  they're now they're now and that's why every every just just liberal leftist
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:20.580]  out on the streets loves it because then they become tiny little dictators too
[3:42:20.580 --> 3:42:24.060]  and they love that they love being able to tell you what to do
[3:42:24.060 --> 3:42:28.700]  absolutely the majority is really bad I just I don't even know if I could do it
[3:42:28.700 --> 3:42:33.580]  anymore here the kids are still wearing masks in school and one judge there's a
[3:42:33.580 --> 3:42:39.780]  huge class action lawsuit that I'm that I'm a part of actually and this one judge
[3:42:39.780 --> 3:42:43.980]  literally still sits there and says oh it's for help now it has to be appealed
[3:42:43.980 --> 3:42:48.300]  how is it for help when nobody else adult I don't know how anybody lives in
[3:42:48.300 --> 3:42:51.900]  these in these cities anymore that require masks and vaccine I really don't
[3:42:51.900 --> 3:42:55.740]  I don't know how anybody puts up with that Frank in North Carolina thanks for
[3:42:55.740 --> 3:42:57.940]  holding
[3:42:57.940 --> 3:43:02.780]  get our great bag of it here I mean this is from people say why is it from
[3:43:02.780 --> 3:43:07.020]  Chiapas Mexico the communists well that's where some of the best coffee in the
[3:43:07.020 --> 3:43:11.620]  world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than
[3:43:11.620 --> 3:43:15.140]  Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy from the little farmers that you know the
[3:43:15.140 --> 3:43:18.260]  media calls communist but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is
[3:43:18.260 --> 3:43:21.740]  is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican
[3:43:21.740 --> 3:43:24.500]  government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[3:43:24.500 --> 3:43:27.500]  been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff
[3:43:27.500 --> 3:43:31.740]  sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[3:43:31.740 --> 3:43:34.260]  think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up
[3:43:34.260 --> 3:43:39.300]  America Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally in fact I'm gonna tell
[3:43:39.300 --> 3:43:49.140]  you a little story anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund

[3:44:19.420 --> 3:44:25.540]  future over to them they want control of procreation they want control of the
[3:44:25.540 --> 3:44:29.620]  relationships between men and women they want to bring a form of living death

[3:48:33.780 --> 3:48:37.620]  on this what we're going through today and what we're seeing happen in the
[3:48:37.620 --> 3:48:45.340]  world is at a biblical level is at a prophetic level and I just want to let
[3:48:45.340 --> 3:48:51.100]  people know like this is that and we know that it's going to unfold the way it's
[3:48:51.100 --> 3:48:57.460]  going to and that there's going to be a mass depopulation and we're going to see
[3:48:57.460 --> 3:49:03.020]  all this evil pour out and judgment it's going to come upon the nations all
[3:49:03.020 --> 3:49:11.100]  we all we can do and all we have is God all we have is our Lord all we have is
[3:49:11.100 --> 3:49:16.420]  him we can't do anything else we have to turn to you who are we have to turn to a
[3:49:16.420 --> 3:49:23.140]  son Yeshua and confess who he is because there's no way out of this and I'm not
[3:49:23.140 --> 3:49:30.740]  trying to be grim or pessimistic but he's only hope he's only way out on the
[3:49:30.740 --> 3:49:37.540]  level of corruption the genetic editing the everything we're seeing is is this
[3:49:37.540 --> 3:49:44.380]  madness we're seeing evil pouring at a level that hasn't been poured out and
[3:49:44.380 --> 3:49:51.460]  since the beginning of the age since the beginning of the world what's so shocking
[3:49:51.460 --> 3:49:56.500]  to me is not those that do evil they're not as shocking to me what's shocking to
[3:49:56.500 --> 3:50:01.900]  me is the people that's that that see it and don't stand against it or or deny it
[3:50:01.900 --> 3:50:05.620]  I mean that that's that's the real shocking thing that's the real shocking
[3:50:05.620 --> 3:50:09.620]  element to me I mean evil humans have always existed throughout history
[3:50:09.620 --> 3:50:14.140]  human humans have always tried to enslave and conquer humans and nations I
[3:50:14.140 --> 3:50:19.620]  mean this is obviously well documented but it's those that ignore it or deny it
[3:50:19.620 --> 3:50:27.500]  that really shocked me even more I would say we're we're seeing people given
[3:50:27.500 --> 3:50:32.140]  over onto the spiritual delusion this the spirit of the Antichrist they're
[3:50:32.140 --> 3:50:37.300]  they're God haters they're lovers of themselves they're in it's we're all
[3:50:37.300 --> 3:50:43.460]  falling but we're seeing this at a at a level where it's it's good where we're
[3:50:43.460 --> 3:50:48.140]  seeing evil being approved of and we've seen this happen in multiple you know
[3:50:48.140 --> 3:50:52.340]  civilizations throughout time and these civilizations fall but we're seeing this
[3:50:52.340 --> 3:50:57.100]  at like a global level before it was just in one part of the world but we're
[3:50:57.100 --> 3:51:03.620]  seeing it all over the world and it's it's just destructive it's killing it's
[3:51:03.620 --> 3:51:09.140]  destroying and separating our body and mind is disconnecting us from God is
[3:51:09.140 --> 3:51:13.020]  disconnecting us from each other with this covert thing with these vaccines is
[3:51:13.020 --> 3:51:19.420]  disconnecting us from our families is disconnecting us from creation absolutely
[3:51:19.420 --> 3:51:23.340]  and that's why the answer is getting reconnected with those things to start
[3:51:23.340 --> 3:51:27.340]  the healing process Emmanuel thank you so much great call let's go to Kelly in
[3:51:27.340 --> 3:51:31.500]  Wisconsin Kelly you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead hi there thanks for
[3:51:31.500 --> 3:51:37.820]  having me I live about 30 minutes away from Waukesha so I just wanted to thank
[3:51:37.820 --> 3:51:42.340]  you for always keeping that story alive oh what story I never heard of a story
[3:51:42.340 --> 3:51:46.260]  nothing happened in Waukesha I haven't heard anything right the car that drove
[3:51:46.260 --> 3:51:51.940]  itself oh there was that car accident yes yes yes so I just thank you for
[3:51:51.940 --> 3:51:56.380]  keeping that story alive because there's obviously a lot of post post traumatic
[3:51:56.380 --> 3:52:00.580]  stress and physical healing that's still happening but it's a great community my
[3:52:00.580 --> 3:52:05.980]  husband works there I lived there for a while so anyway I have a question and I
[3:52:05.980 --> 3:52:12.500]  have a suggestion the question is could Trump run for the Speaker of the House
[3:52:12.500 --> 3:52:19.300]  position and then if you were elected to that begin impeachment proceedings of
[3:52:19.300 --> 3:52:26.220]  Biden Harris and then become president by default so technically speaking I
[3:52:26.220 --> 3:52:31.260]  guess that would be possible yes I mean Trump hasn't showed any signs he would
[3:52:31.260 --> 3:52:35.100]  want to run for Congress and I think he would probably even maybe look at it as
[3:52:35.100 --> 3:52:40.780]  below him however I did I did hear I believe it was Matt Gates I can't say
[3:52:40.780 --> 3:52:43.340]  for sure but I believe it was Matt Gates he may have been saying this tongue in
[3:52:43.340 --> 3:52:48.140]  cheek that he was going to make Trump the Speaker of the House or nominate Trump
[3:52:48.140 --> 3:52:53.340]  to be the Speaker of the House after the next midterm elections I'm guessing he
[3:52:53.340 --> 3:52:58.660]  was just joking about that but he did say that so I mean hypothetically
[3:52:58.660 --> 3:53:03.340]  technically speaking that could happen I'd say there's about a 1% chance of
[3:53:03.340 --> 3:53:08.580]  any of that happening though I think that could solve our problems that we have a
[3:53:08.580 --> 3:53:13.420]  little faster than waiting for him to decide if he's gonna run but okay thank
[3:53:13.420 --> 3:53:18.260]  you for answering that the suggestion is back to Trump again if but if and when
[3:53:18.260 --> 3:53:23.100]  his truth app comes live or of course as soon as possible doesn't have to be that
[3:53:23.100 --> 3:53:28.820]  event but is it possible for you and Alex and all of them in your hosts and
[3:53:28.820 --> 3:53:35.060]  guests to promote a movement where we all bail on Facebook Twitter instead you
[3:53:35.060 --> 3:53:40.140]  know we've tried to do that before and I've tried to do that before and others
[3:53:40.140 --> 3:53:46.700]  have tried to do that before it just it never works so I just I mean it'd be nice
[3:53:46.700 --> 3:53:51.060]  if conservatives could band together and accomplish something like that but we
[3:53:51.060 --> 3:53:55.580]  never do it Republicans don't take the lead on that it's just not something
[3:53:55.580 --> 3:53:59.980]  that conservatives do activism wise so I understand where you're coming from I've
[3:53:59.980 --> 3:54:03.540]  had that idea I know others have too but it's been tried and unfortunately it
[3:54:03.540 --> 3:54:09.180]  fails every time you're taking my call and thank you for all you do all right
[3:54:09.180 --> 3:54:14.140]  Kelly thank you all right we finish up here with bone crusher bone crusher is
[3:54:14.140 --> 3:54:20.620]  called in from FEMA region Ken bone crusher you're on the air hey Owen how's
[3:54:20.620 --> 3:54:25.340]  it going man you know what I can't even talk today because I've just been listening
[3:54:25.340 --> 3:54:28.500]  all these people and all this crap the globalists are doing and I'm so pissed
[3:54:28.500 --> 3:54:32.820]  off right now so you know what I'm gonna go crush some globalists right now and
[3:54:32.820 --> 3:54:38.100]  that's what I'm gonna be doing for the rest of the day bone crusher out he
[3:54:38.100 --> 3:54:42.900]  doesn't even get to his topic he said on the thing so he was gonna talk about
[3:54:42.900 --> 3:54:49.900]  Josh Dugar former reality TV star at least that's what the headlines say I
[3:54:49.900 --> 3:54:54.300]  never heard of heard him before but you got a rest he had a bunch of you know
[3:54:54.300 --> 3:54:57.860]  they always say child porn but I don't believe in child porn there's child
[3:54:57.860 --> 3:55:03.580]  rape children don't agree to be in porn and folks were talking about infants in
[3:55:03.580 --> 3:55:08.980]  these videos and he had a bunch of them on his computer and so many other people
[3:55:08.980 --> 3:55:16.780]  have been caught with with similar stuff just hard drives full of it and you
[3:55:16.780 --> 3:55:25.420]  have a picture of Maxwell with one of the owners if not the sole owner now of
[3:55:25.420 --> 3:55:30.940]  the Atlantic who was the ex-wife of I'm sorry I'm just trying to go off a memory
[3:55:30.940 --> 3:55:38.740]  here it was the ex-wife of who was it guys Steve Jobs Steve Jobs I believe it
[3:55:38.740 --> 3:55:44.660]  was Steve Jobs ex-wife was yeah Powell jobs I think was her name hung out with
[3:55:44.660 --> 3:55:50.980]  Maxwell owner or part owner of the Atlantic so all this stuff is coming
[3:55:50.980 --> 3:55:57.020]  out about Maxwell and serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and in the midst of that
[3:55:57.020 --> 3:56:03.740]  at the Atlantic publishes a headline that says the myth of sex trafficking
[3:56:03.740 --> 3:56:09.380]  ranks the myth of sex trafficking ranks so yeah there is a Powell jobs Steve
[3:56:09.380 --> 3:56:17.740]  Jobs ex-wife with Maxwell and in the middle of the Maxwell trial the Atlantic
[3:56:17.740 --> 3:56:22.180]  publishes a story that says the myth of sex trafficking rings I don't remember
[3:56:22.180 --> 3:56:28.500]  the exact headline if the crew is searching for it right now but so think
[3:56:28.500 --> 3:56:32.900]  about that though there it is the great fake child sex trafficking epidemic oh
[3:56:32.900 --> 3:56:37.540]  yeah they didn't rescue 17 kids from that house in California and kids and
[3:56:37.540 --> 3:56:45.220]  cages and okay it just doesn't happen folks it's just it's a myth and Epstein
[3:56:45.220 --> 3:56:48.540]  doesn't exist either he didn't have any high-level contacts but see that's the
[3:56:48.540 --> 3:56:53.620]  thing they all run with the fake news stories all the time and this is going
[3:56:53.620 --> 3:56:56.740]  to be the big topic on the war room coming up and you know what these calls
[3:56:56.740 --> 3:56:59.620]  have been so great I may just keep taking calls I may just do four hours of
[3:56:59.620 --> 3:57:05.540]  them but that's what they do is they cover all the fake news whether it's
[3:57:05.540 --> 3:57:10.340]  Jesse Smollett or Russian collusion all the other things that they fake and then
[3:57:10.340 --> 3:57:17.620]  they cover up the real stories like Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell and the
[3:57:17.620 --> 3:57:22.900]  rest of them running a giant sex trafficking ring that implemented
[3:57:22.900 --> 3:57:29.420]  Hollywood implemented business executives implemented politics and you
[3:57:29.420 --> 3:57:32.500]  know obviously the media is trying to cover this up and there's obviously
[3:57:32.500 --> 3:57:37.660]  interest inside the courtroom and influence to try to cover it up but I
[3:57:37.660 --> 3:57:41.380]  mean the longer it goes on the more crazy some of these details are that
[3:57:41.380 --> 3:57:45.300]  doesn't for the Alex Jones show coming right back on the war room though the
[3:57:45.300 --> 3:57:49.180]  tech I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in infowars live
[3:57:49.180 --> 3:57:52.500]  products and that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of ultimate

[3:58:50.220 --> 3:58:55.740]  bad about the vaccines are working for quote dark forces that the FBI and CIA
[3:58:55.740 --> 3:59:02.420]  have been advising him on who these evil groups are they know that all over the
[3:59:02.420 --> 3:59:07.140]  world their poison shot is being banned by major governments and Madonna's in
[3:59:07.140 --> 3:59:11.580]  trouble as well they know that the people are starting to get wise this
[3:59:11.580 --> 3:59:16.300]  depopulation agenda in fact evidence is starting to mount that the shots were
[3:59:16.300 --> 3:59:20.340]  supposed to be soft-kill weapons but they're so deadly they're killing a
[3:59:20.340 --> 3:59:26.580]  higher percentage up front and so people are waking up the weapons work a
[3:59:26.580 --> 3:59:31.060]  little too good they're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars but
[3:59:31.060 --> 3:59:35.420]  instead they're making too big of a noise but it's too late for return back
[3:59:35.420 --> 3:59:40.020]  now they're coming after our children so it's up to us to protect our little
[3:59:40.020 --> 3:59:49.300]  children or God will not look favorably on us remember God is watching if you
[3:59:49.300 --> 3:59:54.940]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
