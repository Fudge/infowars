[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:40.420]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.420 --> 00:49.740]  my friends we are live it is Tuesday the 25th day of September 2012 I am your
[00:49.740 --> 00:55.060]  host Alex Jones we're going to be here Lord willing for the next three hours I
[00:55.060 --> 01:01.620]  had a chance to take a couple days off and take my son camping we went hunting
[01:01.620 --> 01:05.260]  but it really turned into camping we didn't do much hunting and it just
[01:05.260 --> 01:12.860]  always gives you a chance to reflect on things and also people watch and I have
[01:12.860 --> 01:17.260]  of course studied the scientific ramifications of this it's not just my
[01:17.260 --> 01:25.300]  opinion but more and more I realize what we really face is a population that is
[01:25.300 --> 01:34.860]  in a trance like medical state the general public is in a trance like
[01:34.860 --> 01:45.220]  mental state and it is a fact that our food our water our air is being bombarded
[01:45.220 --> 01:53.580]  with chemicals biologicals radiologicals to incapacitate the population
[01:53.580 --> 02:02.780]  for assimilation into this global governance system and I was just
[02:02.780 --> 02:10.580]  thinking over the weekend I couldn't resist be a wireless internet on my iPad
[02:10.580 --> 02:17.260]  reading the news and it was just each story crazier than the last like I have
[02:17.260 --> 02:20.620]  a whole stack of news in there on Rob do's desk I came in yesterday and meant
[02:20.620 --> 02:26.180]  to do a report but ended up compiling even more articles so I'll be doing that
[02:26.180 --> 02:30.300]  report tonight on the nightly news but I should probably go over some of those
[02:30.300 --> 02:34.580]  today and I forgot to get those they're in on Rob do's desk it's a big stack of
[02:34.580 --> 02:41.700]  police state news and you know it's stuff like a woman arrested because her
[02:41.700 --> 02:50.620]  neighbor saw her right YouTube building seven on the sidewalk with shock and the
[02:50.620 --> 02:56.100]  police came and charged her they're charging her with vandalism even though
[02:56.100 --> 02:59.780]  the chalk is sold everywhere and it washes off the street and it's clearly
[02:59.780 --> 03:04.580]  the first amendment and highly protected it reminded me of that Marine Corps
[03:04.580 --> 03:10.340]  veteran honorably discharged who posted on his Facebook about 9-11 being an
[03:10.340 --> 03:20.380]  inside job one of our listeners and when the psychiatrist got him alone you know
[03:20.380 --> 03:27.660]  that was the big issue was that he was a person that questioned terror events you
[03:27.660 --> 03:32.020]  see that's what the system scared of because all of their illegitimate power
[03:32.020 --> 03:41.700]  grab they rationalize it by saying we're protecting you from al-Qaeda and that's
[03:41.700 --> 03:48.700]  basically how they've been able to take over our society here it is the Napa
[03:48.700 --> 03:54.020]  Valley Register sidewalk chalking provokes police provokes police of course
[03:54.020 --> 03:57.580]  maybe next time the chalk will threaten the officers and she'll have to be
[03:57.580 --> 04:09.780]  killed Houston PD kills wheelchair-ridden schizophrenic WWW double amputee armed
[04:09.780 --> 04:17.620]  with a pin and he had a pin in his hand he was yelling over a pack of cigarettes
[04:17.620 --> 04:22.580]  that had been stolen and so they shot him and the great part about this is the
[04:22.580 --> 04:27.060]  police chief says that they did the right thing and they talk about how they
[04:27.060 --> 04:32.060]  took care and dealt with the civilian I love the military terminology and they're
[04:32.060 --> 04:43.300]  federalizing the police as well I've come to the realization that well that we
[04:43.300 --> 04:47.820]  were right about everything basically and those of you that like living in
[04:47.820 --> 04:54.140]  slavery those of you that enjoy it you're gonna get a lot more of it so

[05:03.980 --> 05:08.060]  farmers Americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses
[05:08.060 --> 05:11.980]  but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[05:11.980 --> 05:15.740]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[05:15.740 --> 05:19.260]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[05:19.260 --> 05:22.420]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[05:22.420 --> 05:25.220]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found
[05:25.220 --> 05:29.140]  across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat Miso
[05:29.140 --> 05:33.580]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk
[05:33.580 --> 05:36.940]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant
[05:36.940 --> 05:40.300]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods
[05:40.300 --> 05:43.780]  legally and privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these

[08:42.820 --> 08:49.220]  state that they call a new world order truly just all the old tyrannies mixed
[08:49.220 --> 08:56.460]  together and tied together by high-tech systems of surveillance and domination
[08:56.460 --> 09:03.540]  it is Tuesday the 25th day of September 2012 we're gonna be live here for the
[09:03.540 --> 09:09.260]  next three hours and coming up for about 30 minutes in the second hour we're
[09:09.260 --> 09:14.900]  gonna talk to Carl Mayer via video Skype Chris Hedges lawyer the Pulitzer
[09:14.900 --> 09:19.580]  Prize winner it was almost a few weeks ago we want to break down the National
[09:19.580 --> 09:26.260]  Defense Authorization Act in the court battle that is ongoing right now the
[09:26.260 --> 09:30.540]  injunctions the counter injunctions and the fact that it's going to the Supreme
[09:30.540 --> 09:38.180]  Court this is one of the most important court cases in US history no doubt so
[09:38.180 --> 09:46.420]  this is all all coming up today we will have open phones as well on any subject
[09:46.420 --> 09:53.740]  you'd like to raise any point I have basically self-diagnosed the fact that
[09:53.740 --> 10:02.340]  I am absolutely completely overwhelmed and I know you are as well every day for
[10:02.340 --> 10:08.380]  instance there are stacks of confirmed human experimentation against US
[10:08.380 --> 10:14.180]  military troops veterans you name it I mean I have a investigation here that
[10:14.180 --> 10:23.700]  hasn't even broken yet that is confirmed with the government pumping toxic gas
[10:23.700 --> 10:33.780]  into hospitals just to see what it does to patients I have reports here with
[10:33.780 --> 10:40.060]  more scientists bragging that they know the GMO is having backdoor traits added
[10:40.060 --> 10:47.900]  to it to sterilize you and give you cancer we're being murdered I mean it
[10:47.900 --> 10:52.020]  really all comes down to that all the rest of the news is just just window
[10:52.020 --> 11:00.180]  dressing on the road to dehumanization but in the final equation all of the
[11:00.180 --> 11:07.580]  minions of the system all of the servants of the system they themselves are
[11:07.580 --> 11:13.220]  being killed by the globalist you see this is all about testing how much
[11:13.220 --> 11:17.020]  poison they can put in the food and water how many diseases they can give us
[11:17.020 --> 11:23.460]  and will we notice when type 2 diabetes is up over 3,000 percent the general
[11:23.460 --> 11:27.900]  population the last 25 years it's up even higher in Hispanics and Native
[11:27.900 --> 11:36.060]  Americans they want to see if we'll notice that autism's up from 25,000
[11:36.060 --> 11:42.340]  300 and something to 1 in 58 if you add boys and girls together it's even higher
[11:42.340 --> 11:46.660]  if you take the girls out of the equation or that breast cancer is up
[11:46.660 --> 11:50.300]  several thousand percentage points and that we lead the world in that gut
[11:50.300 --> 11:53.980]  disorders we lead the world in that obesity we lead the world in that
[11:53.980 --> 11:58.220]  retardation we lead the world in that chromosomal disorders we lead the world
[11:58.220 --> 12:02.420]  in that neurological disorders we lead the world in that I mean this isn't me
[12:02.420 --> 12:08.100]  just saying let's go look it up we are being devastated right now and the
[12:08.100 --> 12:15.100]  general public is so fed driven and so hollow and it's not their fault they were
[12:15.100 --> 12:20.980]  raised like this that all they're talking about is the referee call you
[12:20.980 --> 12:27.140]  guys print me some stuff on that the referee called it's some NFL game
[12:27.140 --> 12:31.540]  because the the referees are on strike or something I don't know I was
[12:31.540 --> 12:38.900]  exercising this morning and all I heard adults talking about was this and this is
[12:38.900 --> 12:43.500]  out of the park by the way and I'm having to listen to this and then I get
[12:43.500 --> 12:47.260]  into the office and Dan Badan he's like yeah you watch this is all anybody's
[12:47.260 --> 12:51.940]  gonna want to talk about is this referee thing it is such an assault on the
[12:51.940 --> 12:59.980]  mind to know that we are under sustained globalist attack not my opinion
[12:59.980 --> 13:07.380]  absolute fact and pediatric diseases are off the chart it makes me so upset for
[13:07.380 --> 13:14.420]  all these children and women are being chopped up left and right little girls
[13:14.420 --> 13:18.260]  five six seven eight years old are getting ovarian cancer something that
[13:18.260 --> 13:22.140]  never happened to women were you know at least in their 30s or 40s I mean
[13:22.140 --> 13:28.660]  they're killing us and it's all a big test to see how much they can do to us
[13:28.660 --> 13:34.100]  before we even notice and then also siphoning off all of the profit all
[13:34.100 --> 13:38.580]  of the energy we accrue because that's what money in the bank is is symbols of
[13:38.580 --> 13:43.740]  energy all the savings we accrue is siphoned off through the medical
[13:43.740 --> 13:53.180]  complex this weekend I talked to no less than six people who just had best
[13:53.180 --> 14:02.900]  friends wives husbands neighbors die while having minor surgeries from flesh
[14:02.900 --> 14:09.300]  eating bacteria basically I mean the hospitals the statistics are there they
[14:09.300 --> 14:17.140]  are the number one most dangerous place in the country they are factories of
[14:17.140 --> 14:27.060]  unmitigated death I was in somebody's house this weekend and they have a
[14:27.060 --> 14:31.940]  lady that comes over a couple times a week to clean the house and I walk in
[14:31.940 --> 14:40.620]  there this is actually family and in the middle of the table is fluoride water
[14:40.620 --> 14:46.820]  for babies and I said I know you know this is really bad I said who's drinking
[14:46.820 --> 14:51.740]  this and they said look she brings her baby here when she cleans she's not
[14:51.740 --> 14:55.100]  gonna listen she's about to get out of nursing school I said yeah but the
[14:55.100 --> 15:01.260]  American Medical Association says children under section at fluoride and the
[15:01.260 --> 15:05.460]  answer was she doesn't care she's she listens to the AMA and I'm like but I
[15:05.460 --> 15:12.700]  just said the AMA has been forced now six years ago to admit don't give
[15:12.700 --> 15:21.180]  children Florida to paste her water but doesn't matter the store says fluoride
[15:21.180 --> 15:25.100]  for babies and it's was it three or four parts per million that's many times
[15:25.100 --> 15:28.620]  higher than what's in the water supply which is admitted in the big new Harvard
[15:28.620 --> 15:33.420]  study to cause 20-point IQ reduction on average that's the average between being
[15:33.420 --> 15:41.740]  really smart and being stupid folks and bone cancer you name it but see they do
[15:41.740 --> 15:46.140]  they tell the nursing students still have fluoride water they tell them you
[15:46.140 --> 15:50.340]  got to take vaccines or you can't have a job
[15:50.940 --> 15:57.100]  and the average people they're hiring to be nurses literally couldn't tie their
[15:57.100 --> 16:05.700]  shoelaces now and my point is is it's very painful to not even be able to
[16:05.700 --> 16:11.940]  communicate with people by the way it's caused a big fewer or that the Harvard
[16:11.940 --> 16:15.420]  studies has that stupid name Harvard on it there's thousands of studies of
[16:15.420 --> 16:22.740]  thousands over 2,000 going back 100 years or so on the effects of not a
[16:22.740 --> 16:27.900]  little bit of calcium fluoride you need but sodium fluoride when they manipulate
[16:27.900 --> 16:31.220]  the molecular structure the type of acid they put in your water makes it
[16:31.220 --> 16:34.580]  hundreds of times more deadly according to the brain surgeons and scientists we've
[16:34.580 --> 16:40.180]  interviewed and it goes in there and it and it's an adjuvant for everything else
[16:40.180 --> 16:43.620]  toxic in your body and fills up the thyroid in other areas and blocks them
[16:43.620 --> 16:48.220]  from getting the good minerals and things you need
[16:48.220 --> 16:56.340]  but I was just thinking about not being able to get through to people because
[16:56.340 --> 17:04.500]  they have a hypnotic conditioning point they have a hypnotic compulsion
[17:04.500 --> 17:09.940]  basically implanted in them that's what this is and so many people when you
[17:09.940 --> 17:14.660]  warn them they get this weird little smile on their face and then they laugh
[17:14.660 --> 17:25.380]  at you and that's the compulsion they've been programmed with and so basically
[17:25.380 --> 17:29.260]  it's like people slitting their wrist collectively and just easing back into a
[17:29.260 --> 17:35.940]  hot bath to keep their veins open that's what our society's done and so now
[17:35.940 --> 17:41.380]  there's a lot of heat on Harvard because they actually told the truth their
[17:41.380 --> 17:46.380]  big medical center study about the precious fluoride no one wants to admit
[17:46.380 --> 17:50.780]  you know that this has been done to us sprayed on the crops put in hundreds of
[17:50.780 --> 17:56.100]  parts per million in so many different canned foods I mean just brain damaging
[17:56.100 --> 18:01.900]  level I didn't need to be told that stuff was in canned foods when I was a kid I
[18:01.900 --> 18:10.860]  got to where I wouldn't eat it because it would give me a horrible headache the
[18:10.860 --> 18:15.900]  Harvard study comes out there's an article at info wars.com on this from
[18:15.900 --> 18:21.700]  natural news.com and Harvard said well yeah the study does show this but it
[18:21.700 --> 18:27.380]  only lowers IQs outside of America there's some new weird spin where they're
[18:27.380 --> 18:34.340]  gonna say but it doesn't hurt Americans it actually says that and so yeah you
[18:34.340 --> 18:38.220]  shouldn't brush your teeth with it or drink it outside of America but it's
[18:38.220 --> 18:42.460]  still okay inside of America I mean that's kind of like the American Medical
[18:42.460 --> 18:46.940]  Association was forced any American National Association in 2006 so I
[18:46.940 --> 18:53.380]  guess that's yeah that's six years ago seven years ago because the law suits
[18:53.380 --> 18:58.780]  never anything come out and go yeah okay it's true sodium fluoride's really bad
[18:58.780 --> 19:02.580]  for you and it gives you fluorosis and causes bone fractures and joint problems
[19:02.580 --> 19:08.980]  and early onset of different types of joint disorders and now they have the
[19:08.980 --> 19:13.460]  early onset of arthritis early onset about you know oh you're 35 it's time
[19:13.460 --> 19:17.620]  to get your Alzheimer's now Crohn's disease is now you know all over the
[19:17.620 --> 19:25.580]  place didn't exist 50 years ago they're killing us they're killing us and it
[19:25.580 --> 19:32.380]  really only comes down to that that's why now I don't even have any adrenaline
[19:32.380 --> 19:35.860]  when a cop gets behind me or when somebody gets to my face I'm just
[19:35.860 --> 19:40.020]  looking at a dead zombie and I even talked to him like that I go go ahead if

[24:14.460 --> 24:18.380]  freedom is knowing what your environment is freedom is being able to
[24:18.380 --> 24:24.020]  move freedom is being able to not be dependent on others and more and more
[24:24.020 --> 24:32.980]  we're losing all of our basic freedoms it is such a basic assault on humanity
[24:32.980 --> 24:39.580]  that so many people don't even value what reality is they just accept whatever
[24:39.580 --> 24:44.180]  comes in the mail they accept whatever the television says they just accept
[24:44.180 --> 24:48.820]  driving down the road that there's a toll road on the road now they just accept
[24:48.820 --> 24:53.340]  that the school says it's the law your child has to take all these shots when
[24:53.340 --> 24:57.780]  it's not the law here's what I want to say before I get into the news and then
[24:57.780 --> 25:08.820]  your phone calls and it's really this bad people run America bad people run
[25:08.820 --> 25:14.380]  most countries of the world and I've made it my life for the last 19 years or
[25:14.380 --> 25:20.820]  so 17 years on air to study exactly what these bad people believe in and these
[25:20.820 --> 25:26.820]  bad people believe you're dumb animals that need to be dumbed down further so
[25:26.820 --> 25:33.260]  you can be gotten rid of in an orderly fashion you're like a group of ugly
[25:33.260 --> 25:37.780]  little stunted trees to them that they want to cut down so that they can plant
[25:37.780 --> 25:45.780]  their garden and it is the ultimate sin from my perspective to have a ruling
[25:45.780 --> 25:53.500]  class that that seeks consciously to distract and physically harm and dumb
[25:53.500 --> 26:00.460]  down the population because when you decide to tell humanity that they're
[26:00.460 --> 26:04.740]  trash humanity then doesn't have any benchmark and decides that they're trash
[26:04.740 --> 26:11.020]  and then things start to degenerate and unravel and then there's the system
[26:11.020 --> 26:21.100]  posing as the societal referee who will fix things as it collapses and people
[26:21.100 --> 26:24.900]  need to come to the realization that they've got all these excuses and all
[26:24.900 --> 26:29.700]  the propaganda at the grassroots level of why government's doing this and why
[26:29.700 --> 26:35.860]  government's doing that and there's always a good reason for it but we do
[26:35.860 --> 26:42.940]  not have benevolent people in charge we have malevolent malevolent the most
[26:42.940 --> 26:50.780]  malevolent people that have ever been on the face of the world so malevolent that
[26:50.780 --> 26:56.220]  I wouldn't be surprised I'm not saying this literally but that's why I came to
[26:56.220 --> 27:01.980]  realization and I can't knock David Ike because they might as well be evil
[27:01.980 --> 27:06.500]  aliens from a distant star system here manipulating us through a hierarchical
[27:06.500 --> 27:12.020]  system to set up a global extermination grip might as well be seven foot
[27:12.020 --> 27:18.660]  lizards folks okay because that's what they're doing to us it's our own
[27:18.660 --> 27:23.740]  species who openly in all their papers say they've created a new species they're
[27:23.740 --> 27:27.460]  godlike they're gonna merge with the supercomputers they're gonna have all
[27:27.460 --> 27:32.620]  the life extension and we're dead and I sit there and I go hey you know when

[27:54.220 --> 27:58.020]  world government let me show you seven eight clips here of world leaders
[27:58.020 --> 28:00.940]  calling for global government and they go well they're talking about a
[28:00.940 --> 28:05.820]  different global government than you and I look at the guy in his suit and I go

[28:49.380 --> 28:52.900]  because we talked about that at dinner and it was just like it was beyond
[28:52.900 --> 28:58.860]  bizarre it was just like hey we work for the system we're not even gonna debate
[28:58.860 --> 29:06.660]  these facts with you let's go let's go drink some wine I just don't you

[40:20.620 --> 40:24.740]  report dot com on the right hand side or you can find it up at info wars dot
[40:24.740 --> 40:31.060]  com and prison planet dot com it's a Paul Joseph Watson article his wife is
[40:31.060 --> 40:34.420]  from China well we break a lot of news out of China because she can read the
[40:34.420 --> 40:40.020]  Chinese and then guess a good job to eon getting all this done you know they
[40:40.020 --> 40:44.500]  were told they better watch themselves reporting on China they they got word
[40:44.500 --> 40:47.660]  from China that they don't cotton to her and her
[40:47.660 --> 40:53.180]  her free speech but she does continue to write articles and contribute to them
[40:53.180 --> 41:02.900]  man charged by I have article here about a man charged for for eliminate
[41:02.900 --> 41:08.740]  stamp at first I'm gonna get to this one man crushed by road flattening truck
[41:08.740 --> 41:25.660]  on orders of Chinese officials so again man crushed by road flattening truck
[41:25.660 --> 41:32.060]  or steamroller man crushed by a steamroller truck on orders of Chinese
[41:32.060 --> 41:45.460]  officials villager attempted to resist forced government relocation and of
[41:45.460 --> 41:50.740]  course we've all seen the famous Tiananmen Square photo of the man standing
[41:50.740 --> 41:56.380]  in front of the tank and of course just a few months ago they released the
[41:56.380 --> 42:03.300]  larger photo that wasn't cropped of more than 20 tanks actually held up by the
[42:03.300 --> 42:06.820]  one man of course later they just ordered the tanks to start rolling over
[42:06.820 --> 42:11.260]  people they thought that that would not allow people to take photos or get film
[42:11.260 --> 42:16.500]  of it once nightfall came we actually have a clip of that an in-game from
[42:16.500 --> 42:22.940]  Chinese television of the authoritarians with pleasure with with with satisfied
[42:22.940 --> 42:26.900]  looks on their faces announcing that everyone would be killed and run over
[42:26.900 --> 42:32.140]  and then we show images of people just all over the place roadkill run over by
[42:32.140 --> 42:40.140]  the tanks and there's a fox com riots they've they've put up suicide nets
[42:40.140 --> 42:46.260]  around the apple contractor plant they have the worst conditions in China the
[42:46.260 --> 42:51.620]  people that have children chain them to light poles guys type in children chain
[42:51.620 --> 42:56.580]  to light poles in China that's the daycare system and they chain them to
[42:56.580 --> 43:00.900]  light poles they'll probably actually turn out better than children brought up
[43:00.900 --> 43:04.460]  in these government brainwashing centers being injected with toxic chemicals
[43:04.460 --> 43:09.580]  and taught how to not tie their shoelaces but what do they say prosperity
[43:09.580 --> 43:18.380]  makes monsters adversity makes men the way Victor Hugo coined it sounds better
[43:18.380 --> 43:26.460]  adversity makes men those prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men but
[43:26.460 --> 43:31.420]  they have the fox calm people suiciding they're now trying to drug the
[43:31.420 --> 43:36.980]  employees to make them submit they have robots that watch them for vital signs to
[43:36.980 --> 43:40.460]  see if there's any problems to call the authorities to take away the biological
[43:40.460 --> 43:48.020]  land ride yeah if you scroll down you can then see the photo we have it up at
[43:48.020 --> 43:54.780]  prism planet TV of children chain to the light poles but again continuing they
[43:54.780 --> 44:02.860]  now test you to at the medical eyes is in 21 tyranny centers and if you are
[44:02.860 --> 44:13.980]  pregnant well you have the abortion or you're kicked out of Foxcom see this this
[44:13.980 --> 44:19.300]  world is going on a course but people that watch television all day and watch
[44:19.300 --> 44:26.500]  NFL football 24-7 and Sports Center and women that watch their their dramas and
[44:26.500 --> 44:31.900]  soap operas and everybody in the industrialized world who's doing okay
[44:31.900 --> 44:36.020]  we just think everything's a big wonderland it's all a big party then you
[44:36.020 --> 44:44.620]  wonder why you're unfulfilled and then the rest of the world that's deeper in
[44:44.620 --> 44:50.180]  this new world water than we are they're worse off under globalism they're in
[44:50.180 --> 44:56.340]  living hells it comes out on the African and Indian newspapers that they catch
[44:56.340 --> 45:02.460]  the UN and World Health Organization injecting people with live syphilis live
[45:02.460 --> 45:11.380]  polio live HIV tetanus has hormones added to it to sterilize them it all comes
[45:11.380 --> 45:17.340]  out that you know the BBC even had to admit 10 years ago that they did a big
[45:17.340 --> 45:25.140]  medical study and that in one African country 47% of the people under 20 had
[45:25.140 --> 45:32.500]  HIV and they had medical doctors look at thousands of the young women and they
[45:32.500 --> 45:40.060]  did not have their their hymen broken they had never had intercourse and they
[45:40.060 --> 45:47.740]  had been injected when they were given a smallpox shot with the HIV and the
[45:47.740 --> 45:58.820]  answer was well the they must have been the UN must have been sharing needles and
[45:58.820 --> 46:03.060]  I'm supposed to sit here and you know go to a bar today if I was a cool guy you
[46:03.060 --> 46:09.740]  know a well-adjusted guy I'd go to a bar today and I'd pull up my chair and I
[46:09.740 --> 46:20.500]  would impress the guys with how much I knew about football but but when you
[46:20.500 --> 46:23.580]  actually talked to other guys about football it's all hollow it's not even
[46:23.580 --> 46:34.180]  real it's like a thing they just do most of them because that's what men do men
[46:34.180 --> 46:37.180]  give their kids fluoride toothpaste they give them all the shots they wonder why
[46:37.180 --> 46:43.500]  junior can't talk at age 10 you know you wear a football jersey you bow up to
[46:43.500 --> 46:47.020]  people if they look at you wrong but then if they actually want to fight you
[46:47.020 --> 46:51.460]  you you cower people don't really get in fights that much anymore they just start
[46:51.460 --> 46:55.740]  one with you when you go okay let's go oh then they get scared back off see
[46:55.740 --> 47:02.100]  everything's about imagining you're tough I see all these bureaucrats and
[47:02.100 --> 47:09.180]  people look at people with anger and and and hatred and power you know I see
[47:09.180 --> 47:13.420]  cops bow up to people and walk up to families and you know try to intimidate
[47:13.420 --> 47:17.620]  them it's very it's very pathetic you mean you feel sorry for them not all the
[47:17.620 --> 47:23.780]  cops do it before I even saw this article Sunday night about people having
[47:23.780 --> 47:27.820]  the police called on them nationwide not just Florida if you pay even with a
[47:27.820 --> 47:33.340]  $20 bill now or if you pay with cash at a toll booth even with a $5 bill that's
[47:33.340 --> 47:41.220]  in the news we were driving back for we drove to and from East Texas and I
[47:41.220 --> 47:45.060]  decided to take the toll roads in Austin all the new roads they built the last
[47:45.060 --> 47:49.300]  15 years or toll roads and and I happened to read the records it was all
[47:49.300 --> 47:56.940]  built over 90% was was built with taxpayer money fully paid for taxpayer
[47:56.940 --> 48:00.180]  money and in the state where I live in other states now does not go to build
[48:00.180 --> 48:06.420]  or fix roads it goes to build toll roads or add a lane or restripe the existing
[48:06.420 --> 48:10.620]  roads to put toll roads on it to give all the profits to offshore companies
[48:10.620 --> 48:20.700]  like Centra Zachary Centra bought last time I checked over 200 Texas papers they
[48:20.700 --> 48:24.340]  have financed the mayor's everybody they pretty much run the towns and now they
[48:24.340 --> 48:28.980]  run the water they run the schools they run the roads I mean I'm a slave so I
[48:28.980 --> 48:32.940]  said I want to shoot some video of this we were driving the RV Richard went with
[48:32.940 --> 48:41.340]  us so we we we drove out on the big 35 loop they've built that's that's a
[48:41.340 --> 48:45.860]  mile mark to go all the way to Canada so that's an average super highway
[48:45.860 --> 48:48.580]  officially but the media just came out and said doesn't exist remember that
[48:48.580 --> 48:52.260]  when Ron Paul was criticizing it he said doesn't exist there were billboards up
[48:52.260 --> 48:56.820]  saying trans Texas corridor first leg of the NAFTA super highway I mean hundreds
[48:56.820 --> 49:00.460]  of billboards Texan saw him she and N went on and said didn't exist see that's
[49:00.460 --> 49:07.740]  targeting people in a trance and he would pay with with a $20 bill because
[49:07.740 --> 49:12.340]  they make you stop every five miles if you don't have the text tag you know the
[49:12.340 --> 49:18.660]  tag thing you just stop every five miles so he gave her a 20 and and and the
[49:18.660 --> 49:24.300]  woman looked at him with her mouth open but the eyes glaring on a power trip and
[49:24.300 --> 49:29.260]  I noticed it was women everywhere going and coming back we also took some of the
[49:29.260 --> 49:34.060]  side junctions in north Austin across Round Rock over to north Austin and the
[49:34.060 --> 49:40.500]  women would rise up in their chairs and stick their chest out and glare when we
[49:40.500 --> 49:47.340]  paid with cash and I realized it's a mentally ill template I've actually got
[49:47.340 --> 49:51.900]  it down to about five different templates people are following one of them I
[49:51.900 --> 49:56.700]  call the I'm a rockstar template you'll see trendies especially and they'll just
[49:56.700 --> 50:02.860]  be standing there under a tree at the park or whatever before they go for a
[50:02.860 --> 50:08.420]  jog or a swim or whatever is happening and they'll have this satisfied look just
[50:08.420 --> 50:11.220]  standing there and I've even walked over and I said what were you just thinking
[50:11.220 --> 50:17.020]  about and they'll go oh I won't talk oh you were just thinking about how you're
[50:17.020 --> 50:21.060]  really cool aren't you and I actually had somebody this morning go how did you
[50:21.060 --> 50:25.020]  know that man I'm telling you I'm figuring all this out folks it's really
[50:25.020 --> 50:28.300]  freaking me out they are like in in well they're not like they're in these
[50:28.300 --> 50:32.260]  trance states and they're following downloaded templates they've been given
[50:32.260 --> 50:38.380]  there's a tough guy template there's a trendy template there's a I've got to
[50:38.380 --> 50:42.980]  write all this up I've got a I've got to put all this down like in a book so
[50:42.980 --> 50:46.740]  people can the number one thing we've got to do is break people out of their
[50:46.740 --> 50:50.260]  trance we got to do it folks and the question is how do you break them out
[50:50.260 --> 50:54.940]  of a trance because they're also pre-programmed when you warn them to
[50:54.940 --> 50:59.740]  go into this little smiley face thing they do of satisfaction I don't know
[50:59.740 --> 51:03.620]  it's weird the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of
[51:03.620 --> 51:08.340]  2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[51:08.340 --> 51:12.660]  in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[51:12.660 --> 51:17.100]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[51:17.100 --> 51:20.820]  and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[51:20.820 --> 51:24.900]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own

[55:04.860 --> 55:13.020]  it's for research purposes so all of this is research by a technocratic elite
[55:13.020 --> 55:17.940]  that absolutely get off on the fact that you're obsessed with Hollywood football
[55:17.940 --> 55:24.420]  how you look all of this you know men are obsessed with with with sports and
[55:24.420 --> 55:29.340]  acting tough while the real world goes on all around you by the social
[55:29.340 --> 55:34.140]  engineers and they decide what color the highway signs are and they decide what
[55:34.140 --> 55:39.300]  your kids eat at school and they decide what your police do and they decide how
[55:39.300 --> 55:43.980]  big your parking spaces are and what type of toilets you've got they run it all
[55:43.980 --> 55:48.580]  and now they're saying they're going to decide who can have kids because you're
[55:48.580 --> 55:55.940]  gonna have to have genetic screening I've got articles here with Michelle Obama
[55:55.940 --> 56:00.300]  deciding what's on your what's on your school menu and mommy and daddy now
[56:00.300 --> 56:04.460]  started in Illinois two years ago it's now happening in Colorado Texas you name
[56:04.460 --> 56:11.580]  it parents can't pack lunches because you can't be trusted forced inoculations
[56:11.580 --> 56:17.340]  are accelerating all across the country outside of law I mean I'm not here
[56:17.340 --> 56:21.860]  trying to scare you I believe you have courage and that when you're faced with
[56:21.860 --> 56:26.220]  the truth you'll want to do something about it speaking of courage we had him
[56:26.220 --> 56:31.180]  on two weeks ago Chris Hedges the Pulitzer prize-winning author researcher
[56:31.180 --> 56:37.580]  journalist who would and and could have been picked up under the NDAA for
[56:37.580 --> 56:42.220]  simply interviewing people his lawyer Carl Mayer will be joining us for about
[56:42.220 --> 56:47.260]  30 minutes we start the next hour to break down exactly where this case is
[56:47.260 --> 56:52.220]  to hear about it being being being having a stay put on it an injunction and
[56:52.220 --> 56:56.740]  that being lifted is it going to Supreme Court we're gonna break down what's
[56:56.740 --> 57:01.100]  one of the most important cases in US history coming up here in a moment I
[57:01.100 --> 57:05.620]  mean I've seen people say as important since the Pentagon Papers the Pentagon
[57:05.620 --> 57:10.340]  Papers was sure about the power of a whistleblower and it was also about
[57:10.340 --> 57:13.060]  exposing that they knew they couldn't win the Vietnam War and it was just a
[57:13.060 --> 57:17.820]  profit-making exercise but this is much bigger this is the government saying
[57:17.820 --> 57:23.420]  will disappear you and execute you or torture you I mean this is the king
[57:23.420 --> 57:28.740]  saying take him away take her away this is this is going back to before the
[57:28.740 --> 57:32.740]  Magna Carta so it doesn't get any bigger this is one of the most important
[57:32.740 --> 57:37.820]  court cases if not the most important since Dred Scott this is like a this is
[57:37.820 --> 57:44.060]  like the issue of slavery well it's not like the issue of slavery it is and so
[57:44.060 --> 57:47.980]  I don't like the people saying is the biggest thing since the Pentagon Papers
[57:47.980 --> 57:52.220]  we've interviewed Daniel Ellsberg it was a very important case this the
[57:52.220 --> 57:59.420]  Pentagon Papers was not one-tenth in my view as important as this NDAA situation
[57:59.420 --> 58:03.260]  and the fact that the right-wing and left-wing establishments are both want
[58:03.260 --> 58:06.980]  this because they're a bunch of tyrants run by foreign corporations that have
[58:06.980 --> 58:12.820]  hijacked this nation we're going into a very long night and if we don't
[58:12.820 --> 58:17.260]  recognize tyranny for what it is and say no to it and speak out against it we
[58:17.260 --> 58:21.380]  will be overrun by it as Thomas Jefferson pointed out the exact level of
[58:21.380 --> 58:25.460]  tyranny we will live under is the amount we put up with I don't forget this

[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:27.580]  all right my friends kicking off another hour here we couldn't be covering a
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:31.380]  more important subject this is a short segment so I'll get to his bio at the
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.180]  start of the next and some stations don't carry this segment most do Carl
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.260]  Mayer has been called to the New York Times a populist crusader and a maverick
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.620]  lawyer and he's a former law professor and service special counsel of the New
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:49.460]  York State Attorney General I won't get into his whole bio now but I just wanted
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:52.620]  to give us a breakdown of what's coming up here he's been gracious enough to
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:59.420]  join us he is the lawyer Carl Mayer.com who has been successfully pointing out
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:04.780]  that the NDA absolutely eviscerates the Bill of Rights and Constitution with a
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:09.300]  secret arrest and disappearance of US citizens Obama goes past that saying
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:15.980]  I'll kill him if I want to and he's here to break down exactly what the NDA is
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.820]  why it's so important and where this case is going because it's a battle back
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:24.500]  and forth with the injunctions and the injunctions being lifted and all the
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.620]  rest of it Carl thanks for coming on with us thank you Mr. Jones thank you
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.660]  very much for having me on your program I appreciate it we appreciate you we've
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.580]  only got a few minutes for you to break here but I wanted to have you know spent
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:41.220]  every minute we could with you what is the NDA for people that don't know well
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:46.340]  it's a bill that was passed in the dead of night last January 31st 2011 signed
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:50.460]  by President Obama when most people were reveling on New Years and what it
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:56.180]  allows is it allows the government to detain in military prisons without right
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:01.660]  to jury route without right to jury trial without right to an attorney until
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:06.540]  the quote end of hostilities which could be forever anyone who is suspected of
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:11.980]  substantially supporting al-Qaeda the Taliban or associated forces and there
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.420]  are no definitions in this law it's basically a law that allows the the
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.300]  American president to detain US citizens in military prisons which goes
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:27.740]  against 200 years of American history and Supreme Court precedent it's it is in
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:32.820]  many regards an unprecedented law it may even be worse than some of the
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:38.180]  detentions that occurred during World War two in it it provides for a almost
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:42.660]  permanent or unlimited detention until quote until the end of hostilities and
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.620]  the hostilities is not defined in the law it's in other words it's an open-ended
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:53.540]  war worse on terrorism so-called but there there is no definitional section
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:58.060]  I've never seen in 25 years of legal practice I've never seen a statute it
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:03.820]  doesn't have a definitional section so this means that under the the law any
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:08.460]  you know a journalist an activist anyone who for example writes an opinion
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:14.420]  piece sympathetic to a any organization not just al-Qaeda the Taliban let's say
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.900]  let's say a Muslim charity or let's say you have a reporter like Chris hedges
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.220]  who frequently is embedded in reports on the activities of these organizations in
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.580]  the ordinary course of his journalistic career any of those people could be
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:33.820]  subject to detention potentially indefinitely without lawyer or trial so
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:38.860]  it's frightening it's Orwellian and we've been fighting against this statute in
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:44.380]  court since January nine month battle and if you want me to update you on the
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:49.440]  status of the fight I could do that it's at your pleasure yes sir we've got two
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.980]  segments about 25 minutes whether you have to break I want to come back
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:57.500]  and continue you'll fleshing out what you just pointed out because they like to
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:02.140]  cite holding you know German agents here during the war and things like that
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:08.700]  as the pretext how they can expand this also as you alluded to the way they
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:12.780]  passed this the way Obama said he didn't want the provisions it turned out his
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:16.980]  lawyers demanded them then he said he wouldn't sign it he did what you think
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.980]  is really behind all this because I mean you probably know more than anybody
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.260]  outside the White House with all the documents you've been able to get and
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.620]  focusing on this and you've been successful and then on top of it why are
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.620]  you the only people out there challenging it so we've also got a salute
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:38.780]  you Carl Mayer comm is the website if anybody needs our prayers and also
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.740]  moral support but also financial support I should ask you how do we do that
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:50.540]  because this guy is fighting for all our rights we'll be back the worst drought
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.620]  in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half

[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:07.420]  prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of

[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:04.620]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.300]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.500]  are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of

[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:08.460]  of what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every dictator
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:12.940]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:18.100]  the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances and a more
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:23.100]  sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.900]  every one of the superstates that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.700]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:54.580]  answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show we could not be
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:09:00.540]  covering a more important issue today the right of habeas corpus that goes
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:05.940]  back to Magna Carta 1215 our bill of rights our Constitution Obama and his
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:10.420]  lawyers wrote and got Congress to pass while denying that they were behind it
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:18.780]  the NDA that was signed on the 31st of December 2011 he had promised not to
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:23.180]  sign it now since then they've said hey it does affect you as citizens in fact
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.740]  we'll kill you and no one will know where you went we'll torture you we'll
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:32.020]  disappear you and we'll do this if we claim you have any connection to al-Qaeda
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:36.740]  Taliban or any other group we name and I've had constitutional lawyers on from
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:43.620]  the left right center you name it to break down the fact that this affects
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:47.700]  US citizens you notice they use the Patriot Act now thousands of times a
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:52.220]  year per state in non-terror related cases all of this is being used against
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.140]  us we're now told don't worry about al-Qaeda it's domestic groups are now
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.100]  the number one threat and joining us to break this down and to spell a major
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:06.460]  hoax the media is running a hoax you heard that federal courts put
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.420]  injunctions against the secret arrest you know just like in the old days the
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.860]  king says take him to the dungeon for no reason take her away take him away
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:20.620]  that's what this is this is pure tyranny and the media has been saying that it
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:25.940]  got overturned that the law got upheld that the injunction got overthrown and
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:29.540]  that's a hoax he's here to break it down I don't normally read a guest entire
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:35.100]  bio but it's hard not to Carl mayor comm is the site you should visit there's
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:39.500]  also a stop the NDA site and contributions are needed the New York
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.740]  Times called him a populist crusader and maverick lawyer he is a former law
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.780]  professor and served as special counsel to the New York State Attorney General
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:53.660]  Mr. Mayor is graduated top of his class from Princeton University and holds a
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.380]  JD degree from the University of Chicago Law School an LLM degree from
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:03.620]  Harvard Law School and he runs the mayor law group LLC as an author of
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:08.460]  several books including Shake Down in Public Domain Private Domination Mr.

[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:16.540]  Group and the other New Jersey Corruption New Jersey Untouchables and
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:20.300]  there's been movies made about the stuff he's covered 60 minutes pieces I
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:24.080]  won't go into all of it but he's a definitely a star lawyer when it comes
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.700]  to fighting for the Constitution and he's successfully getting it right up
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:31.940]  the Supreme Court now with someone else who's a great crusader and that of
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:37.380]  course is Chris Hedges Pulitzer Prize winner who is a plaintiff here because
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:43.540]  he could be secretly arrested in fact I guess even saying the NDA is bad I saw
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:48.260]  a case just a few weeks ago they're resting pro peace rally people in
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:53.820]  California saying protesting war aides the terrorist overseas so you can't
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:59.500]  protest I even saw the Attorney General say that similar things I mean so crazy
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:04.820]  I'm ranting Carl Mayer thank you for coming on dispel the mainstream media
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.940]  deception about where the case is right now and then break down where it's
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:13.780]  going and then why we should be so concerned about the NDA sir thanks
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:17.860]  again mr. Jones and thanks again for having me on the program this is a
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:23.700]  battle for freedom it's a battle for all of our constitutional liberties and
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:31.540]  fortunately your show and and a few others like democracy now and very few
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:36.020]  websites have been covering this battle but the major media both the left and
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:41.740]  the right have virtually blacked this out and to the extent they have covered
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:49.060]  it they've just routinely indicated wrongly that a court just this week upheld
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:54.100]  the law that's not the case the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York this
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:59.340]  week just put an administrative stay which is a temporary stay on the case
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:04.100]  while they hear the appeal they are hearing an appeal from a judge for us
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:09.580]  district court opinion where judge for us slapped an injunction permanently on
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:15.340]  the federal government to prevent them from executing carrying out this law
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:19.380]  and to prevent the government from rounding up US citizens and putting
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:23.900]  them in military prisons it was a huge victory her opinion came out on
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:30.820]  September 12th the Justice Department worked through the following Friday
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:34.660]  evening they were filing papers at 10 30 on a Friday night they worked through
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:39.180]  the weekend and the following morning they they filed for an emergency appeal
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:43.620]  and stay with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which is the next stop before
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:49.020]  the Supreme Court I don't know how the appeal will come out I'm confident that
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:52.860]  we are right on the law this is a pure First Amendment issue people have the
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:58.140]  right to speak to protest and when whether they comment favorably or
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:02.860]  unfavorably on various organizations that's our American right and we think
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.500]  we're going to prevail whether it's in the Second Circuit of the Supreme Court
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.860]  but I want to assure your listeners that we will fight till the last inning till
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:15.580]  the last out on this case because it is so important we have a very distinguished
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:20.580]  group of plaintiffs led by Chris Hedges and Daniel Ellsberg but we also have a
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:25.380]  young group of activists some of whom were involved in the Occupy Wall Street
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.100]  Movement others of whom are one of whom is for example an elected member of
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.860]  Iceland's Parliament who was targeted by the US government simply because
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:41.700]  she dared to make a film that with WikiLeaks that showed that there was
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:49.060]  targeting of civilians in bombings over in Iraq so we have these terrific
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:54.420]  plaintiffs we have we have won this litigation at every step this litigation
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:58.740]  began in January we won a temporary injunction against the government back
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.980]  on May 16th when Judge Forrest issued it and she prevented them from putting this
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:09.500]  heinous law into effect it has been in place from May 16th all the way till
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:14.700]  September 12th where it was made permanent and then the following Monday I
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:22.100]  believe it was the 20 let me see the 21st maybe of September that's when an
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:26.860]  emergency appeal was made to the Second Circuit the government incredibly was
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.820]  claiming that they couldn't conduct the war on terrorism if they didn't have this
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:38.060]  statute to work with and they hadn't said boo about Judge Forrest's injunction
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.540]  which had been in place since May and yet now they're belly aching that they
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:45.100]  can't conduct an entire war on terrorism because there's one statute that
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:49.020]  targets US citizens how many other statutes do they have including the
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:53.500]  Patriot Act including warrantless wiretapping including the targeted
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:58.540]  assassination of American citizens and on and on and on they now have you may
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.380]  you may have covered on your show the the wonderful Washington Post series
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.940]  called top secret government about how they're now over 1200 government
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:11.540]  agencies devoted to this war on terrorism and 1900 private subcontractors
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.660]  devoted to the war on terrorism and they're saying they still need the
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:20.500]  the power to put away US citizens and military jails can they be serious and
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.700]  that's what we're arguing that's what they're arguing that's what we're
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.700]  arguing in our papers that they can't be so well you're right I mean it's a
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:31.340]  giant power grab on even very busy with this case but you may have seen it just
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:36.220]  three weeks ago during the Democratic National Convention the ACLU got all
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.740]  the documents and I couldn't even believe it when I was reading it and I'm
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:45.060]  expecting this peaceful activists that were driving to the scene from the
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:49.100]  state they would pull them out of their cars arrest them and in the court
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:54.540]  filing the Department of Defense was over it asking the local judge keep
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:17:00.740]  these peaceful protesters in jail because protesting is quote low level
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:05.580]  terrorism so now the Department of Defense I discovered just four years
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:12.060]  ago Ron Paul and myself were protesting in 2008 he was in San and he was in
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:17.100]  Houston I was in Dallas protesting the Federal Reserve and it was leaked by
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.900]  good people inside the army that they had army intelligence at each event
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:28.220]  watching us in the crowds videotaping us in plain clothes for terrorism so
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:34.820]  they're basically using the army now against the American people already yes
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:41.700]  and and incredibly when President Obama sent a statement to the Senate before
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:46.420]  this law was passed he said and I'm quoting it goes against 200 years of
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:51.180]  American history that the military would police our streets and yet he signed
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:57.540]  the bill which was a total a double standard a total sell out of his
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:02.340]  civil rights supporters and a total undermining of American liberty even
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:10.180]  during the Civil War in the United States there was a case decided shortly
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:15.460]  after the Civil War called ex parte milligan and it dealt with a Confederate
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:20.180]  sympathizer who's a civilian who is threatened to blow up the governments of
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:25.580]  Ohio and Indiana in a plot to overthrow the north some of the northern free
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:30.780]  states he was put in he was detained in a military prison and an ex parte
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.420]  milligan the Supreme Court ruled even during a crisis such as the Civil War
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:40.580]  US citizens are entitled to the protections of US courts meaning a
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:46.780]  right to a trial by jury of their peers a right to an attorney etc and this
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:51.900]  overturns that precedent and we are confident that if we go to the Supreme
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.140]  Court and we're confident before the Second Circuit that the justices will
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:00.580]  see that and it doesn't matter whether you're left right or centered this is a
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:07.140]  core issue of freedom the one case that the government has relied on is a case
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:12.380]  called ex parte queran which you alluded to before mr. Jones which had to do with
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:19.220]  the detention of Germans German soldiers during World War two well the fact of
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:25.100]  matter there's those were soldiers of a foreign army of a standing army there's
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:28.580]  no such allegation about any of these plaintiffs here and there's nothing
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:33.380]  written into the statute requiring that they be representing a foreign standing
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:41.420]  army one of them was a US citizen recently but even Justice Scalia in an
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:47.020]  opinion cited by Judge Forrest in this case below wrote straightforwardly
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:52.820]  ex parte queran was wrongly decided so it doesn't matter whether it's a
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:57.820]  conservative justice a liberal justice right justice left justice this is a
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:06.020]  core issue of free speech and also of due process you can't have due process in
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:10.180]  this country which the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees if you're
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:14.580]  taken out of the civil justice system and put into some sort of military's
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:19.900]  attention well sure since when in US States do you have the Department of
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:27.700]  Defense coming to a judge and saying keep American protesters in jail clearly
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:34.100]  under North Common all this the military under the Military Commissions Act all
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:40.380]  of this and is is operating domestically we're seeing drones now being used to
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:45.340]  arrest cattle rustlers in North Dakota I mean pulling back from this again we're
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.500]  talking to Carl Mayer he's the lawyer who's been successfully fighting through
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:54.100]  the courts to restore the Bill of Rights and Constitution and due process so we
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:59.140]  can't be secretly arrested why do you historically think that bipartisan we
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:04.780]  see presidents moving towards getting rid of due process what why does the
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:08.940]  establishment want this because you know even corrupt establishments want due
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:13.300]  process because they understand it can be used against them I mean it's such an
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.860]  incredibly dangerous thing I mean even people like Kim Jong-il of North Korea
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:23.340]  the late dictator at least on paper they have lots of rights the Soviets had
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:27.620]  lots of rights the Nazis even had lots of rights on paper this this putting it
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:33.100]  on paper that we live under such a tyranny is I'm a layman but correct me
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.060]  if I'm wrong as a constitutional scholar is this not really some new uncharted
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:44.060]  waters that we've entered here I think it is in it as I said earlier I've never
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:48.420]  seen a statute that doesn't have a definitional section the Obama
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.860]  administration and the Bush administration before it made clear that
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.340]  they wanted to have as much ambiguity and confusion in these statues as
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:00.500]  possible and it's when it's when the ambiguity in the confusion start that
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:06.060]  due process ends and it's when you have unchecked government power to detain
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:10.140]  in military prisons that the First Amendment is extinguished we're also in
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.260]  uncharted territories and that the attitude of the government and all of
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:18.700]  their briefs in their papers is sorry third branch of government sorry judges
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:23.340]  sorry judicial branch you don't have a role during wartime it's the executive
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:27.340]  branch and it's the unchecked war powers of the president that are to
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:33.060]  prevail during wartime I think part of this has to do you ask me why is this
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:36.660]  happening part of this has to do with the executive always tries to grab more
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:41.580]  power and they need to be checked by the other branches what's new here is this
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:46.700]  is an aggressive move against the judiciary which judge force in her
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:50.580]  opinion was very offended by and even suggested in August 7th hearing that the
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:54.220]  government may be in contempt because the government incredibly in response to
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:58.560]  judge force questions said they don't even keep track of whether people are
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.580]  detained under the NDAA so how could they be in compliance with her injunction
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:08.580]  she suggests they may be in contempt so it's the executive branch shunting aside
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:15.100]  the judiciary I also think and I don't want to sound too conspiratorial and I
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:21.020]  don't think I am I think that the corporate elites and the governmental
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:26.100]  elites that run our country are now afraid of the citizenry because for the
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:31.420]  last 30 years this country has been run for the benefit of the billionaires and
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:36.620]  the elite corporations as well as the foreign policy establishment and those
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:40.900]  in government and we've seen a massive decline in the standard of living of
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:45.260]  Americans we've seen an erosion of our civil rights because the people who run
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:50.700]  this country and the corporations that run this country do not want to see a
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:56.260]  moment of protest and rebellion which this country is so overdue for this is
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.900]  the first time in American history we've got 40 years without a major counter
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:06.580]  reaction we've got police now killing people for no reason people in wheel
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:11.380]  chairs I mean it's getting really scary how they're federalizing the police
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.260]  they're training them to be brutal they're training citizens to spy on
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:19.580]  each other people are getting getting arrested for paying with a $5 bill at a
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:23.860]  toll booth I mean we talk about how we're such a free country all we've got
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.180]  left is the First Amendment and I think that's why your suits so important
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:31.780]  people should go to stopindia.org and read the papers read the press releases
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:36.500]  watch the videos and donate as you guys point out this is an attack on the
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:41.860]  press the way this NDAA is written you guys are fighting an NDAA that they
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:48.060]  claim is fighting Al Qaeda and so by the act of me supporting you now I by
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:52.660]  extension I'm doing it because it's written so broadly read the read the
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:58.060]  transcript of the original trial before Judge Forrest and in federal court in
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:03.100]  Manhattan repeatedly Judge Forrest asked the government attorneys can you
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:08.300]  assure me today that these plaintiffs journalists and activists all have no
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:14.020]  fear of being detained under the NDAA the answer repeatedly we cannot make that
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.580]  representation your honor we cannot make that representation your honor we
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:22.140]  cannot make that representation your honor because this law is totally out
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:28.340]  of control in focusing not just on people who give material support or arm
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:33.340]  support to terrorists but it is now broadened out to include speech and other
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:38.900]  conductive expression that should never be penalized in this country and I
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:43.100]  would I would add one other thing Mr. Jones you referred earlier to the police
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:47.260]  I never thought in my lifetime we'd actually see in many cases the police
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:53.340]  is replaced by what look like paramilitary units it used to be when we
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:57.300]  were growing up you would have police officers in in uniforms on the street
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:02.820]  corner and now we have people dressed in paramilitary uniforms throughout the
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:09.340]  country but that is a it is a cultural shift it is a it is a sort of
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.580]  representation of what's happening in the wider society but where the rubber
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:18.100]  meets the road is where is where this whether this law can be enforced or
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:23.500]  not sure tell us where the NDAA is going from here for people that don't
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.100]  understand the different proceedings when does it go to the Supreme Court and
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:32.300]  what we can do to help restore the Bill of Rights and Constitution sure well the
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:37.620]  the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is hearing the appeal now we have a motion
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:43.740]  we're in the middle of writing our breeze now we on a on a motion for a stay
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.420]  pending an appeal where there is an administrative temporary administrative
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:52.700]  stay put put on we want to lift that stay and just have the appeal process
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:56.700]  work out which probably will take a couple of months after that depending on
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:01.460]  how it goes the Supreme Court may or may not hear it depending on whether they
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.780]  want to review it or not I would think they would that process could take
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:10.580]  another few another few months I would expect that we may know the answer in
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:16.780]  the next year or maybe even sooner than that sure real fast what happens if the
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:23.340]  courts overturn it which if there's any sanity left obviously they will and then
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:28.700]  the executive just continues whether it's Obama or Romney I would expect with
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.220]  the belligerence we've seen and the power grabbing by by the executive
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.660]  bureaucracy that we know is really running things that they'll just continue
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:41.980]  to enforce it even though it's gonna be overturned well we'll do everything our
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:45.500]  power not to let that happen we'll file a motion for contempt if we had to judge
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:50.260]  force suggest it suggested clearly that she would invite one if we have to we'll
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.980]  file a motion for contempt if we have any indication that they are continuing I
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:57.260]  can't imagine that they that they would unless they wanted to provoke a
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:00.900]  constitutional crisis and that's what it would become right now it's a
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:04.820]  constitutional standoff basically the executive department is told the judges
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:09.780]  to to take a hike that they don't really care about their review but it could
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:12.820]  turn into a constitutional crisis sure that's why I say that as we've seen their
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:17.620]  posture is we don't even need the NDA Obama's like we'll just kill whoever we
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:24.180]  want right well they haven't you know fortunately until now they haven't
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:28.100]  they haven't targeted citizens within the United States the NDA a target
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:32.140]  citizens within the United States which is why so frightening but it's the
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.900]  entire bill is frightening and that's why that's why we have to fight with
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.660]  everything we have if you can't contribute people can go to our websites
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:43.540]  and volunteer you know we've had we've had volunteer attorneys flying from

[01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:00.780]  cheeses but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:04.620]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.060]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:11.060]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:14.220]  beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.700]  beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:21.420]  Japanese eat Miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:25.380]  kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's

[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:26.860]  over the country we see footage coming in of people on the street videotaping
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:31.100]  and the police come over and say you have to have a permit to videotape when
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:36.620]  there is no law all over the country government is lying and forcibly
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:40.900]  injecting children saying there's a law they have to take every new vaccine
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:49.980]  there is no law anywhere all over the country we are seeing parents told they
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:53.540]  can't pack their children's school lunches anymore but they've got to buy it
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:58.780]  from this government and that the federal government is over what they eat
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:06.980]  the last vestiges of our free republic are being dissolved decimated
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:15.620]  demolished removed right down and you are the target remember that I meant to
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:20.500]  get with the lawyer we had on his cases in the federal courts right now Carl
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:25.660]  mayor I meant to bring up this point but I ran out of time it's in the news that
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:32.940]  al-qaeda is the main force that the West is arming against the Shiite Iranians in
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:40.980]  Iran but also in Syria and Libya and that's admitted now so how can we give
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:47.020]  up our rights because of al-qaeda when our government runs al-qaeda and we just
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:51.540]  have to come down to the admission that we got taken over and the government is
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:58.060]  criminal I don't care if the cop next door to use a nice guy I don't care if
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:01.620]  the school teacher down the streets a nice lady I don't care if the guy that
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:05.980]  works the local water districts a nice fella I don't care if the city planner
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:10.420]  you know it was really good at poker and you guys have fun going out and getting
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:17.740]  drunk they may be nice people individually but at the top it's run by
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:23.900]  wicked people our country has been globalized not just federalized because
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:31.780]  the feds themselves have been globalized and the people running this planet
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:38.340]  don't just not care about our lives they hate us that's why they're in charge
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:46.820]  because they're willing to do anything and so I'll say it again danger danger
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:55.700]  danger alert alert alert we have been seized by criminals they are
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:02.060]  dismantling every check-in ballots they are training and arming up giant armies
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:13.060]  of paramilitary police and others I was talking a while back to a family member
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:19.140]  of mine has been in the army like 24 years there is high up as you can get as
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:25.660]  a non-commissioned officer and they were offered to be over an entire area of a
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:36.580]  base and they said no I want to be a gunner on a helicopter and when asked
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:45.580]  why do you want to be sent back again they said I want to die on a pile of
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:54.580]  brass and they're only allowed to be in the army another year and a half I guess
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:58.900]  officially then you get out and they put you back in and that's all these guys
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:09.340]  even know I mean they are completely programmed by what they've done 24 years
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:21.020]  in every clandestine war battle you name it and doesn't want to come home
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:33.380]  basically just like I guess in the Hurt Locker just wants to be sent back now
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:41.060]  you take somebody like that who who has just become a creature of war stare into
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:51.060]  the abyss long enough you become the abyss wedded to war and war is wedded to
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:58.460]  him Lord knows how much DU he's breathed and I'd imagine when he probably dies
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:04.380]  younger than he should from it it won't even be an issue it won't even be an
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.940]  issue that there won't be people there to actually physically play taps there'll
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:16.340]  be a recording of it because humans are programmable and when we don't
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:20.180]  understand that we're programmable and we give ourselves over to programming we
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:30.780]  lose our humanity we lose our humanity that's why you hear and see all this
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:36.700]  culture about zombies and they got an article out now about zombie bees that
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:42.380]  get a parasite in them and then the bee becomes a host and flies around bumping
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:47.380]  into things and oh homeland security power report saying prepare for zombie
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:52.220]  attacks get food and water that's a sick joke on you they're saying you're a
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:57.340]  zombie they're teaching you that you're dead inside that you're ugly that you're
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:01.580]  worthless that you need to be mowed down because they know during a total
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:10.140]  physical collapse they know that the general public will behave like zombies
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:21.300]  this has all been programmed it's all been prepared it's all been set up and
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:26.620]  once people been programmed they look at you and they don't care if they're
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:33.900]  slaves because they're following the program what is smoking it's a program
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:38.420]  it's not just addictive you get used to buying the cigarettes opening them up
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:43.180]  putting them in your mouth lighting them putting them out it's the ritual
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:50.780]  sexual addiction the same thing drinking same thing all this they know that once
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:56.060]  they get you in the habit of using a cell phone it won't matter if they admit
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.340]  hundreds of studies it's giving you brain cancer doesn't matter if Cheryl
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:04.260]  Crowe comes out and warns you you're going to kill yourself because you're
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:09.260]  used to drinking out of that little pool and it doesn't matter if somebody's
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:13.340]  poison that pool you're like a gazelle that will go and drink from it and watch
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:17.580]  the other gazelles around you die and you'll keep drinking because you're an
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:23.580]  animal and you can't figure out long-term things you're thinking only in the
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:42.980]  moment and so I sit here watching us in a totally planned system I see us being
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:48.020]  destroyed for lack of knowledge and once they get somebody in this zombie like
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:41:03.180]  state a self-satisfied delusion it's almost impossible to get them out of it
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:07.820]  because they don't want to get out of it they don't want out of the matrix they
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:15.220]  want to stay in it I mean it is a fact that for over a hundred years you can
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:20.900]  look at about 1910 as the demarcation point the point of no return that a
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:27.220]  eugenics-based government has been in control not in full control but had its
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:32.460]  beachhead over the federal government began to federalize states so they could
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:40.060]  carry out their eugenics program it's a fact for 40 years they've been taking
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:46.460]  your blood at birth and putting it in a UN database it's a fact that all the
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:52.540]  major GMO crops have had backdoor genes added to them to attack your organs to
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:59.740]  give you cancer and to reduce your fertility your fertility it's a fact
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:06.140]  that they put souped-up acid-based sodium fluoride in the water to wreck your
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:12.540]  endocrine system it's a fact they chose out of thousands of plastic
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:21.220]  formulas one in the 40s that releases estrogen to feminized men hyperfeminized
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:30.900]  women it is a fact that we are being absolutely murdered right now it is a
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:37.260]  fact Rob do we have a major Institute coming on tomorrow that's broken news
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:40.860]  that we're gonna put up as a press release I mean I learned about this
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:46.300]  months ago but they weren't ready to go with it yet of hospitals doing secret
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:53.420]  medical test for the FDA and EPA on their people but well of course that
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:43:01.180]  that that's why in the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s they would take doctors and have
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:09.100]  them start out by doing lethal test on foster children and military personnel
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:16.860]  and prisoners they usually start them on prisoners well these prisoners don't
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:22.180]  deserve to not have dioxin sprayed on them secretly at night so we've got the
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:27.100]  medical end where we put them in there and we spray this on them and then then
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:30.700]  when they die you take part of the cover-up they all deserve to be killed
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:38.780]  anyways when they die you help us dissect them and then next yeah now we're
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:44.340]  gonna do it to some foster kids these kids have bad gene pools these are real
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:48.700]  cases I'm mentioning here and then next you're killing five-year-old kids and
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:58.660]  then next you're at the VA pumping carbon monoxide calling it a test into
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:07.340]  face mask on on veterans kill them God Almighty man I tell you and then they
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:13.100]  take those people and they put them over the heads of your local hospital see
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:17.500]  they put their people everywhere see it's only now that I really figured out
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.620]  that it's really worse than I said and they've got their operatives all over
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:24.820]  the place and the only reason they haven't killed me is because their plans
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:29.900]  going basically on schedule it's a little bit behind and they don't want to
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:34.980]  stir everybody up they got you in a coma they've got you in a trance they got
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:40.780]  you right where they want you and they're gonna kill you they're gonna take
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:45.740]  their time it I use the analogy of back when I had time to deer hunt and liked
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:53.060]  it when I watched you know 20 or 30 doe come out to a deer feeder I wanted to
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:57.780]  wait till a big buck came out a big trophy so when a spike comes out or a
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:01.780]  little six-point comes out or something with a rack you know 25 inches across I
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:07.820]  don't shoot them because I know the big daddy's waiting and watching everybody
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:17.420]  out there to see if they get shot before he comes out or he wants to see what
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:21.700]  happens to that little rut and buck before he comes out and copulates has
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:26.580]  Congress with one of those females and that's exactly they've got this whole
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:36.220]  thing shut up they they founded IBM to do this they founded Microsoft they
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:43.500]  founded Facebook Facebook's the name of the CIA file a computer file for people's
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:48.940]  faces facecans Google if I told y'all this you know many years ago now it's
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:55.260]  admitted because they're people are so deep into the trance now that they're
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:46:00.180]  just throwing it out and everybody's face you see the globalist they haven't
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:04.060]  told me this but I've now reverse engineered it years ago and then I was
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:10.780]  able to later find bits and pieces where they admitted it they believe that a
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:19.500]  show like mine they believe you're so weak they believe you're so pathetic that
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:26.100]  basically all I'm doing is psychologically inoculating you to the
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:31.620]  fact that all of this is being done to you show that when leaks come out and
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:35.100]  things that they don't fully control because they're not in full control yet
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:40.340]  but when they get in full control they're gonna drop the hammer we're
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:44.660]  talking ninety percent eighty percent some of their more lenient documents
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:57.980]  will be exterminated but there they are laying all this out and they believe
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:04.980]  that shows like mine psychologically inoculate everyone that this is going
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:08.620]  on they believe that you're so weak you'll just become comfortable with the
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:15.900]  late things really are because you're so set in the daily rituals the daily
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:22.820]  habits that they've put you into I knew 15 years ago all this recycling and
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:26.860]  stuff was about the system setting the precedent that they tell you what to do
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:32.140]  with something that sounds reasonable and that it was a ritual to ritualize
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:37.900]  doing what you're told and then later I saw government documents and think tank
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:42.100]  documents we've covered them on air where they admit their habitualizing and
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:46.260]  ritualizing all this and setting the precedent with things that sound
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.540]  reasonable on the surface to then come in and say by the way now you're not
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:53.740]  gonna have more than one child and by the way you're gonna live in a tiny house
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:56.700]  and by the way you're not gonna have a car and by the way you're gonna work
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:04.380]  more for less but it's not for the environment it's for their total control
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:10.260]  while all the real environmental crises open-air genetic engineering toxic
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:14.940]  waste dumping all of that just goes on pal mel because these people believe
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:19.260]  they're gonna become God and their religion is about not caring what they
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:24.900]  do they think it's cool to destroy beautiful life force systems they believe
[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:29.780]  they get power from it they had a Satanist 20 years ago kill the treaty
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:36.900]  out big famous oak tree where they signed treaties and things here in Austin he
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:40.340]  thought he'd get all this power by digging into it at night off a major
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:46.580]  road and putting weed killer in it come in these globalists are so evil I mean
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:51.220]  if people knew that I'm not just here saying all this if you knew that I mean
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:49:01.220]  we're facing the pit of hell the absolute pure 100% crystalline evil you'd
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:06.420]  realize none of this means anything I tell you it is it is a wake-up call
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:11.620]  though when you have basically no ego anymore and none of it means anything
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:16.260]  it's not exciting when some movie star calls you up at home it's not exciting
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:19.940]  when some rock star calls you anymore it's not exciting when a good-looking
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:24.340]  woman comes on to you it's not exciting none of it is exciting anymore of
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:27.740]  course I'm more fulfilled than ever but none of it because I know it's all a
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:34.420]  projection it's fantasy land when you look at a beautiful woman on Fox News
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:38.980]  licking her lips looking sexually excited she's looking at a camera she's
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:42.620]  looking at a teleprompter she's been trained to flirt with you but it's
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:48.140]  digital systems being sent through a satellite into your television the woman
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:53.220]  isn't really there and I know you consciously know that but I watch
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:50:00.260]  groups of men watch women on television like it's really their friend when the
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:05.260]  woman flirts with you and folks if you can understand that's not real you can
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:09.780]  understand the rest of it none of it's real none of it matters you understand
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:17.740]  that all that matters is getting these controllers out of control all that
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:22.500]  matters is getting you to wake up at some feeble level so what's going on so we
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:30.780]  can resist this all right the toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99231
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:37.060]  800-25-99231 I'm gonna say it again if you got children every time I look at

[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:13.780]  the right side I do there's so much good in this world there's so many innocent
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:17.260]  people in this world there's so many people that have beautiful hearts and
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:23.260]  beautiful minds who are good and kind and caring and constructive but those
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:29.260]  people are naive because they think the rest of the world is like them and to
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:36.260]  protect the good we have to admit that there's evil in this world
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:42.660]  millions of people a year now but die of bad drug interactions and infections in
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:50.500]  hospitals it's a number one cause of death in this country hands down and the
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:55.740]  reason that's happening is because there's a culture of death in this
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:05.500]  nation and it runs across the board and we're much much later in the ball game
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:10.220]  and most people think or want to even admit that's all I'm trying to get out
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:16.660]  to people all right we're gonna have open phones into the next hour and I've
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:21.420]  got a lot of other news I mean look at Paul Ryan on NFL ref lockout time to get
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:28.900]  the real refs back and then they've got Democrats responding I mean you know
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:35.740]  we're talking about referees in a game while the troops are using depleted
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:41.660]  uranium that is a death sentence to all of them it's just a very screwed up
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:52.180]  society television has allowed the system to do this and the greatest
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:57.580]  mind scientists the world has ever seen have have trained and researched to
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:05.060]  understand every little facet of our minds to manipulate us and the only way
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:11.380]  to ever wake up you know the old term the America slept or the world slept
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:17.060]  while evil grew that's not just a figure of speech people are sleeping and you
[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:22.060]  must awaken so many say well have I awakened what am I gonna do about it
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:28.820]  just the act of awakening means that you will become more informed and then you
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:33.180]  will be driven to warn others and we can turn this around you know the biggest
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:37.380]  message to those that serve the system is you're being targeted by all this as
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:45.220]  well and if you would just research what I'm saying you'd find out I wasn't
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:48.660]  lying to you here's a quick story we'll go to break and come back with your

[01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:09.180]  Austin Texas Alex Jones I was sitting here during the one minute break and
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:12.780]  they brought in the new info wars magazine the October global edition
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:18.140]  don't show it yet I'm gonna announce it officially tomorrow and I was having this
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:24.700]  moment where I was thinking about making a big announcement on air concerning
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:28.940]  the technocracy and then they walked in with this you'll know what I'm talking
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:36.340]  about tomorrow when I show you the cover this is humanity's greatest challenge
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:44.460]  and I do not feel worthy to be here communicating to you truths this hard
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:53.980]  core this huge man I tell you this new this new publication is powerful I said
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:57.180]  I'd go to your phone calls and I do intend to take a lot of them in this
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:07.940]  hour Wow if you like the last issue this is gonna really really blow you away
[02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:13.660]  trying to find the cover story maybe I show people just the cover story you
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:20.060]  know what I'll just do this tomorrow you know it's almost exhausting to take off
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:23.500]  and not be here doing the radio show because my mind's working the whole
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:28.540]  time I'm here and when I stay focused just on basic operations and everything
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:35.260]  else it kind of keeps me distracted from the depths of reality to where it
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:44.540]  doesn't hurt me when I really start researching stuff and confirm that my
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:51.980]  basic analysis has been absolutely on target it's it's it hurts I know why a
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:57.860]  lot of people don't want to admit all this stuff because gosh if you do man it
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:03.660]  is scary but it's not even scary once you understand that it's here this is the
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:08.100]  way it is we got to do something about it it's more just saddening it's very
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:15.140]  pitiful it's pitiful to see people with the pre-programming the satisfied looks
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:19.780]  on their faces when they give you a preconditioned response and you know
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:25.260]  they're like a biological android they're a zombie they were sent in front of
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:29.420]  television from birth they follow all these little templates that make them
[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:33.340]  feel good about themselves and as long as they are feeling good about
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:37.860]  themselves again I'm gonna go to break and come back to your calls it's just
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:41.940]  that I remember being three years old playing Batman and Robin with the
[02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:47.740]  neighbor kid jumping off the front porch with towels tucked into our t-shirts
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:52.540]  and the neighbor kid looking up at me with stars in his eyes and saying we're
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:57.740]  Batman and Robin and I remember being able to pull back from my shelf from my
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:02.620]  body basically see my shelves and the other child standing there and realize
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:07.820]  we're imagining we're superheroes superheroes aren't real I'm on a
[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:16.420]  planet in a universe you know in this galaxy and I am finite and then for
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:20.300]  years having that deep understanding that I was finite and having these
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:25.500]  dreams every night this reoccurring dream where I flew out my spirit flew out
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:32.500]  to the edge of creation God's creation and then there was the nothingness out
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:42.820]  side of God's creation I liken it to a big spinning black obelisk wheel column
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:47.260]  similar to what you see in the first Tron movie but it's not red it's black and
[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:51.780]  all the light goes into it it's like the heart of a black hole and outside of
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:56.940]  that outside of the creation of God outside of space time continuum there
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:04:01.660]  is nothing but the Creator and here I am at three years old having thoughts and
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:05.980]  dreams like this and I now realize that most children have those thoughts and
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:11.380]  dreams and the New World Order's main design is to keep you from spiritually
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:16.980]  maturing which which begins all of you all of that is in you at a seed level
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:22.340]  as a child this whole system is meant to ever keep you from developing so that
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:28.220]  they can rob your spiritual development as Revelation says they
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:33.620]  traffic in the souls of men that's enough your calls on whatever you're

[02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:52.140]  out to you and I'm dropping around a little but maybe it is all tied in news
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:56.220]  week September the first week of September issue first or second week
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:10:01.780]  whole article on how our surgeons are killing us if it were listed as a cause
[02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:06.460]  of death killing people on operating tables would be the six bleeding calls
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:12.220]  of death in this country well yeah well I mean actually yeah just the just the
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:17.460]  surgeon going to have a two-hour lunch while kidney surgery is going on and
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:20.900]  and or or scratching the inside of the heart when they're doing a surgery and
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:25.140]  killing you that is arguably number three four five or six they debate the
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:30.420]  numbers but if you add the bad drugs the surgeries the infections together it's
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:39.300]  number one the hospital is the most dangerous place to go it is a veritable
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:45.020]  death trap do you know who has the lowest life expectancy of any profession
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:55.580]  would you like me to tell you go ahead and tell me sir psychiatrist then indies then dentist then

[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:09.380]  numbers vary year to year but you can look them up for yourself that is the
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:15.020]  most dangerous thing to be I mean that's how unhealthy they are but they're
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:20.300]  going to tell us how to live our lives absolutely okay yesterday my local paper
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:25.420]  here in Marble Tennessee the Marble Daily Times children's death required DCS
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:29.620]  review the revelation that the Tennessee Department of Human Services has not
[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:33.220]  been notified lawmakers of the deaths of or near deaths of children in their
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:37.020]  district is required by law is an embarrassment and it's been going on for
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:40.460]  seven years I'd say it's been a lot longer than that anyway it goes on to
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:46.140]  say that 31 Tennessee children die in the first six months of 2012 while in
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.380]  state custody yeah I was about to say they usually don't even say it in the
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:57.700]  article they'll usually say CPS or DHS needs more money because kids are dying
[02:11:57.700 --> 02:12:01.580]  in the state and then I'll see the article and type it in and find the real
[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:06.620]  case and it's always CPS killing them you know we played a clip we couldn't find
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:12.180]  it was like six seven years ago it was in Arkansas and in one town three kids
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:17.980]  who died in a small town in CPS custody in one week CPS had let their pit bulls
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:24.460]  eat one kid and then two had drowned okay and they had the head CPS guy on
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:30.700]  there going children will die that's just the way it is I mean that's a quote
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:37.960]  children will die just way to seven times more likely from anywhere children
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:44.220]  get rate seven times this is just part numbers look it up seven times more
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:50.580]  unlikely to be sexually abused in their care five times physically five times
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:55.380]  off the charts malnutrition listen one summer I clean carpets I appreciate your

[02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:32.620]  start getting angry Diane in New York you're on the air go ahead hi Alex
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:38.980]  hello welcome I need to tell you that when I moved I talked to you like like
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:44.100]  two weeks ago I was born in Venezuela and one thing that amazed me about the
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:50.060]  American people was how docile they are if you tell them not to do something
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:56.260]  they just obey they don't think out of the box and that's I to me is a huge the
[02:14:56.260 --> 02:15:02.060]  biggest problem that Americans have that they don't they're not able to think by
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:07.260]  themselves they have to be told what to do if they went to South America at least
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:13.100]  to Caracas and try to drive they would go crazy because they're not stop signs
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:19.940]  anywhere not no signs of any kind and if they are nobody respects them so they
[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:25.780]  would die well I mean the issue here is Americans are under hypnotic commands
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:31.860]  look look look in every category we have the we have the highest rate of
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:37.820]  everything bad okay we went from the best 50 years ago roughly to the worst and
[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:43.300]  it's scientific ma'am everything we're under is coming to every other country we
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:48.380]  are under attack if you were going to set up a global corporate eugenics-based
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:51.980]  government meant to exterminate the most of the population so you could rule the
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:56.540]  planet and truly conquer it because I mean when the Romans took over they
[02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:59.860]  killed everybody in most cases the Israelites did that this is actually an
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:04.700]  old program what would you do you take over the richest powerful as country you
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:10.860]  to use it to project power while shutting it down as well you understand so so
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:18.660]  yes Americans are docile we have the lowest IQ not education IQ we're brain
[02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:23.420]  damaged it's a fact we've been under chemical attack so of course we're
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:27.620]  docile ma'am I mean we've been under absolute systematic attack that's why
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:32.140]  I'm not mad at people anymore I learned the clinical stuff of the zombie trance
[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:36.780]  of you know the you know the smile the giggling all of it and it's just another
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:41.700]  victim it's very sad it's very sad ma'am you're in a nation of people under
[02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:47.100]  mind control to varying degrees you're on a country on the way out you're on a
[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:54.900]  country designed for total destruction sorry go ahead it's ridiculous no I
[02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:59.940]  know it's I mean I got a guy who works for me who does a fabulous job from
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:04.460]  Venezuela and he says Venezuelans would never put up with this but then he
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:07.460]  doesn't know why they put up with Chavez well that's because you know he took
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:11.580]  over and made him dependent so it you know it's the same thing but no I hear
[02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:18.980]  you anything else no it was just how amazed I am to see how docile and dumb
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:23.460]  down are the American people it's just incredible well the statistics the
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:27.620]  statistics show it ma'am look we were domesticated I mean they put chemical
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:32.100]  and biological weapons in our food and vaccines I mean most people you see you're
[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:36.500]  gonna be dead in 10 15 years I mean if you follow the statistics the numbers
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:41.820]  of cancer and and and other diseases increasing if this continues in 10 15
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:47.180]  years folks I've seen numbers of in 10 years half the population will have
[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:54.820]  cancer they're killing us let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Washington you're
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:18:03.820]  on the air hello Alex hey buddy I'd mentioned it yesterday when that other
[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:08.100]  guy was on the phone there is an interesting book that is a follow-up
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:13.380]  to what you said when you had that conversation with that e-food direct guy
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:21.340]  was written in 1966 it's called ill fares the land the Plamin famine plan for
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:27.980]  America and it began with the Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1933 under
[02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:35.340]  Franklin Roosevelt yeah and of course the Secretary of State was Wallace whom I
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:42.420]  think you know us about in the agribat agricultural department was the where
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:47.940]  Communist cell Alger his came out of there Harry Dexter White came out of
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:54.140]  there what they told did then was they talked about overproduction that's a
[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:57.620]  problem with America where is actually they were importing food even in the
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:03.820]  early 30s and of course then they were you know trying to tell what stay there

[02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:08.340]  layman's words what is Alex Jones saying a planetary government run by mad
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:17.020]  scientist that controls society via fiat currency that they issue is playing
[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:22.860]  god with our lives and testing things on us and then using what works for
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:27.660]  themselves they give us accelerated cancers and then practice keeping us
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:31.580]  alive with them all different sorts of treatments I mean it's just it's so
[02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:37.540]  unbelievable ladies and gentlemen and it's so in our face and I know I'm
[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:41.420]  getting off in the medical tyranny a lot today it's because that's that's what
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:47.260]  it's all about everything else is window dressing let's go back to the calls
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:51.060]  here let's talk to Peter in Washington Peter you were getting into the
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:55.820]  communist plan they did it everywhere Ukraine they did it in China they do it
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:59.420]  everywhere where they come in collectivize the farms and here they did it
[02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:06.700]  by subsidies which you know at first were you know real good for farmers but
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:11.380]  you can see what it's done over time beef prices are the highest they've ever
[02:25:11.380 --> 02:25:14.300]  been but people are going bankrupt everywhere that actually grow cattle
[02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:18.220]  that's what they call it grow you know beef cattle because they've designed it
[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:22.140]  just like people with natural gas wells are getting almost no money but the big
[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:26.140]  companies are making tons of money everything has been gamed and rigged go
[02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:37.380]  ahead yeah this book ill fares the land he mentions by the way organic farming
[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:43.100]  which he says is a good idea this is 1966 and yes he also is aware of the
[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:47.220]  corporate problem because he said the big problem is to get the farmers stuff to
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:55.980]  market and he's got various solutions for it this is a book you probably can't
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:26:00.860]  find on the internet if you'll put one of your people on the phone afterwards
[02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:05.060]  with an address that I'll just gonna send it to you guys because I think you
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:09.580]  can do more good out of it than I can well certainly we'll look into it and
[02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:14.660]  see if the author is still alive did you want to make any other points about the
[02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:22.580]  communist connection you were getting into I'll just briefly that continued
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:27.780]  on to the Kennedy administration Rose are the Eisenhower administration
[02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:34.140]  Ezra Chaff Benson the Mormon elder who was secretary of agriculture fought it
[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:39.340]  fought that bureaucracy but you know as he points out he wasn't too successful
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:45.340]  because he called his book crossfire and then then it went back again with
[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:49.220]  Kennedy and of course this book was written in the or published in the
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:52.860]  middle of the of the Johnson administration was secretary Freeman and
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:27:00.900]  they were right back to it again that's all I just I just want to send it to
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:08.020]  you guys because you I think you can do more good with it than I can well sir we
[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:13.660]  will put you on hold and we will give you that address in fact I can give it to
[02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:19.340]  you right now it's P.O. Box one nine five four nine P.O. Box one nine five four
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:27.100]  nine Austin Texas seven eight seven six zero P.O. Box one nine five four nine
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:33.940]  Austin Texas seven eight seven six zero and thank you so much sir I really do
[02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:41.420]  appreciate you calling us you know that's the problem with all this is that
[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:46.300]  everything the government does has a propaganda package of how it's good for
[02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:53.460]  you but all of it in the final equation is designed to reduce you down to
[02:27:53.460 --> 02:28:00.100]  slavery and if you look at what the bureaucracy and the government's doing
[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:07.540]  for anyone that studied study basic history it's what authoritarians do it's
[02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:14.500]  totalitarian and it's nasty and you try to talk to the bureaucrats and people
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:21.660]  they were so many of them really get off on it you know I'll be out in public
[02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:26.580]  with my children I was off work most of yesterday taking time off of my children
[02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:35.820]  and I went to the park with my children I went to a store with my children and
[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:46.420]  both places I had people say hey what are you doing playing hooky and in one
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:54.420]  case the guy meant it good-naturedly but still there's that instinct to ask
[02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:58.020]  people what they're doing with their kids not in a government training camp
[02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:02.740]  the first time the guy was wearing a city of Austin hat at the park and he
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:06.060]  said what are you doing playing hooky I said yeah they're not in a government
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:09.780]  training center where they inject him with vaccines for cancer viruses I do
[02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:13.380]  that now in line it's how you know the government's murdering you cancer
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:18.860]  viruses the vaccines that's how you should respond and the guy goes you know I
[02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:24.700]  know I'm a listener I wish I had parents like you when I was growing up now at
[02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:30.380]  the other place the person wasn't a listener we're on the March the

[02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:22.380]  consciousness is such an incredible gift
[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:28.820]  it is so wonderful to be alive on this planet and to see so much of reality
[02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:37.020]  clouded by the poisonous messages that are in TV and embedded in sports and on
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:41.220]  mainstream television whatever I'm on vacation I tend to watch more television
[02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:46.420]  than when I'm at home obviously and it's just everything is laced with
[02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:53.060]  destructive messages all of it and it's simple when you are damaged when you are
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:34:00.900]  dumbed down you're not in the globalist way establishing their world and I want
[02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:06.940]  you to have access to life extension technologies I want you to have access to
[02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:12.220]  the incredible technologies that have been developed to empower you I want to
[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:18.060]  see you empowered I am confident to the point of not being threatened by others
[02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:23.020]  who are successful and that's really the difference between someone like
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:30.100]  myself and the establishment it is inviting when I was crawling up my
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:35.060]  shelf from nowhere to reaching tens of millions conservatively a week when I
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:39.580]  got attacked by other crabs in the bucket it was inviting to join the
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:46.700]  establishment but thank God I never did because now that I know more it is so
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:50.860]  uninviting and I'll go back to your calls but by that let me just break this
[02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:57.660]  down here briefly have you ever caught a bunch of crabs or crawdads for that
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:35:04.300]  matter crayfish and you get like ten of them in a big bucket or a nice chest and
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:09.220]  when one tries to get out they run over and grab him and start pinching him as
[02:35:09.220 --> 02:35:15.020]  long as he's not trying to climb out they don't attack and I noticed that
[02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:18.940]  trying to climb out of here people attacked me a lot including people that
[02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:23.620]  said they were patriots and anti-New World Order those people weren't
[02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:30.700]  success didn't have a lot of success because their hearts weren't pure none
[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:33.980]  of us are perfect but you know the heart is either pointed in the direction of
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:38.860]  good or bad and people who want status people who people who really are
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:43.900]  looking for worldly power they are never that successful from the perspective
[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:48.260]  of trying to do good because someone who's into evil just really cannot do
[02:35:48.260 --> 02:35:55.380]  good in the final equation it gets put through that filter and gets twisted
[02:35:55.380 --> 02:35:59.420]  even if your hearts turn towards good a lot of it ends up being turned towards
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:03.580]  bad and I don't want to preach anymore it's just that my brain is always
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:08.060]  storming with information and things I want to talk about and it's just
[02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:13.300]  frustrating it makes my head hurt
[02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:20.860]  I don't even know why I got off into the crab in the bucket analogy
[02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:31.020]  the issue is a lot of people get hurt a lot of people get dominated a lot of
[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:36.180]  people get run over in life and so they they decide to be cold they decide to
[02:36:36.180 --> 02:36:44.740]  be hard they decide to do whatever it takes to find avenues that will give
[02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:52.900]  them temporal or physical manifestations of power to protect themselves a lot of
[02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:58.740]  people join evil because they think they need its power to be strong others
[02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:03.220]  join it because they simply enjoy exercising it others join it by pure
[02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:12.300]  pressure some join it consciously because it is of their essence some people
[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:20.900]  were born to be wicked some were born to be wild some were born to be good some
[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:29.620]  were born to sacrifice for others but some were born and there's something to
[02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:34.660]  bloodlines there's a lot of bloodlines that from which pure evil flows to serve
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:40.460]  darkness and make no mistake those of us that are alive on this planet now who
[02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:47.020]  see what's going on and you understand what's going on we have a sacred duty a
[02:37:47.020 --> 02:38:04.300]  a a a a a predestined lot to resist darkness and if you do not take that
[02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:09.060]  destiny in your hands that's your free will but that destiny is lying there
[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:13.300]  for you and it will take you to incredible places when you begin to fight
[02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:20.220]  corruption some of them good some of them bad now don't just mean places
[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:24.540]  physically but places in your mind places in your heart reality is all
[02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:31.580]  around you is my message and what you see coming out of the television is a
[02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:41.940]  distorted reality meant to hurt you the New World Order wants to hurt you and it
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:50.540]  wants to hurt your children and I will tell minions of the system this if you
[02:38:50.540 --> 02:38:55.660]  don't care about yourselves and you just want to die on a pile of brass think
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:39:04.860]  about your children think about them because what we're going to see in
[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:11.220]  civilization and the changes that we're about to witness in the next 20 years are
[02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:20.620]  going to eclipse a thousand times anything that science fiction dystopics
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:25.100]  could ever imagine and the propaganda the chemical the biological the
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:31.540]  psychotronic the electronic Berlin wall of deception and delusion is going to be
[02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:41.540]  so great people are going to think it's normal when half their block is dying
[02:39:41.540 --> 02:39:47.780]  people are going to run to the dark side they're going to run to the
[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:55.580]  establishment even as the establishment destroys them many people will not wake
[02:39:55.580 --> 02:40:01.060]  up as things get worse they are going to double down and then when things get
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:05.260]  even still worse double down again and then double down again and again and
[02:40:05.260 --> 02:40:11.060]  again and again and again and again committed to their service of evil
[02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:16.780]  committed to their service of lies committed to their service their
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:26.700]  sacrament so you better pray God gives you strength you are not going to find
[02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:32.420]  God in 95% of these churches I will assure you that's the first place the
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:46.740]  devil takes over these churches have convinced you that you're evil so you
[02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:58.660]  might as well give into it instead of telling you the truth these churches
[02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:02.580]  tell you to stand down because God's going to handle it when the whole Bible
[02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:13.940]  says the opposite these churches are run by lazy soft little control freaks who
[02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:28.660]  know they're evil so don't ever ever fall prey to their Romans 13 devil tree
[02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:31.220]  let's go to your calls I need to shut up
[02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:36.540]  Tim in Kentucky you're on the air welcome hey man that was a great rant
[02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:43.020]  love it keeps up the good work thank you brother what's on your mind I'm a
[02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:47.900]  disabled veteran from a desert storm and I called in yesterday by the way the
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:54.340]  guests yesterday were awesome my Adams this is a very special person oh yeah
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:42:01.860]  I it's bothered me the reporting about police targeting veterans and so I went
[02:42:01.860 --> 02:42:07.140]  out for a couple hours last week and tried to get pulled over I am disabled
[02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:11.380]  veteran place I tried to get pulled over and I couldn't so I wanted to let you
[02:42:11.380 --> 02:42:16.100]  know that at least in my neck of the woods it's all good now but I can't but
[02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:21.460]  the whole thing bothers a lot of us to their veterans I I hadn't heard a lot
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:25.860]  about the camp Liberty going back or any K getting camp Liberty and they're
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:30.660]  taking off the terrorist list and they're gonna target us after all that we
[02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:34.380]  do all that they've injected in us and made it fit they're gonna they're gonna
[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:37.340]  target us it's terrible yeah that's why they injected you with all the
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:46.340]  experimental shots look here here's the issue selling evil is really hard to do
[02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:50.900]  the selling the federalization the internationalization the twisting is a
[02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:56.340]  big deal you're right that the average cop looks at training manuals saying
[02:42:56.340 --> 02:43:00.140]  returning veterans of the number one terror threat and it's waking them up
[02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:05.900]  you're right that the average police officer is a good person I've discovered
[02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:12.220]  that it doesn't matter their bosses are now the same Justice Department that
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:17.180]  ship guns into Mexico so what I'm saying is we either take over our towns
[02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:21.260]  peacefully as bull works against the globalist or they will be taken over
[02:43:21.260 --> 02:43:26.340]  against us it's not it's not like any towns or cities are gonna be neutral the
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:30.620]  entire Homeland Security architecture is built around taking over state
[02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:36.460]  legislatures and taking over cities and counties with the army that don't go
[02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:41.100]  along with forced inoculation and stuff so yes I mean you've seen all these
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:45.340]  sheriffs and county commissioners and people and judges saying we're
[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:50.020]  preparing to fight the new world order that you know that's the issue is that
[02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:54.500]  people are starting to actually wake up but the globalists are just gonna keep
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:44:00.820]  pressing it through and that's the thing that we face and they're gonna stage
[02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:05.780]  all sorts of crises and and and big events to try to stampede the locals
[02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:11.740]  into going along with this and the churches are all teaching it's the end
[02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:18.300]  of the world so don't get involved so the globalist can take over instead of
[02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:24.820]  the hundred-year reprieve of Nineveh the story of Jonah you see they don't teach
[02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:29.260]  any of that they just teach hey it's the end oh praise God all this evil is
[02:44:29.260 --> 02:44:32.700]  happening yeah they're gonna you know make kids wear tracker chips well that
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:35.820]  means the end of the world's coming praise the Lord says the church lady
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:39.860]  instead of going out I've got reporters right now in San Antonio about to cover
[02:44:39.860 --> 02:44:45.060]  a protest against them putting tracker chips on all the kids down there and
[02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:49.500]  people should be there today for that we should be out there actively
[02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:55.980]  resisting this we've gotten in this position because when everybody goes to
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:45:00.900]  church the preacher tells them when the good guys go to church every Sunday the
[02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:05.020]  guys that don't tell a lie and you know don't do anything you know wrong and
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:09.780]  love Jesus and grandma too when they go to church they're told lay down and do
[02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:13.860]  whatever you're told and so they're sitting there while evil takes over
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:18.260]  we're supposed to occupy the land and this is not a preaching show it's just
[02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:25.380]  when we come down to this it is a fight between good and evil the problem is the
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:30.620]  church has been discredited because it was taken over by the 501c3 system by
[02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:38.060]  the Rockefeller Foundation and so we have to take over our towns and cities
[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:42.260]  that's why in the army manuals you saw the new army manual so what you're
[02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:46.740]  alluding to people can just type it in army training to fight tea party they
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:49.940]  say they're preparing for the tea party to take over cities when they don't turn
[02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:54.220]  their guns in then the army is going to have to come and put a perimeter around
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:46:00.620]  the city and start you have helicopters go in and take over the city council but
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:04.540]  and then if people keep resisting they then have a cordon and they just start
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:08.900]  going house to house I mean that's what the army trains for we've got to get the
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:13.540]  word out ahead of scenarios they're going to trigger to try to sell this
[02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:18.020]  takeover and we have to admit to ourselves we've really gotten to this
[02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:22.500]  point and that when Obama gets kicked out of office which may happen don't
[02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:26.300]  think it's all just going to go away because we get rid of Obama you know I
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:30.780]  saw a sign in fact I'll tweet it out at the end of the sour here about 15
[02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:36.580]  minutes I saw a sign driving back from from our family property in East Texas
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:46.220]  that said save America vote Republican go to twitter.com for slash real Alex
[02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:48.900]  Jones if you want to see it I will tweet it out here when the show's over about
[02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:53.180]  15 minutes and you know those are well-meaning people and on the surface
[02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:57.740]  yeah Republicans don't like abortion don't like our sovereignty being
[02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:02.580]  destroyed pro family hey sounds good the problem is the globalists just have
[02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:06.360]  them and there is a placeholder so everybody thinks oh well that's our
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:10.560]  choice to get us out of this when by and large they're just as bad as the
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:15.540]  Democrats anything else sir oh I was just gonna add that I expected to be
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:20.260]  pulled over in the city and they expected to encounter exactly what you
[02:47:20.260 --> 02:47:24.300]  were saying but I want to point out that just the town I live in it's the town
[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:28.220]  where the two last terrorists were arrested last year in charge of federal
[02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:32.780]  court so I expected security oh yeah that's what they're saying the veterans
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:36.220]  we're gonna be terrorists that's totally a shaken back operation now I hear you
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:43.060]  and I appreciate your call let's go ahead and instead of getting cops pull
[02:47:43.060 --> 02:47:47.180]  you over sing talk to them it's just better to go in to their events that
[02:47:47.180 --> 02:47:51.100]  when they have charity events stuff like that and talk to them there you know go
[02:47:51.100 --> 02:47:55.420]  give them 20 bucks for the disabled cop charity or whatever for our for the
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:47:59.180]  dead cop you know family charities or whatever and then talk to them there go
[02:47:59.180 --> 02:48:04.020]  talk to your police chief or sheriff I mean it's it's probably not best to try
[02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:08.380]  to get pulled over to talk to them even though that's what I do now I mean look
[02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:11.620]  out you're about though you want to ask some questions I'm gonna I'm here to talk
[02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:16.540]  to you let's go ahead and talk to Jones in North Carolina Jones you're on the
[02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:22.180]  air go ahead hi Alex Jones is Dr. Jones I'm in North Carolina just want to add a
[02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:26.380]  few points basically building on what a lot of colors said it's easier to catch

[02:59:55.340 --> 03:00:02.060]  can hear me pretty good sir Alex I'm 23 years old I dropped out of college two
[03:00:02.060 --> 03:00:07.220]  years ago to prepare for what's coming because I feel like I'm the only one in
[03:00:07.220 --> 03:00:11.940]  my generation who's actually awake so I have a I have a question for you and some
[03:00:11.940 --> 03:00:17.660]  important information to share one how are you reaching out to kids in my
[03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:23.460]  generation college age kids high school age kids who they are the ones who are
[03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:26.460]  gonna have to stand up to this they're the ones who are gonna have to make a
[03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:30.300]  change and I feel like I'm the only one who's awake sure well I mean I guess in
[03:00:30.300 --> 03:00:34.140]  your area Kansas yeah I hear that a lot from Kansas of all places that no one's
[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:36.980]  awake I don't know that's I actually run a lot of people that are awake from
[03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:41.620]  Kansas but you know you're telling me people you talk to aren't you ask what
[03:00:41.620 --> 03:00:46.540]  I'm doing sir I'm doing everything I can and also tearing myself apart trying to
[03:00:46.540 --> 03:00:51.460]  do more beating myself up for not doing enough okay and I've learned I just got
[03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:57.940]  to give it to God and do the maximum effort I can okay and just ask God to
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:04.180]  you know guide my torpedoes I launch at the globalist in the info war you need
[03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:08.740]  to print up fact sheets of basic facts you need to start shooting a YouTube
[03:01:08.740 --> 03:01:14.140]  video trying to warn people about what's happening you need to go in to the
[03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:17.340]  people that whether it's in college or high school and talk to them and you
[03:01:17.340 --> 03:01:21.220]  need to be the leader so many people say Alex what are you doing to get the
[03:01:21.220 --> 03:01:24.860]  young people our demographics are incredible I don't even track
[03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:29.140]  demographics but we can look them up we don't target certain groups but we are
[03:01:29.140 --> 03:01:36.220]  absolutely waking up young people at amazing levels and there's countless
[03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:40.100]  young people that I've supported over the years that have now done huge amounts
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:44.420]  of great work on their own right so we're here as a platform trying to help
[03:01:44.420 --> 03:01:51.980]  others but you know here we are so I hope that answers your question question
[03:01:51.980 --> 03:01:58.700]  for you how can someone young like me find some land to start living off of
[03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:03.780]  it and self-preserving myself sure so many people want to follow the instinct
[03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:07.460]  to try to get their own place but if you don't have enough money or jobs to
[03:02:07.460 --> 03:02:11.020]  sustain it they'll take it with property taxes which they designed so you
[03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:14.380]  couldn't just go to the country and be self-sufficient they've got
[03:02:14.380 --> 03:02:19.060]  actuaries to bankrupt you by design where everybody I know living on a
[03:02:19.060 --> 03:02:23.620]  farm's got to have a job outside of it to support it that's a higher level stage
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:32.300]  if you're able to to move to the country the best offense you know to the
[03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:38.140]  globalist the best defense is an offense so you need to be trying to wake
[03:02:38.140 --> 03:02:43.460]  people up show the new world order doesn't get to win instead of everybody
[03:02:43.460 --> 03:02:48.140]  just running and getting ready I've said it's good to get prepped you know he
[03:02:48.140 --> 03:02:53.500]  foods direct calm all that great people but it's more important to get your your
[03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:58.700]  soul ready your mind ready and to try to wake up others that's the deciding
[03:02:58.700 --> 03:03:04.340]  factor the globalists themselves say 90% of war is psychological you have the
[03:03:04.340 --> 03:03:09.180]  truth they have the lies I appreciate your call to jam in one more Bob in
[03:03:09.180 --> 03:03:14.060]  Texas you're on the air go hey how you doing Alex it's the first time I've
[03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:19.580]  listened to your program and I'm kind of impressed by it I like it appreciate a
[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:24.500]  lot the reason I'm a call is hopefully I can brighten up your day I've heard a
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:30.340]  lot that you've said about the new world order conspiracy theories and the like
[03:03:30.340 --> 03:03:35.460]  and I'm sure that you're familiar with what a mortgage pooling agreement is as
[03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:41.980]  well as most of your listeners but many people have not taken the time to read
[03:03:41.980 --> 03:03:46.740]  this dribble I've read several of them and in every case there is one sentence
[03:03:46.740 --> 03:03:52.500]  that seems to connect all of the dots between what happened in the early to
[03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:59.300]  mid-1920s leading up today and it's just one single sentence it's in almost every
[03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:04.540]  pooling and we're gonna see an agreement read it okay it says not with
[03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:10.420]  standing the foregoing in no event shall the trust created hereby continue
[03:04:10.420 --> 03:04:17.380]  beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:23.340]  descendants of Joseph Kennedy the ambassador of the United States to the
[03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:29.340]  court of St. James living on the date here up that's crazy I'm gonna look that
[03:04:29.340 --> 03:04:54.500]  up amazing
