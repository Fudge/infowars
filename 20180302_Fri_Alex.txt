[00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:25.533]  You know, I don't say this a lot on air, even though I should probably start every broadcast by saying it.
[00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.216]  Because I really don't care what the enemy thinks.
[00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.177]  I know they don't listen to me anyways.
[00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:32.058]  They're so delusional.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.481]  But the listeners need to know this.
[00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.622]  The listeners need to understand this.
[00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:47.906]  Because you are the activist, you are the resistance, you are America, you are the Renaissance, you are the light in the country's eyes.
[00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:51.767]  You're the spirit.
[00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.269]  Of 1776, you are the descendants.
[00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.211]  Whether you weren't even related to those people as an American, you can take on that amazing historical birthright of Providence.
[00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:11.905]  God loves children, drunks, the United States of America, as Von Bismarck said.
[00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:26.296]  But, getting back to the main issue, prior to all the incredible news, over the top, this country's in the middle of an absolute 21st century technological information civil war, with the globalists.
[00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:33.662]  You got the globalist factions, and you've got just people that want to have the country be decent, and try to move forward, and try to not be evil.
[00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:34.943]  And we don't have a lot of, you know,
[00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:40.945]  Time to turn this around.
[00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:41.826]  We're trying to turn it around.
[00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:44.249]  We're trying to right the ship.
[00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.251]  But it's not some heroic thing to right the ship.
[00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.933]  It's survival instinct.
[00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.836]  And that's what I'm getting at here for people.
[00:01:51.836 --> 00:02:00.545]  When I get attacked and I get lied about in really unbelievable ways that really only somebody like
[00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:03.923]  Trump has to go through.
[00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.685]  It's done because they fear the information.
[00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:10.468]  They fear the platform because it gives you a voice, a bigger voice.
[00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:13.150]  And they fear the guests we have on.
[00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:24.538]  But folks think that when I'm being destroyed ritualistically every day in the media, that I'm losing or you're losing.
[00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:25.078]  And we're not.
[00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.139]  We're taking the culture back.
[00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:34.180]  We're putting ideas into the ether that are now becoming the dominant understanding and are changing the world.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.341]  We're exposing world government, the fact that it's unelected.
[00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:42.084]  We're exposing that the globalists are very satanic and anti-God and anti-family.
[00:02:42.084 --> 00:02:43.625]  And we're winning.
[00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:48.588]  And we're forcing them to engage in Chinese government style, communist style censorship.
[00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:54.591]  We're forcing their hand and it's blowing up in their face big time.
[00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.012]  And I can list a bunch of those examples when we come back from break.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.483]  So when I say I'm honored to be lied about and attacked, this is 21st century war.
[00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:12.868]  And I'm not having to get arms and legs blown off like soldiers have going back to the start of this country, millions and millions of dead.
[00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:20.372]  And all the other men and women that have fought for their families and fought for justice throughout history, all that blood, sweat, and tears.
[00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:22.053]  This is Hillary Clinton striking back.
[00:03:22.053 --> 00:03:26.856]  And if it's not sending a hit team to kill me, because she knows she could get caught in this modern system.
[00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:32.854]  Yeah, but just trying to destroy my name to be able to get the word out.
[00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:33.874]  That's fine.
[00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:38.278]  See, I'm willing to sacrifice myself so that we beat these people.
[00:03:38.278 --> 00:03:40.099]  And that's out of pure survival.
[00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.861]  Not out of being a hero.
[00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:44.182]  Our back is against the wall, folks.
[00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.844]  You can't even submit to these people.
[00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:48.966]  They just want total tyranny and to disease your mind.
[00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:50.007]  They want mental illness.
[00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:51.248]  They want collapse.
[00:03:51.248 --> 00:03:52.749]  That's their plan.
[00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:53.970]  It's public.
[00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:57.328]  So there is not even capitulation.
[00:03:57.328 --> 00:03:59.591]  It's not like we're going to be assimilated by this new world order.
[00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.076]  It wants us out of the way.
[00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.139]  It's got all the characteristics of an alien force.
[00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:09.064]  Operating through humans.
[00:04:09.064 --> 00:04:10.084]  And everybody knows that.
[00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:11.104]  Every culture knows that.
[00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:12.345]  And that's what the Bible says.
[00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:13.685]  That's what it is.
[00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:14.866]  Fallen angel.
[00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:17.507]  Now, I don't get into UFOs and all this other stuff.
[00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:24.729]  I'm just telling you, we're dealing with an off-world force that wants us to kill each other, and wants us mentally ill, and doesn't want us to work together.
[00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:32.072]  And you read the WikiLeaks, it's written like an alien would write something to turn the people against themselves and blow the planet up.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.861]  So, it's that.
[00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:41.927]  I mean, I'm on a suicide mission because it's total death if we lose for everybody.
[00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:46.210]  So, I'm winning, you're winning, we're winning.
[00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.515]  They just want to make it look like you stand up and promote freedom and expose the deep state, you're going to be destroyed.
[00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:53.297]  The truth is they're the ones being destroyed.
[00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:55.419]  I rise every day like the phoenix.
[00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.600]  Every day I come back.
[00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.791]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:07.752]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:05:07.752 --> 00:05:11.114]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:05:11.114 --> 00:05:13.634]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:18.376]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:20.717]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:05:20.717 --> 00:05:27.099]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:35.928]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:35.928 --> 00:05:40.993]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:05:40.993 --> 00:05:47.980]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:53.544]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.587]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:52.301]  It's already March 2nd.
[00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:58.365]  The Ides of March.
[00:06:58.365 --> 00:06:59.806]  That's when they killed Julius Caesar.
[00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:03.308]  Right in the middle of March.
[00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:07.250]  Beware the Ides of March.
[00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.052]  Are we about to see the fall of President Trump?
[00:07:15.973 --> 00:07:29.376]  I don't go with the hype with CNN and all the other globalist run, disinformation outfits, propaganda.
[00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:30.937]  But I can sense the will of the people.
[00:07:30.937 --> 00:07:42.699]  I can pick up the spirit of the population and I can talk to the man and woman on the street.
[00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:45.080]  And I can tell you that Trump has dented
[00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:49.603]  He is aura.
[00:07:49.603 --> 00:08:02.812]  He has put a big fat dent and a big old goose egg right on top of his head with a hammer with the statements he's been making in these
[00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:15.138]  Listening sessions he's been having with victims of the shooting and also members of Congress.
[00:08:15.138 --> 00:08:26.824]  Dianne Feinstein hunched over like the archetypal witch without even wearing the green makeup looking more witch-like than the witch in The Wizard of Oz.
[00:08:26.824 --> 00:08:29.546]  And you gotta ask, why is he doing that?
[00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:35.289]  I made some phone calls this morning and last night and he said, listen, it's Ivanka and it's Jared.
[00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:38.757]  And I don't want to sit here and bash Ivanka and Jared.
[00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:39.638]  They're from New York.
[00:08:39.638 --> 00:08:43.441]  They grew up basically in little glass fishbowls.
[00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:47.583]  And to a goldfish that lives in a tiny little fishbowl, they think guns are scary.
[00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:49.865]  I mean, I get it.
[00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:50.845]  You're domesticated.
[00:08:50.845 --> 00:09:00.732]  And your idea of fun is shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue.
[00:09:00.732 --> 00:09:02.533]  And you're all suave and
[00:09:05.481 --> 00:09:07.883]  Fancy-pantsed.
[00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:17.310]  It sounds reasonable to give a little up, but all of us know the goal is to always have us give up, give up, give up, give up, and take bites out of it until it's all gone.
[00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:28.818]  And we've got Dianne Feinstein, and we've got Michael Moore, and we've got the New York Times, and we've got Chuck Todd on the Sunday morning shows saying, we're going to repeal the entire thing and take all your guns.
[00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:34.142]  And we know about the UN treaty that Obama signed that says the abolition of civilian firearms
[00:09:35.788 --> 00:09:41.814]  Is our goal.
[00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:52.205]  Civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:56.730]  What is a power monopoly?
[00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.812]  Well, if you've got a fish in a fishbowl,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:08.885]  If you don't give it food, and if you don't give it water to keep the water filled, when it evaporates, it will surely die.
[00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:15.509]  And when you have a goldfish, it is a lesson to your children of a monopoly of power.
[00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:23.073]  Because if you don't feed little Goldie, little Goldie's gonna shrivel up like a skeleton.
[00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:33.071]  Can't tell me how many times I'll be over at a kid's house or at a party or, you know, some place and see a starving goldfish or a couple of them all skinny and looking out for food.
[00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:39.973]  Hey, why don't you feed your fish or why don't you go dump them in the lake?
[00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.853]  And that's kind of what leftism is.
[00:10:42.853 --> 00:10:44.214]  They want to run everything.
[00:10:44.214 --> 00:10:45.454]  They're control freaks.
[00:10:45.454 --> 00:10:49.375]  They're like collectors, people that collect, you know, 400 dogs and cats or whatever.
[00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:53.056]  There's feces three feet tall and they just got to have more, more, more.
[00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:53.636]  It's mental illness.
[00:10:55.126 --> 00:10:57.087]  And that's what Satanism is.
[00:10:57.087 --> 00:10:57.928]  They want dominance.
[00:10:57.928 --> 00:10:58.608]  They want power.
[00:10:58.608 --> 00:11:01.490]  They don't want any responsibility.
[00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.472]  And they want to wreck things and control them.
[00:11:04.472 --> 00:11:15.539]  And they want to look over and see a bunch of starving, yapping dogs begging to them in some dirty, flea-infested yard because it makes them feel powerful.
[00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:16.980]  Notice that about mentally ill people.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.342]  They like to mistreat animals.
[00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:29.440]  And that's what it is.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.282]  And so, I don't blame Ivanka and Jared.
[00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:35.043]  They're goldfish.
[00:11:35.043 --> 00:11:37.825]  And I guess you could say Donald Trump looks like a big goldfish.
[00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:46.190]  But, getting serious here, Trump, he is no goldfish.
[00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.191]  And his sons aren't either.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:58.324]  And when you've got Eric Trump running around saying, well, I think not letting folks buy semi-automatic rifles till they're 21 is reasonable and bump stocks, ban those.
[00:11:58.324 --> 00:12:01.085]  What happens then every time somebody uses something in a crime?
[00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:01.846]  We got to ban that?
[00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:13.191]  Well, there won't be any baseball bats or screwdrivers or butcher knives or cars or anything.
[00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.472]  So, let's just stop right there.
[00:12:18.194 --> 00:12:23.138]  And look at where we are.
[00:12:23.138 --> 00:12:25.601]  There are a lot of signs that Trump is starting to buckle.
[00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:32.707]  And we've had sources that have been worried about him being compromised.
[00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.993]  I don't judge people.
[00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:52.994]  For what they're individually doing doesn't hurt somebody else.
[00:12:52.994 --> 00:12:54.175]  I judge them by their fruits.
[00:12:54.175 --> 00:12:55.136]  Because I've read the Bible.
[00:12:55.136 --> 00:12:57.177]  You look at people like King David.
[00:12:57.177 --> 00:13:00.440]  Again, who had the same problem Donald Trump does.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.002]  But his heart was good, so God said he was chief among men.
[00:13:04.002 --> 00:13:07.065]  So you have to really read the Bible to understand it.
[00:13:07.065 --> 00:13:10.707]  It's not hypocritical, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:18.053]  America, because Trump wasn't a hypocrite, and said he stood up for these things, and did stand up for them,
[00:13:20.353 --> 00:13:25.656]  Gave him a pass on some of the moral issues.
[00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:31.080]  But we're in a society where the vice president won't get on an elevator with an unattended woman.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.703]  That's one step away from Barkus, but I understand why he's doing it.
[00:13:35.703 --> 00:13:46.310]  But this whole crazed behavior about men and women coming together is from the left, is going so far left, it's coming back to basically orthodox Islam.
[00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:55.761]  I mean, where a woman hugs you and if you touch their back, Prairie Home Companion, you're fired.
[00:13:55.761 --> 00:13:56.962]  And they said, no, that's what he did.
[00:13:56.962 --> 00:14:01.264]  He touched a woman's back when she was fawning over him.
[00:14:01.264 --> 00:14:08.188]  It's like saying women throwing their panties at Elvis Presley, climbing up on top of him if Elvis hugged one of them.
[00:14:08.188 --> 00:14:09.949]  Oh my God, it's rape.
[00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:13.711]  That's like saying of two mammals.
[00:14:16.578 --> 00:14:16.898]  I don't know.
[00:14:38.536 --> 00:14:43.460]  If he does these steel and aluminum deals, we don't really have any steel or aluminum production compared to what we did.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.943]  It's down by over 80% since the 1950s.
[00:14:46.943 --> 00:14:56.832]  And what we have is leaving because they have internal tariffs against us with their taxes and regulations in China and other areas where no one can compete.
[00:14:56.832 --> 00:14:59.814]  And the industry's come here and said, we can hire people and we can do this.
[00:15:00.626 --> 00:15:05.567]  Because again, China lowered their tax from 15% to zero to counter Trump.
[00:15:05.567 --> 00:15:09.168]  So he said, okay, I'm gonna put tariffs on at 20%.
[00:15:09.168 --> 00:15:10.268]  What does that basically do?
[00:15:10.268 --> 00:15:15.549]  It matches what the Chinese have done and then gives them a five point ding.
[00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:18.629]  He's being very fair.
[00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:24.830]  And they're calling it, on CNN, a depression, oh and Germany's so mad, on and on and on.
[00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.491]  I mean, they've got so many tariffs and controls on our goods going into Europe.
[00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.552]  It's insane.
[00:15:31.552 --> 00:15:33.834]  So Trump's doing a lot of good.
[00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:40.821]  And I think that he's just putting out this rhetoric so they give us a deal that's really horrible so nothing happens and then he has the cake and eat it too.
[00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:41.902]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:15:41.902 --> 00:15:45.786]  You can't intellectually play that game.
[00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:50.992]  You can't do that with bedrock issues or we lose the intellectual battle down the road.
[00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:51.592]  We'll be back.
[00:15:51.592 --> 00:15:52.934]  We've got critical news straight ahead.
[00:16:01.374 --> 00:16:03.075]  So how did the designer brands do?
[00:16:17.765 --> 00:16:23.349]  I expected notable brands to perform well, and I was pretty surprised to see that it was not fully protective.
[00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:28.833]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising that they do.
[00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:34.016]  Get a Stronghold on your credit cards, license, and other critical data with i-D Stronghold wallets.
[00:16:34.016 --> 00:16:36.758]  Other RFID blocking wallets simply aren't the same.
[00:16:36.758 --> 00:16:39.060]  i-D Stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.542]  I would definitely recommend i-D Stronghold wallets to my friends and family.
[00:16:42.802 --> 00:16:43.583]  Check the label.
[00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:46.568]  If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[00:16:46.568 --> 00:16:49.072]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold wallet.
[00:16:49.072 --> 00:16:55.662]  Get the most trusted brand in RFID blocking wallets and protect yourself from electronic pickpocketing.

[00:16:58.769 --> 00:17:02.492]  One out of four people listening to my voice right now could die from heart disease.

[00:17:30.252 --> 00:17:35.635]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:38.537]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[00:18:09.247 --> 00:18:17.656]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.656 --> 00:18:22.341]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:18:29.306 --> 00:18:36.490]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:43.515]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.515 --> 00:18:47.858]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:19:39.796 --> 00:19:41.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:24.497]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:24.497 --> 00:20:30.360]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.122]  I almost forgot.
[00:20:34.122 --> 00:20:35.062]  It's March 2nd, 2018.
[00:20:35.062 --> 00:20:36.043]  Texas Independence Day.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.305]  There's a celebration of the adoption of the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2nd, 1836.
[00:20:45.305 --> 00:20:56.855]  With this document signed by 59 delegates, settlers in Mexican Texas officially declared independence from Mexico and created the Republic of Texas.
[00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:59.457]  And some of my ancestors are on that baby.
[00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:05.462]  So, we see the continued march on from people wanting to live under freedom,
[00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:09.148]  And you can look at Texas and say, well, is it true freedom?
[00:21:09.148 --> 00:21:11.329]  Well, compare it to Mexico.
[00:21:11.329 --> 00:21:19.872]  With the wealth and the freedom and the prosperity and the science and the technology, you can see that there was a lot more freedom here.
[00:21:19.872 --> 00:21:25.394]  And a lot bigger step away from colonialism and to independence.
[00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:37.504]  But the left teaches that Texas and all these other areas belong to Mexico when there's a reason there's been six flags over Texas.
[00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:52.691]  That's because it was a war zone that no one could keep until the Scottish and Irish, mainly, settlers and then German and English came in.
[00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:55.112]  They were the ones out of Alabama, Tennessee,
[00:21:56.946 --> 00:22:08.954]  Georgia, Virginia that came in at the behest of the Mexican government to fight the Comanche.
[00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:20.622]  There was no Mexican government past areas of South Texas and Galveston and out into West Texas and places like San Antonio and South Texas.
[00:22:20.622 --> 00:22:25.765]  There were Spanish missions that were armed forts and that was it.
[00:22:27.253 --> 00:22:41.482]  And the only reason Anglo settlers were let in by the Anglo rulers of Mexico was to kill the Comanche.
[00:22:41.482 --> 00:22:42.663]  And that's a fact.
[00:22:42.663 --> 00:22:44.904]  And kill the Comanche we did.
[00:22:44.904 --> 00:22:46.885]  And also intermarry with them.
[00:22:46.885 --> 00:22:47.926]  As some of my ancestors did.
[00:22:49.206 --> 00:22:54.930]  But you never hear anybody say they're a Comanche because everybody that was a Comanche changed their name to another tribe.
[00:22:54.930 --> 00:23:01.314]  Because if you told somebody you were a Comanche, even until the 1920s, they'd try to kill you.
[00:23:01.314 --> 00:23:04.536]  There's a lot of folks, you know, had their mama and their daddy killed by them.
[00:23:04.536 --> 00:23:05.396]  They remembered it.
[00:23:05.396 --> 00:23:10.119]  And you've got these images of these sweet, loving people.
[00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:13.041]  And it was a far, far different.
[00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:17.664]  The Comanche, you know, terrorized all the other Native Americans and had them all scared and took over basically much of the
[00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:31.949]  Midwest all the way up to Illinois right down through Oklahoma into South Texas because they tortured and killed basically everybody they came across.
[00:23:31.949 --> 00:23:33.050]  You know they were the ones that would
[00:23:34.042 --> 00:23:35.803]  Cut the islands off and bury it in an ant bed.
[00:23:35.803 --> 00:23:42.265]  And then the Apaches, which were a sweet lot compared to the Comanche, but were out in areas the Comanches didn't want.
[00:23:42.265 --> 00:23:46.927]  Desert, starting in West Texas, out into Arizona.
[00:23:46.927 --> 00:23:49.148]  They had a few of the Comanche tactics.
[00:23:49.148 --> 00:23:58.912]  And of course, there was another loving group called the Karankawa, who were down on the Texas coast, as we know it today.
[00:23:58.912 --> 00:24:01.072]  And they were cannibals.
[00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:01.893]  And they
[00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:11.751]  Quite a few Spanish letters went back about, you know, the people going on shore to get water and being eaten.
[00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:17.773]  So, let's just really be honest about what was going on around here.
[00:24:17.773 --> 00:24:18.933]  Let's be honest.
[00:24:18.933 --> 00:24:26.135]  There were people that ate their enemies, and that wasn't the only tribe that did that.
[00:24:26.135 --> 00:24:31.817]  And there were people that killed everybody but young women and children.
[00:24:33.857 --> 00:24:37.058]  And so that's why they were wiped out.
[00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:42.921]  And that's why groups affiliated with them got marched off to be killed.
[00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:45.762]  And I'm not saying that was a good thing.
[00:24:45.762 --> 00:24:54.746]  I'm saying people need to understand the reality of what went on in this country and how it was carved out and what was done.
[00:24:54.746 --> 00:24:57.127]  Like Mexico claims California.
[00:24:57.127 --> 00:24:59.908]  California, the Russians claimed for a while.
[00:24:59.908 --> 00:25:01.008]  So did the Spanish.
[00:25:01.008 --> 00:25:02.829]  So it goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:06.729]  And that's a fact.
[00:25:06.729 --> 00:25:14.414]  They don't teach in colleges what you just heard.
[00:25:14.414 --> 00:25:19.858]  They teach evil white people came down here because they wanted to continue slavery.
[00:25:19.858 --> 00:25:23.720]  Even though, again, less than 2% had slaves.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.182]  And that Mexico is this wonderful free place.
[00:25:26.182 --> 00:25:29.744]  Oh, is that why Santa Ana lost Guatemala as well and other states of Mexico?
[00:25:29.744 --> 00:25:30.525]  No, he was a tyrant.
[00:25:31.584 --> 00:25:38.406]  Now, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes and I'm going to get focused, but I want to do a little bit of Texas Independence Day here.
[00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:43.888]  Is Trump going sideways on us?
[00:25:43.888 --> 00:25:46.509]  I think the answer is rhetorically, yes.
[00:25:46.509 --> 00:26:00.874]  Even sitting there and acting like he's appeasing and giving validity to victim disarmament policies when the Democrats admit they want the abolition of the Second Amendment is a tactic so that they bring forward such a larcenous bill that the whole thing gets shelved.
[00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:03.189]  He knows they don't have the votes.
[00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:07.451]  It's a tactic, and it worked on DACA.
[00:26:07.451 --> 00:26:10.031]  He gave them something reasonable, which he would have actually let them done.
[00:26:10.031 --> 00:26:13.472]  They said total AMSI, total open borders.
[00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:19.274]  But this isn't something where what he was saying, I think, was reasonable as what he said in the campaign.
[00:26:19.274 --> 00:26:26.316]  This is going back on what he said in the campaign, even if it's rhetorical, and it has, again, dented his aura.
[00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:34.710]  Of being a person that delivers and a person that's a promise keeper and it makes me sick.
[00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.932]  And it's made people even more angry because they love Trump.
[00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:41.633]  And so it's, you know, like a spurned woman.
[00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:44.794]  Hell has no fury like a woman scorned.
[00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:50.630]  Is that a Bible verse or is that always forget or is that Shakespeare?
[00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.851]  Maybe Shakespeare quoted it, but it is a Bible verse.
[00:26:52.851 --> 00:27:03.920]  When you look, and believe me, we all know if you've had a woman scorned, even if they leave you just to make you try to come groveling back to them and then you don't, man do they get mad!
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.343]  They'll cut their own nose off to spite their face just to get at you.
[00:27:07.343 --> 00:27:10.926]  Well, hell hath no fear like a woman scorned.
[00:27:10.926 --> 00:27:13.428]  And that is William Congrave.
[00:27:13.428 --> 00:27:15.449]  See, I can't even get it right.
[00:27:15.449 --> 00:27:16.250]  First written as
[00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:24.513]  Heaven has, hell hath no fury like a woman's score, but it was in Old English there in another way.
[00:27:24.513 --> 00:27:27.816]  But I'm digressing.
[00:27:27.816 --> 00:27:40.126]  Hell hath no fury, well, hell hath no fury like an electorate that has been betrayed over and over and over and over again, and where betrayal just becomes compromise.
[00:27:40.126 --> 00:27:45.150]  You can't compromise with people who are the essence of betrayal.
[00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:47.355]  You can't do it.
[00:27:47.355 --> 00:27:49.076]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[00:27:49.076 --> 00:27:57.244]  I just briefly want to thank the listeners during our fundraising drive of the last 24 hours.
[00:27:57.244 --> 00:28:00.567]  We're going to continue live transmission until 6 o'clock tonight.
[00:28:00.567 --> 00:28:01.748]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:28:04.756 --> 00:28:09.339]  I am taking my children on a short vacation next week.
[00:28:09.339 --> 00:28:12.841]  I'm sure the media will announce that I, because of all these false allegations, have quit.
[00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:16.122]  I've been hiding.
[00:28:16.122 --> 00:28:20.725]  We just say these things so we can then show you how we know the enemy when they do it.
[00:28:20.725 --> 00:28:22.486]  I told you they were banning our YouTube.
[00:28:22.486 --> 00:28:23.767]  Then they denied it.
[00:28:23.767 --> 00:28:24.987]  Then they said they were.
[00:28:24.987 --> 00:28:26.548]  Then they admitted it was for political reasons.
[00:28:26.548 --> 00:28:27.689]  And then they reinstated it.
[00:28:28.956 --> 00:28:32.498]  They totally banned Dr. Corsi's YouTube channel, our D.C.
[00:28:32.498 --> 00:28:38.823]  Bureau man, and then returned it today.
[00:28:38.823 --> 00:28:46.088]  And that's a whole civil war inside YouTube that's amazing, where YouTube admits rogue employees are doing this.
[00:28:46.088 --> 00:28:49.650]  Well, CNN says they're contacting people at YouTube and saying, go do it.
[00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.991]  And I told you it's all fraud.
[00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:57.376]  And they had all these TV shows celebrated, and it's now blown up in all of your dirty, lying faces.
[00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:05.955]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[00:29:05.955 --> 00:29:10.218]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[00:29:10.218 --> 00:29:14.842]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[00:29:28.902 --> 00:29:34.024]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:29:34.024 --> 00:29:39.726]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:29:39.726 --> 00:29:44.929]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:49.270]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.211]  See guidelines.
[00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:53.492]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:55.433]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:29:55.433 --> 00:29:56.974]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:30:00.347 --> 00:30:08.593]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[00:30:08.593 --> 00:30:09.814]  A 360 win.
[00:30:09.814 --> 00:30:16.378]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:30:16.378 --> 00:30:23.904]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:30:24.304 --> 00:30:29.368]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:30:29.368 --> 00:30:35.473]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:30:35.473 --> 00:30:43.279]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:49.804]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature in InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:51.285]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:30:51.445 --> 00:30:53.867]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:53.867 --> 00:30:55.849]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[00:30:55.849 --> 00:31:00.172]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:31:00.172 --> 00:31:03.655]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:15.165]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[00:31:15.165 --> 00:31:16.065]  This is pollen blood.
[00:31:17.066 --> 00:31:29.736]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[00:31:29.736 --> 00:31:34.059]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:38.062]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet
[00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:48.611]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:51.753]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.
[00:31:51.753 --> 00:31:55.997]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:01.466]  I'm so excited.
[00:32:01.466 --> 00:32:11.609]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:20.112]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:32:20.112 --> 00:32:28.915]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:32:31.004 --> 00:32:41.268]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:32:41.268 --> 00:32:50.593]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:53.254]  It is amazing!
[00:32:53.254 --> 00:32:58.236]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:33:02.757 --> 00:33:22.025]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.025 --> 00:33:27.467]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[00:33:27.467 --> 00:33:29.468]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.468 --> 00:33:31.349]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:33:33.456 --> 00:33:34.776]  That's right!
[00:33:34.776 --> 00:33:38.778]  Look at some of the unbelievable stories at Infowars.com.
[00:33:38.778 --> 00:33:54.782]  As we've pointed out, they're not just fining people in Germany, France and Sweden thousands of euros if they even say that Islam is not a religion of peace and that it's associated with violence and oppression of women.
[00:33:54.782 --> 00:34:00.644]  But Marie Le Pen has been criminally charged yet again and is facing two years in prison
[00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:12.741]  We're saying that ISIS is as big a threat to Europe and that the Islamic ISIS invasion as Hitler was, which is totally true.
[00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:15.542]  In fact, Hitler wanted to Islamify Europe.
[00:34:15.542 --> 00:34:17.322]  I've read his writings where he said that.
[00:34:17.322 --> 00:34:19.363]  I mean, talk about a crazy man.
[00:34:19.363 --> 00:34:23.464]  Because he wanted to totally take over the Middle East, the whole world.
[00:34:23.464 --> 00:34:29.285]  He had it all figured out and now they've done the same EU model and the globalists have got it all figured out how they're going to take over our lives.
[00:34:31.593 --> 00:34:35.335]  So, of course, we see these articles every day now, like it's no big deal.
[00:34:35.335 --> 00:34:36.716]  Sweden.
[00:34:36.716 --> 00:34:42.900]  Woman interrogated and imprisoned for posting a joke meme about Islam.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.562]  And we'll show you the joke meme if we can scroll down for TV viewers.
[00:34:47.562 --> 00:34:49.603]  For radio listeners, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:34:49.603 --> 00:34:57.008]  Thought criminal faces two years in jail after authorities grilled her on support for multiculturalism.
[00:34:57.901 --> 00:35:05.762]  A woman in Sweden has been interrogated by the police and her DNA taken and subsequently imprisoned for the crime of sharing a joke meme about Islam on Facebook.
[00:35:05.762 --> 00:35:07.463]  And Facebook reports it to the police.
[00:35:07.463 --> 00:35:09.623]  They use the former Stasi in Germany.
[00:35:09.623 --> 00:35:23.305]  The 32-year-old woman from Gothenburg drew the attention of authorities after she posted the image below, which depicts a Muslim man having his brain removed and then being wrapped in Islamic headdress.
[00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:26.746]  While the meme may be considered offensive,
[00:35:27.631 --> 00:35:29.792]  What happened next was truly Orwellian.
[00:35:29.792 --> 00:35:37.597]  A reporter alerted police to the post, claiming that the woman had expressed herself in a threatening manner towards a protected group.
[00:35:37.597 --> 00:35:45.222]  The reporter passed on details of the woman's identity and her place of residence.
[00:35:45.222 --> 00:35:53.728]  And basically, the meme is, you put, you take a brain out, you put poop in the brain, you put a
[00:35:55.407 --> 00:36:03.937]  Turban on it, you know, he's had brain surgery, and then you're out physically attacking people in the street, you're an Islamist.
[00:36:03.937 --> 00:36:08.162]  The woman profusely apologized for the post, claiming she thought it was aimed at members of ISIS.
[00:36:09.224 --> 00:36:11.125]  While asserting that her best friend was Muslim.
[00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.706]  Oh, of course, grovel properly.
[00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:15.747]  And that she was ill at the time with a fever.
[00:36:15.747 --> 00:36:17.728]  Which she posted the image.
[00:36:17.728 --> 00:36:20.449]  Oh, I love how they grovel instead of saying it's her free speech.
[00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:22.550]  You, you, you globalist thugs.
[00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:27.633]  This did not satisfy authorities who proceeded to interrogate her about her thoughts on Sweden's multicultural society.
[00:36:27.633 --> 00:36:31.354]  And by the way, they run the Sweden Culture Minister as a Muslim.
[00:36:31.354 --> 00:36:32.535]  It says it's his job to get rid of it.
[00:36:33.422 --> 00:36:34.743]  The threat of Swedish culture.
[00:36:34.743 --> 00:36:37.004]  And whether she had something against Muslims.
[00:36:37.004 --> 00:36:38.385]  Well, they had something against her.
[00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:42.248]  The woman insisted she was against the Islamic State and non-individual Muslims.
[00:36:42.248 --> 00:36:44.189]  Well, you can't do that.
[00:36:44.189 --> 00:36:53.375]  However, Gothenburg prosecutor Sarah Torskog, if I'm pronouncing that right, decided to proceed with charges of hate speech.
[00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:55.136]  The woman now faces two years in prison.
[00:36:55.136 --> 00:36:56.517]  This is what they're trying to get here.
[00:36:58.956 --> 00:37:03.877]  Comedy Central and everybody go, Jones has had his YouTube struck and it's about to go down for hate speech.
[00:37:03.877 --> 00:37:05.858]  No, they said bullying is what they said.
[00:37:05.858 --> 00:37:09.459]  And by the way, they had to restore it because that was even a fraud.
[00:37:09.459 --> 00:37:13.160]  A, you shouldn't take somebody's speech for what you call bullying.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.360]  That should be done in the courts if you can prove it.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.141]  Oh, think of that, actually proving something.
[00:37:18.141 --> 00:37:21.282]  And then you have to expand on it from there.
[00:37:21.282 --> 00:37:24.143]  But now, oh, they had a big Gizmodo article about
[00:37:25.825 --> 00:37:30.187]  Infowars, Washington, YouTube taken down with tens of millions of views.
[00:37:30.187 --> 00:37:32.869]  Very popular channel.
[00:37:32.869 --> 00:37:35.910]  And everybody celebrated it, and people were all over the news.
[00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.912]  I mean, I've got stacks of them going, Yay!
[00:37:37.912 --> 00:37:38.292]  Yay!
[00:37:38.292 --> 00:37:39.332]  They're on our website.
[00:37:39.332 --> 00:37:40.913]  And the comment section, Yay!
[00:37:40.913 --> 00:37:43.114]  We took down one of their YouTubes!
[00:37:43.114 --> 00:37:43.575]  Yay!
[00:37:43.575 --> 00:37:44.615]  We did it!
[00:37:44.615 --> 00:37:47.257]  We hate free speech!
[00:37:47.257 --> 00:37:51.259]  This morning, all the strikes are gone, and it's back.
[00:37:51.259 --> 00:37:54.701]  Because YouTube came out and told Bloomberg, We've had
[00:37:55.692 --> 00:38:00.694]  Some rogue employees targeting conservatives, and we apologize.
[00:38:00.694 --> 00:38:02.155]  And you know why they're apologizing?
[00:38:02.155 --> 00:38:10.118]  Because we have their executives on video saying they're blocking us because of our views, not for bullying.
[00:38:10.118 --> 00:38:15.061]  But never fear, they've got the Young Turks coming out, calling it my anti-Semitic meltdown.
[00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:18.522]  We'll play some of it, and it is incredible.
[00:38:18.522 --> 00:38:22.624]  They say I'm an anti-Semite for saying George Soros
[00:38:24.915 --> 00:38:29.576]  Worked with the Nazis.
[00:38:29.576 --> 00:38:33.378]  You talk about jumping the shark, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:33.378 --> 00:38:51.523]  Soros' father wrote a book, Soros wrote a book, and Soros was on 60 Minutes saying he helped round up Jews and felt no remorse, and we're gonna play the clip, next segment, and then I'm gonna play Sink Uyghur, who named his group after the young Turks
[00:38:53.285 --> 00:38:57.208]  Who killed over a million and a half Armenians.
[00:38:57.208 --> 00:38:58.589]  Christians.
[00:38:58.589 --> 00:39:09.357]  And he says it doesn't exist, when it's totally recognized, the Associated Press wrote about it at the time, and it's completely documented.
[00:39:09.357 --> 00:39:18.203]  But instead, the Los Angeles Armenian community loves him, and donates to him on record, and likes it.
[00:39:18.203 --> 00:39:22.707]  Talk about Stockholm Syndrome, you talk about being cucks, shame on you!
[00:39:25.353 --> 00:39:28.595]  If you won't stand up for your own people, I will.
[00:39:28.595 --> 00:39:32.077]  Because if somebody doesn't stand up for you, nobody will stand up for me.
[00:39:32.077 --> 00:39:37.861]  And this whole electronic lynching.
[00:39:37.861 --> 00:39:39.682]  That's right.
[00:39:39.682 --> 00:39:40.143]  Continuing.
[00:39:41.656 --> 00:39:47.242]  As we've exhaustively documented, Sweden is an authoritarian country that prosecutes people for satire and telling the truth.
[00:39:47.242 --> 00:39:51.486]  It goes through 70-year-old people being put in jail on all the videos of it.
[00:39:51.486 --> 00:40:01.817]  They have these diversity concerts, and then the women show up, and then the men line up 30, 40 deep and rape them bloody, and the police do nothing.
[00:40:01.817 --> 00:40:03.059]  It's a religion!
[00:40:05.874 --> 00:40:07.555]  of sacrifice in Europe.
[00:40:07.555 --> 00:40:13.701]  That's what Satanism is, is sacrificing your culture, giving in, being a cuck.
[00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:18.905]  On one end of it.
[00:40:18.905 --> 00:40:29.174]  Yeah, hundreds protested in Sweden after police told women to stay inside or walk in pairs after a series of violent gang rapes of teenage girls, and the police chief came out and said it's Muslims doing it, and
[00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:49.900]  That police chief got fired, and then Tommy Robinson, who was just on today, earlier in the 24-hour broadcast, he's been banned off Twitter for saying the police statistic that 90 plus percent of pedophilia and raping girls, which is what they meant, grooming as well, is Muslims!
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:56.562]  So the Muslim radicals are really doing it, but then there's newspaper headlines everywhere saying
[00:40:57.776 --> 00:41:10.448]  That I hugged a woman once, which they thought was grooming, which wasn't even true, and that then becomes, in Newsweek, sex assault.
[00:41:10.448 --> 00:41:11.729]  Think about that.
[00:41:11.729 --> 00:41:15.893]  But they just put the headline up, hoping you just see the headline, see?
[00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:16.994]  Hoping you just believe it.
[00:41:16.994 --> 00:41:20.678]  Now, there's another clip on InfoWars where a professor comes over to a pro-gun table,
[00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:27.854]  of a young student group that's, you know, checked it out and has it and is handing out information.
[00:41:27.854 --> 00:41:29.655]  And he says, oh, you're Russian-funded.
[00:41:29.655 --> 00:41:31.176]  The Second Amendment's Russian.
[00:41:31.176 --> 00:41:32.357]  It's Russian.
[00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:43.904]  Notice in that fake EEOC complaints put in against me by two employees that were dating, it says, and he was there with a Russian operative handling him.
[00:41:43.904 --> 00:41:45.745]  Just, oh, oh, it's total proof.
[00:41:45.745 --> 00:41:46.006]  See?
[00:41:46.006 --> 00:41:49.088]  And it's like Hillary Clinton's lawyer.
[00:41:50.006 --> 00:41:56.992]  Her personal lawyer is the one that filed this on us, and you can just read it, and it's like, oh, throw a little bit of Russian in there.
[00:41:56.992 --> 00:41:58.093]  You're like, that's ridiculous.
[00:41:58.093 --> 00:41:59.574]  No, not to Democrat followers.
[00:41:59.574 --> 00:42:01.876]  They'll hear that and say, see?
[00:42:01.876 --> 00:42:02.536]  See?
[00:42:02.536 --> 00:42:04.458]  He's got Russians telling him what to do in the office.
[00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.110]  I want to thank you all for the support.
[00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.291]  We've got some of the biggest sales in our history.
[00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:13.412]  We've never gone 80%, but those are some clearance items.
[00:42:13.412 --> 00:42:20.514]  There's some great t-shirts that for some reason, such an extensive area, kind of gets hidden on the shopping cart wherever.
[00:42:20.514 --> 00:42:21.755]  They're 80% off.
[00:42:21.755 --> 00:42:24.796]  That is below cost.
[00:42:24.796 --> 00:42:25.176]  We've got
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.061]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:30.243]  We'll be back with the really big news.

[00:44:27.382 --> 00:44:29.984]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[00:44:30.624 --> 00:44:32.146]  And so much more.
[00:44:32.146 --> 00:44:33.527]  It is concentrated.
[00:44:33.527 --> 00:44:35.268]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:44:35.268 --> 00:44:41.053]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:42.415]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:44:42.415 --> 00:44:44.296]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:44:44.296 --> 00:44:46.878]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:44:46.878 --> 00:44:48.320]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.682]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:44:50.682 --> 00:44:51.402]  Immune Wall.
[00:44:51.402 --> 00:44:52.844]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:52.844 --> 00:44:54.005]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:01.414 --> 00:45:02.915]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:45:02.915 --> 00:45:04.936]  Victor, you're calling, go ahead.
[00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:06.537]  Yes, hi Alex.
[00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:13.142]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:45:13.142 --> 00:45:17.484]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:45:17.484 --> 00:45:19.346]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:45:19.346 --> 00:45:29.172]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it's like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:45:30.173 --> 00:45:35.056]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:45:35.056 --> 00:45:43.121]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:45:43.121 --> 00:45:49.245]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:45:49.245 --> 00:45:54.789]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:45:54.789 --> 00:45:57.891]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.

[00:47:04.104 --> 00:47:06.727]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.684 --> 00:47:24.249]  The world is a dangerous place.
[00:47:24.249 --> 00:47:32.757]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:47:32.757 --> 00:47:37.122]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:37.122 --> 00:47:41.306]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:47:41.306 --> 00:47:42.928]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:44.807 --> 00:47:46.828]  So, we've got a blueprint to bring the country back.
[00:47:46.828 --> 00:47:50.789]  The globalists know it, and they're attacking us on every front, savagely.
[00:47:50.789 --> 00:47:51.810]  It isn't about us, though.
[00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:54.851]  It's about you and platforms where you still have free speech.
[00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:56.412]  And they want to exhaust us.
[00:47:56.412 --> 00:47:57.312]  They want to wear us out.
[00:47:57.312 --> 00:47:59.913]  But you're sick of hearing about censorship.
[00:47:59.913 --> 00:48:09.197]  They banned thousands of conservative, and libertarian, and Christian, and veterans, and gun sites on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube the last two weeks.
[00:48:09.197 --> 00:48:12.038]  But now, thousands of them have come back.
[00:48:14.127 --> 00:48:22.555]  And YouTube says, we're sorry, rogue employees did this, and you didn't do what we said you did.
[00:48:22.555 --> 00:48:36.409]  Now, you're not going to hear apologies from Stephen Colbert, or Jordan Klepper, or any of these comedians that read off teleprompters who pose as newsmen, and their job is to murder truth.
[00:48:37.435 --> 00:48:39.896]  You're not going to hear apologies from CNN, who's running the campaign.
[00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:41.397]  You're not going to hear apologies from SMBC.
[00:48:41.397 --> 00:48:46.219]  You're not going to hear apologies to you, the viewer and listener, that they lied to.
[00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:49.340]  They knew those videos said there were not crisis actors.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.701]  This was a real shooting.
[00:48:50.701 --> 00:48:54.022]  They banned a video that started like that.
[00:48:54.022 --> 00:49:04.466]  While the young man, Mr. Hogg, is on TV and on Twitter calling me a piece of you-know-what and calling me all these names, and I'm saying, young man, please come on.
[00:49:04.466 --> 00:49:05.607]  I'd like to politely debate you.
[00:49:06.696 --> 00:49:13.825]  I'm not going to talk to the likes of you that says nobody died.
[00:49:13.825 --> 00:49:16.689]  Using him to ban the free speech but because you stood up.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:32.002]  Because you stood up to him, because you got upset, because Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com, DrudgeReport.com, because he did that, and made it, because Drudge cared!
[00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:37.303]  All the rest, even the conservative and libertarian media thought, oh well, we'll have competition out of the way of Alex Falls.
[00:49:37.303 --> 00:49:41.024]  No, I'd be a domino, you'd be next.
[00:49:41.024 --> 00:49:48.546]  But Drudge, day after day, he linked yesterday to how they banned Corsi, and they put him back up today and apologized.
[00:49:48.546 --> 00:49:49.026]  See, Drudge,
[00:49:51.508 --> 00:49:55.350]  Has rational self-preservation traits.
[00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.472]  He's not a moron.
[00:49:58.472 --> 00:50:00.133]  But even the conservative side's cheered.
[00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:02.335]  Even the Washington Times kind of cheered.
[00:50:02.335 --> 00:50:03.776]  Like, yay!
[00:50:03.776 --> 00:50:04.396]  Yay!
[00:50:04.396 --> 00:50:05.457]  Let's start banning things!
[00:50:05.457 --> 00:50:08.199]  We'll get more attention, you morons!
[00:50:08.199 --> 00:50:10.220]  They're gonna shut you up next, you idiots!
[00:50:14.707 --> 00:50:16.848]  I mean, they really are idiots.
[00:50:16.848 --> 00:50:24.252]  Don't you know governments always pick some group first that they want to demonize and set the precedent?
[00:50:24.252 --> 00:50:26.593]  Then they end up arresting people.
[00:50:26.593 --> 00:50:29.174]  Are you really that historically illiterate?
[00:50:29.174 --> 00:50:34.957]  What is your problem?
[00:50:34.957 --> 00:50:39.620]  Well, yet again, Drudge pulls the bacon out of the fire.
[00:50:40.751 --> 00:50:42.392]  And you pulled the bacon out of the fire.
[00:50:42.392 --> 00:50:44.514]  By the way, Drudge pulled his own bacon out.
[00:50:44.514 --> 00:50:45.415]  I want to explain that.
[00:50:45.415 --> 00:50:47.477]  Not to say he didn't do something good, didn't have courage.
[00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:50.019]  In a world of cowards, just doing the right thing is heroic.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.702]  He's not satanic, you see.
[00:51:00.702 --> 00:51:04.465]  A satanic mindset doesn't even get its own preservation.
[00:51:04.465 --> 00:51:10.049]  It wants one level, one dimensional, mmm, somebody's going down, mmm, that makes me bigger.
[00:51:10.049 --> 00:51:14.973]  No, that makes you smaller, ding ding.
[00:51:14.973 --> 00:51:17.214]  I want to get to the Young Turks, bizarre deception.
[00:51:17.214 --> 00:51:20.437]  I can't play the whole thing, it's like eight minutes long.
[00:51:20.437 --> 00:51:26.602]  These are the people that are funded by Qatar and other Gulf state dictatorships and name themselves after the
[00:51:28.194 --> 00:51:34.257]  Brown shirt, paramilitary, that Hitler modeled the SA off of.
[00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:37.678]  He modeled it off Benito Mussolini and the Young Turks.
[00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:40.499]  Hitler wrote this, you can look it up.
[00:51:40.499 --> 00:51:48.243]  The SA, the thugs in the streets, the paramilitary before Hitler took power, the gangs, were modeled after the Young Turks.
[00:51:49.209 --> 00:51:51.974]  And he's a Turk, with the name Young Turk.
[00:51:51.974 --> 00:51:54.419]  And Islamists is funding.
[00:51:54.419 --> 00:51:58.807]  And then he gets up there and he says, George Soros
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:04.564]  I'm anti-semitic because I said George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:52:04.564 --> 00:52:08.408]  George Soros said he's proud that he survived by doing that.
[00:52:08.408 --> 00:52:15.915]  So let me see, if a foreign country occupied and then I helped round up my own family so I'd live, I'd be called a collaborator.
[00:52:15.915 --> 00:52:17.777]  I'd be called the lowest form of scum.
[00:52:17.777 --> 00:52:20.439]  Worse than the people that came in and took over, because they're bad.
[00:52:20.439 --> 00:52:21.981]  They're usurpers, but you're a traitor.
[00:52:24.133 --> 00:52:33.657]  And by some bizarre alchemy, they've got PR out there, CNN, ABC News, they always go, Alex Jones lies and says George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:52:33.657 --> 00:52:44.041]  I don't know, his dad wrote a book, he wrote a book, he went on 60 Minutes trying to hide it in plain view back in, what, 1999, when he thought everybody was so dumb they'd just buy into it.
[00:52:44.041 --> 00:52:52.725]  And that was his job, it was 14, 15, 16, was rounding Jews up in Hungary.
[00:52:52.725 --> 00:52:53.025]  And then,
[00:52:54.195 --> 00:53:03.439]  He's got the nerve to point his finger and then have a young Turk... A young Turk!
[00:53:03.439 --> 00:53:05.300]  It's all hiding in plain view!
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.201]  How'd you like how they rubbed our faces in it?
[00:53:08.201 --> 00:53:13.584]  A young Turk, an arrogant, dim-witted buffoon.
[00:53:13.584 --> 00:53:18.346]  Oh, but there's no...
[00:53:20.009 --> 00:53:22.370]  There's no connection to the Nazis with George Soros.
[00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:24.431]  And it's anti-semitic.
[00:53:24.431 --> 00:53:28.552]  I've attacked a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:28.552 --> 00:53:30.313]  Next we'll hear Hitler was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:30.313 --> 00:53:32.534]  Did you know Hitler was a holocaust survivor according to this logic?
[00:53:32.534 --> 00:53:34.014]  I think that's terrible.
[00:53:34.014 --> 00:53:35.275]  I don't think he was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:38.356]  I don't think Heinrich Himmler was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:38.356 --> 00:53:42.197]  I don't think Zeb Dietrich was a holocaust survivor.
[00:53:42.197 --> 00:53:45.498]  Or Klaus Barbie?
[00:53:45.498 --> 00:53:46.639]  Joseph Mingela perhaps?
[00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:57.716]  I know the Nazi survivor of Nazi wealth is the head of the unelected EU.
[00:53:57.716 --> 00:53:58.516]  Mr. Juncker.
[00:53:58.516 --> 00:54:01.919]  I'm running out of time here.
[00:54:01.919 --> 00:54:04.962]  Let's go to this clip of Soros first.
[00:54:06.892 --> 00:54:11.114]  It's the claim that the August protest was some sort of a left-wing plot.
[00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:13.174]  Who, you might ask, would say something so offensive?
[00:54:13.174 --> 00:54:15.916]  An elected representative who's serving right now in the U.S.
[00:54:15.916 --> 00:54:16.756]  Congress.
[00:54:16.756 --> 00:54:17.696]  Now look at the background.
[00:54:17.696 --> 00:54:22.518]  George Soros is one of those people that actually helps, you know, back these individuals.
[00:54:22.518 --> 00:54:23.418]  Who is he?
[00:54:23.418 --> 00:54:31.682]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[00:54:31.682 --> 00:54:32.182]  Yes, yes.
[00:54:33.556 --> 00:54:37.128]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:54:37.128 --> 00:54:37.549]  That's right.
[00:54:47.126 --> 00:54:48.906]  Not at all.
[00:54:48.906 --> 00:54:52.927]  Do you think George Soros funded the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville?
[00:54:52.927 --> 00:54:55.188]  It would be interesting to find out.
[00:54:55.188 --> 00:54:59.568]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:54:59.568 --> 00:55:01.169]  Is this lost on anyone?
[00:55:01.169 --> 00:55:06.490]  George Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator.
[00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:11.251]  But now let's hear from the young Turk named after a genocidal organization.
[00:55:11.251 --> 00:55:12.211]  Can't make this up.
[00:55:12.211 --> 00:55:12.811]  Let's hear from him.
[00:55:13.578 --> 00:55:19.200]  Alex Jones has received considerable criticism for, first of all, everything, as he should.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:25.623]  He's a lunatic, makes up wild conspiracy theories about pig-bear-human hybrids.
[00:55:25.623 --> 00:55:28.164]  And on top of that, he's deeply anti-Semitic.
[00:55:28.164 --> 00:55:29.764]  Now, why do I say that?
[00:55:29.764 --> 00:55:31.465]  For a number of reasons.
[00:55:31.465 --> 00:55:37.907]  He has attacked George Soros over and over again with references to his background.
[00:55:37.907 --> 00:55:40.388]  He attacked Michael Wolff, who wrote a book about Donald Trump.
[00:55:40.388 --> 00:55:41.369]  They both happen to be Jewish.
[00:55:43.817 --> 00:55:45.478]  Back that up.
[00:55:45.478 --> 00:55:47.098]  Michael Wolff writes this book.
[00:55:47.098 --> 00:55:49.159]  Everybody criticizes him.
[00:55:49.159 --> 00:55:50.499]  He's Jewish.
[00:55:50.499 --> 00:55:58.161]  And so I'm attacking Jews because George Soros is a Jew who worked with the Nazis.
[00:55:58.161 --> 00:55:58.902]  So it's anti-Semitic.
[00:55:58.902 --> 00:55:59.882]  Talk bad about him.
[00:55:59.882 --> 00:56:01.882]  This is a get out of jail free card is what he's saying.
[00:56:01.882 --> 00:56:03.163]  Wolff writes this phony book.
[00:56:03.163 --> 00:56:04.203]  Everybody decries it.
[00:56:04.203 --> 00:56:06.964]  He's known in New York as a fraud.
[00:56:06.964 --> 00:56:09.585]  And then, well, I mean, just hear it from Sink himself.
[00:56:09.585 --> 00:56:09.865]  Here it is.
[00:56:10.675 --> 00:56:15.059]  Over and over again with references to his background.
[00:56:15.059 --> 00:56:18.041]  He tagged Michael Wolff who wrote the book about Donald Trump.
[00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.303]  They both happen to be Jewish.
[00:56:20.303 --> 00:56:25.867]  He, you'll see it in a second as well, says that Soros worked with the Nazis.
[00:56:25.867 --> 00:56:30.391]  It's just like, to say someone who, I don't know if you know this, Soros survived the Holocaust.
[00:56:30.931 --> 00:56:32.592]  Alex Jones is the worst guy on earth.
[00:56:32.592 --> 00:56:35.513]  Anyway, we're going to get to what happened today in a second.
[00:56:35.513 --> 00:56:46.658]  But in his midst of his lunatic attacks against Americans of Jewish descent, he started with Michael Wolff just a little while back, just to give you some context.
[00:56:46.658 --> 00:56:48.698]  And he said, oh, Michael Wolff, he looks bad.
[00:56:48.698 --> 00:56:54.101]  And then he put up a picture of Brian Stelter and started railing on him and saying that he looks like Michael Wolff and they're all the same.
[00:56:54.781 --> 00:56:55.742]  Yeah, as it turns out, Brian.
[00:57:14.955 --> 00:57:17.356]  Don't forget, I almost forgot, free shipping store-wide.
[00:57:17.356 --> 00:57:18.917]  It's going to end on Monday.
[00:57:18.917 --> 00:57:20.598]  And we've got the biggest sales ever.
[00:57:20.598 --> 00:57:25.361]  So we buy a lot of product, great supplements, great books, great videos, great products.
[00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:29.323]  Infowarsstore.com, that's how you stand against George Soros and all these liars.
[00:57:29.323 --> 00:57:31.304]  What an incredible fraud.
[00:57:31.304 --> 00:57:36.567]  The worst person on earth, that's who I am, because I played a clip of George Soros saying he helped the Nazis.
[00:57:36.567 --> 00:57:39.049]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, that guy thinks you're stupid.
[00:57:39.329 --> 00:57:42.558]  And they want to shut us off the air so we can't show what liars.
[00:57:42.558 --> 00:57:43.380]  But guess what?
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.185]  You failed, scumbags!
[00:57:45.185 --> 00:57:46.187]  You failed again!
[00:57:49.764 --> 00:57:57.209]  I'm very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:57:57.209 --> 00:58:10.438]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:29.230]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[00:58:50.325 --> 00:58:54.168]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com.
[00:58:54.168 --> 00:58:58.892]  But instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:58:58.892 --> 00:59:03.456]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:06.599]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:09.702]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:59:11.215 --> 00:59:24.039]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:59:24.039 --> 00:59:39.104]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[00:59:40.105 --> 00:59:44.390]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what you can do for your family.
[00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.112]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:59:46.112 --> 00:59:53.442]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[00:59:53.442 --> 00:59:56.065]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:16.802]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.802 --> 01:00:29.445]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, on Texas Independence Day, it is the resistance to globalism.
[01:00:29.445 --> 01:00:30.725]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:34.086]  So, the young Turk, Cenk,
[01:00:35.296 --> 01:00:40.621]  The Gulf State Dictatorship-funded, Al Gore-funded creature.
[01:00:40.621 --> 01:00:49.149]  That's where the old prune caught line, caught with fake memos, of course, as well.
[01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:50.650]  The other fake newsman, Dan Rather.
[01:00:51.621 --> 01:00:57.605]  Now floats around over in that cesspit of the young, young turkeys.
[01:00:57.605 --> 01:01:00.567]  And I really shouldn't joke about this because it's so serious.
[01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:02.008]  I can't believe it.
[01:01:02.008 --> 01:01:07.072]  They've got all over the news saying George Soros never helped the Nazis.
[01:01:07.072 --> 01:01:10.874]  And that I'm lying, attacking a Holocaust survivor.
[01:01:10.874 --> 01:01:12.896]  This is so sick.
[01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.071]  But see, their followers will believe anything.
[01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:17.112]  So think of the logic.
[01:01:17.112 --> 01:01:25.576]  He helped, for years, round up Jews, because he was a teenager, and he could get in and find their hiding spots, and get them to tell them where their money was, and claim that they were going to get them out.
[01:01:25.576 --> 01:01:33.200]  And then they'd take their money, and give them over to the Nazis, and then give the money to the Nazis and keep part of it.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.861]  And they got super rich off that.
[01:01:34.861 --> 01:01:36.962]  And that's where George Soros came from.
[01:01:36.962 --> 01:01:41.424]  Man, you talk about having some baggage and being whacked out, and being screwed up.
[01:01:44.011 --> 01:01:51.013]  And then you got a guy named after a genocidal organization who denies that the Young Turks ever killed any Christian Armenians.
[01:01:51.013 --> 01:01:52.233]  They killed a million and a half of them.
[01:01:52.233 --> 01:01:54.414]  That's now admitted.
[01:01:54.414 --> 01:01:56.614]  On there saying, I'm the worst person in the world.
[01:01:56.614 --> 01:01:57.654]  Well, guess what, Cenk?
[01:01:57.654 --> 01:02:00.535]  You can't shut me up, buddy.
[01:02:00.535 --> 01:02:07.937]  And I've got over 200 radio stations and all these TV stations, and we are kicking your political behind up and down the street, buddy.
[01:02:10.404 --> 01:02:18.788]  You know, George Soros might actually be one of the worst people in the world, but you say I'm one of the worst people in the world.
[01:02:18.788 --> 01:02:32.774]  Even though they've had hundreds of investigative reporters, hundreds, usually it sounds like an exaggeration saying, I mean, it's probably thousands, crawling up and down, doing everything they can to try to find some body to tell lies or to twist things.
[01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:42.592]  And I was just thinking about the latest stuff and it actually made me feel sorry for the individuals because they're being used, but I have to do what I have to do.
[01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.474]  And I just thought about
[01:02:46.075 --> 01:02:50.539]  Some of the sad issues that those folks have, and I actually feel sorry for them.
[01:02:50.539 --> 01:02:52.721]  But it makes me even more angry at the globalists.
[01:02:52.721 --> 01:02:53.641]  It's crazy.
[01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:55.543]  But this is the level of deception we're dealing with.
[01:02:55.543 --> 01:02:58.365]  So let's go back to the Young Turks leader.
[01:02:58.365 --> 01:02:59.346]  Here he is.
[01:02:59.346 --> 01:03:05.431]  And they put up a picture of Brian Stelter and started railing on him and saying that he looks like Michael Wolff and they're all the same.
[01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:09.374]  Now, as it turns out, Brian Stelter is not Jewish.
[01:03:09.374 --> 01:03:11.156]  I never said Brian Stelter was Jewish.
[01:03:11.156 --> 01:03:13.538]  See how the deceptions are so fast?
[01:03:13.538 --> 01:03:14.839]  You have to listen every three seconds.
[01:03:16.308 --> 01:03:19.650]  He goes, oh look, Michael Wolff's Jewish, look how he looks.
[01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.371]  I didn't say that.
[01:03:21.371 --> 01:03:25.653]  I said, these guys have these crazy smiles.
[01:03:25.653 --> 01:03:27.955]  Like Jack Nicholson, he's not Jewish.
[01:03:27.955 --> 01:03:30.876]  I mean, they got, they're scary looking dudes, man.
[01:03:30.876 --> 01:03:32.838]  Ryan Stelter.
[01:03:32.838 --> 01:03:42.203]  I said, why would you put out these crazy, where he's like, that looks crazy.
[01:03:42.203 --> 01:03:45.485]  I've seen crazy people on the sidewalk, you know, that schizophrenics look like that.
[01:03:46.721 --> 01:03:47.702]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:03:47.702 --> 01:03:55.406]  Imagine you post your photo and it's like... I mean, he's just a weird looking dude.
[01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:58.328]  But again, oh, now I called him Jewish, but he's not.
[01:03:58.328 --> 01:03:59.849]  See Alex is wrong again.
[01:03:59.849 --> 01:04:01.550]  You just lie to your audience.
[01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:02.091]  Every word.
[01:04:03.223 --> 01:04:05.565]  Let's go back to Mr. Turd.
[01:04:05.565 --> 01:04:06.186]  He gets worked up.
[01:04:06.186 --> 01:04:06.926]  He doesn't know.
[01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:07.907]  He's like, look at him!
[01:04:07.907 --> 01:04:09.309]  In fact, here, let's show you the video.
[01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:11.350]  But just look at Skelter again!
[01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:12.652]  Put him on screen!
[01:04:12.652 --> 01:04:19.358]  I think all the broadcast should be is just a photo of Skelter smiling.
[01:04:19.358 --> 01:04:22.821]  Oh my gosh!
[01:04:22.821 --> 01:04:24.522]  Oh, hell on earth!
[01:04:24.522 --> 01:04:25.543]  Notice they did it on purpose.
[01:04:25.543 --> 01:04:26.724]  Media Matters blurs it.
[01:04:26.724 --> 01:04:28.306]  They all take it from Media Matters.
[01:04:28.306 --> 01:04:29.206]  That's George Soros.
[01:04:30.322 --> 01:04:31.583]  That's George Soros funded.
[01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:33.944]  The Young Turks have gotten George Soros money, it's been in the news.
[01:04:33.944 --> 01:04:36.166]  This is George Soros' TV station.
[01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:38.968]  Come on, come on up.
[01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:41.169]  Come on, come on up.
[01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:42.130]  Come on up.
[01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:47.133]  I think tomorrow I'm gonna get a personal, personal playing of this.
[01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:50.816]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[01:04:50.816 --> 01:04:53.578]  You are so aced, turd.
[01:04:53.578 --> 01:04:54.318]  You are so defeated.
[01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:01.462]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:10.589]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:11.970]  So what do we do about it?
[01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:15.093]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:05:15.293 --> 01:05:23.040]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:29.285]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.

[01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:53.817]  Brain Force Plus.

[01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:06.864]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:06.864 --> 01:06:10.826]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:10.826 --> 01:06:12.728]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:12.728 --> 01:06:14.889]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:14.889 --> 01:06:18.392]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:41.728]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:06:41.728 --> 01:06:46.831]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:46.831 --> 01:06:54.217]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the line.
[01:06:58.377 --> 01:07:00.278]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:00.278 --> 01:07:08.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:08.241 --> 01:07:22.188]  Well, I've been interviewing Larry Pratt for 20 years, at least 20 years, and I've never seen him as concerned as when he was on last night during a marathon broadcast that we're now into, what, hour 30 of?
[01:07:24.224 --> 01:07:25.588]  We'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:07:25.588 --> 01:07:26.571]  with a Sunday transmission.
[01:07:26.571 --> 01:07:31.126]  We're 10 hours a day live now with David Knight and his great transmission, The David Knight.
[01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:32.650]  We're good to go.
[01:07:56.892 --> 01:08:01.835]  We'll look at Amnesty for some dreamers, because he'd always said if they'd been here decades and weren't criminals, we could fast track that.
[01:08:01.835 --> 01:08:03.416]  That's reasonable.
[01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.798]  The Democrats came back and said we want total open borders.
[01:08:05.798 --> 01:08:09.280]  Total, you know, 20 deep chain migration, just unending.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.382]  So the whole thing was killed.
[01:08:11.382 --> 01:08:14.744]  But see, he always said he would be reasonable, and that was reasonable.
[01:08:14.744 --> 01:08:15.945]  He didn't do that with this.
[01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:21.354]  He said, no we're not going to repeal any of this, it's the criminals.
[01:08:21.354 --> 01:08:27.300]  And now we've got all these clips, I don't think I need to play them again, but just so we have them, let's play a few and then go to Larry Pratt.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:32.204]  Trump, I like taking the guns early, then do process.
[01:08:32.204 --> 01:08:34.646]  I mean, has he turned into Dianne Feinstein?
[01:08:34.646 --> 01:08:35.647]  Did he get a brain transplant?
[01:08:35.647 --> 01:08:35.928]  Here it is.
[01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:41.596]  I take the firearms first and then go to court because that's another system.
[01:08:41.596 --> 01:08:49.223]  Because a lot of times by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures.
[01:08:49.223 --> 01:08:55.047]  I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man's case that just took place in Florida.
[01:08:55.828 --> 01:08:56.969]  He had a lot of firearms.
[01:08:56.969 --> 01:08:58.370]  They saw everything.
[01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.812]  To go to court would have taken a long time.
[01:08:59.812 --> 01:09:04.936]  So you could do exactly what you're saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.
[01:09:04.936 --> 01:09:06.698]  That is the dream of the gun grabbers.
[01:09:06.698 --> 01:09:08.460]  That's actually Bloomberg's plan.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:12.664]  They just say, oh, you see a psychologist, you can't have guns.
[01:09:12.664 --> 01:09:13.044]  No.
[01:09:13.044 --> 01:09:13.865]  There's already laws.
[01:09:13.865 --> 01:09:18.249]  You say, I'm going to kill people, and the police have been to your house, and you're on meds.
[01:09:18.249 --> 01:09:19.089]  You get adjudicated.
[01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:21.852]  The guy at the Texas shooting at the church.
[01:09:21.852 --> 01:09:23.193]  He'd been in a mental institution.
[01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:24.575]  He escaped.
[01:09:24.575 --> 01:09:26.736]  He had a dishonorable discharge and he went and bought the guns.
[01:09:26.736 --> 01:09:27.838]  They didn't put up the database.
[01:09:27.838 --> 01:09:32.762]  They need to court-martial the commanding officer over that and they'll start getting that in the database.
[01:09:32.762 --> 01:09:33.703]  I'm going to go to Larry Pratt.
[01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.044]  That's what we got him on.
[01:09:35.044 --> 01:09:38.107]  But I can't even hardly play these clips, the other ones.
[01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:44.092]  Let's play the Feinstein Wicked Witch of the West garbage because it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:44.092 --> 01:09:44.353]  Here it is.
[01:09:45.017 --> 01:09:48.498]  If you can add that to this bill, that would be great, Diane.
[01:09:48.498 --> 01:09:52.860]  If you could add what you have also, and I think you can, into the bill.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.180]  Joe, are you ready?
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.501]  Can you do that?
[01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:56.921]  Joe, can you do that, Pat?
[01:09:56.921 --> 01:09:59.042]  Can you add some of this?
[01:10:01.443 --> 01:10:04.806]  Well, no, I'll help, but can you add what- Republicans look really upset.
[01:10:04.806 --> 01:10:05.847]  Can we add them in?
[01:10:05.847 --> 01:10:09.811]  And I know you can add what John- Yeah, I have another domestic violence- Cornyn's like, what the hell just happened?
[01:10:09.811 --> 01:10:14.415]  It's about dating partners, and a number of states have just enacted- I would say this.
[01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:16.377]  We're going to get it passed.
[01:10:16.377 --> 01:10:17.478]  We're going to get it passed.
[01:10:17.478 --> 01:10:24.485]  If you can add domestic violence, paragraphs, pages into this bill, I'm all for it.
[01:10:25.746 --> 01:10:27.767]  It's already there, Mr. President.
[01:10:27.767 --> 01:10:28.608]  So I know what he's doing.
[01:10:28.608 --> 01:10:31.569]  He's taking the you-know-what out of them, as they say in England.
[01:10:31.569 --> 01:10:38.993]  But you can't do it because it advances their flawed, fake system when they're admitting they want abolition of the Second Amendment is the goal, piece by piece.
[01:10:38.993 --> 01:10:41.214]  Larry Pratt, Gunners of America, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:41.214 --> 01:10:43.295]  I know you're a busy, busy man.
[01:10:43.295 --> 01:10:46.977]  What is the state of this situation right now?
[01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:49.118]  Let me just comment on one thing the President was saying.
[01:10:51.404 --> 01:11:01.993]  expressed a correct outrage for him to say, we're going to take care of due process after we've grabbed you and thrown you in the clink.
[01:11:01.993 --> 01:11:11.420]  And then he referred to the dirt bag down in Florida where 39 times the police came to his house.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:14.222]  They didn't do a thing.
[01:11:14.222 --> 01:11:18.446]  Why would we think that somehow being able to throw somebody in jail
[01:11:19.096 --> 01:11:31.888]  Fixes something that was not a problem until their own sloppiness and lack of desire to interact with people that have been reported by who knows how many neighbors and people at school.
[01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:36.512]  This was a bad dude and apparently everybody knew it except the sheriff.
[01:11:38.477 --> 01:11:59.505]  Don't don't don't talk about clearly a stand down and we need to be on offense that they had all the warnings he was on the drugs they stood down all the defaults were not followed we have the protections in place and as you said they're always trying to keep us from having select teachers armed which is the answer that sure is the answer and isn't it interesting that
[01:12:00.323 --> 01:12:04.745]  Except for Congressman Massey and maybe a couple of Senators.
[01:12:04.745 --> 01:12:08.187]  You just don't hear anybody talking about arming teachers.
[01:12:08.187 --> 01:12:14.470]  They're the ones that are going to be there during the first five, six minutes of a dirtbag's attack.
[01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:16.831]  That's when most of the people get killed.
[01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:20.053]  Sometimes that's all it lasts is five or six minutes.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.342]  And we're not talking about arming teachers.
[01:12:23.342 --> 01:12:30.609]  Now, to the President's credit, he did say he would support that, but he's also supporting the shredding of the Second Amendment.
[01:12:30.609 --> 01:12:31.990]  What's the word on Capitol Hill?
[01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:33.691]  I know you've got feelers out.
[01:12:33.691 --> 01:12:36.914]  Is he just doing like DACA and being reasonable, and then they won't be reasonable?
[01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:38.235]  No, he's not really being reasonable.
[01:12:38.235 --> 01:12:40.297]  He's playing along with their false logic.
[01:12:40.297 --> 01:12:44.741]  What are your... I know you've got some of the top lobbyists in the halls right now.
[01:12:44.741 --> 01:12:46.142]  What in Hades is going on?
[01:12:46.142 --> 01:12:47.684]  And what are the Republican lawmakers saying?
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:59.851]  Well, we're still hoping that this is a feint, the way it was in DACA, and that he's ultimately going to spring the trap and the situation will be resolved.
[01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:04.055]  But it doesn't sound that way, because he's used different language on this.
[01:13:04.055 --> 01:13:08.440]  He hasn't talked about how he might be able to walk it back.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.503]  So we think this is a big, big deal.
[01:13:14.503 --> 01:13:23.530]  And we hope people will continue to, as many times a day as they can manage, contact the White House to tell them that this is the end of the Second Amendment.
[01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:29.715]  And it will also, if you carry this out, be the end of the Republican Party.
[01:13:29.715 --> 01:13:33.197]  They're going to get wiped out in 2018 elections.
[01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:42.654]  If this is what they have brought to the table for the voters to judge them on, they will be judged and found wanting.
[01:13:42.654 --> 01:13:51.639]  This is an incredible betrayal, and the President seems to be rather more serious about this than he was with DACA.
[01:13:51.639 --> 01:13:55.361]  Again, I'm still leaving the door open, at least a crack.
[01:13:55.361 --> 01:14:00.284]  Hopefully the President is gaming this, but it increasingly doesn't sound that way.
[01:14:01.472 --> 01:14:06.533]  And even if he's trying to set a trap, it was a very reckless thing to say.
[01:14:06.533 --> 01:14:09.094]  Man, I just felt like, I'm not, I'm not putting on an actor.
[01:14:09.094 --> 01:14:10.794]  I just felt nauseous.
[01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:11.894]  I mean, I have been so committed.
[01:14:11.894 --> 01:14:13.454]  He's done so much good.
[01:14:13.454 --> 01:14:15.715]  It means Larry, they must've compromised him.
[01:14:15.715 --> 01:14:19.555]  He's been fighting so hard and they're just all around him and he's been good.
[01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:20.836]  My gut knows he's good.
[01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:23.896]  And, and I, and my gut thinks they're turning him.
[01:14:23.896 --> 01:14:27.197]  I, I think what you think my gut tells me, this is so sad, Larry.
[01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:33.390]  The way we've seen him, and I think I mentioned this last night, is that the president is not a conservative.
[01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:37.912]  We've never heard him refer to prominent conservative thinkers.
[01:14:37.912 --> 01:14:46.375]  He doesn't express himself as if he's looking at the economy as Ludwig von Mises might, a famous libertarian economist.
[01:14:49.336 --> 01:14:51.897]  Has been a fighter against the establishment.
[01:14:51.897 --> 01:14:54.118]  Republican and Democrat alike.
[01:14:54.118 --> 01:14:58.340]  And when he was doing that, most of the time we would be saying, right on.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:01.581]  Those are good things that you're opposing and fighting for.
[01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:03.862]  And he came across as a fighter.
[01:15:03.862 --> 01:15:05.482]  And hopefully he still is.
[01:15:05.482 --> 01:15:12.305]  But now we're talking about a major turn where he doesn't seem to have a rudder
[01:15:12.965 --> 01:15:15.387]  Because he doesn't seem to be a concern.
[01:15:15.387 --> 01:15:18.429]  For the first time I read CNN headlines this morning and some of them were true.
[01:15:18.429 --> 01:15:22.573]  They're basically saying he's rudderless and he's suddenly become rudderless.
[01:15:22.573 --> 01:15:24.975]  Let's come back in the last segment and ask why and what do we do.
[01:15:24.975 --> 01:15:26.015]  But hey, here's the good news.
[01:15:26.015 --> 01:15:27.897]  Larry Pratt's not gonna roll over.
[01:15:28.197 --> 01:15:29.258]  I don't care what they do to me.
[01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.859]  You see what they're doing to me, folks.
[01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:31.459]  It's 100% fake.
[01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:32.280]  I'm not rolling over.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.041]  Ted Nugent's not rolling over.
[01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:35.161]  The veterans aren't rolling over.
[01:15:35.161 --> 01:15:36.682]  This audience isn't rolling over.
[01:15:36.682 --> 01:15:39.584]  And the Republican Party, the leadership, they're not rolling over.
[01:15:39.584 --> 01:15:42.306]  I've seen them say, listen, Mr. President, we're not doing this.
[01:15:42.306 --> 01:15:50.450]  We're not going to just go along with the last thing you heard from somebody, because you want to sit there with a bunch of grieving people that manipulated you, and so they pulled on your heartstrings.
[01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:51.211]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:51.211 --> 01:15:52.292]  Stay with us.
[01:15:52.292 --> 01:15:53.953]  Are we seeing the end of Trump?
[01:15:53.953 --> 01:15:55.854]  Or will he wake up before he crashes the plane?
[01:15:58.007 --> 01:15:59.208]  Hear that?
[01:15:59.208 --> 01:16:04.612]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.612 --> 01:16:07.515]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.515 --> 01:16:11.097]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:11.097 --> 01:16:18.663]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:16:18.663 --> 01:16:23.267]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:23.267 --> 01:16:25.689]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:16:25.689 --> 01:16:26.870]  Faketv.com
[01:16:27.634 --> 01:16:29.515]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:16:29.515 --> 01:16:32.757]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[01:16:32.757 --> 01:16:34.358]  Savory and delicious.
[01:16:34.358 --> 01:16:37.180]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:37.840]  Awesome!
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.942]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:16:40.942 --> 01:16:42.503]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:16:42.503 --> 01:16:43.123]  Bacon.
[01:16:43.123 --> 01:16:47.286]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[01:16:47.286 --> 01:16:48.707]  Or warm and served.
[01:16:48.707 --> 01:16:50.768]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:16:50.768 --> 01:16:52.689]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[01:16:52.689 --> 01:16:55.491]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.

[01:16:58.507 --> 01:17:06.172]  Ever since ID Stronghold created RFID blocking wallet technology over 10 years ago, major designer brands have tried to create their own versions.
[01:17:06.172 --> 01:17:07.573]  But do they really work?
[01:17:07.573 --> 01:17:14.437]  We let real people test designer brand RFID blocking wallets using the same rigorous testing ID Stronghold wallets go through.
[01:17:14.437 --> 01:17:15.858]  So how did the designer brands do?
[01:17:16.158 --> 01:17:21.742]  I expected notable brands to perform well, and I was pretty surprised to see that it was not fully protected.
[01:17:21.742 --> 01:17:27.226]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising that they do.
[01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:32.409]  Get a Stronghold on your credit cards, license, and other critical data with ID Stronghold wallets.
[01:17:32.409 --> 01:17:35.151]  Other RFID blocking wallets simply aren't the same.
[01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:37.473]  ID Stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[01:17:37.473 --> 01:17:40.935]  I would definitely recommend ID Stronghold wallets to my friends and family.
[01:17:41.195 --> 01:17:41.976]  Check the label.
[01:17:41.976 --> 01:17:44.958]  If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:47.460]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold wallet.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:54.046]  Get the most trusted brand in RFID blocking wallets and protect yourself from electronic pickpocketing.

[01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:03.931]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:18:03.931 --> 01:18:08.693]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:18:08.693 --> 01:18:17.375]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:20.776]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[01:18:20.876 --> 01:18:26.141]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:18:26.141 --> 01:18:33.447]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:37.350]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:42.074]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:18:42.074 --> 01:18:45.658]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:18:46.118 --> 01:18:47.459]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.
[01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:48.299]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:18:48.299 --> 01:18:49.420]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:19:06.923 --> 01:19:18.427]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[01:19:18.427 --> 01:19:27.530]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:33.795]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[01:19:33.795 --> 01:19:39.240]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.502]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[01:19:41.502 --> 01:19:43.523]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:47.812]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:19:47.812 --> 01:19:49.834]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:19:49.834 --> 01:19:53.137]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:19:53.137 --> 01:19:55.680]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:01.525]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[01:20:01.525 --> 01:20:04.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:22.951]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:24.531]  Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.531 --> 01:20:35.695]  The big question for Larry Pratt, we're going to him in just one moment, dot owners dot org, is
[01:20:44.187 --> 01:20:55.131]  What is the political calculus when the left has already been so brainwashed to hate Trump and Reagan Democrats are still going to vote for Trump if he delivers on the economy, which he is.
[01:20:55.131 --> 01:21:05.115]  All you do is turn your base off and demoralize them to not fight when he already re-announced his campaign 900 days out.
[01:21:07.011 --> 01:21:10.355]  980 something days out because they're already campaigning against him.
[01:21:10.355 --> 01:21:15.560]  He needs his base fired up, engaged, foaming at the mouth.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.982]  Not disillusioned.
[01:21:16.982 --> 01:21:22.628]  I know maybe the calculus is if they do this, everybody will wake because now maybe the Second Amendment's under attack.
[01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:25.051]  Maybe it's super sophisticated 3D chess.
[01:21:25.051 --> 01:21:27.674]  I mean, I can kind of war game this, but I don't think that's what it is.
[01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:28.415]  I think it's him trying to get
[01:21:29.673 --> 01:21:33.396]  Points with the press to get them off his back, and I think that'll just make him intensified.
[01:21:33.396 --> 01:21:38.821]  George W. Bush, you know, ratified and signed onto Biden's all the assault weapon stuff.
[01:21:38.821 --> 01:21:41.964]  It's Republicans that keep giving us this stuff by being bullied.
[01:21:41.964 --> 01:21:42.404]  It's crazy.
[01:21:42.404 --> 01:21:45.166]  We'll talk to Larry Pratt here and find out how we get out of this in a minute.
[01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:45.727]  But first off...
[01:21:47.059 --> 01:21:48.900]  You fight back by joining the NRA.
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.402]  The folks that keep them honest, you join gunowners.org.
[01:21:51.402 --> 01:21:53.123]  That's even more important.
[01:21:53.123 --> 01:21:55.584]  And you support this broadcast.
[01:21:55.584 --> 01:21:57.766]  They've taken down Dr. Corsi's YouTube.
[01:21:57.766 --> 01:21:58.726]  Violates no other rules.
[01:21:58.726 --> 01:21:59.487]  They had to put it back up.
[01:21:59.487 --> 01:22:00.888]  They said rogue employees did it.
[01:22:00.888 --> 01:22:02.068]  That's major news.
[01:22:02.068 --> 01:22:04.290]  Yes, rogue employees put fake strikes on us.
[01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:08.613]  Well CNN bragged that they were working with the insiders at YouTube to do it.
[01:22:08.613 --> 01:22:09.653]  Did you hear that?
[01:22:09.653 --> 01:22:12.055]  YouTube's in Bloomberg saying rogue employees did it.
[01:22:13.089 --> 01:22:15.890]  And CNN says they were talking to the employees, getting them to do it.
[01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:19.612]  I mean, CNN is trying to shut us down.
[01:22:19.612 --> 01:22:23.513]  Launched the campaign last Friday, seven days ago.
[01:22:23.513 --> 01:22:28.795]  I know for a fact they're offering people big money to lie about me, folks, and we knew it was coming.
[01:22:28.795 --> 01:22:35.798]  And in the case that they picked to do it in, it's unbelievably phony like Swiss cheese.
[01:22:35.798 --> 01:22:37.359]  The holes are very easy to disprove.
[01:22:37.359 --> 01:22:40.240]  I just feel sorry for the people that got, you know, induced into it.
[01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:51.999]  And later I'm going to let them know that there's still time to come forward and admit who paid you and why they did it and the rest of it, because we already know.
[01:22:51.999 --> 01:22:55.840]  But we'll just let you go through that process.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.921]  Now, again, we have Operation Paul Revere 2018.
[01:22:58.921 --> 01:23:02.842]  It's 30 to 80 percent off, and we're talking about our best sellers.
[01:23:02.842 --> 01:23:06.804]  I mean, I sold out of our Super Tumor, our bodies.
[01:23:08.038 --> 01:23:10.500]  I told you I was selling out.
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.241]  So a bunch of stuff selling out.
[01:23:12.241 --> 01:23:13.422]  Biome Defense, 50% off.
[01:23:13.422 --> 01:23:15.603]  Great Probiotic, Trueway, 50% off.
[01:23:15.603 --> 01:23:17.704]  Prebiotic Fiber, that's our newest product.
[01:23:17.704 --> 01:23:18.685]  It's the best source fiber.
[01:23:18.685 --> 01:23:21.627]  It's really amazing, concentrated, super high quality.
[01:23:21.627 --> 01:23:24.989]  Infowars Life, select products, 40% off.
[01:23:24.989 --> 01:23:25.970]  Clearance Apparel, 80% off.
[01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:27.351]  That's some of our best stuff.
[01:23:27.351 --> 01:23:28.571]  There's just so much apparel.
[01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:29.992]  Some stuff sells out, some doesn't.
[01:23:29.992 --> 01:23:31.874]  So there's some great deals and amazing shirts.
[01:23:32.842 --> 01:23:34.346]  Sweatshirts and caps, you name it.
[01:23:34.346 --> 01:23:36.211]  Aegis Body Armor for backpack inserts.
[01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:38.437]  Very lightweight, nanotech stuff.
[01:23:38.437 --> 01:23:40.182]  It's 20% off.
[01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:41.264]  Already a very, very low price.
[01:23:42.871 --> 01:23:48.975]  I mean, 200 bucks for some backpack, high-quality, high-tech, space-age stuff's a great deal, and 20% off, that's an even better deal.
[01:23:48.975 --> 01:23:53.818]  So, check it all out, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:23:53.818 --> 01:23:56.239]  And we've got free shipping for a while.
[01:23:56.239 --> 01:24:04.825]  There's so many deals, I can't get into all of it, but these deals are so big, we need to sell a lot of product to be able to face this, and I've got to have the lawyers,
[01:24:06.369 --> 01:24:09.391]  And a lot of other stuff, you know, we're going to have to put into motion here.
[01:24:09.391 --> 01:24:12.273]  Because let me tell you, this is like a James Bond movie around here.
[01:24:12.273 --> 01:24:17.196]  And we've got to have counterintelligence, intelligence, we've got to have it all.
[01:24:17.196 --> 01:24:18.637]  This is the info war.
[01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:23.601]  And we're at this level now where it's every day I have to make the right decisions or we go down.
[01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:25.942]  Which will be its own spectacular victory against the Globals.
[01:24:25.942 --> 01:24:29.224]  That's going to blow up really big if they kill me or set me up or whatever.
[01:24:29.224 --> 01:24:32.467]  I mean, we see them launch the attack and then the support comes.
[01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:34.148]  But what's scary is it's like spiritual.
[01:24:34.148 --> 01:24:35.729]  It's always just enough to beat them.
[01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:37.591]  And it's always just enough.
[01:24:37.591 --> 01:24:41.976]  And I'm like, God, if we had a whole bunch more money, we could really beat him.
[01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:44.899]  No, it's always just enough, just enough, just enough.
[01:24:44.899 --> 01:24:46.401]  So you guys, it's like magic.
[01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:49.644]  You just come through with exactly what we need, never really more.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.042]  And I, it's, it's, it's, it's God.
[01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:55.323]  Going back to Larry, you've got the floor the last four minutes.
[01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:56.804]  I appreciate you holding while I plug.
[01:24:56.804 --> 01:24:57.865]  Keep us afloat here.
[01:24:57.865 --> 01:25:00.366]  Gunowners.org, you can give the number out as well.
[01:25:00.366 --> 01:25:01.607]  In closing, you heard my points.
[01:25:01.607 --> 01:25:03.808]  What does, what's the calculus?
[01:25:03.808 --> 01:25:05.829]  I mean, even if he was Machiavelli, he's winning.
[01:25:05.829 --> 01:25:06.930]  Why is he doing this?
[01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:09.572]  And what do we do to get him back on the straight and narrow?
[01:25:10.945 --> 01:25:20.713]  Well, if folks go to GunOwners.org, they can give a substantial boost to getting the President back in line, getting back on the rails.
[01:25:20.713 --> 01:25:30.042]  GunOwners.org, you can sign up right on the link from the front page to get the free email alerts, and they're what enable you to be like Paul Revere.
[01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:37.348]  You can just spread the word, you can get your email sent up from what we send you, and the whole thing probably takes less than 30 seconds.
[01:25:37.748 --> 01:25:54.503]  Now, the battle that we're fighting right now, besides trying to get the President back on the rails, is to stop the gun bill that's in the Congress, because they're talking about putting Dianne Feinstein's semi-automatic ban on what at one time was a good piece of legislation.
[01:25:54.503 --> 01:25:56.285]  That's some time ago now.
[01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:59.908]  But that, I think, if they really try to do that,
[01:26:00.504 --> 01:26:04.749]  Would almost certainly be an important mistake.
[01:26:04.749 --> 01:26:09.293]  Because they would be putting something up where they may not even have 40 votes.
[01:26:10.519 --> 01:26:23.815]  Uh, for that measure, and if they will then leave their tank forth the bridge, and it's going to block the ability of other measures in the gun control agenda to get across that bridge.
[01:26:23.815 --> 01:26:30.443]  So we think that they if they proceed that way, they're likely to find that they've shot themselves in the foot.
[01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:34.111]  And let's hope that we can indeed pull that off.
[01:26:34.111 --> 01:26:49.675]  And once we're in that posture, once it's the Feinstein bill they're blocking, somebody, all some senator, a good guy has to do is say, I object to the next move, which would be to get around it, to set aside, bring up other gun control measures.
[01:26:50.355 --> 01:26:55.957]  One person saying, I object, and the whole enterprise gets shut down.
[01:26:55.957 --> 01:27:06.040]  And we can hold them in that position for a fairly long period of time while we continue, hopefully, to build our own support and our own forces.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:16.903]  Who would have thought, because he did the right thing after Vegas, and pointed out that it was all illegal, what happened, there was a stand-down, Islamic connections, you name it, and the media
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.083]  Backed off because the story fell apart, whatever really happened.
[01:27:22.083 --> 01:27:24.405]  And then now with this, this is blood in the water.
[01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:35.374]  I've got a, it looks like an exclusive about another county with our connections in Florida, where another person says they're going to shoot people as a Democrat sheriff and the report is they've let the person go.
[01:27:35.374 --> 01:27:40.739]  So, I mean, it just, it just continues to happen.
[01:27:40.739 --> 01:27:44.002]  Doesn't Trump understand that this will destroy him?
[01:27:44.002 --> 01:27:46.204]  Does he understand that the base isn't going to put up with this?
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.761]  You would think the answer to that would be, of course he understands that.
[01:27:50.761 --> 01:27:53.901]  But right now, the question's legitimate.
[01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:57.462]  Because what he's done is certainly not helpful to himself.
[01:27:57.462 --> 01:28:06.524]  And unless he has some plan, as I was mentioning earlier, to game the Democrats and some of the anti-gun Republicans, he's headed down the wrong path.
[01:28:06.524 --> 01:28:10.984]  And he better, for sure, have a way back to where he came from.
[01:28:10.984 --> 01:28:14.385]  Because otherwise, it's not going to end well politically for him at all.
[01:28:14.605 --> 01:28:20.513]  Well, exactly, and Feinstein and others' body language was just, they were in ecstasy because her own party's about to throw her overboard.
[01:28:20.513 --> 01:28:22.696]  This makes her look strong to go ahead and get the nomination.
[01:28:22.696 --> 01:28:27.102]  Yeah, rubbing her hands together like a giant rat.
[01:28:27.102 --> 01:28:30.206]  But the Wicked Witch of the West, it's an incredible photo.
[01:28:30.206 --> 01:28:31.188]  I'm so glad you got it.
[01:28:31.886 --> 01:28:40.313]  Well, sir, if it wasn't for GunOwners.org, because I was there watching it to keep the NRA somewhat honest, and it wasn't people like Ted Nugent, we wouldn't be here today with the Second Amendment left.
[01:28:40.313 --> 01:28:41.474]  So God bless you.
[01:28:41.474 --> 01:28:42.915]  We salute you, Larry Pratt.
[01:28:42.915 --> 01:28:44.096]  GunOwners.org.
[01:28:44.096 --> 01:28:47.079]  And what's the number?
[01:28:47.079 --> 01:28:49.801]  Uh, 888-886-GUNS.
[01:28:49.801 --> 01:28:52.924]  But mostly people use the internet these days, I'm happy to say.
[01:28:52.924 --> 01:28:53.885]  I know they do, brother.
[01:28:53.885 --> 01:28:54.545]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:54.545 --> 01:28:55.086]  We're in a fight.
[01:28:55.086 --> 01:28:55.866]  We're going to fight together.
[01:28:55.866 --> 01:28:56.347]  We salute you.
[01:28:57.475 --> 01:28:58.376]  It's a no-brainer.

[01:33:41.962 --> 01:33:52.950]  If a woman shares a meme that shows an ISIS member with crap for brains, she gets arrested and put in prison and strip searched.
[01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:56.153]  I mean, they're putting 70-year-old women in jail for months.
[01:33:56.153 --> 01:33:59.856]  And it has them begging on the news, apologizing for what they've done.
[01:33:59.856 --> 01:34:04.739]  And you have an extension of that.
[01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:05.260]  YouTube
[01:34:08.274 --> 01:34:10.416]  Tried to ban our channel.
[01:34:10.416 --> 01:34:15.179]  CNN was on the news saying, we reported that they said nobody died.
[01:34:15.179 --> 01:34:16.060]  We're working with them.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.621]  We put in the complaint.
[01:34:17.621 --> 01:34:19.322]  A so-called news organization.
[01:34:19.322 --> 01:34:20.804]  Total tortious interference.
[01:34:20.804 --> 01:34:21.604]  Total racketeering.
[01:34:21.604 --> 01:34:23.085]  I got a lawyer right here, Mike Cernovich.
[01:34:23.085 --> 01:34:23.966]  He'll give us his take.
[01:34:23.966 --> 01:34:25.027]  But I've talked to my lawyers.
[01:34:26.579 --> 01:34:33.643]  And I've talked to Veritas and all the other people that caught them on video, YouTube, saying our job is to censor Alex Jones, people like him.
[01:34:33.643 --> 01:34:38.346]  And they have Facebook and Twitter employees going, also American flags and veterans.
[01:34:38.346 --> 01:34:40.687]  Just veterans are called dumb rednecks.
[01:34:40.687 --> 01:34:45.210]  Black, white, Hispanic, you're scum too.
[01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:47.391]  You really realize these people, they're globalists.
[01:34:47.391 --> 01:34:50.693]  They think of everybody who's pro-America as some dumb idiot.
[01:34:52.961 --> 01:35:00.245]  We got video from Campus Reform where a professor, one of the head professors of the university walks over and goes, oh I see you're paid by the Russians!
[01:35:00.245 --> 01:35:04.467]  And it's NRA stuff.
[01:35:04.467 --> 01:35:07.068]  And anti-socialism pamphlets and pro-gun pamphlets.
[01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:11.951]  And the guy sits there and debates them and goes, I really know that you're Russians.
[01:35:11.951 --> 01:35:14.052]  And then this fake EEOC complaint about me.
[01:35:14.052 --> 01:35:19.194]  They just, Hillary Clinton's, it's Hillary's former personal lawyer.
[01:35:19.194 --> 01:35:20.035]  He brags about it.
[01:35:20.834 --> 01:35:25.215]  He worked for her when he got out of college at Georgetown and was her personal assistant.
[01:35:25.215 --> 01:35:30.076]  And then a lawyer for her.
[01:35:30.076 --> 01:35:35.337]  He says I'm a liar and all this stuff and that this EEOC thing will just add to all of it.
[01:35:35.337 --> 01:35:38.977]  So he makes a political statement in it.
[01:35:38.977 --> 01:35:45.399]  And then they say that I have a Russian operative that handles me in the EEOC report.
[01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:45.879]  I mean, folks.
[01:35:47.284 --> 01:35:52.592]  You know how desperate they are that they're now putting in EEOC complaints that there are Russians.
[01:35:52.592 --> 01:35:54.154]  Yes, Daria was born in Russia.
[01:35:54.154 --> 01:35:55.496]  Yes, she's an army veteran.
[01:35:55.496 --> 01:35:56.777]  Yes, she's a patriot.
[01:35:56.777 --> 01:35:58.360]  And it's so crazy.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.541]  How about discriminatory?
[01:35:59.541 --> 01:36:03.247]  They're saying we're bad because someone born in Russia works here, and that's the proof.
[01:36:05.714 --> 01:36:18.143]  And again, she's a combat veteran, a whole nine yards, honorably discharged, you honorably serve your country, and you have a Russian background, and you are the devil, and you are just convicted.
[01:36:18.143 --> 01:36:23.427]  All right, let's go to Mike Cernovich, because I was thinking about him like three days ago.
[01:36:23.427 --> 01:36:25.829]  I'm not kidding.
[01:36:25.829 --> 01:36:29.691]  I'm sitting there at night, driving home, and I'm thinking about him.
[01:36:29.691 --> 01:36:31.172]  Boy, he had the idea to protest Google.
[01:36:31.172 --> 01:36:34.074]  I mean, we've done it before as well, but he had the idea, we have to get out there with our censorship.
[01:36:35.353 --> 01:36:39.197]  They had the whole Charlottesville thing, and Google said, oh, people are planning to attack us.
[01:36:39.197 --> 01:36:40.979]  We knew it was a setup, so we canceled them.
[01:36:41.991 --> 01:36:46.613]  But I was thinking about it, and then I get home and the text comes in saying, hey, we got to do this for our lives.
[01:36:46.613 --> 01:36:48.374]  We got to fight for the First Amendment right here.
[01:36:48.374 --> 01:36:49.114]  This is the takeover.
[01:36:49.114 --> 01:36:50.115]  You got to do it, Alex.
[01:36:50.115 --> 01:36:51.476]  And so he's been busy the last few days.
[01:36:51.476 --> 01:36:53.136]  We've got him on to talk about it.
[01:36:53.136 --> 01:36:53.917]  He's absolutely right.
[01:36:53.917 --> 01:36:56.278]  Stop by Stop Bus is coming up in a couple of weeks in Austin.
[01:36:56.278 --> 01:36:57.519]  They're all going to be here.
[01:36:57.519 --> 01:37:01.380]  And he wants to coordinate this from behind the scenes so they don't know when we're coming, when you're coming.
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:04.222]  And I think he's a good leader, so I'm going to let him honcho this.
[01:37:04.222 --> 01:37:05.122]  But I'm going to work with him.
[01:37:05.122 --> 01:37:06.143]  But watch this channel.
[01:37:06.943 --> 01:37:17.806]  When the South by Southwest is going on for what we're going to do, it's going to be legal and lawful, but they are so scared of us physically showing up because they only want cyber control.
[01:37:17.806 --> 01:37:19.867]  They're totally afraid of grassroots.
[01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:28.210]  So Mike Cernovich, what would you say historically the point we've reached now with just this whole cornucopia of insanity and Trump starting to go sideways and
[01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:32.438]  But our YouTube, Corsi's YouTube channel was taken down, they put it back up today.
[01:37:32.438 --> 01:37:35.264]  YouTube apologizes and said we have rogues.
[01:37:35.264 --> 01:37:38.051]  I mean, this is a real civil war in the country.
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:46.584]  Well, Alex, I'm usually a positive and upbeat guy, but I'm not positive and upbeat about this.
[01:37:46.584 --> 01:37:47.784]  It's life or death now.
[01:37:47.784 --> 01:37:51.426]  This isn't the usual, oh, we're under, we're always under attack.
[01:37:51.426 --> 01:37:53.527]  This isn't the usual, we're under an attack.
[01:37:53.527 --> 01:37:55.048]  Thank you for the support, share links.
[01:37:55.048 --> 01:37:55.889]  No, no, no.
[01:37:55.889 --> 01:37:57.389]  This is, we are done.
[01:37:57.389 --> 01:37:58.410]  We're off the internet.
[01:37:58.410 --> 01:37:59.651]  They're banning us.
[01:37:59.651 --> 01:38:01.231]  And not just us.
[01:38:01.231 --> 01:38:02.232]  If you're a Christian,
[01:38:03.203 --> 01:38:07.707]  Snopes and Facebook are now trying to ban Christians from Facebook.
[01:38:07.707 --> 01:38:16.475]  What they're doing now is if you write Christian content on Facebook, Snopes will say, well, we're fact-checking this and this actually isn't true.
[01:38:16.475 --> 01:38:21.179]  And then Facebook threatened to ban a Christian website called the Babylon Bee.
[01:38:21.179 --> 01:38:24.882]  They do satire and jokes because Snopes fact-checked
[01:38:25.622 --> 01:38:25.942]  I don't
[01:38:49.316 --> 01:38:49.757]  And by the way,
[01:39:07.469 --> 01:39:12.112]  The first Methodist Church all over the country is removing crosses because they're offensive.
[01:39:12.112 --> 01:39:16.134]  In Europe, they're removing crosses from Catholic churches, Presbyterian, Baptist.
[01:39:16.134 --> 01:39:18.876]  This is a total ecumenical UN global takeover.
[01:39:18.876 --> 01:39:20.057]  The Pope's a globalist.
[01:39:20.057 --> 01:39:21.077]  They're making their move.
[01:39:21.077 --> 01:39:22.238]  You're absolutely right.
[01:39:22.238 --> 01:39:28.982]  And I meant to mention that all over Christian YouTubes, Prager University's in a lawsuit because they're trying to ban them and have banned them.
[01:39:28.982 --> 01:39:33.705]  Very professional, very loving, very well done, very fatherly.
[01:39:34.696 --> 01:39:36.357]  That's being banned.
[01:39:36.357 --> 01:39:39.720]  And all over, Christians are being blocked from being able to share.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.024]  And notice Google Assistant says, Christ is a fictional character.
[01:39:45.024 --> 01:39:47.606]  So yes, this is an assault.
[01:39:47.606 --> 01:39:48.707]  This is crazy.
[01:39:48.707 --> 01:39:56.573]  You should think Google, Facebook, Twitter would want one of the biggest minorities in the country now, Christians, you know, of every group, to be on their platforms.
[01:39:56.573 --> 01:39:59.155]  But no, they want to socially control you.
[01:39:59.155 --> 01:39:59.896]  This is incredible.
[01:40:01.192 --> 01:40:10.336]  Yeah, they want to take away our guns, they want to take away our free speech, and they want to put Christians in death camps, and they can clip that snippet, but they'll never argue it.
[01:40:10.336 --> 01:40:13.698]  They'll never say, they'll go, oh, look, Sernich claims they want death camps.
[01:40:13.698 --> 01:40:20.541]  Why do they want to take away our guns, and why do they want to take away our free speech rights and our rights to peaceably assemble and censor us?
[01:40:20.541 --> 01:40:22.081]  What is the endgame of that?
[01:40:22.081 --> 01:40:27.303]  They want to bankrupt people, they want to ruin people's reputations, they want to destroy people.
[01:40:27.303 --> 01:40:30.525]  They went after Pamela Geller's daughters, four Jewish women,
[01:40:30.945 --> 01:40:36.128]  Merely because of who her mom is, these girls are now facing death threats from jihadis.
[01:40:36.128 --> 01:40:37.669]  This is not a joke, Alex.
[01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:38.829]  This is not a fun thing.
[01:40:38.829 --> 01:40:41.871]  No, I know the jihadis are the foot soldiers of the left now.
[01:40:41.871 --> 01:40:43.232]  We now know they are the muscle.
[01:40:44.912 --> 01:40:47.835]  Yeah, so people go, oh, Mike, you've been a little somber lately.
[01:40:47.835 --> 01:40:52.861]  You've been a little... Well, right, because I'm a realistic person and I know that they want us murdered.
[01:40:52.861 --> 01:40:54.242]  They want us killed now.
[01:40:54.242 --> 01:40:57.145]  And it isn't just you and me and people on the front lines now.
[01:40:57.145 --> 01:41:04.554]  If you're a listener and you're just a Christian who wants to tell some jokes and have fun with your friends and maybe go to church on Sundays and pray...
[01:41:05.214 --> 01:41:07.718]  You're now a target by Facebook.
[01:41:07.718 --> 01:41:09.360]  You're now a target by Snopes.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.044]  They will do everything they can to run you off the internet.
[01:41:12.044 --> 01:41:13.986]  They will do everything they can to disarm you.
[01:41:13.986 --> 01:41:15.749]  They're saying that we want to disarm you.
[01:41:15.749 --> 01:41:17.771]  We want to take away your free speech rights.
[01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:20.375]  They want to take away every means we have to fight back.
[01:41:21.169 --> 01:41:22.930]  That is how you have a Holocaust.
[01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:25.311]  That is how you have Pol Pot's death camps.
[01:41:25.311 --> 01:41:26.511]  That's how you have the Soviet Union.
[01:41:26.511 --> 01:41:39.416]  And Mike, Mike, as you know, Snopes, the Young Turks, Media Matters is all funded by George Soros who are all now saying he's a Holocaust survivor and that I'm defaming him and that he fought the Nazis when he was admittedly a Nazi collaborator in his own words.
[01:41:39.416 --> 01:41:40.236]  It's next level.
[01:41:40.236 --> 01:41:41.737]  Snopes runs it all.
[01:41:41.737 --> 01:41:47.479]  And everywhere, in front of our stuff, your stuff, they put Snopes, even in front of Fox News, and then Snopes just says,
[01:41:47.839 --> 01:41:49.120]  This is not true!
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:53.264]  Snopes basically says a Muslim didn't attack a few months ago with a truck in New York!
[01:41:53.264 --> 01:41:54.526]  I mean, they just do whatever they want!
[01:41:56.089 --> 01:42:11.633]  Yeah, well, and the latest, and that's why I think the attack on the Babylon Bee is really such an important thing because, as you know, YouTube has given me a community guideline strike because I uploaded a video of a protest by Antifa.
[01:42:11.633 --> 01:42:13.173]  Not anything that I said.
[01:42:13.173 --> 01:42:14.694]  Not anything that I'd done.
[01:42:14.694 --> 01:42:22.616]  All I did was journalistically uploaded a video of a protest of Antifa, and Facebook has issued me a community guideline strike and censored my channel.
[01:42:23.283 --> 01:42:28.522]  They're going after journalism because they don't want, this is what I have to tell the Christians, you have to listen.
[01:42:29.312 --> 01:42:36.539]  Antifa and Jihadis are the foot soldiers of the left, and that is why YouTube is banning anyone.
[01:42:36.539 --> 01:42:42.984]  If you report on Antifa, they don't want the Christians to know, because eventually Antifa, they're protesting me and Alex.
[01:42:42.984 --> 01:42:43.805]  They're coming for you.
[01:42:43.805 --> 01:42:45.266]  They're coming for your churches.
[01:42:45.266 --> 01:42:49.851]  They come with guns and won't let our reporters on the Capitol and the police say, sorry, it's Blue City.
[01:42:49.851 --> 01:42:52.693]  They're allowed to have guns and violate your free speech in Austin.
[01:42:52.693 --> 01:42:54.495]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:42:54.495 --> 01:42:55.576]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:44:01.748 --> 01:44:09.835]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:44:09.835 --> 01:44:15.119]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:17.661]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:44:17.661 --> 01:44:21.885]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:44:21.885 --> 01:44:24.327]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:44:24.987 --> 01:44:32.229]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.

[01:45:14.343 --> 01:45:19.306]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:45:19.306 --> 01:45:24.771]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[01:45:25.111 --> 01:45:32.898]  Zika 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[01:45:32.898 --> 01:45:37.622]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[01:45:37.622 --> 01:45:46.430]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[01:45:46.630 --> 01:45:50.199]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[01:45:50.199 --> 01:45:54.088]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:45:54.088 --> 01:45:55.712]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:45:58.021 --> 01:46:04.407]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:46:04.407 --> 01:46:07.611]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:11.314]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:46:11.314 --> 01:46:16.019]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:46:16.019 --> 01:46:19.302]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:46:20.163 --> 01:46:31.175]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:46:31.175 --> 01:46:39.704]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:46:41.326 --> 01:46:42.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:20.572 --> 01:47:25.017]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:25.017 --> 01:47:26.459]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:43.973 --> 01:47:44.633]  2018.
[01:47:44.633 --> 01:47:52.598]  And I was already launching this, had the idea last week because of all the censorship, them taking sponsors again, trying to shut us down.
[01:47:52.598 --> 01:47:58.722]  I was already going to have this broadcast in defense of free speech, in defense of the Second Amendment, in defense of internet freedom.
[01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:01.423]  That was the promo that we put out.
[01:48:01.423 --> 01:48:04.305]  And then we got banned on YouTube.
[01:48:04.305 --> 01:48:05.406]  Then they reinstated us.
[01:48:05.406 --> 01:48:07.407]  They were blocking us uploading.
[01:48:07.407 --> 01:48:08.928]  Then they banned our sub-channels.
[01:48:08.928 --> 01:48:10.629]  They banned Dr. Corsi's DC channel.
[01:48:11.826 --> 01:48:14.227]  Which was getting millions of views a week.
[01:48:14.227 --> 01:48:17.347]  They saw it really catching on as he covered QAnon in the storm.
[01:48:17.347 --> 01:48:19.888]  And now Mike Cernovich is a lawyer.
[01:48:19.888 --> 01:48:21.288]  He can speak to this.
[01:48:21.288 --> 01:48:24.029]  I've never seen him so concerned.
[01:48:24.029 --> 01:48:24.949]  Because he should be.
[01:48:24.949 --> 01:48:26.809]  We all should be.
[01:48:26.809 --> 01:48:29.750]  Let's say past censorship was a 2 or 3 on the Richter scale.
[01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:31.771]  This is like a 9, okay?
[01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:33.631]  It's exponential each level up.
[01:48:33.631 --> 01:48:37.792]  And the next level is being totally silenced and arrested like in Europe.
[01:48:39.116 --> 01:48:46.480]  So, this is true detronianism, this is true, and I keep saying censorship, censorship, censorship, people are dull to that term.
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.442]  Mike's smart, because he's targeting what it is.
[01:48:49.442 --> 01:48:51.543]  It's a war on real journalism!
[01:48:51.543 --> 01:49:00.228]  Mike has real sources, I have real sources, you get tomorrow's news today, you get next week's news today, next year's news today, because we really don't just make stuff up like CNN.
[01:49:01.584 --> 01:49:03.604]  We told you this stuff was all fake.
[01:49:03.604 --> 01:49:04.725]  That's how they had to reverse it.
[01:49:04.725 --> 01:49:09.265]  We told you we had lawyers that were already letting YouTube know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:49:09.265 --> 01:49:12.946]  I'm not going to get into a lot of behind-the-scenes agreements and things, but we're on the move here.
[01:49:12.946 --> 01:49:15.307]  We're fighting, and I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:49:15.307 --> 01:49:16.727]  This is the second American Revolution.
[01:49:16.727 --> 01:49:18.747]  I don't have to get my arms and legs blown off.
[01:49:18.747 --> 01:49:26.869]  I don't have to march, you know, from Ticonderoga a hundred-something miles dragging giant, you know, guns till our shoes fall off and there's a trail of blood.
[01:49:27.932 --> 01:49:32.014]  And people's, you know, hundreds of people had to have their toes amputated.
[01:49:32.014 --> 01:49:33.095]  That's will.
[01:49:33.095 --> 01:49:33.775]  We don't have to do that.
[01:49:33.775 --> 01:49:37.597]  We just gotta take their lies, turn around and counterpunch every day.
[01:49:37.597 --> 01:49:38.317]  Like a video game.
[01:49:38.317 --> 01:49:39.438]  Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:49:40.438 --> 01:49:41.439]  But never give up.
[01:49:41.439 --> 01:49:42.940]  We need to protest these people.
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.521]  We need to take action and also know we're fighting hard for you.
[01:49:45.521 --> 01:49:51.105]  You cannot make a better investment than going to InfoWareStore.com and getting books, videos, high-quality supplements.
[01:49:51.105 --> 01:49:52.526]  We got free shipping storewide right now.
[01:49:52.526 --> 01:50:00.111]  And at discounts like these, we sell a lot of product, but it takes a lot of product to be sold at these prices because we don't make a lot.
[01:50:00.111 --> 01:50:04.854]  We don't have seven times markup like other supplement companies where they put almost nothing in it and then seven times mark it up.
[01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:09.004]  We were putting almost $50 a bottle in DNA Force.
[01:50:09.004 --> 01:50:14.670]  We've reformulated it even stronger, got a bigger contract in, so we lowered the price for us to make it to $30, $32.
[01:50:14.670 --> 01:50:17.032]  Now we can lower the price.
[01:50:17.032 --> 01:50:18.193]  That's how that works.
[01:50:18.193 --> 01:50:20.476]  Nobody's putting $30 in a bottle, okay?
[01:50:20.476 --> 01:50:21.477]  I mean, these are like...
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:23.741]  Hardcore.
[01:50:23.741 --> 01:50:25.062]  And we've got some stuff that's like $9.95.
[01:50:25.062 --> 01:50:31.767]  You know, we got colloidal silver, we got true whey, biome defense, free shipping store-wide, super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:50:31.767 --> 01:50:32.628]  It's all there.
[01:50:32.628 --> 01:50:37.252]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:37.252 --> 01:50:39.694]  Our newest product is best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:50:40.962 --> 01:50:42.043]  It has.
[01:50:42.043 --> 01:50:44.744]  From the very best, from cranberries, you name it.
[01:50:44.744 --> 01:50:45.684]  It's concentrated.
[01:50:45.684 --> 01:50:46.504]  It's really good.
[01:50:46.504 --> 01:50:47.245]  It's really healthy.
[01:50:47.245 --> 01:50:49.446]  A lot of forms of fiber out there aren't too good.
[01:50:49.446 --> 01:50:53.928]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.928 --> 01:50:55.248]  You stand against Soros.
[01:50:55.248 --> 01:50:56.749]  You stand against the globalists.
[01:50:56.749 --> 01:51:01.931]  You stand against everything they're doing when you support people in the economy that support your freedoms.
[01:51:01.931 --> 01:51:10.155]  When you don't give all your money to the biggest supplement maker and seller in the world, Jeff Bezos, who has his publications saying, shut me down, any supplements or snake oil.
[01:51:10.535 --> 01:51:11.916]  So this is sick.
[01:51:11.916 --> 01:51:19.601]  By the way, Cernovich has developed, I've taken it before, an amazing new kind of sports enhancer, nootropic gorilla mind.
[01:51:19.601 --> 01:51:21.082]  So also buy that from him.
[01:51:21.082 --> 01:51:26.185]  That's what this is all about, is building these economies is how we're going to turn things around.
[01:51:26.185 --> 01:51:28.846]  But Mike, let's get into your idea.
[01:51:28.846 --> 01:51:29.267]  Absolutely.
[01:51:29.267 --> 01:51:30.367]  We've got to protest Google.
[01:51:30.367 --> 01:51:32.228]  We've got to protest South by Southwest.
[01:51:32.228 --> 01:51:32.849]  You're going to come.
[01:51:32.849 --> 01:51:34.010]  I want to have you in the studio.
[01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.890]  We've got some ideas.
[01:51:34.890 --> 01:51:35.931]  I was already planning to do it.
[01:51:36.591 --> 01:51:38.673]  But I'm going to do it a few unannounced times and things.
[01:51:38.673 --> 01:51:39.394]  I'm just leaving it at that.
[01:51:39.394 --> 01:51:42.617]  As you know, the inside documents say I'm banned from their campus.
[01:51:42.617 --> 01:51:45.801]  What do we need to do to take this to the next level to fight back?
[01:51:47.802 --> 01:51:49.183]  Yeah, we need all of our people.
[01:51:49.183 --> 01:51:50.484]  And this is not optional.
[01:51:50.484 --> 01:51:52.606]  This is a red alert.
[01:51:52.606 --> 01:51:57.010]  Because again, it's just not about Alex or me or anybody else.
[01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:59.432]  It is about the war on Christians.
[01:51:59.432 --> 01:52:08.599]  Again, when Facebook is threatening Christian comedy websites with censure and banning, that tells you all you need to know about what is going on.
[01:52:08.599 --> 01:52:14.284]  All of these anti-Christian, anti-freedom tech companies are going to be in South by Southwest.
[01:52:14.284 --> 01:52:15.545]  So legally and lawfully,
[01:52:16.241 --> 01:52:21.309]  We need to show up and just peacefully assemble and ask them, why do you hate Christians?
[01:52:21.309 --> 01:52:23.072]  Why do you censor websites?
[01:52:23.072 --> 01:52:26.197]  Why do you not allow honest reporting on Antifa?
[01:52:26.197 --> 01:52:27.839]  Do you endorse political violence?
[01:52:27.839 --> 01:52:30.263]  Do you endorse what is happening on the streets?
[01:52:30.263 --> 01:52:31.084]  And we need to again,
[01:52:31.685 --> 01:52:35.688]  Peacefully and lawfully, just ask these tech companies at South by Southwest.
[01:52:35.688 --> 01:52:37.109]  Why do you hate Christians?
[01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:38.790]  Why do you want to censor people?
[01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:43.074]  Why do you support Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, which hates Jews?
[01:52:43.074 --> 01:52:47.137]  Because everybody tries to always say, oh, you know, Cernovich and Jones.
[01:52:47.137 --> 01:52:48.638]  We love the Jewish people.
[01:52:48.638 --> 01:52:49.758]  We love Israel.
[01:52:49.758 --> 01:52:50.979]  We have no problems at all.
[01:52:50.979 --> 01:52:53.001]  This is nonsense and a lie.
[01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:57.044]  But Louis Farrakhan and Keith Ellison, they actually orientalize Semites.
[01:52:57.504 --> 01:53:02.967]  Louis Farrakhan gave a speech where he said, Keith Ellison was a member of us in the Nation of Islam.
[01:53:02.967 --> 01:53:04.108]  This is his speech.
[01:53:04.108 --> 01:53:06.509]  This isn't Alex and me conspiracy theory.
[01:53:06.509 --> 01:53:08.650]  This is actually real life.
[01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:14.493]  And Farrakhan had said, if you want the door open, you got to wait for a Jew to open it for you.
[01:53:14.493 --> 01:53:17.414]  This is Louis Farrakhan, not me, not Alex.
[01:53:17.414 --> 01:53:22.437]  Keith Ellison, nevertheless, holds up the Antifa handbook, supports domestic terrorism.
[01:53:22.437 --> 01:53:23.978]  He supports anti-Semitism.
[01:53:24.398 --> 01:53:30.460]  So the people who hate the Jewish people are not us, they're not real Americans because we tolerate everybody.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:41.943]  I was about to say, have you seen the Young Turks saying that I'm anti-Semitic for saying George Soros was a Nazi collaborator and that because I said Brian Stelter has a crazy looking smile, I'm anti-Semitic and I said he was a Jew?
[01:53:41.943 --> 01:53:43.424]  I never said any of that.
[01:53:43.424 --> 01:53:46.385]  The level of crazy lying is just insane.
[01:53:46.385 --> 01:53:47.965]  How much can they turn it up from here?
[01:53:47.965 --> 01:53:48.765]  I think you're right.
[01:53:48.765 --> 01:53:50.186]  I think it's just, they want to kill us.
[01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:57.613]  Yeah, well that's the issue is they want to lie about us without us being able to tell the truth.
[01:53:57.613 --> 01:53:59.853]  And the Young Turks, their engagement is terrible.
[01:53:59.853 --> 01:54:01.814]  They don't get views like they used to.
[01:54:01.814 --> 01:54:03.435]  And by the way, we should ask Google.
[01:54:04.486 --> 01:54:06.348]  Why do you promote Sink?
[01:54:06.348 --> 01:54:11.012]  Have you read what Sink and his partner wrote about 14-year-old girls?
[01:54:11.012 --> 01:54:16.518]  They said women are subhuman and genetically mutants and because they don't all want to have sex with him.
[01:54:16.518 --> 01:54:19.861]  And then he talked about young 15-year-old girls in the house.
[01:54:19.861 --> 01:54:21.302]  I'm not going to say what he said.
[01:54:21.302 --> 01:54:26.267]  Well, what do you expect from, you know, this Islamist didn't fall too far from the tree.
[01:54:27.301 --> 01:54:37.570]  Yeah, so we should ask you two, why is it that you promote most heavily somebody who referred to 15-year-old girls as, again, I can't say it but... Don't say it or they'll say we're bullying.
[01:54:39.361 --> 01:54:41.802]  Yeah, that's what they said, though.
[01:54:41.802 --> 01:54:43.803]  No, no, we quote them and then we get banned.
[01:54:43.803 --> 01:54:45.004]  I mean, this is the level we're at.
[01:54:45.004 --> 01:54:46.505]  And Mike, you're a lawyer, though.
[01:54:46.505 --> 01:54:47.065]  Don't you agree?
[01:54:47.065 --> 01:54:49.487]  I've talked to top lawyers and they say, no, you've got the suit now.
[01:54:49.487 --> 01:54:51.268]  That's why YouTube's backed off.
[01:54:51.268 --> 01:54:52.308]  Because they know we're not playing games.
[01:54:52.308 --> 01:54:58.111]  We have them all the whole chain saying they're censoring, saying it's for political, laughing about it.
[01:54:58.111 --> 01:55:00.152]  And now they're backing off, at least on me.
[01:55:00.152 --> 01:55:01.413]  They should back off on you and others.
[01:55:01.413 --> 01:55:02.754]  But that's because we fought back.
[01:55:02.754 --> 01:55:04.515]  As a lawyer, is this not tortious interference?
[01:55:05.868 --> 01:55:07.450]  Well, it's antitrust.
[01:55:07.450 --> 01:55:08.451]  There's a number of things.
[01:55:08.451 --> 01:55:12.436]  If you want... Facebook and Google control 88% of the advertising market.
[01:55:12.436 --> 01:55:14.558]  That's their big weakness is the antitrust, exactly.
[01:55:14.558 --> 01:55:18.723]  But what I mean is CNN admitting that they're involved with YouTube trying to shut me down.
[01:55:18.723 --> 01:55:21.866]  Another company involved with a third party trying to shut someone down.
[01:55:21.866 --> 01:55:22.968]  Is that not tortious interference?
[01:55:23.902 --> 01:55:24.823]  That's how it always is.
[01:55:43.161 --> 01:55:48.847]  Then they want to take all the Christians and round up all the Christians just like Facebook is now having snow.
[01:55:48.847 --> 01:55:52.731]  Facebook is now putting Christians in ghettos just like Matt Drudge predicted.
[01:55:52.731 --> 01:55:54.754]  I can't believe, how did Drudge predict all this?
[01:55:55.987 --> 01:55:57.068]  Well, he knew.
[01:55:57.068 --> 01:55:58.149]  I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:59.551]  I did not like politics.
[01:55:59.551 --> 01:56:04.315]  All I ever cared about was going to the gym, lifting weights, and doing my Gorilla Mindset stuff.
[01:56:04.315 --> 01:56:10.762]  And then I read a book on the Cambodian genocide, which the media never talks about because it was left-wing.
[01:56:10.762 --> 01:56:12.764]  Zabiga Brzezinski supported it.
[01:56:13.755 --> 01:56:17.078]  Yes, I saw the parallels between the killing fields.
[01:56:17.078 --> 01:56:19.160]  What was happening in Cambodia?
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.282]  That is the path that we're on today.
[01:56:21.282 --> 01:56:23.604]  And when I read that book, I actually cried.
[01:56:23.604 --> 01:56:28.829]  I remember I was traveling through Cambodia and learning about the people and the culture.
[01:56:28.829 --> 01:56:32.152]  I read the book Survival in the Killing Fields and I was crying and I realized
[01:56:32.692 --> 01:56:40.955]  I have to get involved because if I don't, if you were in Cambodia, you just thought, well, you know, I'm just a middle class person or I'm just a regular person.
[01:56:40.955 --> 01:56:41.996]  I'm going to sit this one out.
[01:56:41.996 --> 01:56:46.037]  If you knew how to write, if you had glasses, you were dead.
[01:56:46.037 --> 01:56:46.557]  Yeah.
[01:56:46.557 --> 01:56:52.460]  So now if you're, if you are a Christian, they're going to put you in, the killing fields are coming.
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:58.562]  That's all I can say is that anybody who's studied history knows that the only reason you want to censor and disarm people
[01:56:59.298 --> 01:57:04.100]  It's so that they are powerless and helpless and you can take them away into the night and put them in the gulags.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:05.420]  Yes, it's a formula.
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:07.381]  Every time they're following an exact plan.
[01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:09.222]  Europe's about two years ahead of us.
[01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:10.042]  Mike, you're right.
[01:57:10.042 --> 01:57:11.283]  You're not just saying this.
[01:57:11.283 --> 01:57:12.843]  They're following an exact plan.
[01:57:12.843 --> 01:57:15.084]  So I want to come back and talk about the Google protest.
[01:57:15.084 --> 01:57:16.044]  People need to be ready for this.
[01:57:16.044 --> 01:57:17.325]  We're not announcing it yet.
[01:57:17.325 --> 01:57:20.186]  And then other solutions with Mike Cernovich from Guerrilla Mindset.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:25.001]  Absolutely essential, people, that you realize this is happening.
[01:57:25.001 --> 01:57:32.183]  And that's the reason we've got patriots in government that are more and more working with us because they understand that, wow, you conspiracy theorists were right.
[01:57:32.183 --> 01:57:33.584]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[01:57:33.584 --> 01:57:34.384]  You bet.
[01:57:34.384 --> 01:57:36.585]  So let's all get together and let's stop this.
[01:57:36.585 --> 01:57:37.365]  Let's come together.
[01:57:37.365 --> 01:57:38.646]  We can do it.
[01:57:38.646 --> 01:57:39.346]  I can feel it.
[01:57:39.346 --> 01:57:40.366]  I can feel it right now.
[01:57:40.366 --> 01:57:43.267]  I know the spirit of liberty is rising.
[01:57:43.267 --> 01:57:44.868]  That's why the enemy is panicking.
[01:57:44.868 --> 01:57:45.908]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:47.369 --> 01:58:07.344]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:07.344 --> 01:58:09.466]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:58:09.466 --> 01:58:13.489]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:13.489 --> 01:58:14.490]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:20.714]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:58:20.714 --> 01:58:23.096]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:58:23.096 --> 01:58:28.539]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:58:28.539 --> 01:58:31.021]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:40.227]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:58:40.227 --> 01:58:44.670]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:58:48.274 --> 01:58:50.177]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:58:50.177 --> 01:58:51.418]  Go ahead.
[01:58:51.418 --> 01:58:53.360]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:59:02.692]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:59:03.545 --> 01:59:10.327]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:59:10.327 --> 01:59:12.568]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:59:12.568 --> 01:59:13.628]  Thank you.
[01:59:13.628 --> 01:59:16.129]  I use the BioTruth Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:59:16.129 --> 01:59:20.431]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:59:20.431 --> 01:59:23.452]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:59:23.452 --> 01:59:24.772]  They are quality.
[01:59:24.772 --> 01:59:26.513]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:59:26.513 --> 01:59:29.394]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:59:29.394 --> 01:59:29.914]  Absolutely.
[01:59:30.154 --> 01:59:51.929]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:59:51.929 --> 01:59:54.631]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.093 --> 02:00:24.755]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:24.755 --> 02:00:30.877]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.877 --> 02:00:34.858]  They say that those that don't know history are dim to repeat it.
[02:00:34.858 --> 02:00:36.799]  I am a novice historian.
[02:00:36.799 --> 02:00:38.079]  I've read 800 books.
[02:00:40.655 --> 02:00:44.940]  On history, I probably listened to another 100 or 200 or more, actually.
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:48.023]  I think about on the treadmill or... I need to start doing that again.
[02:00:48.023 --> 02:00:55.691]  That's what I used to do, is get on the treadmill or whatever and listen to historical, you know, uh... screeds while I was exercising.
[02:00:55.691 --> 02:01:02.698]  I'll admit, the last 7, 8, 9 years I've been so busy, I... I don't read history anymore, but I have that body of knowledge.
[02:01:02.698 --> 02:01:02.818]  And...
[02:01:03.871 --> 02:01:19.538]  There's no doubt that we've got an authoritarian system, and now that they're getting it in place, they're hyping up the left as the chosen instrument worldwide to bully and attack and kill everybody else.
[02:01:19.538 --> 02:01:20.459]  Mike Cernovich is back.
[02:01:22.125 --> 02:01:26.727]  I guess he thought that was a longer break, because I know the end of the hour is only two minutes, not four like the others, but Mike is back.
[02:01:26.727 --> 02:01:29.729]  And I just wanted to, he's got the idea, and I agree, we need to get on the street.
[02:01:29.729 --> 02:01:42.375]  And that just means you with a sandwich board out there, or a bumper sticker, or whatever it is, but we need to have some big demonstrations, kind of like flash mobs, I don't want to use that term, flash liberty, peacefully, and just say, you know, everybody be waiting.
[02:01:43.379 --> 02:01:45.763]  Maybe have an email list or something like that.
[02:01:45.763 --> 02:01:46.504]  You know, that's what we'll do.
[02:01:46.504 --> 02:01:48.947]  Go sign up at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:48.947 --> 02:01:49.989]  InfoWars.com.
[02:01:49.989 --> 02:01:52.252]  A forward slash newsletter.
[02:01:52.252 --> 02:01:55.477]  And we should create a new email for people that want that.
[02:01:56.263 --> 02:01:58.344]  See, we had an app that had some issues.
[02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:01.026]  We're launching a new one that's even better that's going to have live alerts.
[02:02:01.026 --> 02:02:01.806]  That's really the answer.
[02:02:01.806 --> 02:02:03.927]  Everybody needs to get the apps.
[02:02:03.927 --> 02:02:04.928]  And Mike, we need to meet.
[02:02:04.928 --> 02:02:07.750]  I don't even want to meet and talk, and then we've both been busy.
[02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:09.691]  But let's just talk about the war games.
[02:02:09.691 --> 02:02:11.252]  People kind of get the idea of what's coming.
[02:02:11.252 --> 02:02:14.493]  Because we have to really, really protest Facebook, Twitter, Google.
[02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:15.454]  We've got to let them know.
[02:02:15.454 --> 02:02:18.776]  And we've got to piss in their Cheerios coming up at South by Southwest.
[02:02:19.878 --> 02:02:21.540]  Yeah, this is our last stand.
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:24.222]  If we don't succeed, it's just over.
[02:02:24.222 --> 02:02:25.283]  That's what I tell people.
[02:02:25.283 --> 02:02:26.784]  If you like me, thanks.
[02:02:26.784 --> 02:02:28.265]  Been good to know you.
[02:02:28.265 --> 02:02:29.086]  It's over.
[02:02:29.086 --> 02:02:29.587]  It's done.
[02:02:29.587 --> 02:02:31.408]  Free speech is over in America.
[02:02:31.408 --> 02:02:35.172]  If you're a Christian and you think you can just go to church and they're going to leave you alone, you're wrong.
[02:02:35.172 --> 02:02:36.233]  They're coming for you.
[02:02:36.233 --> 02:02:40.897]  They're coming for you harder than me because the Christians are the biggest
[02:02:41.237 --> 02:02:43.759]  You and I don't ever try to censor people.
[02:03:01.542 --> 02:03:04.084]  We don't try to say, why won't you do it?
[02:03:04.084 --> 02:03:05.105]  I can't even do it.
[02:03:05.105 --> 02:03:09.028]  I can't even file a complaint on CNN and play their own game for bullying.
[02:03:09.028 --> 02:03:10.450]  I just can't do it.
[02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:12.992]  It's like, it's too cowardly.
[02:03:12.992 --> 02:03:15.374]  Well, look what CNN did to that grandma.
[02:03:15.374 --> 02:03:23.360]  Could you imagine if you or I went to an elderly Hillary Clinton's house and said, did you know that you were involved in Russian activity?
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.142]  People would crucify us.
[02:03:25.142 --> 02:03:25.902]  It would be over.
[02:03:25.902 --> 02:03:27.544]  They would say, look at these monsters.
[02:03:28.214 --> 02:03:32.439]  But meanwhile, CNN, and here's why I don't like these people, they're gutless.
[02:03:32.439 --> 02:03:34.401]  Why don't you go to Clapper's house?
[02:03:34.401 --> 02:03:38.545]  Why don't you go to Deep State's house and address them and confront them?
[02:03:38.545 --> 02:03:41.909]  Why don't you go to Michael Moore, CNN, if you're so tough?
[02:03:41.909 --> 02:03:45.233]  Michael Moore attended an anti-Trump protest in New York.
[02:03:45.233 --> 02:03:46.394]  They just want to bully grandma.
[02:03:46.394 --> 02:03:47.235]  That was funded by Russia.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.222]  Yeah, they just want to bully Nana.
[02:03:50.222 --> 02:03:51.464]  That's all they want to do.
[02:03:51.464 --> 02:03:53.105]  They're not, they have no integrity.
[02:03:53.105 --> 02:03:54.307]  That's why they want to go after you.
[02:03:54.307 --> 02:03:55.968]  But what they did is bully.
[02:03:55.968 --> 02:03:57.510]  They should be banned.
[02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:00.213]  If the rules were applied equally, they would, their channel would be banned.
[02:04:00.213 --> 02:04:01.254]  Yeah, this is real bullying.
[02:04:01.254 --> 02:04:02.075]  This is real bullying.
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:04.061]  Yeah, we don't do that.
[02:04:04.061 --> 02:04:04.981]  Go up to Nana.
[02:04:04.981 --> 02:04:07.642]  Hey, Nana, did you know you voted for Hillary Clinton?
[02:04:07.642 --> 02:04:11.044]  Hey, Nana, did you know that you spread a meme from Russia?
[02:04:11.044 --> 02:04:11.925]  Terrific!
[02:04:11.925 --> 02:04:16.187]  I don't know how even Glenn Greenwald and liberal people were like, I'm appalled.
[02:04:16.187 --> 02:04:18.348]  This is nauseating what they're doing.
[02:04:18.348 --> 02:04:19.269]  Oh, tough guy.
[02:04:19.269 --> 02:04:20.049]  Big tough, Drew.
[02:04:20.049 --> 02:04:20.929]  You're so tough.
[02:04:20.929 --> 02:04:22.210]  Why don't you come confront me?
[02:04:22.210 --> 02:04:23.451]  Why don't you confront Alex?
[02:04:23.451 --> 02:04:24.952]  Why don't you confront Clapper?
[02:04:24.952 --> 02:04:27.493]  Why don't you confront somebody other than somebody's grandma?
[02:04:28.129 --> 02:04:29.130]  They won't do it.
[02:04:29.130 --> 02:04:33.433]  So that is why, South by Southwest, I will be in Austin, Texas, Alex.
[02:04:33.433 --> 02:04:34.313]  We have to meet.
[02:04:34.313 --> 02:04:35.374]  Let's do a few more minutes.
[02:04:35.374 --> 02:04:36.755]  Let's do a few more minutes, and we got our next guest.
[02:04:36.755 --> 02:04:37.836]  I want to talk about that.
[02:04:37.836 --> 02:04:39.417]  And people, this is it.
[02:04:39.417 --> 02:04:39.797]  It's right.
[02:04:39.797 --> 02:04:43.299]  That's why they're so scared of demonstrations, because they know that's where they can't shut us down.
[02:04:43.299 --> 02:04:46.081]  And they don't want this to start a chain reaction to show their censorship.
[02:04:46.081 --> 02:04:49.864]  That's why they backed off on us for now, because they realize we got the momentum.
[02:04:49.864 --> 02:04:51.324]  We have the initiative.
[02:04:51.324 --> 02:04:52.906]  Now is the time to strike.
[02:04:52.906 --> 02:04:53.306]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.627 --> 02:05:00.030]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWarsLife.
[02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:03.993]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:03.993 --> 02:05:07.355]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:07.355 --> 02:05:09.877]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:05:09.877 --> 02:05:14.621]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:05:14.621 --> 02:05:16.963]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:16.963 --> 02:05:23.348]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:23.968 --> 02:05:32.157]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:37.222]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:37.222 --> 02:05:44.209]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:05:44.850 --> 02:05:49.773]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[02:05:49.773 --> 02:05:52.615]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:52.615 --> 02:05:54.536]  You got a business.
[02:05:54.536 --> 02:05:55.656]  You didn't build that.
[02:05:55.656 --> 02:06:00.199]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:06:17.535 --> 02:06:22.417]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:22.417 --> 02:06:29.439]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:29.439 --> 02:06:32.800]  Ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.762]  A few more minutes with Mike Cernovich of Gorilla Mindset, Gorilla Media.
[02:06:37.853 --> 02:06:40.295]  He's on fire today and he's so right.
[02:06:40.295 --> 02:06:51.503]  We get conditioned with the censorship and now the attack on journalism and this concerted Twitter, Facebook, YouTube ban that is, I don't know, I want to say it's about 50 times bigger than anything else we've ever seen.
[02:06:51.503 --> 02:06:55.146]  They've been trying bans and trying spin and trying all this.
[02:06:55.146 --> 02:06:57.467]  This is exponentially bigger than anything I've ever seen.
[02:06:57.467 --> 02:06:59.048]  I want to see if Mike agrees with that.
[02:07:00.189 --> 02:07:01.630]  They are banning Christians.
[02:07:01.630 --> 02:07:02.730]  They are banning Libertarians.
[02:07:02.730 --> 02:07:04.591]  They're persecuting them everywhere.
[02:07:04.591 --> 02:07:08.332]  Facebook's kicking thousands of pro-gun and Christian channels off.
[02:07:08.332 --> 02:07:11.614]  PragerU is in a giant lawsuit.
[02:07:11.614 --> 02:07:14.635]  It's very milquetoast, very professional.
[02:07:14.635 --> 02:07:18.937]  And then they block it all and Snopes comes in and says, you know, we question this.
[02:07:20.285 --> 02:07:22.267]  This is such discrimination.
[02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:37.124]  I mean, imagine if people were putting, like, on a gay YouTube website, you know, about, say, you know, gay lifestyles or something, and there were, like, conservative Christian markers saying, we dispute this, we're the fact-checkers, you're all going to hell.
[02:07:37.124 --> 02:07:38.665]  The left has their religion.
[02:07:39.346 --> 02:07:52.638]  And it's controlling everybody's life, and now they're doing it, they're saying, hashtag, cunt Republicans, you know, billboards, kill the NRA, kill people, burn Dana Loews, kill her, she's a murderer, witch, witch, witch, she's a witch, how do we know she's a witch?
[02:07:52.638 --> 02:07:56.381]  Well, if she sinks and drowns, she's not a witch, but if she floats, she is a witch.
[02:07:56.381 --> 02:08:02.327]  I mean, it's so medieval to see people degenerate back into, like, varlets.
[02:08:02.847 --> 02:08:04.509]  Well, they're just like, we'll kill them all!
[02:08:04.509 --> 02:08:05.149]  Yeah!
[02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:07.011]  We want communism, it's so good!
[02:08:07.011 --> 02:08:09.453]  All my smartphone and my everything be here!
[02:08:09.453 --> 02:08:13.277]  And you're like, well, go to Venezuela, where they're eating out of trash cans for five years.
[02:08:13.277 --> 02:08:13.678]  Shut up!
[02:08:13.678 --> 02:08:15.639]  And like, they have thousands a week dying of starvation.
[02:08:15.639 --> 02:08:16.460]  Shut up!
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:17.421]  You don't know!
[02:08:17.421 --> 02:08:18.302]  It's a wonderful thing!
[02:08:18.302 --> 02:08:19.523]  I don't even know what I'm doing!
[02:08:19.523 --> 02:08:19.884]  Witch!
[02:08:19.884 --> 02:08:20.284]  Witch!
[02:08:20.284 --> 02:08:23.647]  In fact, let's play a second of this, then go back to Mike Cernovich about how we need to take action.
[02:08:23.647 --> 02:08:24.648]  Here it is.
[02:08:24.648 --> 02:08:25.829]  Let's play a clip of Witch, Witch.
[02:08:25.829 --> 02:08:26.270]  Do we have it ready?
[02:08:28.504 --> 02:08:30.186]  Okay, well, cue it up later and we'll get it.
[02:08:30.186 --> 02:08:33.048]  I want to hook all those computers up to sound, if we can do that, that'd be great.
[02:08:33.048 --> 02:08:34.590]  Anyways, which which.
[02:08:34.590 --> 02:08:35.030]  Seriously.
[02:08:35.953 --> 02:08:37.073]  They've gone crazy.
[02:08:37.073 --> 02:08:44.997]  I know there's elites behind them and money, but it's like an 89-year-old crazy Nazi collaborator where they think they can go on CNN, ABC News.
[02:08:44.997 --> 02:08:46.937]  They've obviously put a PR funding out.
[02:08:46.937 --> 02:08:52.239]  He funds Cink Uyghur, who's got the name of a Christian genocide organization.
[02:08:52.239 --> 02:08:55.821]  Just what you're pointing out, the Young Turks killed a million and a half Christians.
[02:08:55.821 --> 02:09:00.503]  That's the biggest genocide outside Russia and Poland and we've ever seen in Ukraine.
[02:09:00.503 --> 02:09:03.544]  So that's the fourth biggest Christian genocide in modern history.
[02:09:04.448 --> 02:09:05.949]  Fourth biggest, I guess, in history.
[02:09:05.949 --> 02:09:08.871]  You know, a million and five, that's not chopped liver.
[02:09:08.871 --> 02:09:10.732]  Dead people, children, you name it.
[02:09:10.732 --> 02:09:12.513]  Pregnant women, run through.
[02:09:12.513 --> 02:09:19.057]  And then he's saying, I don't know if you saw the clip, that I'm the worst person in the world, that George Soros is a Holocaust survivor.
[02:09:19.057 --> 02:09:25.200]  Again, Mike, the magnitude of them defending this, they think they'll get away with it.
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:27.342]  What type of slimy creature is this?
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:34.883]  Well, they know that if they get rid of us, they can engage in a genocide here in America.
[02:09:34.883 --> 02:09:39.585]  The young Turks are biting at the bit to destroy Christians here.
[02:09:39.585 --> 02:09:40.826]  So that's the whole game.
[02:09:40.826 --> 02:09:42.907]  And by the way, they're going after Jews, too.
[02:09:42.907 --> 02:09:48.489]  There's a lot of drama on Twitter right now from people who have called us falsely anti-Semites.
[02:09:48.489 --> 02:09:52.091]  Just for the record, I disavow any bigotry, hatred.
[02:09:52.091 --> 02:09:53.412]  They all know that, though!
[02:09:54.266 --> 02:09:55.167]  Right.
[02:09:55.167 --> 02:10:01.975]  They all know, and they're all liars, and they are coming for the Jewish people, and they're finally realizing that now.
[02:10:01.975 --> 02:10:08.243]  I see on Twitter people from Taliban... I am seeing a lot of even liberal Jews are waking up going, you're right, I see it, I apologize.
[02:10:08.243 --> 02:10:08.884]  I'm getting a lot of that.
[02:10:09.881 --> 02:10:18.147]  Yeah, so they're actually freaking out a little bit because they realize people like me and you, I don't sit around all day thinking about Jewish issues.
[02:10:18.147 --> 02:10:23.111]  I don't really, it's not... I don't even ever ask myself what somebody is if they're interesting and cool.
[02:10:23.111 --> 02:10:24.892]  I don't even like... I'm sick.
[02:10:24.892 --> 02:10:26.974]  I'm not obsessed with race or religion.
[02:10:26.974 --> 02:10:28.174]  Well that's what's funny.
[02:10:28.174 --> 02:10:33.418]  They'll call me an anti-Semite for making fun of somebody and I go, what are you talking... I didn't even know the guy was Jewish.
[02:10:33.418 --> 02:10:35.039]  I just knew the guy was an idiot, you know.
[02:10:35.039 --> 02:10:36.941]  I'm not talking about this at all.
[02:10:37.321 --> 02:10:39.163]  Well, I make fun of Sink for how he looks.
[02:10:39.163 --> 02:10:41.165]  I'm not bashing Turks in general.
[02:10:41.165 --> 02:10:42.486]  And it's the same thing with Stelter.
[02:10:42.486 --> 02:10:44.068]  He said, I said Stelter's a Jew.
[02:10:44.068 --> 02:10:45.209]  I've already said this.
[02:10:45.209 --> 02:10:45.969]  And I didn't.
[02:10:45.969 --> 02:10:49.113]  And then he just lies and says I attacked him because he's Jewish.
[02:10:49.113 --> 02:10:50.614]  And then he says, but he's not Jewish.
[02:10:50.614 --> 02:10:54.438]  He just makes up all these things I'm wrong about that aren't demonstrably false.
[02:10:54.438 --> 02:10:56.019]  Show the video, Sink!
[02:10:56.019 --> 02:10:56.440]  He doesn't.
[02:10:57.418 --> 02:11:13.865]  But, and what they're doing, so the funny thing is, they want to get people like us out of the way, because they know that we would stand with any oppressed Jewish minority, and they know if they get us out of the way, then they can go, and the Jews are going to be in the concentration camps with the Christians too, if the left has a way.
[02:11:13.865 --> 02:11:16.265]  Just go read what Louis Farrakhan has to say!
[02:11:16.265 --> 02:11:17.646]  They're in public!
[02:11:17.646 --> 02:11:18.066]  They're in public!
[02:11:18.066 --> 02:11:22.348]  Well, I mean, expanding off of that, mainline leftists teach that
[02:11:23.621 --> 02:11:30.348]  Teach that Jews are bad, and that George Soros says that Israel needs to be given over to the Muslims.
[02:11:30.348 --> 02:11:35.733]  So that's a fact, and then the Jewish movements in America are led by George Soros, a Nazi collaborator.
[02:11:35.733 --> 02:11:37.735]  What fruitcake planet did we wake up on?
[02:11:39.045 --> 02:11:40.827]  Well, that was the problem.
[02:11:40.827 --> 02:11:46.753]  A lot of people were brainwashed into thinking that we're throwing dog whistles or whatever, which we're not.
[02:11:46.753 --> 02:11:53.299]  But meanwhile, Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam overtly say that Jews are satanic.
[02:11:53.299 --> 02:11:54.300]  This is what they say.
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.441]  Not me.
[02:11:55.441 --> 02:11:56.002]  Not me.
[02:11:56.002 --> 02:11:56.542]  Not you.
[02:11:56.542 --> 02:11:58.464]  We would never say that because we don't believe it.
[02:11:58.464 --> 02:11:59.565]  So that's what's going on.
[02:11:59.565 --> 02:12:00.246]  But that's why.
[02:12:01.309 --> 02:12:08.657]  We have, maybe we need to set up a separate website or something, but those of you, especially if you're in Austin, Texas, I'm going to be in town.
[02:12:08.657 --> 02:12:17.026]  I don't want to travel, but I realize, I'm so burned out by traveling Alex, but I realize this is life or death, and this is our last stand.
[02:12:17.026 --> 02:12:18.488]  If they destroy us here, we're dead.
[02:12:19.428 --> 02:12:30.438]  Yeah, let's go ahead and pick the date that we're going to, or a few days when we're going to do it, so people can get here, they can be in place, they can be ready, and then we'll announce live on air, hey, two hours this.
[02:12:30.438 --> 02:12:31.639]  So when is South by Southwest?
[02:12:31.639 --> 02:12:33.341]  I try to avoid it.
[02:12:33.341 --> 02:12:33.761]  When is that?
[02:12:33.761 --> 02:12:37.885]  It's like March 9th through the 14th, I think, something like that.
[02:12:39.622 --> 02:12:41.163]  Yeah, oh my god.
[02:12:41.163 --> 02:12:44.445]  It's like a plague that sends all these zombies trying to get a job that doesn't exist.
[02:12:44.445 --> 02:12:46.926]  It's a giant pump and dump to rip people off, in my view.
[02:12:46.926 --> 02:12:49.128]  It's incredible.
[02:12:49.128 --> 02:12:51.009]  So, yeah, we'll set something up.
[02:12:51.009 --> 02:12:54.631]  Let's start talking today, and then let's start announcing something by Monday, okay?
[02:12:55.939 --> 02:12:58.362]  Yeah, we need a dedicated event.
[02:12:58.362 --> 02:13:01.586]  We need a squad leader, team leader, activism.
[02:13:01.586 --> 02:13:04.190]  If we don't do activism now, we're all done.
[02:13:04.190 --> 02:13:05.011]  We're all dead.
[02:13:05.011 --> 02:13:06.553]  And I don't mean figuratively.
[02:13:06.553 --> 02:13:13.963]  They won't even... We're at the point now where if I just said, you know what, I just want to retire and leave me alone, then they would say, oh, now you look weak.
[02:13:14.523 --> 02:13:23.366]  I was about to say, I want to turn the tide completely, because I'll still have info wars, but I don't want to like, just be like, pedal to the metal constantly.
[02:13:23.366 --> 02:13:26.247]  It has a physical effect, it has a mental effect.
[02:13:26.247 --> 02:13:28.448]  You know, your children grow up, and it's, I agree.
[02:13:28.448 --> 02:13:31.309]  I mean, I am just so sick of this.
[02:13:31.309 --> 02:13:32.129]  But they're not going to stop.
[02:13:32.129 --> 02:13:34.370]  They're forcing us to get even stronger.
[02:13:34.370 --> 02:13:35.510]  God bless you, Mike Cernovich.
[02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:40.752]  Let's talk, let's get you shut up for like Monday or something on the show to come on, and let's talk about this.
[02:13:40.752 --> 02:13:42.393]  But let's war game this over the weekend, okay?
[02:13:43.257 --> 02:13:43.899]  Perfect.
[02:13:43.899 --> 02:13:44.580]  Alright, thanks buddy.
[02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:45.422]  You can just honcho that.
[02:13:45.422 --> 02:13:46.344]  You always have great plans.
[02:13:46.344 --> 02:13:48.829]  So you just tell me what you think we ought to do and we'll just do it.
[02:13:49.753 --> 02:13:51.674]  It's great to have generals out there like Mike Cernovich.
[02:13:51.674 --> 02:14:00.361]  Just briefly, we're going to come back with this next guest from the Second Amendment, who's in Florida and has found out about some potential triggers for another mass shooting that may not be averted by a sheriff.
[02:14:00.361 --> 02:14:02.363]  He's working on the case right now.
[02:14:02.363 --> 02:14:04.164]  He is from the Central Florida Post.
[02:14:04.164 --> 02:14:05.705]  You saw him on CNN.
[02:14:05.705 --> 02:14:07.667]  They were trying to demonize him, trying to talk.
[02:14:07.667 --> 02:14:09.268]  We'll play that clip as well when we come back.
[02:14:09.268 --> 02:14:13.612]  I also wanted to open the phones up today, but they've loaded me up with so many great guests with so much breaking intel.
[02:14:14.252 --> 02:14:15.793]  But we're going to be taking more calls on the show.
[02:14:15.793 --> 02:14:16.534]  I love your calls.
[02:14:16.534 --> 02:14:18.555]  It's great during the 34-hour broadcast.
[02:14:18.555 --> 02:14:19.896]  We've had a lot of chance to take those.
[02:14:19.896 --> 02:14:22.838]  I came in last night, did about two hours, took about 20 phone calls.
[02:14:22.838 --> 02:14:25.580]  So we're going to be doing a lot of that.
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:28.182]  This is serious, okay?
[02:14:28.182 --> 02:14:29.063]  Everybody sees it.
[02:14:29.063 --> 02:14:35.227]  It's just like, for what you see, there's 80% more going on behind the scenes you don't know.
[02:14:35.227 --> 02:14:38.449]  And I'm quite frankly very honored.
[02:14:38.449 --> 02:14:39.090]  Very honored.
[02:14:40.041 --> 02:14:41.482]  Uh, that they pulled out all the stops.
[02:14:41.482 --> 02:14:45.686]  And I know that they may go ahead and pull the trigger and, you know, deep six me.
[02:14:45.686 --> 02:14:46.426]  But you know what?
[02:14:46.426 --> 02:14:47.908]  My forebears did that.
[02:14:47.908 --> 02:14:50.870]  And everybody else, I, as a man, it's like, I'm instinctive.
[02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:52.692]  It feels like where I'm supposed to be.
[02:14:52.692 --> 02:14:54.313]  I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
[02:14:54.313 --> 02:14:59.137]  I don't have any fear of dying or being put in prison or being killed or being attacked or anything.
[02:14:59.137 --> 02:15:05.542]  I just have fear that I haven't completed the mission and that you're not realizing how important you are and not active enough and not aggressive enough.
[02:15:05.542 --> 02:15:06.383]  And I'm not bitching at you.
[02:15:06.943 --> 02:15:08.564]  I'm just saying, do whatever you gotta do.
[02:15:08.564 --> 02:15:11.625]  Go to city council, call the talk radio, write a book.
[02:15:11.625 --> 02:15:13.545]  All of us together, we're going to defeat this.
[02:15:13.545 --> 02:15:16.546]  Especially the young people, but also powerful individuals.
[02:15:16.546 --> 02:15:22.748]  Whether you're a pastor, or a professor, or a teacher, or a shop teacher.
[02:15:22.748 --> 02:15:23.968]  Everybody's powerful.
[02:15:23.968 --> 02:15:30.070]  And people that have money are really powerful because you can buy products that you need and use and help support the truth.
[02:15:30.070 --> 02:15:31.151]  You can donate.
[02:15:31.151 --> 02:15:33.531]  Infowars.com forward slash show has a donate button.
[02:15:33.531 --> 02:15:35.212]  I want to thank those that have donated.

[02:16:56.873 --> 02:17:02.257]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.

[02:18:59.953 --> 02:19:11.462]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[02:19:11.462 --> 02:19:12.362]  This is pollen blood.
[02:19:13.363 --> 02:19:26.013]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[02:19:26.013 --> 02:19:29.856]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[02:19:30.336 --> 02:19:34.798]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[02:19:34.798 --> 02:19:44.903]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:02.275]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.795 --> 02:20:27.496]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:27.496 --> 02:20:29.136]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:29.136 --> 02:20:35.679]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:35.679 --> 02:20:45.402]  Here's the Facebook and Google administrators on Twitter announcing that they're going to be very fair in banning bullying, which they now call witchcraft.
[02:20:45.402 --> 02:20:50.804]  This is actual footage of a Google-Facebook meeting where they decided to censor InfoWars.
[02:20:54.246 --> 02:20:56.188]  Who do you know she is a witch?
[02:20:56.188 --> 02:20:59.130]  She looks like one!
[02:20:59.130 --> 02:21:01.552]  Bring her forward.
[02:21:01.552 --> 02:21:02.673]  I'm not a witch!
[02:21:02.673 --> 02:21:04.314]  I'm not a witch!
[02:21:04.314 --> 02:21:05.975]  But you are dressed as one.
[02:21:05.975 --> 02:21:08.817]  They dressed me up like this.
[02:21:08.817 --> 02:21:14.802]  And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
[02:21:14.802 --> 02:21:15.943]  Well?
[02:21:15.943 --> 02:21:17.664]  Well, we did do the nose.
[02:21:17.664 --> 02:21:19.065]  The nose?
[02:21:19.065 --> 02:21:19.726]  And the hat.
[02:21:19.726 --> 02:21:20.487]  But she's a witch!
[02:21:24.424 --> 02:21:25.985]  Did you dress her up like this?
[02:21:25.985 --> 02:21:26.566]  No!
[02:21:26.566 --> 02:21:26.846]  No!
[02:21:26.846 --> 02:21:27.666]  No!
[02:21:27.666 --> 02:21:28.207]  No!
[02:21:28.207 --> 02:21:28.707]  Yes!
[02:21:28.707 --> 02:21:29.007]  Yes!
[02:21:29.007 --> 02:21:29.608]  Yes!
[02:21:29.608 --> 02:21:30.088]  A bit!
[02:21:30.088 --> 02:21:30.428]  A bit!
[02:21:30.428 --> 02:21:30.748]  A bit!
[02:21:30.748 --> 02:21:31.049]  A bit!
[02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:33.430]  She has got a wart!
[02:21:33.430 --> 02:21:35.532]  What makes you think she's a witch?
[02:21:35.532 --> 02:21:38.674]  Well, she turned me into a newt!
[02:21:38.674 --> 02:21:43.317]  A newt?
[02:21:43.317 --> 02:21:44.318]  I got better.
[02:21:44.318 --> 02:21:45.779]  Burn her, Eddie!
[02:21:45.779 --> 02:21:47.240]  Burn her!
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:47.760]  Burn her!
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:48.160]  Burn her!
[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:50.442]  They were actually chanting burn her to gain a life.
[02:21:52.162 --> 02:21:53.443]  We've got a clip of the gentleman that was there.
[02:21:53.443 --> 02:21:57.704]  We're going to go to him right now for a little bit of the next segment because I got to him late and we'll have our next guest on.
[02:21:57.704 --> 02:22:04.968]  Jacob Ingalls is the publisher of the Central Florida Post, centralfloridapost.com, and contributor with New Dawn Magazine.
[02:22:04.968 --> 02:22:13.711]  He's committed to true journalism on a local level, and they tried to demonize him and make a fool of him, the one person they let into this other town hall to do this.
[02:22:13.711 --> 02:22:15.692]  I wonder, behind the scenes, they chanted, burn him.
[02:22:15.692 --> 02:22:19.074]  He's been on The War Room before, I believe, as I recognize him.
[02:22:19.074 --> 02:22:21.395]  But Jacob Ingalls, thank you for joining us today.
[02:22:22.708 --> 02:22:24.331]  Great to be on the program.
[02:22:24.331 --> 02:22:25.713]  So major new controversy.
[02:22:25.713 --> 02:22:30.742]  Now you're working on a big story of another potential stand down in Florida and making another mass shooting.
[02:22:30.742 --> 02:22:35.810]  We want to know as much as you can tell us about that, but also just the whole state of the burn the gun owners meme that's going on.
[02:22:37.097 --> 02:22:43.100]  You know, it was really, really sad to see how CNN edited the gun control panel that I participated in.
[02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:47.043]  The first segment, they were very fair, very decent.
[02:22:47.043 --> 02:22:58.409]  But the second segment, where I brought up the fact that it wasn't too long ago, in the 1960s, Jim Crow South, that state and county governments systematically disarmed black citizens so they couldn't fight back against oppression.
[02:22:58.789 --> 02:22:59.409]  We have that clip, don't we?
[02:22:59.409 --> 02:23:01.410]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip of Jacob Ingalls and then flipping out.
[02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:01.690]  Here it is.
[02:23:28.693 --> 02:23:30.594]  Why can't I see an emotional response?
[02:23:30.594 --> 02:23:31.294]  What's wrong with you?
[02:23:31.294 --> 02:23:32.455]  Legislation.
[02:23:32.455 --> 02:23:34.215]  Legislation is not a bad thing.
[02:23:34.215 --> 02:23:39.697]  You have kids who should be grieving right now, and instead, adults are putting them on national television.
[02:23:39.697 --> 02:23:40.258]  Hold on.
[02:23:40.258 --> 02:23:41.738]  This I have to object to.
[02:23:41.738 --> 02:23:45.240]  I've never seen more motivated people come to a camera.
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:48.061]  I want to tell their story about what they demand now.
[02:23:48.061 --> 02:23:49.861]  These are not kids.
[02:23:49.861 --> 02:23:53.303]  They hijacked four of them, fed the narrative, and then got a bunch of other people to join.
[02:23:53.923 --> 02:23:54.525]  They're motivated.
[02:23:54.525 --> 02:23:58.431]  They watch their friends die and you're gonna bash on them?
[02:23:58.431 --> 02:24:04.842]  Who, show of hands, would be comfortable raising the age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21?
[02:24:07.202 --> 02:24:07.722]  Three of you.
[02:24:07.722 --> 02:24:08.682]  It's an arbitrary age.
[02:24:08.682 --> 02:24:10.483]  It's like the drinking age is an arbitrary age.
[02:24:10.483 --> 02:24:10.863]  Make it a hundred!
[02:24:10.863 --> 02:24:13.143]  I'm comfortable with it being a higher arbitrary age.
[02:24:13.143 --> 02:24:13.563]  Yeah.
[02:24:13.563 --> 02:24:19.064]  You have 18-year-olds still in high school and you're going to sell them an assault weapon, or any weapon for that matter.
[02:24:19.064 --> 02:24:20.024]  It shouldn't be.
[02:24:20.024 --> 02:24:21.065]  They're at an 18-year-old.
[02:24:21.065 --> 02:24:22.525]  You let them drive a car, Dumbo.
[02:24:22.525 --> 02:24:23.745]  All 18 to 20-year-olds.
[02:24:23.745 --> 02:24:28.606]  This is a total arrest and development thing now, where they call 35, as they say, the new 16.
[02:24:28.606 --> 02:24:31.466]  These people are on to how they're doing.
[02:24:31.466 --> 02:24:33.047]  I love being lazy and dumb.
[02:24:33.047 --> 02:24:33.747]  I enjoy it.
[02:24:35.437 --> 02:24:36.818]  I can't listen to these idiots anymore.
[02:24:36.818 --> 02:24:40.079]  Jacob, what is it like being around these morons?
[02:24:40.079 --> 02:24:41.280]  You know, it was very interesting.
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:57.288]  When I went to the holding room in CNN and started talking to people before the panel, as soon as they realized that I wasn't for gun grabbing, that I wasn't for knee-jerk reaction gun control measures, and that I instead wanted to review the laws on the books, enforce them properly,
[02:24:57.948 --> 02:25:02.270]  And address the issue of mental health and pumping people full of psychotropic drugs.
[02:25:02.270 --> 02:25:03.691]  I was ostracized in the room.
[02:25:03.691 --> 02:25:05.291]  They didn't want to talk to me anymore.
[02:25:05.291 --> 02:25:09.273]  And then on that panel, I had to fight tooth and nail to get my point across.
[02:25:09.273 --> 02:25:16.436]  And that SJW blonde chick in the front just kept talking over me and kind of matronly, I'm older than you.
[02:25:16.436 --> 02:25:17.216]  I'm an adult.
[02:25:17.216 --> 02:25:19.197]  Sit down and shut up, young man.
[02:25:19.197 --> 02:25:21.178]  And that was really disappointing.
[02:25:21.178 --> 02:25:24.299]  I tried hard and then I got some good points across.
[02:25:24.299 --> 02:25:26.480]  But CNN, again, seems determined.
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:38.182]  To come for our guns and to convince the American people that anyone who doesn't agree with that are somehow child murderers and that's sick, it's depraved, and quite frankly, I think it's a little demonic.
[02:25:40.267 --> 02:25:46.710]  Well it is, and all I know is they said that I said nobody died or they were all brought in from California and it was all fake.
[02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:58.676]  Then they'd take my videos down where I said the opposite and then they'd have Hogg and people run around and call me a piece of you-know-what and all sorts of names and then say you wanted to debate me when I said doody back down and then they call that bullying.
[02:25:58.676 --> 02:25:59.996]  It's just, it's crazy.
[02:25:59.996 --> 02:26:08.841]  You know, the guy is being flown around, they're being flown around, not Hogg, a bunch of other young people on private jets to go around and like get other groups of people to run around and be anti-gun.
[02:26:08.841 --> 02:26:09.501]  This is crazy.
[02:26:11.489 --> 02:26:15.532]  Well, David Hogg, simply put, is full of hogwash.
[02:26:15.532 --> 02:26:21.977]  That individual... And they'll call that bullying, and I'll sue them if they take this video down, I am, they know already.
[02:26:21.977 --> 02:26:30.163]  Because he's an adult world, he's a spokesman calling me a piece of S-H-I-T, or, I mean, see, and they can say it all they want, I can't.
[02:26:30.163 --> 02:26:34.746]  Calling me a piece of you-know-what, and then you can't even make a joke saying he's wrong.
[02:26:36.478 --> 02:26:49.661]  David Hogg and everyone else who's standing up from that tragedy that happened put themselves in the public arena, and adults around them knew that they were putting them in the public arena, and when you're in the public arena, you're a public figure.
[02:26:49.661 --> 02:26:50.402]  It's fair game.
[02:26:50.402 --> 02:27:03.605]  I would argue that they're too young, and they're not developed enough to have been put in that position, but adults made that decision for them, and they've encouraged it, so now their proposals are going to be scrutinized, and that is only fair.
[02:27:05.930 --> 02:27:09.440]  What do you make of the other town hall where they were saying burn Dana Loesch right out of Monty Python?
[02:27:11.694 --> 02:27:25.559]  It just begs the question, are these people mentally competent, or are they so deranged from the election of Donald Trump that they have no longer control over their mental faculties?
[02:27:25.559 --> 02:27:37.544]  And I don't think they have control over themselves, and it's really sad because they're Americans, they're fellow humans, they're people that we want to help become better individuals, but it seems they've lost complete and total control.
[02:27:37.544 --> 02:27:40.645]  Oh, you ought to see them in Austin, not bragging, but
[02:27:42.759 --> 02:27:45.541]  The county is... I gotta get into it.
[02:27:45.541 --> 02:27:48.764]  The point is that I'm not even welcome in my own hometown.
[02:27:48.764 --> 02:27:49.525]  I was born in Dallas.
[02:27:49.525 --> 02:27:50.626]  A lot of families from here.
[02:27:50.626 --> 02:27:51.806]  I've been here since high school.
[02:27:51.806 --> 02:27:54.349]  And I've had family here since before it was a state.
[02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:57.151]  Before it was its own country, when it was Mexico.
[02:27:57.151 --> 02:28:02.996]  And the Californians, they're not really Californians, but the little globalist bots, they get in my face everywhere.
[02:28:02.996 --> 02:28:07.459]  And when I speak back, they go, oh, you're bullying and getting mad when I get back in their face.
[02:28:07.459 --> 02:28:08.801]  That's mental illness.
[02:28:08.801 --> 02:28:11.443]  You get in somebody's face and then can't believe it when they get back in yours.
[02:28:12.888 --> 02:28:14.249]  That's exactly the point.
[02:28:14.249 --> 02:28:20.816]  I've been consistently called Nazi, spat on, and anytime I go to defend myself, they say, no, let's talk about intellect.
[02:28:20.816 --> 02:28:22.217]  Let's talk about logic.
[02:28:22.217 --> 02:28:24.939]  Let's be real here and talk one-on-one.
[02:28:24.939 --> 02:28:27.582]  They say, oh, you can't question me.
[02:28:27.582 --> 02:28:29.884]  My opinion is fact.
[02:28:29.884 --> 02:28:31.405]  They just start having this bastard.
[02:28:31.405 --> 02:28:33.767]  That's right.
[02:28:33.767 --> 02:28:35.569]  They can't control what's coming out of their mouth.
[02:28:35.569 --> 02:28:36.110]  It's scary.
[02:28:37.185 --> 02:28:46.992]  I want to ask you briefly on the other side where you think this is all going and get a little bit of that story you say you're working on without getting out any names yet, because we'll obviously know more about it tomorrow.
[02:28:46.992 --> 02:28:54.418]  But I also want to get your take on Trump as, you know, are you being more of a libertarian pro-gun act is what you make of him starting to go sideways, which is a nightmare.

[02:32:59.804 --> 02:33:02.388]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:17.865 --> 02:33:22.070]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:24.373]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:24.373 --> 02:33:26.055]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:26.055 --> 02:33:31.502]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:36.768]  Alright, we've got Dr. Steve Pachetnik on with us, who was on the broadcast.
[02:33:37.824 --> 02:33:44.907]  What was it like Monday, and he said, don't worry Alex, it's rogue people at Google and YouTube, the channels will all be back.
[02:33:44.907 --> 02:33:46.827]  Well, they took Horsey's down, it's back.
[02:33:46.827 --> 02:33:48.828]  They had ours blocked, it's back.
[02:33:48.828 --> 02:33:51.449]  Military Arms Channel was down, I just got a text, that's back.
[02:33:52.705 --> 02:33:55.447]  Looks like thousands of sites are all coming back.
[02:33:55.447 --> 02:33:58.969]  And he goes, the relationship with the government and Google is very good.
[02:33:58.969 --> 02:34:00.049]  It'll be back.
[02:34:00.049 --> 02:34:07.294]  And I don't want to, I think it's the pressure and Drudge Report and everything coming back and, you know, them exposing it.
[02:34:07.294 --> 02:34:10.676]  But Pchenik did say that it was rogue people inside.
[02:34:10.676 --> 02:34:12.897]  So we're going to find out about this in just a minute.
[02:34:12.897 --> 02:34:15.059]  But finishing up, he's laughing.
[02:34:15.059 --> 02:34:16.379]  He likes my imitation.
[02:34:16.379 --> 02:34:17.520]  There you go.
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:19.161]  I always go crazy in the third hour.
[02:34:19.161 --> 02:34:20.262]  I wanted to go ahead and finish up.
[02:34:21.329 --> 02:34:30.219]  With the gentleman that we're talking to, Jacob Ingalls, who is on the CNN panel and who heads up a newspaper there in Florida, heads up the Central Florida Post.
[02:34:30.219 --> 02:34:31.280]  Where is this going now?
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:35.105]  What do you make of Trump starting to go sideways in his rhetoric on the Second Amendment?
[02:34:35.105 --> 02:34:39.450]  I mean, it's like they transplanted his brain with that of Dianne Feinstein's.
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:58.537]  I sincerely hope that our president is using this as a negotiating tactic and technique to give the Democrats and the Liberals an idea of, hey, we'll come to the table, we'll work with you, we'll give you a little bit of what you want, and then that he drops the hammer at the last minute.
[02:34:59.298 --> 02:35:00.399]  I don't think he is, but it's rhetorical.
[02:35:22.771 --> 02:35:25.353]  It hurts the general movement.
[02:35:25.353 --> 02:35:31.719]  Can you get into the story you're working on, dealing with that situation, a new potential crisis?
[02:35:33.122 --> 02:35:35.603]  Yes, one of my sources gave me a call today.
[02:35:35.603 --> 02:35:41.985]  There's a local college here in Central Florida, and apparently yesterday there was an incident between a few students.
[02:35:41.985 --> 02:35:43.465]  A teacher got involved.
[02:35:43.465 --> 02:35:45.185]  There was a little bit of a scuffle.
[02:35:45.185 --> 02:35:46.826]  Campus security responded.
[02:35:46.826 --> 02:35:58.389]  And when this individual was being removed from the room and detained for the police, he made a comment, something to the effect of, I'm going to go get my gun and come back.
[02:35:59.253 --> 02:36:09.422]  Everyone now the police What I'm told by my sources then Baker acted this individual But the concern we're having right now is that there was no check done.
[02:36:09.422 --> 02:36:27.477]  There was no real investigation to even if he is a danger Even if he has access to weapons So our main concern now is that he's being Baker acted pump full of psychotropic drugs And then we'll just be haphazardly released back out into the world where if he does have access to something and he is a
[02:36:27.797 --> 02:36:31.479]  Mentally unstable, and now he's got harmful chemicals in his body.
[02:36:31.479 --> 02:36:34.060]  That is tailor-made for disaster.
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:44.245]  I really, really hope that the police are investigating this and not being as sloppy as they were down in Broward.
[02:36:44.245 --> 02:36:47.626]  We will watch this very closely, Jacob Engels of the Central Florida Post.
[02:36:47.626 --> 02:36:49.067]  Thank you.
[02:36:49.067 --> 02:36:50.167]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:36:50.167 --> 02:36:50.587]  You bet.
[02:36:50.587 --> 02:36:53.249]  Thanks for your courage to go into that den of vipers and CNN.
[02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:59.092]  Now, again, you just heard me introduce it, Dr. Steve Pachetnik is here.
[02:36:59.092 --> 02:37:03.474]  Here's one of the headlines, Gizmodo, YouTube terminates account of Infowars Bureau Chief.
[02:37:03.474 --> 02:37:10.617]  Had nothing to do with the shootings, did not say they were actors, talking about Trump striking back against the globalists politically.
[02:37:10.617 --> 02:37:13.779]  That's what they're scared of, the QAnon, the storm, all that.
[02:37:13.779 --> 02:37:20.142]  Meanwhile, YouTube mocks critics amid a censorship fight.
[02:37:20.142 --> 02:37:22.863]  Now, the reason this is important is that
[02:37:24.096 --> 02:37:27.397]  YouTube says they hired 10,000 SJWs.
[02:37:27.397 --> 02:37:28.357]  That's the criteria.
[02:37:28.357 --> 02:37:33.619]  And it's also come out in the news in lawsuits that you can't be white or Asian.
[02:37:33.619 --> 02:37:35.520]  They've just said no more whites or Asians.
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:37.701]  And again, that makes it sound like, oh, affirmative action.
[02:37:37.701 --> 02:37:39.721]  No, it's like discrimination.
[02:37:39.721 --> 02:37:45.723]  Plus, they're now, the left's now saying, well, Asians didn't own any slaves, but they're still bad.
[02:37:45.723 --> 02:37:50.085]  So it's like, oh, people that work harder in school and do all this stuff, they're inherently bad.
[02:37:51.025 --> 02:37:55.489]  And by the way, whites are way down the line, like the top nine richest slots are Asian groups.
[02:37:55.489 --> 02:37:59.472]  Whites are like, whites are there with blacks, you name it, on average.
[02:37:59.472 --> 02:38:01.994]  It's a lot of rich white people, but there's also a ton of poor ones.
[02:38:01.994 --> 02:38:08.599]  That's why Bernie Sanders, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:38:08.599 --> 02:38:11.202]  Honeymoon to the Soviet Union.
[02:38:11.202 --> 02:38:13.383]  They know how to treat those Christians.
[02:38:13.383 --> 02:38:15.065]  We could just do it.
[02:38:15.065 --> 02:38:17.146]  Sorry, I want to be a big man.
[02:38:17.146 --> 02:38:18.327]  I'm going to be one someday.
[02:38:18.327 --> 02:38:19.588]  All right, let me get serious.
[02:38:20.949 --> 02:38:25.814]  And he does that bozo the clown hair, he'll look like he's Einstein when he's really an idiot.
[02:38:25.814 --> 02:38:28.396]  Looks like he's like, he's become a straightjacket.
[02:38:28.396 --> 02:38:31.078]  We've got to take that picture and put him in a straightjacket.
[02:38:31.078 --> 02:38:32.179]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[02:38:32.179 --> 02:38:42.128]  Dr. Steve McShannock joins us on Google and the big internet war that it looks like, I don't want to say we've turned the tide, but it's starting to turn where they're just saying it's a mistake, we're sorry.
[02:38:42.128 --> 02:38:42.988]  Is it the real headline?
[02:38:43.889 --> 02:38:52.078]  Google was hacked by its own employees in an internal civil war to purge conservatives and libertarians in like a desperate mutiny?
[02:38:52.078 --> 02:38:53.780]  I mean, that's what really happened.
[02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:58.746]  Suddenly, YouTube blinks, Shestang goes, Google goes, we had employees that did that who were unauthorized.
[02:38:58.746 --> 02:38:59.206]  I can't say a word.
[02:39:27.449 --> 02:39:29.190]  It's almost impossible.
[02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:31.171]  It's exactly what I told you.
[02:39:31.171 --> 02:39:33.092]  Nothing's going to happen to you.
[02:39:33.092 --> 02:39:34.973]  You're too important to the Republic.
[02:39:35.743 --> 02:39:38.604]  And, I mean, like slatulence in a church.
[02:39:38.604 --> 02:39:40.344]  Who can come up with that kind of riff?
[02:39:40.344 --> 02:39:42.025]  That's why you're popular.
[02:39:42.025 --> 02:39:42.925]  Oh, stop, stop, stop.
[02:39:42.925 --> 02:39:44.205]  You're the guy that predicted this.
[02:39:44.205 --> 02:39:48.006]  So, so... Well, it's not a very hard prediction, Alex.
[02:39:48.006 --> 02:39:49.986]  Let's go back to our history.
[02:39:49.986 --> 02:39:56.888]  You and I and others have been on the forefront of whatever we could call it, an infowar revolution.
[02:39:57.771 --> 02:40:05.717]  The people at Google, the people at Amazon and all the other institutions got a wake-up call.
[02:40:05.717 --> 02:40:10.800]  And that wake-up call came very quickly after you and I had that discussion.
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:26.131]  But there were people within the government, and again I go through this, there are loyalists within our government and many, many of our 18 intelligence agencies who are very concerned about what happens to this country.
[02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:32.674]  Right or wrong, they are committed as much as I am, you are, to the sustaining of the republic.
[02:40:32.674 --> 02:40:35.636]  Remember, the presidency is temporal.
[02:40:35.636 --> 02:40:49.564]  From our point of view, we want to maintain the integrity of the republic so that the nation state has a capacity for transaction, for national security, and for the ability to encourage entrepreneurship.
[02:40:49.564 --> 02:40:50.625]  This is what it's all about.
[02:40:51.045 --> 02:41:06.699]  But when entrepreneurship becomes a massive fascist organization, which it could under Google, and the boys who started it came out of the Soviet Union, and yours truly helped to get those boys out of the Soviet Union, we don't like what happens.
[02:41:06.699 --> 02:41:17.089]  So those of us who've been involved in conflict, those of us who were involved in taking down the Soviet Union, it's not me, the CIA and others who were involved in military intelligence,
[02:41:17.489 --> 02:41:26.496]  I understand very clearly that we're not going to reduplicate the Soviet Union in the guise of Google, Amazon, or any other institution.
[02:41:26.496 --> 02:41:32.101]  So they are in fact beholden to the different segments of our intelligence community.
[02:41:32.421 --> 02:41:47.498]  But there is a civil war within the companies, within the institutions, within the police departments, because if it wasn't for Drudge and the listeners getting upset and making it a major news story, I mean that obviously helped people also on the inside make the moral argument to make sure this stopped.
[02:41:47.498 --> 02:41:51.643]  Because somebody hired these 10,000 scallywags, brought them in to do this lynching.
[02:41:52.765 --> 02:41:57.466]  Well, however it occurred, it occurred, but you're correct.
[02:41:57.466 --> 02:42:04.347]  I've said to you for a long time ago, only 4% of the American population was involved in the Revolutionary War.
[02:42:04.347 --> 02:42:17.449]  We can take that to about 4 to 3% right now of the Americans who were involved in the active participation to make sure that we don't have these kinds of interference in our democracy and our republic.
[02:42:17.449 --> 02:42:20.110]  You happen to be the voice of that
[02:42:20.751 --> 02:42:21.132]  We're good.
[02:42:31.588 --> 02:42:38.253]  Alex Stone, Alex Jones, is extremely important to the integrity of the Republic.
[02:42:38.253 --> 02:42:39.514]  That's as simple as that.
[02:42:39.514 --> 02:42:41.515]  Well, everybody, we're just a focal point.
[02:42:41.515 --> 02:42:42.676]  It's everybody on this show.
[02:42:42.676 --> 02:42:43.497]  It's everybody.
[02:42:43.497 --> 02:42:43.937]  It really is.
[02:42:43.937 --> 02:42:44.477]  It's everybody.
[02:42:44.477 --> 02:42:45.758]  And it's Matt Drudge.
[02:42:45.758 --> 02:42:49.521]  And let's come back and talk about what you think is going to happen next.
[02:42:49.521 --> 02:42:50.362]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:42:50.362 --> 02:42:52.463]  Next week's news today with Steve Pucinich.
[02:42:52.463 --> 02:42:53.064]  StevePucinich.com.
[02:42:55.754 --> 02:42:59.238]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:59.238 --> 02:43:10.750]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[02:43:10.750 --> 02:43:11.631]  This is pollen blood.
[02:43:12.652 --> 02:43:25.304]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[02:43:25.304 --> 02:43:29.168]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[02:43:29.628 --> 02:43:34.111]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[02:43:34.111 --> 02:43:44.196]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[02:43:44.196 --> 02:43:47.338]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.
[02:43:47.338 --> 02:43:51.581]  Available now at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:43:56.229 --> 02:43:57.029]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:57.029 --> 02:44:07.175]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:07.175 --> 02:44:15.699]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.699 --> 02:44:24.483]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:26.567 --> 02:44:46.151]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:46.151 --> 02:44:48.832]  It is amazing!
[02:44:48.832 --> 02:44:53.793]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:44:57.661 --> 02:45:03.124]  Maximize your potential and take your body back with super male vitality.

[02:45:18.035 --> 02:45:24.940]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[02:45:46.215 --> 02:45:47.698]  Take control of your body.
[02:45:47.698 --> 02:45:52.907]  Grab a bottle of Super Male Vitality today at infowarslife.com.
[02:45:52.907 --> 02:45:54.831]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:45:56.755 --> 02:46:05.324]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarslife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:46:05.324 --> 02:46:09.889]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:46:09.889 --> 02:46:13.032]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:46:13.032 --> 02:46:16.136]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:46:17.645 --> 02:46:30.471]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:46:30.471 --> 02:46:45.538]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:46:46.538 --> 02:46:50.799]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what it can do for your family.
[02:46:50.799 --> 02:46:52.540]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:46:52.540 --> 02:46:59.782]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:46:59.782 --> 02:47:02.443]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:13.376 --> 02:47:15.060]  Alright, final segment of this hour.
[02:47:15.060 --> 02:47:22.659]  Joel Gilbert normally hosts on Fridays at the 4th hour, but I'm going to commandeer the next two segments of that, because we've got the Military Arms Channel.
[02:47:23.991 --> 02:47:25.031]  Tens of millions of views.
[02:47:25.031 --> 02:47:26.572]  Hundreds of millions of views.
[02:47:26.572 --> 02:47:27.972]  I've seen it.
[02:47:27.972 --> 02:47:29.793]  I couldn't see it anymore because they deleted the channel.
[02:47:29.793 --> 02:47:32.573]  I couldn't go actually look it up when it was banned to see what it had on there.
[02:47:32.573 --> 02:47:34.494]  But we can have those statistics back now.
[02:47:34.494 --> 02:47:35.814]  They just reinstated that today.
[02:47:35.814 --> 02:47:37.815]  So first they reinstated Infowars.
[02:47:37.815 --> 02:47:39.435]  And now hundreds of accounts we know of.
[02:47:39.435 --> 02:47:41.376]  So I guess that must be thousands.
[02:47:41.376 --> 02:47:43.416]  But then they hit Corsi last night and deleted him.
[02:47:43.416 --> 02:47:44.996]  And then it was back up this morning.
[02:47:44.996 --> 02:47:46.497]  So this is an act of
[02:47:47.978 --> 02:47:48.979]  Mutiny.
[02:47:48.979 --> 02:47:59.249]  And I'm really worried about somebody killing the president that works in the White House or, you know, something like that because I deal with leftists and they're so deranged now, Trump derangement syndrome, that is real.
[02:47:59.249 --> 02:48:12.401]  They're so crazed that they're... I don't think we're out of the woods because they're still shadow banning, they're still curtailing libertarian talk, but their naked attempt to ban everything really blew up in their face.
[02:48:12.401 --> 02:48:13.682]  Is that what you're getting at, Dr. Pachenik?
[02:48:15.188 --> 02:48:24.873]  Yeah, it's pretty much, I'm not worried that anybody's going to assassinate or hurt Trump because I'm quite familiar with the Secret Service.
[02:48:24.873 --> 02:48:28.494]  And for over 30 years, they've been exceedingly, exceedingly good.
[02:48:28.494 --> 02:48:32.476]  It's one of the few institutions that we really don't appreciate.
[02:48:32.476 --> 02:48:34.677]  It's a 24-7 job.
[02:48:34.677 --> 02:48:37.258]  When I ran the psychiatric units at St.
[02:48:37.258 --> 02:48:41.380]  Elizabeth's, we reported literally on a weekly, if not daily basis.
[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:42.181]  This is back on the 70s.
[02:48:43.301 --> 02:48:44.942]  I'm not worried about that.
[02:48:44.942 --> 02:48:46.944]  Actually I'm not even worried about the left.
[02:48:58.149 --> 02:49:07.317]  What does concern me, and I'm going to change it a little bit, is that Trump announced a tariff of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum.
[02:49:07.317 --> 02:49:16.085]  What that does is really create a tariff war, which at this particular point in time, I do not agree with.
[02:49:16.085 --> 02:49:24.172]  It's something that has major ramifications, particularly for our closest allies, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea.
[02:49:24.172 --> 02:49:25.753]  Isn't he doing it as a negotiating point?
[02:49:27.074 --> 02:49:32.518]  He may be, but he invoked national security, which isn't exactly a negotiating point.
[02:49:32.518 --> 02:49:34.520]  And he said it's really quite simple.
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:42.166]  We're at the tail end of a steel deficit, and we really want to increase the price of steel as it comes in.
[02:49:42.686 --> 02:49:44.428]  Well, that's not exactly correct.
[02:49:44.428 --> 02:49:48.632]  We don't have that type of steel deficit.
[02:49:48.632 --> 02:49:50.774]  Our companies, Nucor, U.S.
[02:49:50.774 --> 02:50:05.349]  Steel, are important companies, but they can't produce the amount of steel that we need in the various industries at the prices that we had with imports of steel coming from Canada and aluminum and particularly from... Are you saying it's going to trigger inflation?
[02:50:06.488 --> 02:50:07.809]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:50:07.809 --> 02:50:12.333]  It's triggering not only inflation, but a major uncertainty in the stock market.
[02:50:12.333 --> 02:50:30.469]  We've lost about $500 billion over the past two days, and we're heading in for what we call a fifth day of distribution and a major, major pullback in all the major companies, including the steel and aluminum companies, as well as the car companies and every other ancillary service.
[02:50:31.289 --> 02:50:32.150]  Other than the left.
[02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:33.811]  The left has nothing to do with this.
[02:50:33.811 --> 02:50:40.516]  This is really total economic, what I wouldn't call warfare, but it begins economic warfare.
[02:50:40.516 --> 02:50:47.701]  Sure, it's a form of an embargo, but China, you know, keeps lowering their taxes to counter us, and what are we supposed to do?
[02:50:47.701 --> 02:50:50.823]  I mean, we got de-industrialized this way.
[02:50:50.823 --> 02:50:56.428]  I agree that maybe just announcing he's doing it instead of saying I may do it has caused some jitters, but
[02:50:57.088 --> 02:50:59.330]  You know, I don't know.
[02:50:59.330 --> 02:51:05.675]  They're trying to push that a depression could be triggered from this, but I thought the depression was already happening, and then they came along with smooth haulings.
[02:51:06.787 --> 02:51:07.988]  No, not really.
[02:51:07.988 --> 02:51:09.148]  There was no depression.
[02:51:09.148 --> 02:51:20.313]  Our economy is quite strong and what happened is Mr. Powell of the Federal Reserve, I admire what he does, hinted very clearly that we're going to have four increases in interest rates.
[02:51:20.313 --> 02:51:31.418]  So that's when the stock market pulled back a thousand points or more because we weren't used to having an increased GDP and at the same time having an increase in interest rates.
[02:51:31.418 --> 02:51:32.198]  That's actually a good point.
[02:51:32.398 --> 02:51:32.618]  Correct.
[02:51:32.618 --> 02:51:39.443]  But on the other hand, the stock markets don't know exactly when those interest rates come in and how much it will affect it, particularly when there's announcements that there will be three and possibly four.
[02:51:39.443 --> 02:51:43.586]  More importantly, you have to understand, the amount of steel that we get from China is less than 5%.
[02:51:43.586 --> 02:51:43.746]  It's 2%.
[02:52:02.120 --> 02:52:12.264]  What we're really concerned about, I mean in general, both in the national military area and in the business area where I'm involved as well, is that we have allies like Canada.
[02:52:12.264 --> 02:52:14.005]  We can't afford to alienate them.
[02:52:14.005 --> 02:52:15.225]  We have Germany.
[02:52:15.225 --> 02:52:16.205]  That's an ally.
[02:52:16.205 --> 02:52:24.368]  Britain depends very heavily on our ability to have imports of their steel and to have exports that we can bring to them.
[02:52:24.368 --> 02:52:25.769]  And in the process of Brexit,
[02:52:26.169 --> 02:52:28.317]  We're hurting them.
[02:52:28.317 --> 02:52:28.898]  You're right there.
[02:52:28.898 --> 02:52:30.945]  Trump has promised them better trade deals.
[02:52:30.945 --> 02:52:32.470]  This is kind of a slap to Britain.
[02:52:33.393 --> 02:52:35.074]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:52:35.074 --> 02:52:48.065]  And in a way, what I'm cautioning Trump to do is to listen to Mr. Cohen and to Wilbur Ross and actually the guys at Goldman Sachs and the others who understand the ramifications of a tariff.
[02:52:48.065 --> 02:52:49.006]  So let me bring this up.
[02:52:49.006 --> 02:52:52.629]  Listeners hear that and they go, Goldman Sachs, that's the globals that got us this position.
[02:52:52.629 --> 02:52:55.311]  Well, if Goldman Sachs starts working for the country, that's a different deal.
[02:52:55.311 --> 02:52:57.353]  And I know there's been some power structure things, but you've got
[02:52:57.873 --> 02:53:07.482]  You've got the head of Goldman Sachs, Blankfein, kind of shooting his mouth off against Trump and making jokes about China's going to be supreme, but then it is going to be Goldman Sachs underwriting a lot of this other stuff.
[02:53:07.482 --> 02:53:11.526]  So give us a little inside baseball from your sources about what's going on at Goldman Sachs.
[02:53:12.398 --> 02:53:16.079]  Well, Goldman Sachs, it's an investment banking.
[02:53:16.079 --> 02:53:18.099]  I've been a managing director at Kidder.
[02:53:18.099 --> 02:53:21.740]  It wasn't at the same quality as Goldman Sachs, but it's pretty much the same thing.
[02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:25.180]  You have diversified entities within that structure.
[02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:27.501]  You have people who are exceedingly good.
[02:53:27.501 --> 02:53:32.661]  These are people who are traders, although the trading factor into Goldman Sachs, I think, was eliminated.
[02:53:32.661 --> 02:53:37.962]  What they're very good at is analyzing the economic ramifications of certain acts.
[02:53:37.962 --> 02:53:42.283]  That's what happens at Societal General and all the major investment banking
[02:53:42.383 --> 02:53:42.983]  We're good to go.
[02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:15.962]  Trump says has an exponential factor to it.
[02:54:15.962 --> 02:54:21.184]  It radiates so quickly out there that China is not just concerned about itself.
[02:54:21.184 --> 02:54:27.626]  It's really concerned about the fact that it's going to affect many, many of the countries around Asia, Southeast Asia.
[02:54:27.626 --> 02:54:31.988]  Well, Trump said he was going to renegotiate NAFTA and a lot of this has been unfair to our country.
[02:54:31.988 --> 02:54:33.768]  So we need to negotiate this.
[02:54:33.768 --> 02:54:35.249]  And isn't he just fulfilling his promises?
[02:54:36.164 --> 02:54:36.565]  No.
[02:54:36.565 --> 02:54:39.208]  He hasn't effectively negotiated NAFTA.
[02:54:39.208 --> 02:54:42.653]  He has not effectively looked at the tariff agreement.
[02:54:42.653 --> 02:54:47.239]  He has not worked out the ramifications of what a tariff means.
[02:54:47.239 --> 02:54:49.182]  Well then who is advising him then?
[02:54:50.561 --> 02:55:00.444]  I would say Cohen, Ross, I don't know who the specific individuals are that would have told him to say, look, I'm going to impose a tariff immediately on steel and aluminum.
[02:55:00.444 --> 02:55:01.564]  And I'm a day trader.
[02:55:01.564 --> 02:55:12.347]  And I can tell you that market was pulled back so quickly that four days in a row we had what we call distribution, which means we may be headed for another major pullback of five.
[02:55:12.347 --> 02:55:12.787]  No, I got it.
[02:55:12.787 --> 02:55:15.688]  You're saying this would cause a major stock market correction.
[02:55:15.688 --> 02:55:16.648]  So but but here's the thing.
[02:55:17.188 --> 02:55:20.249]  Trump's policy so far has brought the economy back.
[02:55:20.249 --> 02:55:23.810]  So, I mean, it comes to kind of like dancing with the one that brung you.
[02:55:23.810 --> 02:55:28.952]  If he's been right so far, then, you know, why sit there and say this is wrong?
[02:55:28.952 --> 02:55:33.553]  I mean, I got mixed feelings across the board, but I think we're going to see what happens.
[02:55:33.553 --> 02:55:35.434]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:55:35.434 --> 02:55:44.797]  Politically, what do you make of just all the stuff we're seeing with the Democrats and all their calls for impeachment and all the rest of it?
[02:55:44.797 --> 02:55:45.897]  You're saying you're not worried about that?
[02:55:46.658 --> 02:55:48.699]  No, that's just absolute nonsense.
[02:55:48.699 --> 02:55:58.264]  What's far more significant is what we were doing here on your show almost a year, year and a half ago when we said Hope Hicks has to leave, Jared Kushner will be leaving.
[02:55:58.264 --> 02:55:59.205]  Oh, that's a question.
[02:55:59.205 --> 02:56:01.546]  Do you have any information on why Hope Hicks left?
[02:56:02.643 --> 02:56:03.703]  Yes.
[02:56:03.703 --> 02:56:05.364]  The reason was very simple.
[02:56:05.364 --> 02:56:09.104]  She was very seductive, very effective.
[02:56:09.104 --> 02:56:17.506]  But as a Greenwich graduate, she knew better than to seduce the men in the White House if she had nothing else to do.
[02:56:17.506 --> 02:56:23.307]  And being close to the president doesn't necessarily mean you're being manipulative and seductive.
[02:56:23.307 --> 02:56:25.588]  Being close to the president means you're being discreet.
[02:56:26.188 --> 02:56:31.093]  And she knew her family in Greenwich was involved in public relations.
[02:56:31.093 --> 02:56:37.699]  She should have been a lot more discreet than seduce a man, Porter, who was already on the watch list with the FBI.
[02:56:37.699 --> 02:56:42.063]  John Kelly could not afford to have this kind of nonsense going on in the White House.
[02:56:42.603 --> 02:56:45.805]  And in fact, really insisted on cleaning this out.
[02:56:45.805 --> 02:56:59.491]  And this is one of the reasons why we in the community, intelligence and military community, insist on having a John Kelly, insist on having a Mattis, probably a McMaster, he may go to Fort Bragg, and we have a Pompeo and CIA.
[02:56:59.491 --> 02:57:06.194]  Not because we want military control, but we need a command and control system that has accountability.
[02:57:06.194 --> 02:57:10.116]  With a Hope Hicks, with a Jared Kushner, we have no accountability.
[02:57:10.476 --> 02:57:15.298]  Jared Kushner's now up on the crosshairs of being indicted for criminal activity.
[02:57:15.298 --> 02:57:18.119]  Well, you said a year and a half ago they're going to go after him for China.
[02:57:18.119 --> 02:57:19.659]  And now Mueller's off on China stuff.
[02:57:19.659 --> 02:57:22.020]  That's not in his mandate.
[02:57:22.020 --> 02:57:23.301]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:57:23.301 --> 02:57:24.201]  Let's do five more minutes.
[02:57:24.201 --> 02:57:25.061]  I have my next guest coming on.
[02:57:25.061 --> 02:57:28.202]  But let me ask this, two minutes.
[02:57:28.202 --> 02:57:30.763]  My only point is, is they want to get Trump.
[02:57:30.763 --> 02:57:33.824]  And so, okay, Kushner gets some money from some foreign banks.
[02:57:33.824 --> 02:57:35.305]  That's before he was even, it's like,
[02:57:36.425 --> 02:57:37.909]  Why is Mueller going after Kusher?
[02:57:37.909 --> 02:57:38.992]  I'm trying to protect Kusher.
[02:57:38.992 --> 02:57:42.281]  It's just, you've got the Clintons that have done 50 million things worse.
[02:57:46.653 --> 02:57:48.153]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:57:48.153 --> 02:57:49.694]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:57:49.694 --> 02:57:50.174]  Go ahead.
[02:57:50.174 --> 02:57:50.914]  Yes.
[02:57:50.914 --> 02:57:51.755]  Hi, Alex.
[02:57:51.755 --> 02:57:58.357]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:57:58.357 --> 02:58:02.698]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:58:02.698 --> 02:58:04.559]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:58:04.559 --> 02:58:14.462]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it's like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:58:14.462 --> 02:58:20.226]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:58:20.226 --> 02:58:28.352]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:58:28.352 --> 02:58:34.476]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:58:34.476 --> 02:58:40.020]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:58:40.020 --> 02:58:43.102]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:58.528]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[02:58:58.528 --> 02:58:59.909]  So what do we do about it?
[02:58:59.909 --> 02:59:03.252]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:59:03.252 --> 02:59:09.336]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush

[02:59:38.713 --> 02:59:40.034]  It's the real deal.

[02:59:49.098 --> 02:59:51.759]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.365 --> 03:00:01.387]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:20.586 --> 03:00:25.129]  Alright, Dr. Steve Pachanek is our guest best-selling author, works at the State Department and other agencies.
[03:00:25.129 --> 03:00:26.510]  Just a great source of info.
[03:00:26.510 --> 03:00:32.594]  Different respects, you may not totally agree with all of it, but it's always thought-provoking and it ends up being pretty accurate down the road.
[03:00:32.594 --> 03:00:37.597]  We just went to break, and I was asking the question, then my daughter called me.
[03:00:37.597 --> 03:00:41.239]  I guess they were off school today, about to come home, and she was wanting something.
[03:00:41.239 --> 03:00:42.820]  I remember, why was I saying hold over?
[03:00:42.820 --> 03:00:44.722]  What was the question, Dr. Pachanek, I got you to hold over for?
[03:00:45.879 --> 03:00:50.583]  The issue was Mueller and you said, will Mueller indict Trump and is he dangerous?
[03:00:50.583 --> 03:00:51.864]  The answer is no.
[03:00:51.864 --> 03:00:55.767]  What happened, and I've said it for a year or so, and most people didn't pick it up.
[03:00:56.394 --> 03:01:01.139]  I said, I think Mueller is making amends for what he participated in 9-11.
[03:01:01.139 --> 03:01:03.121]  Mueller comes out of St.
[03:01:03.121 --> 03:01:03.922]  Paul's.
[03:01:03.922 --> 03:01:08.527]  He was really a war hero in Vietnam and he got co-opted by the Bushes.
[03:01:08.527 --> 03:01:17.977]  I think what's happening now is Mueller's working with Trump, quite frankly, and he's... I heard this months ago from SG Silver Bull and all those guys and more and more.
[03:01:17.977 --> 03:01:19.038]  Could that actually be happening?
[03:01:19.830 --> 03:01:27.213]  Yes, because Mueller can do the one thing that Trump can't do within his own family, and that is to fire Jared Kushner.
[03:01:27.213 --> 03:01:42.259]  Although Trump himself has been very annoyed with this young man... By the way, I never... I want you to finish, but I never believed that until the indictment came out, and it's a bunch of Russians getting funded by Soros and stuff to manipulate the election, which we knew really went on.
[03:01:42.259 --> 03:01:45.340]  Not Russia itself, but people using Russian companies.
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:48.762]  So when I saw that, I thought, is Mueller actually really been turned back to Trump?
[03:01:49.881 --> 03:01:50.922]  Yeah.
[03:01:50.922 --> 03:01:54.044]  Mueller is more interested, not so much in the Russian affairs.
[03:01:54.044 --> 03:01:55.505]  That's just, I think, a cover.
[03:01:55.505 --> 03:02:01.049]  What he's really going after is Manafort, who we talked about, I said a year and a half ago, get rid of him.
[03:02:01.049 --> 03:02:02.070]  He was corrupt.
[03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:03.411]  He's corrupt.
[03:02:03.411 --> 03:02:06.093]  Kushner is the equal corruption to Manafort.
[03:02:06.093 --> 03:02:08.194]  Kushner brought in Manafort.
[03:02:08.194 --> 03:02:09.115]  Equally corrupt.
[03:02:09.115 --> 03:02:11.156]  And this is more than just the Russian.
[03:02:11.156 --> 03:02:14.319]  The Chinese control 666 Fifth Avenue.
[03:02:14.319 --> 03:02:15.820]  That's what you said a year and a half ago.
[03:02:15.820 --> 03:02:18.522]  That's what they're looking at Kushner for, is the Chinese money.
[03:02:19.594 --> 03:02:22.135]  And not only Chinese money, but Israeli money.
[03:02:22.135 --> 03:02:31.140]  The money that comes from Bank Lumi is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and he has a major loan, as he quote, is our diplomat to the Middle East.
[03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:36.882]  He also has major loans from an Israeli loan company, which he hadn't identified.
[03:02:36.882 --> 03:02:38.283]  He has other major loans.
[03:02:38.283 --> 03:02:41.024]  He's had bankruptcy in his paper.
[03:02:41.024 --> 03:02:42.825]  He is a total disaster.
[03:02:42.825 --> 03:02:44.206]  I said from day one, this was
[03:02:44.206 --> 03:02:54.451]  He was a stupid, incompetent, corrupt individual who mirrors very much what his father was, who was indicted and convicted and went to jail under Christie.
[03:02:54.451 --> 03:03:02.294]  Now trust me, in a corrupt state like New Jersey, for his father to go to a corrupt prison, you have to be exceedingly corrupt.
[03:03:02.294 --> 03:03:04.195]  And that's corrupt Kushner.
[03:03:04.195 --> 03:03:05.696]  And Trump knows that.
[03:03:05.696 --> 03:03:07.177]  And he has to get rid of him.
[03:03:07.177 --> 03:03:10.118]  Then why in Hades would he bring him into the center of the White House?
[03:03:10.816 --> 03:03:12.858]  Because he has a daughter.
[03:03:12.858 --> 03:03:13.880]  You have a daughter.
[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:27.456]  If your daughter asks something, and he thinks the world of his daughter, and he sent her out to South Korea... I love my daughters, but if they... I mean, if they had some son buying buildings called 666 for three times what they were worth, I'd say he was married to a moron.
[03:03:28.413 --> 03:03:30.395]  Well, what can I tell you?
[03:03:30.395 --> 03:03:32.737]  I can't get involved in their private relationship.
[03:03:32.737 --> 03:03:33.998]  No, I don't even hate Kushner.
[03:03:33.998 --> 03:03:35.599]  The point is I don't even dislike him.
[03:03:35.599 --> 03:03:37.100]  I didn't really know because he never talks.
[03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:39.502]  I don't know if he's good or bad or what's going on.
[03:03:39.502 --> 03:03:41.084]  I don't wish any harm upon him.
[03:03:41.084 --> 03:03:43.286]  And I mean, you know, getting loans for your buildings, whatever.
[03:03:43.286 --> 03:03:44.607]  He's not running the government.
[03:03:44.607 --> 03:03:48.810]  I don't think there's an issue of him getting Chinese money unless he's in the White House.
[03:03:48.810 --> 03:03:51.893]  I mean, who cares who helps you buy a building as long as you're not in the government, right?
[03:03:52.481 --> 03:03:53.442]  Well, that's correct.
[03:03:53.442 --> 03:03:54.643]  But that's not the issue.
[03:03:54.643 --> 03:03:58.846]  He's been going into negotiations with Russians who owe him money.
[03:03:58.846 --> 03:04:03.389]  He's been going into negotiation in Israel and picked out the most corrupt of all leaders.
[03:04:03.389 --> 03:04:05.230]  And I've said it before, Bibi.
[03:04:05.230 --> 03:04:06.191]  I've said it for years.
[03:04:06.191 --> 03:04:07.972]  Bibi has to leave Israel.
[03:04:07.972 --> 03:04:09.353]  There's no question about it.
[03:04:09.353 --> 03:04:16.899]  Bibi is so corrupt that their own police department has already indicted him for several hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:04:16.899 --> 03:04:18.140]  And Bibi is on the verge
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:21.983]  Well, I don't know all the, you know, internal war battles that go on and all this stuff.
[03:04:21.983 --> 03:04:26.947]  I just know that the President's moving the country forward, and I don't really see the corruptions.
[03:04:26.947 --> 03:04:31.110]  I just think he ought to leave the whole thing alone, but whatever.
[03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:32.231]  We'll see what happens.
[03:04:32.231 --> 03:04:32.631]  It's crazy.
[03:04:32.631 --> 03:04:33.432]  Thank you, Dr. Puccini.
[03:04:33.432 --> 03:04:34.132]  Appreciate you.
[03:04:47.482 --> 03:04:49.563]  We got the Military Arms Channel coming on.
[03:04:49.563 --> 03:04:50.764]  They got banned by YouTube.
[03:04:50.764 --> 03:04:52.105]  Now it's been reinstated.
[03:04:52.105 --> 03:04:54.946]  Why is this happening?

[03:06:08.792 --> 03:06:16.474]  We've got Tim Harmson of the Military Arms Channel on YouTube.
[03:06:16.474 --> 03:06:21.996]  We're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[03:06:21.996 --> 03:06:27.218]  The reason we've got him on is that all the thousands of
[03:06:35.154 --> 03:06:41.616]  YouTube accounts of libertarians, conservatives, sites like his that have hundreds of millions of views.
[03:06:41.616 --> 03:06:47.057]  This is just one we've picked out, because I've watched some of the videos and know who he is, to just have on.
[03:06:47.057 --> 03:06:48.617]  A lot of listeners are really mad at us.
[03:06:48.617 --> 03:06:50.798]  They're like, my site got taken down, my thing.
[03:06:50.798 --> 03:06:54.179]  I can't even, in all the hours of the day, keep track of what's going on.
[03:06:54.179 --> 03:06:55.779]  So I apologize.
[03:06:55.779 --> 03:06:57.580]  Yes, I know a lot of you got purged.
[03:06:57.580 --> 03:06:59.080]  Christians are getting purged off Facebook.
[03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:01.781]  Veterans groups are getting purged off everything.
[03:07:01.781 --> 03:07:07.225]  Christian groups, gun owner groups, Second Amendment groups, 4-H shooting clubs.
[03:07:07.225 --> 03:07:09.867]  I mean, I can't even keep track of this, okay?
[03:07:09.867 --> 03:07:16.931]  So, believe me, just because I'm not talking about your channel and you're sending me emails, it's thousands.
[03:07:16.931 --> 03:07:20.173]  Because I've seen hundreds.
[03:07:20.173 --> 03:07:24.296]  I look at articles on our website and a lot of the videos are dead because so many sites we link to are gone.
[03:07:25.558 --> 03:07:28.479]  So I can't keep track of how many fish there are in the sea.
[03:07:28.479 --> 03:07:30.140]  What we do know is this attack happened.
[03:07:30.140 --> 03:07:32.821]  We know it's taken place.
[03:07:32.821 --> 03:07:35.442]  And we know they lied about what we were saying and doing to do it.
[03:07:35.442 --> 03:07:37.343]  Said we were bullying children and said nobody died.
[03:07:37.343 --> 03:07:40.605]  Well, that's our right to do even if it's bull, but we didn't do that.
[03:07:40.605 --> 03:07:43.506]  So now Bloomberg comes out two days ago and goes, they apologize.
[03:07:43.506 --> 03:07:47.348]  YouTube says that they hurt 10,000 people and they mistakenly flagged stuff that wasn't
[03:07:50.243 --> 03:07:52.244]  Wasn't hateful or wasn't bullying.
[03:07:52.244 --> 03:07:59.189]  But it all started last Friday when CNN said they were advising YouTube employees on what to take down.
[03:07:59.189 --> 03:08:01.371]  That's some really unfair business practices.
[03:08:01.371 --> 03:08:03.012]  That's sabotage.
[03:08:03.012 --> 03:08:11.098]  If you've got a hamburger place and I call regulators and I'm there with the regulators saying, see there's still milk on the malt machine, shut them down.
[03:08:11.098 --> 03:08:15.541]  And then across the street, I've got two foot long cockroaches bigger than chihuahuas.
[03:08:15.541 --> 03:08:17.583]  And I mean, that's basically what's going on here.
[03:08:18.163 --> 03:08:26.731]  You've got the leftist YouTubers saying, kill president, kill me, kill the NRA, burn Dana Loesch, murder everybody, kill Scalise, and that's all fine.
[03:08:26.731 --> 03:08:32.837]  And we're just up there going, oh, it was a police stand down, and look at all these eyewitnesses saying two shooters, and they banned that and then said something else.
[03:08:32.837 --> 03:08:33.598]  So he popped in.
[03:08:33.598 --> 03:08:40.605]  I appreciate Tim joining us from the Military Arms Channel on YouTube.
[03:08:40.605 --> 03:08:41.346]  It's back for now.
[03:08:42.677 --> 03:08:44.217]  You click the about there and read all about it.
[03:08:44.217 --> 03:08:46.798]  They've got 680,000 subscribers.
[03:08:46.798 --> 03:08:48.098]  Massive views.
[03:08:48.098 --> 03:08:49.619]  And they just review guns.
[03:08:49.619 --> 03:08:50.619]  They just do basic stuff.
[03:08:50.619 --> 03:08:51.699]  People like it.
[03:08:51.699 --> 03:08:52.860]  And, you know, we have a right to guns.
[03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:54.100]  We have a right to watch people with guns.
[03:08:54.100 --> 03:08:55.160]  Look at Hollywood.
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:56.281]  Shows how to misuse guns.
[03:08:56.281 --> 03:08:57.001]  But they're okay.
[03:08:57.001 --> 03:09:00.322]  Nobody's saying... Imagine walking into a movie theater that shows guns being shot.
[03:09:00.322 --> 03:09:02.642]  You know, some stupid Arnold Schwarzenegger movie or whatever.
[03:09:02.642 --> 03:09:05.783]  Like, I demand this movie be shut down for hate!
[03:09:05.783 --> 03:09:06.783]  They're showing guns!
[03:09:06.783 --> 03:09:08.564]  This is showing how to properly use a gun.
[03:09:09.204 --> 03:09:11.505]  Think about the magnitude of this censorship.
[03:09:11.505 --> 03:09:20.570]  So he joins us for the seven minutes we have, because I've commandeered the time here from the great Joel Gilbert, who's coming up in a moment, normally hosts this hour on Friday.
[03:09:20.570 --> 03:09:21.631]  What is your take on this?
[03:09:21.631 --> 03:09:23.032]  Why do you think it happened?
[03:09:23.032 --> 03:09:27.374]  And then some of our channels that got restored, they didn't even say that we won our appeal.
[03:09:27.374 --> 03:09:28.895]  They just restored them.
[03:09:28.895 --> 03:09:29.816]  This is a big deal.
[03:09:29.816 --> 03:09:34.999]  It sounds like a mutiny happened of leftists at Google, like an internal hack or something.
[03:09:34.999 --> 03:09:35.559]  This is crazy.
[03:09:36.826 --> 03:09:54.651]  Yeah, you know what Alex, it's kind of hard to kind of figure out what exactly is going on because Google is so tight-lipped, but what we do know is because they've actually admitted to it publicly, is that they have targeted conservative speech, and they have targeted firearms channels, and that's of course where my domain is.
[03:09:54.651 --> 03:09:55.992]  I just talk about firearms.
[03:09:56.892 --> 03:09:58.333]  I don't even really review firearms.
[03:09:58.333 --> 03:10:05.757]  I just take them out and show historic firearms, shoot them, have fun, and show the safe, responsible use of firearms, but I'm constantly being targeted by YouTube.
[03:10:05.757 --> 03:10:08.178]  But I'm also quite politically active.
[03:10:08.178 --> 03:10:11.520]  Whenever our Second Amendment rights come under attack, I go political.
[03:10:11.520 --> 03:10:16.003]  I go political on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, pretty much all of my social media outlets.
[03:10:16.623 --> 03:10:30.841]  But in this instance, I read an article that Google had contracted with the Southern Poverty Law Center to hire 10,000 moderators to go through and clean up the hate speech, or what they're calling the fake news.
[03:10:30.841 --> 03:10:32.783]  And somehow we got caught up in this web.
[03:10:34.142 --> 03:10:46.346]  It's really unclear if it's a coordinated attack by Moms Demand Action and Everytown Matters because we do know that these guys have private Facebook groups and they coordinate attacks against us on Facebook to try to get our pages taken down.
[03:10:46.346 --> 03:10:48.307]  We've caught them doing it multiple times.
[03:10:48.307 --> 03:10:50.248]  Is that what's happening here at YouTube?
[03:10:50.248 --> 03:10:59.271]  We don't know, but what I can tell you is 48 hours ago, my channel was one strike away from being completely shut down.
[03:10:59.271 --> 03:11:01.632]  And so I went in through my account, my network rep,
[03:11:02.252 --> 03:11:07.636]  And disabled every single video on my channel and released one video saying, guys, this is what's happening.
[03:11:07.636 --> 03:11:10.098]  YouTube is targeting gun channels right now.
[03:11:10.098 --> 03:11:11.498]  And this was over a weekend.
[03:11:11.498 --> 03:11:14.661]  There was nobody at YouTube we could contact to try to get it resolved.
[03:11:14.661 --> 03:11:19.964]  And it took me until 48 hours ago to get those account strikes lifted.
[03:11:19.964 --> 03:11:21.545]  I had one night of peace.
[03:11:21.545 --> 03:11:31.612]  I wake up the next morning and I have that pink page of death that says, you've been given account strikes again on the exact same videos they just lifted the strikes against.
[03:11:32.501 --> 03:11:35.284]  And so it's kind of amazing.
[03:11:35.284 --> 03:11:39.529]  It has to be coming from within YouTube to a degree.
[03:11:39.529 --> 03:11:44.434]  And I say this because when I got my first account strike, I immediately disabled all my videos.
[03:11:44.434 --> 03:11:49.119]  The only people that could see my videos at that point were myself and YouTube.
[03:11:49.119 --> 03:11:52.243]  Even if you had a link to one of my disabled videos, you could not view it.
[03:11:52.703 --> 03:11:59.690]  Tim, if you read the Bloomberg articles, it says they hired them and YouTube said it was mistakenly done by their employees.
[03:11:59.690 --> 03:12:03.974]  But the truth is, they're just ignoring the brass, hoping they don't notice.
[03:12:03.974 --> 03:12:05.615]  That's why this is mutiny.
[03:12:05.615 --> 03:12:06.736]  This is big news.
[03:12:06.736 --> 03:12:12.462]  Because I understand from on top, Google wants to quietly censor everybody and kind of restrict this and play games.
[03:12:12.462 --> 03:12:17.627]  But I'm saying they've gotten overzealous, jumped the shark, and that's now blown their whole operation wide open.
[03:12:18.737 --> 03:12:22.322]  It has, and not only that, they say that they're fixing it, but they're not.
[03:12:22.322 --> 03:12:28.831]  I mean, they fixed it for me for 48 hours, they go right back and strike my account again, and now I'm fighting again for my very existence on YouTube.
[03:12:28.831 --> 03:12:31.294]  And this is how I make a living, right?
[03:12:31.294 --> 03:12:32.796]  And that's how a lot of us make livings.
[03:12:33.677 --> 03:12:34.117]  We're good to go.
[03:12:55.683 --> 03:12:56.263]  Yeah, it is.
[03:12:56.263 --> 03:12:59.845]  I mean, really, you touched on a very key point there.
[03:12:59.845 --> 03:13:02.387]  We all have signed the same agreement with YouTube.
[03:13:02.387 --> 03:13:04.988]  Millions of us all have the same contract with YouTube.
[03:13:04.988 --> 03:13:05.789]  But for some reason,
[03:13:06.576 --> 03:13:08.758]  Different groups are treated differently, right?
[03:13:08.758 --> 03:13:35.115]  Uh, Prager University has a lawsuit against them right now because, um, they're a conservative think tank, and their videos are being struck and removed, but then on the other side of the house, you have the liberal point of view, the exact same commentary about the exact same subject, yet their videos aren't being- YouTube leaves up videos of two-year-olds giving transvestite men money at strip clubs in-in b-bizarre stuff, and then Prager University is completely milquetoast and scientific and totally polite, and they were banning them.
[03:13:35.115 --> 03:13:35.575]  Exactly.
[03:13:35.575 --> 03:13:36.296]  It's crazy.
[03:13:37.397 --> 03:13:37.797]  It is.
[03:13:37.797 --> 03:13:39.678]  It's all politically motivated.
[03:13:39.678 --> 03:13:41.399]  I mean, we know that.
[03:13:41.399 --> 03:13:42.840]  And they've admitted as much.
[03:13:42.840 --> 03:13:55.849]  And if you go and look at the Chief Business Officer, one of the executives, he recently did an interview with another large YouTuber, and he is from the Czech Republic, I forget his name, but he said that there's four core principles that YouTube lives by.
[03:13:55.849 --> 03:14:00.472]  Freedom of speech, freedom of community, and freedom for everybody to be treated equally and to earn a living.
[03:14:00.472 --> 03:14:00.692]  Really?
[03:14:01.492 --> 03:14:05.516]  Then why is it for the last two years I've been fighting for my very existence on YouTube?
[03:14:05.516 --> 03:14:07.498]  This isn't the first time this has happened, Alex.
[03:14:07.498 --> 03:14:08.759]  They constantly harass us.
[03:14:08.759 --> 03:14:10.121]  They demonetize us.
[03:14:10.121 --> 03:14:13.103]  Every video we upload, they won't monetize us.
[03:14:13.103 --> 03:14:15.325]  We went through the whole adpocalypse right now.
[03:14:15.325 --> 03:14:17.728]  We've had 70% of our revenue taken away.
[03:14:17.728 --> 03:14:19.129]  Some claim 90%.
[03:14:19.129 --> 03:14:20.050]  And it's never come back.
[03:14:20.510 --> 03:14:25.334]  Yeah, they did 96% on us for a while, and then it hurt them so bad they went back to like 70.
[03:14:25.334 --> 03:14:29.817]  Absolutely, this is what they're doing, and you're totally on target.
[03:14:29.817 --> 03:14:32.058]  So, why do you think they had to reverse?
[03:14:32.058 --> 03:14:35.621]  Because it became a big national issue with drugs exposing it and things?
[03:14:35.621 --> 03:14:36.121]  I think so.
[03:14:36.121 --> 03:14:38.563]  I think, you know, of course I have my own law of filing.
[03:14:38.563 --> 03:14:41.405]  The firearms community as a whole is very vocal.
[03:14:41.405 --> 03:14:42.746]  So everybody got pissed off.
[03:14:43.553 --> 03:14:55.446]  Right, and I even told my followers, here's the phone number, here's the email address, blow up their phone lines, blow up their inbox, and we pressure Google and then they have to come out and say, oops guys, sorry, we made a mistake, but then they turn right around and do it again.
[03:14:55.446 --> 03:14:57.969]  Tim, don't we need to start demonstrating?
[03:14:57.969 --> 03:15:01.373]  I think we need to have on-the-street demonstrations against Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[03:15:02.638 --> 03:15:03.339]  I think so.
[03:15:03.339 --> 03:15:09.563]  I think it's time that we start applying pressure to them because we can't just sit silently by when they treat us differently.
[03:15:09.563 --> 03:15:11.925]  And you point out a very key point, Alex.
[03:15:11.925 --> 03:15:22.652]  We have a contract that we're all working under, but legally, how can you treat one party differently than the other when you have the exact same verbiage and you've all agreed to the exact same terms of use and community guidelines?
[03:15:23.112 --> 03:15:27.620]  Why are you targeting one group and discriminating against them, yet saying this is okay?
[03:15:27.620 --> 03:15:34.211]  My six-year-old son can get on Google and type in, um, putting on a condom, and it's just straight-up pornography, and that's allowed on Google.
[03:15:34.211 --> 03:15:34.752]  On YouTube.
[03:15:35.937 --> 03:15:36.938]  It's unbelievable.
[03:15:53.513 --> 03:15:54.314]  This is Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.314 --> 03:15:56.135]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?

[03:17:22.791 --> 03:17:23.992]  Hear that?
[03:17:23.992 --> 03:17:29.395]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:17:29.395 --> 03:17:32.297]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[03:20:07.992 --> 03:20:11.655]  Joel Gilbert is about to take over.
[03:20:11.655 --> 03:20:26.888]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[03:20:26.888 --> 03:20:29.511]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:33.559 --> 03:20:38.141]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[03:20:38.141 --> 03:20:39.782]  We are the dealers!
[03:20:39.782 --> 03:20:43.363]  We'll give you everything you need!
[03:20:43.363 --> 03:20:43.803]  Woo!
[03:20:43.803 --> 03:20:47.365]  Welcome back.
[03:20:48.860 --> 03:20:51.201]  All right, Joel knows we host the 4th Hour on Fridays.
[03:20:51.201 --> 03:20:59.344]  He does a fabulous job, great production, great material, great research, great mind, great filmmaker, that we commandeer sometimes in emergencies, and we've done that today.
[03:20:59.344 --> 03:21:01.605]  He's welcome to come back during the War Room and catch up on the time, too.
[03:21:01.605 --> 03:21:02.786]  He's about to take over in about two minutes.
[03:21:02.786 --> 03:21:08.668]  He's got a big guest coming up as well, but we're in the middle of the, I keep saying 24, 36, I'm telephoning for free.
[03:21:08.668 --> 03:21:17.251]  It's a 34-hour broadcast, and there is three and a half hours roughly left, three hours and 39 minutes or however it works.
[03:21:17.251 --> 03:21:18.252]  The point is, is that
[03:21:19.406 --> 03:21:26.190]  We are in the middle of a free speech emergency transmission that I set up to do last week, because I knew this stuff was coming, and here we are.
[03:21:26.190 --> 03:21:28.211]  It has gotten crazy.
[03:21:28.211 --> 03:21:35.055]  With YouTube channels up, YouTube channels down, thousands of them deleted, Facebook, Twitter, huge Christian channels being banned everywhere.
[03:21:37.153 --> 03:21:40.134]  You were in front of each other earlier, and he's usually more optimistic.
[03:21:40.134 --> 03:21:40.635]  He agreed.
[03:21:40.635 --> 03:21:42.896]  He said, this is 50 times anything we've ever seen.
[03:21:42.896 --> 03:21:48.218]  I mean, this is a bonkers purge, and you better believe it goes with other stuff they're planning.
[03:21:48.218 --> 03:21:51.299]  So I want to get Gilbert's take on that, and he's going to take over.
[03:21:51.299 --> 03:21:58.723]  Just remember, you're the reason we can weather the storm like a seawall or like a lighthouse out there in the storm.
[03:21:58.723 --> 03:22:01.184]  With the waves coming in, you are what strengthens us.
[03:22:01.184 --> 03:22:02.704]  You're what makes us a big steel
[03:22:04.821 --> 03:22:06.362]  You're the steel pillar in that fight.
[03:22:06.362 --> 03:22:07.723]  You are what renews us.
[03:22:07.723 --> 03:22:09.445]  You're the only reason we're here.
[03:22:09.445 --> 03:22:11.346]  The great guests, the research, all of it.
[03:22:11.346 --> 03:22:13.008]  So don't ever call and thank me.
[03:22:13.008 --> 03:22:15.750]  The listeners have finally gotten this and are stopping thanking me.
[03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:19.233]  Because it's obscene.
[03:22:19.233 --> 03:22:21.415]  We're going to be totally enslaved if we don't fight these people.
[03:22:21.415 --> 03:22:22.276]  This is authoritarianism.
[03:22:22.276 --> 03:22:23.757]  This is survival.
[03:22:23.757 --> 03:22:29.962]  If my house is on fire and I was running out with my kids, don't run up and say, oh man, you guys are so brave.
[03:22:29.962 --> 03:22:31.323]  I'm so brave.
[03:22:31.323 --> 03:22:31.844]  It's not...
[03:22:33.152 --> 03:22:35.373]  Brave to fight for your life.
[03:22:35.373 --> 03:22:49.358]  And I keep saying that because we have to get a mindset where it's not a Joel Gilbert and it's not a Ron Paul or it's not a Donald Trump or it's not a Matt Drudge or a Joseph Farah or whoever, Sean Hannity, anybody that's speaking up for basic freedom.
[03:22:49.358 --> 03:22:52.520]  It's not like, oh, it's just us that are doing it and thank God we're there.
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:55.621]  We're this close to total victory and this close to total defeat.
[03:22:56.707 --> 03:22:59.189]  And so, you got free shipping store-wide.
[03:22:59.189 --> 03:23:00.950]  People love those big sales.
[03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:03.151]  Our products are only 100% marked up.
[03:23:03.151 --> 03:23:06.533]  So when we do 30% off, we're making 20%.
[03:23:06.533 --> 03:23:10.476]  When we do 80%, it's a lost leader.
[03:23:10.476 --> 03:23:12.197]  And by the way, I'm proud of all the stuff we've got.
[03:23:12.197 --> 03:23:13.097]  We've never done 80% off.
[03:23:13.097 --> 03:23:15.539]  We've got some things, thousands of shirts and things.
[03:23:15.539 --> 03:23:19.121]  We've ordered so many shirts that for some reason we didn't promote or weren't put on the right page.
[03:23:19.121 --> 03:23:20.602]  People didn't see.
[03:23:20.602 --> 03:23:24.945]  Here's more than 20 awesome shirts in there and ball caps, you name it, that are very limited edition.
[03:23:26.505 --> 03:23:30.548]  In many cases, and that are 80% off.
[03:23:30.548 --> 03:23:35.272]  That means, you know, if a shirt cost us $5, $6, we're selling it for $20.
[03:23:35.272 --> 03:23:36.473]  At 80% off, you're getting it below cost.
[03:23:36.473 --> 03:23:37.133]  These are great shirts.
[03:23:37.133 --> 03:23:37.694]  So look at that.
[03:23:38.766 --> 03:23:44.831]  But we got a lot of stuff that flies off the shelves, like Supramel Vitality, Supra Female Vitality, 50% off, that is a rarity.
[03:23:44.831 --> 03:23:47.012]  Pollen Block, it was sold out, now back in stock.
[03:23:47.012 --> 03:23:50.615]  Amazing, found out why it's so unique and so documented.
[03:23:50.615 --> 03:23:52.697]  Pollen Block's 50% off.
[03:23:52.697 --> 03:23:53.937]  Immune Wall, 50% off.

[03:24:11.310 --> 03:24:12.351]  We really appreciate everybody.
[03:24:12.351 --> 03:24:20.957]  We want to thank you for all that you've done and just want to ask you to continue to realize we got products you need that fund the revolution against the globalists.
[03:24:20.957 --> 03:24:22.758]  It is a total 360 win.
[03:24:22.758 --> 03:24:24.980]  So, you look at all those thousands of five-star reviews.
[03:24:24.980 --> 03:24:27.762]  No prebiotic reviews yet because it just came out this week.
[03:24:27.762 --> 03:24:30.144]  Okay, Joel, thanks for letting me crash in on this hour.
[03:24:30.144 --> 03:24:31.765]  I know you've always got a lot of great
[03:24:32.245 --> 03:24:36.186]  I'm going to eat my lunch here while I watch you.
[03:24:36.186 --> 03:24:39.447]  Thank you so much, and please take over.
[03:24:39.447 --> 03:24:41.788]  Okay, thank you so much, Alex.
[03:24:41.788 --> 03:24:47.050]  Look, what you're talking about, of course, is not a deep state.
[03:24:47.050 --> 03:24:49.891]  The term deep state badly missed the mark.
[03:24:49.891 --> 03:24:52.912]  The conservative media used the term deep state.
[03:24:52.912 --> 03:24:55.692]  The reality is police state.
[03:24:55.692 --> 03:25:00.554]  Deep state simply means an entrenched bureaucracy, self-serving people that are opposed to change.
[03:25:01.292 --> 03:25:09.197]  And the dark reality that was a subversion of democracy that Obama set in place from the get-go is a police state.
[03:25:09.197 --> 03:25:11.939]  And we see it being done by his minions.
[03:25:11.939 --> 03:25:16.401]  I want to define for you the proper term, by the way.
[03:25:16.401 --> 03:25:28.569]  The definition of a police state is, I'm going to read it to you, the inhabitants of a police state experience restrictions on their freedom of expression to communicate their political views and are subject to monitoring and enforcement.
[03:25:29.255 --> 03:25:36.657]  Political control may be exerted by a secret force that operates outside the boundaries of the normal constitutional state.
[03:25:36.657 --> 03:25:44.018]  So we experienced that from Barack Obama in 2012 when they interfered in the election with the IRS.
[03:25:44.018 --> 03:25:50.439]  We experienced it, of course, with the DOJ and FBI interfering in the 2016 election.
[03:25:50.439 --> 03:25:56.901]  And we're experiencing it these days with their minions in YouTube and the people that control the means of expression.
[03:25:58.467 --> 03:26:01.570]  Preventing conservatives from communicating.
[03:26:01.570 --> 03:26:08.456]  The deep state is a police state apparatus, and that is the sad reality.
[03:26:08.456 --> 03:26:17.965]  Had Hillary Clinton won, the United States would have been finished, and we would have had a permanent police state, and we're still fighting against it as we speak.
[03:26:18.585 --> 03:26:19.585]  Joel, I've got to interrupt.
[03:26:19.585 --> 03:26:20.186]  I was about to leave.
[03:26:20.186 --> 03:26:21.106]  This is so profound.
[03:26:21.106 --> 03:26:22.006]  You're right.
[03:26:22.006 --> 03:26:26.027]  Deep State's the old COG for an emergency nuclear war type deal.
[03:26:26.027 --> 03:26:31.409]  It's police state entrenched in a deep state structure that are trying to bully us into submission.
[03:26:31.409 --> 03:26:36.271]  And they always spin, when I talk about a police state under Clinton and others, that I was anti-police.
[03:26:36.271 --> 03:26:41.452]  No, a police state means a tyranny controlling your speech, controlling your mood, but controlling your life.
[03:26:41.452 --> 03:26:47.534]  And that's what the big corporations and combines and the leftist mobs and Antifa and Black Lives Matter are.
[03:26:48.114 --> 03:26:49.894]  That's correct.
[03:26:49.894 --> 03:27:00.976]  The deep state term, I think we need to throw it out.
[03:27:00.976 --> 03:27:07.458]  It really didn't describe what we're up against and we saw it in the last few days how all these YouTube channels were subverted.
[03:27:07.458 --> 03:27:14.919]  There's a nexus between the police state and their economic interests like Google, YouTube, Amazon, Washington Post.
[03:27:15.639 --> 03:27:20.462]  And they're trying to impose their will on freedom of speech, freedom of movement.
[03:27:20.462 --> 03:27:22.783]  And all we can do is keep fighting back.
[03:27:22.783 --> 03:27:27.786]  I think we won the war the last few days, but it's something that constantly has to be vigilant about.
[03:27:27.786 --> 03:27:28.846]  It's who wants it the most.
[03:27:28.846 --> 03:27:31.728]  We won this battle so far, you know they're going to hit again.
[03:27:33.135 --> 03:27:35.197]  You know, they're coming back.
[03:27:35.197 --> 03:27:36.117]  It's just constant.
[03:27:36.117 --> 03:27:37.919]  I mean, I'm here in Southern California.
[03:27:37.919 --> 03:27:48.586]  I'm looking out at the Reagan library from my window, and I always remember those profound words of Ronald Reagan that tyranny is only one generation away.
[03:27:48.586 --> 03:27:49.647]  You have to be vigilant.
[03:27:50.334 --> 03:27:52.615]  And unfortunately, these people will never stop.
[03:27:52.615 --> 03:28:04.418]  They're always coming back with new excuses, new schemes, new terminology to prevent the Constitutional Republic from thriving and existing.
[03:28:04.418 --> 03:28:07.758]  I'm going to talk about that more as we get into my segment.
[03:28:07.758 --> 03:28:09.959]  Well, I almost wish I wouldn't have commandeered that earlier segment.
[03:28:09.959 --> 03:28:13.200]  It was important to have some of the people that have been banned on.
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:15.300]  Why do you think they've backed off so far?
[03:28:15.300 --> 03:28:18.161]  They say it's a mutiny, like their own people got too zealous.
[03:28:20.556 --> 03:28:21.238]  I think the
[03:28:22.463 --> 03:28:29.088]  Look, there's a there's a strong foundation of constitutional people in this country.
[03:28:29.088 --> 03:28:34.573]  There are people in the middle class is very strong and supports the free market system.
[03:28:34.573 --> 03:28:41.538]  And whenever they go too far and they think they've gone too far, they back off a bit because they've got so many schemes in their pocket.
[03:28:41.538 --> 03:28:43.580]  They're waiting to come back with the next one.
[03:28:43.580 --> 03:28:45.041]  So I think that's right.
[03:28:45.041 --> 03:28:45.701]  They're testing.
[03:28:45.701 --> 03:28:47.883]  And when we and we fight, they back off like guerrilla.
[03:28:47.883 --> 03:28:50.265]  We'll be right back with Joel Gilbert.
[03:28:50.265 --> 03:28:50.785]  Stay with us.
[03:28:50.785 --> 03:28:51.446]  Riveting Intel.
[03:28:52.591 --> 03:28:53.491]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:28:53.491 --> 03:28:55.912]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:28:55.912 --> 03:29:04.035]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[03:29:04.035 --> 03:29:05.976]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[03:29:05.976 --> 03:29:09.677]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[03:29:18.860 --> 03:29:19.500]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:29:22.452 --> 03:29:27.573]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:29:27.573 --> 03:29:33.274]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:29:33.274 --> 03:29:38.475]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[03:29:40.436 --> 03:29:42.796]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[03:29:42.796 --> 03:29:43.756]  See guidelines.
[03:29:43.756 --> 03:29:47.037]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[03:29:47.037 --> 03:29:48.997]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[03:29:48.997 --> 03:29:50.538]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[03:29:53.680 --> 03:30:02.226]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:30:02.226 --> 03:30:06.809]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:30:06.809 --> 03:30:09.931]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:30:09.931 --> 03:30:13.053]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:30:14.557 --> 03:30:27.380]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:30:27.380 --> 03:30:42.443]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[03:30:53.328 --> 03:31:00.852]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:31:02.472 --> 03:31:13.298]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:31:13.298 --> 03:31:15.419]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:31:15.419 --> 03:31:19.141]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:19.141 --> 03:31:20.622]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[03:31:20.862 --> 03:31:26.666]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[03:31:26.666 --> 03:31:29.048]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:31:29.048 --> 03:31:34.491]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:31:34.491 --> 03:31:36.993]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:36.993 --> 03:31:46.179]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:31:46.179 --> 03:31:50.622]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:31:53.103 --> 03:31:57.505]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:31:57.505 --> 03:32:05.588]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:32:05.588 --> 03:32:10.891]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:32:10.891 --> 03:32:13.412]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:32:13.412 --> 03:32:17.634]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:32:17.634 --> 03:32:20.075]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:32:20.755 --> 03:32:27.999]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:32:27.999 --> 03:32:36.063]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:32:36.063 --> 03:32:43.246]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:32:43.246 --> 03:32:44.727]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[03:32:44.727 --> 03:32:46.528]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[03:32:57.625 --> 03:33:00.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.481 --> 03:33:16.069]  Welcome back to InfoWars, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.069 --> 03:33:21.593]  I'm Joel Gilbert, coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:33:34.605 --> 03:33:39.667]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones Store and get my new film, of course, Art of the Insult.
[03:33:39.667 --> 03:33:46.350]  You'll finally understand Trump, and you'll see his branding genius, and you'll laugh for 95 minutes.
[03:33:46.350 --> 03:33:50.271]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to have Kevin Jackson of the Black Sphere.
[03:33:50.271 --> 03:33:55.693]  You know him as a Fox News commentator, and he's going to give some insights.
[03:33:55.693 --> 03:34:01.736]  I want to first give you some of my takes about what's been happening the last couple weeks.
[03:34:01.736 --> 03:34:02.456]  The Parkland
[03:34:03.439 --> 03:34:04.019]  shootings.
[03:34:04.019 --> 03:34:08.202]  It's still all about the FBI and confidence in corruption.
[03:34:08.202 --> 03:34:12.085]  The FBI has been missing all these shooters, even though they had them under their fingertips.
[03:34:12.085 --> 03:34:22.691]  Dylan Roof, Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hassan, the Tsarnaev brothers, the Boston Marathon bombers, of course, the Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen.
[03:34:22.691 --> 03:34:25.813]  They investigated this guy for like two years.
[03:34:25.813 --> 03:34:26.974]  They said, oh, no problem.
[03:34:26.974 --> 03:34:28.515]  Just go about your business.
[03:34:29.341 --> 03:34:39.185]  Now, what are the odds that the FBI was not all over Steven Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, and that's why they cut off all the information?
[03:34:39.185 --> 03:34:40.425]  Because heads would have rolled.
[03:34:40.425 --> 03:34:45.627]  You think maybe the FBI is covering up something that they had a connection to Paddock?
[03:34:45.627 --> 03:34:46.647]  Where's the videotape?
[03:34:46.647 --> 03:34:48.348]  The hotel videotape?
[03:34:48.348 --> 03:34:50.629]  All the information was cut off.
[03:34:50.629 --> 03:34:56.251]  So the FBI still has the chutzpah to tell us, if you see something, say something.
[03:34:57.043 --> 03:35:00.125]  It's completely useless, completely irrelevant.
[03:35:00.125 --> 03:35:06.409]  The best slogan we can live by is be prepared to protect yourself.
[03:35:06.409 --> 03:35:10.972]  Have a weapon because the FBI or police are just going to wait outside.
[03:35:10.972 --> 03:35:14.955]  They're making a big deal about Parkland that four deputies waited outside.
[03:35:14.955 --> 03:35:23.561]  People forget that in the Pulse nightclub shooting, the entire SWAT team set up outside for three hours while everybody who had been shot bled to death.
[03:35:25.735 --> 03:35:28.036]  So, how would you like to live?
[03:35:28.036 --> 03:35:37.458]  Either have some people on the inside, like a school where there's a few teachers with weapons, or have the people with the weapons that are supposed to save you hanging out outside.
[03:35:37.458 --> 03:35:43.179]  I want to talk to you about the Parkland Promise Program.
[03:35:43.179 --> 03:35:47.880]  We're learning a lot about Broward County's very deadly Promise Program.
[03:35:49.026 --> 03:35:53.248]  Uh, this is why, uh, Nicholas Cruz was not arrested.
[03:35:53.248 --> 03:36:01.792]  Like so many other liberal social engineering projects, rather than saving the world, it is proving to be very deadly.
[03:36:01.792 --> 03:36:11.537]  Now, on the website, the Promise Program for Broward County calls for change and intervention, and it says they're not going to arrest teenagers for crimes.
[03:36:11.537 --> 03:36:18.380]  Essentially, they're whitewashing their behavior and sending them back to school and to the community to commit more crimes.
[03:36:19.065 --> 03:36:22.586]  Here's the quote from the Broward County Sheriff website.
[03:36:22.586 --> 03:36:23.606]  This is the promise.
[03:36:23.606 --> 03:36:28.508]  The promise is to safeguard the student from entering the judicial system.
[03:36:28.508 --> 03:36:29.708]  Well, well, well.
[03:36:29.708 --> 03:36:33.290]  What about safeguarding the public from the criminal?
[03:36:33.290 --> 03:36:34.150]  How did it work out?
[03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:36.491]  17 dead students.
[03:36:36.491 --> 03:36:38.931]  One is going to jail for life.
[03:36:38.931 --> 03:36:40.852]  What would have been better?
[03:36:40.852 --> 03:36:46.694]  Now, then there's a quote also on their website, eliminating the school to prison pipeline.
[03:36:47.498 --> 03:36:52.980]  Broward County is committed to keeping students engaged in school and out of the justice system.
[03:36:52.980 --> 03:36:53.781]  Well, how about this?
[03:36:53.781 --> 03:36:55.041]  Let's have a new slogan.
[03:36:55.041 --> 03:37:02.325]  We promise to let you commit as many crimes as you want until you or your classmates end up dead.
[03:37:02.325 --> 03:37:06.406]  That's the real promise they made to Nicholas Cruz and the community.
[03:37:06.406 --> 03:37:09.848]  That's how Trayvon Martin lost his life in a similar program.
[03:37:10.926 --> 03:37:13.727]  He was not held accountable for many crimes.
[03:37:13.727 --> 03:37:25.231]  They stopped arresting students, and it eventually led to the confrontation with George Zimmerman, where he had a weapon to defend himself, and Trayvon is dead because of these types of programs.
[03:37:25.231 --> 03:37:40.056]  So, the Promise Program, I want to give perspective, it's just the same social engineering by these utopian geniuses, these big thinkers on the socialist part of the world that believe they know how human nature should be.
[03:37:41.239 --> 03:37:43.020]  Remember Mao Zedong?
[03:37:43.020 --> 03:37:47.361]  He said, we're going to put all these farmers in collective farms and they're going to produce more food.
[03:37:47.361 --> 03:37:48.981]  They're going to be happier.
[03:37:48.981 --> 03:37:52.422]  They just don't know it until we force them onto these farms.
[03:37:52.422 --> 03:37:53.762]  That caused the Great Famine.
[03:37:53.762 --> 03:37:57.443]  50 million Chinese people starved to death.
[03:37:57.443 --> 03:38:07.106]  Of course, here in America, in Detroit, the Democrats were controlling Detroit for 60 years, the greatest American city with all the jobs and great economy, industry.
[03:38:07.924 --> 03:38:09.525]  Mayor Coleman Young was a socialist.
[03:38:09.525 --> 03:38:16.289]  The idea was, let's raise taxes, put all these regulations on business, and it's going to work out just great.
[03:38:16.289 --> 03:38:21.571]  Well, all the businesses left, and Detroit turned into a disaster.
[03:38:21.571 --> 03:38:29.075]  So, with Nicholas Cruz, we know that he got expelled for having, quote, bullets in his backpack.
[03:38:29.075 --> 03:38:35.979]  Well, you think maybe he had a handgun, and they just downgraded it to bullets, so he wouldn't be arrested?
[03:38:35.979 --> 03:38:37.360]  I think that's probably what happened.
[03:38:38.055 --> 03:38:41.319]  Liberal social engineering is a disaster.
[03:38:41.319 --> 03:38:43.240]  It's always been a disaster.
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:44.061]  But they don't give up.
[03:38:44.061 --> 03:38:47.625]  They just say, well, it's going to work out great next time.
[03:38:47.625 --> 03:38:49.587]  You know the VA hospitals?
[03:38:49.587 --> 03:38:52.070]  Yeah, well, we're going to have the Affordable Care Act.
[03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:54.432]  You're going to save $5,000 per family.
[03:38:54.432 --> 03:38:58.196]  You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, and it's not going to work out like the VA.
[03:38:58.196 --> 03:38:59.217]  It's just going to be great.
[03:39:00.097 --> 03:39:08.663]  So, the bottom line is the socialist, liberalist ideologues, they actually know that none of this is going to work out.
[03:39:08.663 --> 03:39:10.224]  But they thrive on chaos.
[03:39:10.224 --> 03:39:19.530]  If everything is peaceful and good, if people go to church, they earn a good living, they love their country, there's no justification for radical change.
[03:39:19.530 --> 03:39:29.097]  They have to create this chaos through all these schemes so they can say, well give us the power, we'll fix the chaos that we created, and we'll make it right for you.
[03:39:30.058 --> 03:39:33.021]  And that's how evil some of these schemes are.
[03:39:33.021 --> 03:39:36.545]  They cause intentional harm, they know will cause damage.
[03:39:36.545 --> 03:39:44.612]  They would rather Nicholas Cruz not be arrested and say, let's say he's got bullets in his backpack, don't talk about the handgun.
[03:39:44.612 --> 03:39:51.399]  And they know that he'll create the chaos they can use one day to usurp the Constitutional Republic.
[03:39:51.399 --> 03:39:54.362]  I want to show a video from my film, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:39:55.111 --> 03:40:08.435]  It's called The Weight of the Poor, and it shows you how today's Democratic Party is trying to bring down the constitutional, traditional American republic and replace it with this socialist ideal.
[03:40:08.435 --> 03:40:17.178]  Can we roll that video?
[03:40:17.178 --> 03:40:23.380]  So here you've got communists trying to overburden the system.
[03:40:25.023 --> 03:40:26.283]  They use poor people.
[03:40:26.283 --> 03:40:29.144]  They use minorities.
[03:40:29.144 --> 03:40:36.045]  They want to create a system that can't be sustained.
[03:40:36.045 --> 03:40:40.706]  And by overburdening it, they want to collapse the system.
[03:40:40.706 --> 03:40:43.666]  This is the Cloward-Piven Theory.
[03:40:43.666 --> 03:40:45.347]  And they did it to New York in the 70s.
[03:40:45.347 --> 03:40:49.567]  They bankrupted New York with this process.
[03:40:49.567 --> 03:40:52.408]  The idea is if they can collapse the system, they can replace it.
[03:40:53.826 --> 03:41:04.715]  This perfect society, this perfect world.
[03:41:04.715 --> 03:41:09.879]  Now this is how you can see that the Democrat Party wants to sow chaos.
[03:41:09.879 --> 03:41:12.622]  They became a radical socialist party.
[03:41:12.622 --> 03:41:19.727]  Compared to the 1980s, the Democrats worked with Ronald Reagan to implement huge tax reform and tax cuts.
[03:41:19.727 --> 03:41:21.809]  Today, the Democrats, 100% together,
[03:41:23.934 --> 03:41:27.116]  They knew that if America succeeds, they will fail.
[03:41:27.116 --> 03:41:29.357]  So they all voted against the tax cuts.
[03:41:29.357 --> 03:41:33.340]  They know that if America works, that they lose power.
[03:41:33.340 --> 03:41:39.423]  So they're out to stop Donald Trump at all costs, even at the cost of their constituents.
[03:41:39.423 --> 03:41:51.050]  And that's why you see little Adam Schiff lying every day on TV about how Trump is going to be impeached and all these innuendos that he puts forth.
[03:41:51.050 --> 03:41:51.170]  So
[03:41:52.031 --> 03:41:53.793]  This is today's Democrat Party.
[03:41:53.793 --> 03:41:56.054]  It's stealth socialism.
[03:41:56.054 --> 03:42:00.538]  It's not the open calls for communism and destroying the Republic.
[03:42:00.538 --> 03:42:02.100]  They don't say we want to kill you anymore.
[03:42:02.100 --> 03:42:04.081]  They say we want to help you.
[03:42:04.081 --> 03:42:16.472]  And the way we're going to help you is by taking away all your rights and making the promise program for Nicholas Cruz so he only has bullets in his backpack.
[03:42:16.472 --> 03:42:17.513]  This is where we are today.
[03:42:18.437 --> 03:42:27.047]  And if you look closely at everything we've talked about earlier with Alex, the deep state is a police state.
[03:42:27.047 --> 03:42:31.592]  And these are the types of schemes that go on.
[03:42:31.592 --> 03:42:34.115]  I'll be back with Kevin Jackson in the next segment.
[03:42:53.895 --> 03:42:56.196]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:42:56.196 --> 03:42:57.757]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[03:44:54.562 --> 03:44:58.044]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:44:58.044 --> 03:45:09.551]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[03:45:09.551 --> 03:45:10.472]  This is Pollen Block.
[03:45:11.452 --> 03:45:24.126]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:45:24.126 --> 03:45:27.971]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[03:45:28.431 --> 03:45:32.913]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[03:45:32.913 --> 03:45:42.999]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:45:42.999 --> 03:45:46.141]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.

[03:46:57.652 --> 03:47:00.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.463 --> 03:47:28.827]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:47:28.827 --> 03:47:32.869]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:32.869 --> 03:47:34.550]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:38.072]  I'm Joel Gilbert from the left coast right here.
[03:47:38.072 --> 03:47:40.674]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones Store only.
[03:47:40.674 --> 03:47:45.117]  Go to the Alex Jones Store for my new film, Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:47:45.117 --> 03:47:49.199]  You won't stop laughing and you'll understand Trump for the first time.
[03:47:49.199 --> 03:47:52.061]  This is a number one film right now in the Alex Jones Store.
[03:47:53.016 --> 03:47:55.898]  I want to bring on now, people know him from Fox News.
[03:47:55.898 --> 03:47:57.900]  He's been on quite a few times.
[03:47:57.900 --> 03:48:00.202]  He's a fantastic commentator.
[03:48:00.202 --> 03:48:01.183]  Kevin Jackson.
[03:48:01.183 --> 03:48:04.625]  He's also a talk show host on Salem Communications.
[03:48:04.625 --> 03:48:14.733]  He's the author of the Amazon bestsellers, The Big Black Lie and Race Pimping, the multi-trillion dollar business of liberalism.
[03:48:14.733 --> 03:48:16.475]  Kevin Jackson, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:48:17.719 --> 03:48:18.900]  Hey, Joel, thanks for having me.
[03:48:18.900 --> 03:48:25.125]  Real quick update, I'm with Genesis on the same network as Alex, actually, not Salem.
[03:48:25.125 --> 03:48:25.885]  Okay, thanks.
[03:48:25.885 --> 03:48:27.426]  We got that from your website.
[03:48:27.426 --> 03:48:32.230]  By the way, Kevin's website, TheBlackSphere.net.
[03:48:32.230 --> 03:48:33.991]  Kevin, you've been talking about it for a long time.
[03:48:33.991 --> 03:48:36.313]  You've seen my film, There's No Place Like Utopia, where...
[03:48:37.384 --> 03:48:38.765]  I went to South Side Chicago.
[03:48:38.765 --> 03:48:41.087]  I talked to a lot of black people.
[03:48:41.087 --> 03:48:44.350]  They love Obama because he's one of them.
[03:48:44.350 --> 03:48:46.411]  They're proud of his heritage.
[03:48:46.411 --> 03:48:50.475]  But when I talked to them about his policies, they said, we're getting poorer.
[03:48:50.475 --> 03:48:53.097]  We want more cops, not less cops.
[03:48:53.097 --> 03:48:55.579]  We don't want illegals in our neighborhood.
[03:48:55.579 --> 03:48:57.300]  We want jobs.
[03:48:57.300 --> 03:49:03.525]  They seem to be very conservative, but they're still supporting the Democrats like 90%.
[03:49:03.525 --> 03:49:04.626]  What's happening on that?
[03:49:05.550 --> 03:49:18.040]  I don't think those numbers, I don't think those numbers, look we've both been there and there are a lot of people that wanted Obama, black folks, and he got in there and he gave it a shot and he blew it.
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:23.965]  I mean he was the Mookie Wilson of baseball, Mookie Robinson rather, not the Jackie Robinson.
[03:49:23.965 --> 03:49:25.406]  And black folks know it.
[03:49:25.766 --> 03:49:29.009]  You know, now look, they've invested a lot in this guy.
[03:49:29.009 --> 03:49:34.274]  And, you know, you can't just throw him to the wolves because that will validate the white man.
[03:49:34.274 --> 03:49:39.619]  And as we know, in America today, you can't do anything that validates white.
[03:49:39.619 --> 03:49:42.901]  Look at Chuck Schumer that doesn't want to vote for a qualified judge.
[03:49:42.901 --> 03:49:43.622]  Why?
[03:49:43.622 --> 03:49:45.163]  Simply because he's white.
[03:49:45.163 --> 03:49:47.065]  It has nothing to do with qualification.
[03:49:47.065 --> 03:49:48.807]  So just the idea that we have this
[03:49:49.327 --> 03:49:51.228]  Overt racism.
[03:49:51.228 --> 03:49:55.031]  And I heard you talking in the last segment about the sneaky racism.
[03:49:55.031 --> 03:49:56.252]  It's not sneaky.
[03:49:56.252 --> 03:49:57.753]  It's right in your face.
[03:49:57.753 --> 03:50:02.056]  The Congressional Black Caucus makes everything about white versus black.
[03:50:02.056 --> 03:50:03.797]  It's not only that, though.
[03:50:03.797 --> 03:50:05.738]  It's woman versus man.
[03:50:05.738 --> 03:50:08.340]  It's Muslim versus Christian or Jew.
[03:50:08.340 --> 03:50:08.980]  And on and on.
[03:50:08.980 --> 03:50:10.421]  And that's what they do is divide.
[03:50:10.421 --> 03:50:12.843]  So as far as Obama's concerned, he's circa 2008.
[03:50:12.843 --> 03:50:14.304]  He's last year's news.
[03:50:19.087 --> 03:50:19.527]  I don't think so.
[03:50:37.176 --> 03:50:40.079]  Okay, well Kevin, tell me when, what was the exact time, and how do you think
[03:50:57.978 --> 03:51:06.756]  The civil rights movement got away from Martin Luther King's vision of let's judge people by the strength of their character and not by the color of their skin.
[03:51:06.756 --> 03:51:08.139]  How did it all turn around?
[03:51:09.178 --> 03:51:16.323]  You know, it's so strange that we as conservatives have allowed the Republican Party to fight for us.
[03:51:16.323 --> 03:51:19.525]  I mean, we've got a sissy in our fight.
[03:51:19.525 --> 03:51:20.706]  And when did it happen?
[03:51:20.706 --> 03:51:27.750]  It happened in the 60s under LBJ, who, along with the Democrat elite, has decided, you know what?
[03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:33.894]  We will continue to trick black people into believing that we have their best interest in mind.
[03:51:33.894 --> 03:51:36.396]  And that, by the way, that ruse continues to this day.
[03:51:37.119 --> 03:51:51.627]  So, when they set out to do this, it was a real strategy, and just to be blunt, and this may make some people mad, probably not with Alex's audience, but just to be blunt, it was, let's keep black people just stupid.
[03:51:51.627 --> 03:51:53.708]  Let's keep them completely stupid.
[03:51:53.708 --> 03:51:55.589]  Let's rewrite history.
[03:51:55.589 --> 03:52:03.533]  And so, you've got a party of Republicans who, pre-black people, wrote almost every civil rights legislation that protected black people.
[03:52:04.153 --> 03:52:21.194]  Started the NRA to give black people guns, started the Freedmen's Bureau to get black people educated, have all their white Republican names on every HBCU, that's historically black colleges and universities in the country, fought against the Klan, fought against segregation, fought against Jim Crow, etc.
[03:52:22.174 --> 03:52:27.777]  And they can't sell that concept to black people today, because you know what you hear, Joel?
[03:52:27.777 --> 03:52:32.680]  You hear, well, that was the Republicans from the past, and the Democrats have flipped.
[03:52:32.680 --> 03:52:34.281]  You know, everybody's flipped.
[03:52:34.281 --> 03:52:35.462]  Nothing's flipped.
[03:52:35.462 --> 03:52:39.544]  Planned Parenthood is a, you know, a scourge against black people.
[03:52:39.544 --> 03:52:41.805]  It's very clear what it's meant to do.
[03:52:41.805 --> 03:52:44.607]  It's to keep black people from breeding, right?
[03:52:44.607 --> 03:52:47.749]  And I can give you the statistics around how it has done that.
[03:52:48.330 --> 03:52:53.883]  When you look at the abject racism of Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill,
[03:52:54.796 --> 03:53:00.639]  Giving a eulogy to a Klansman, Robert Byrd, and Democrats saying nothing.
[03:53:00.639 --> 03:53:02.980]  By the way, Barack Obama eulogized him as well.
[03:53:02.980 --> 03:53:06.582]  They all said he had a tangential relationship.
[03:53:06.582 --> 03:53:07.882]  That's exactly what Bill Clinton said.
[03:53:07.882 --> 03:53:10.243]  He had a tangential relationship with the Klan.
[03:53:10.243 --> 03:53:14.105]  40 plus years in the Klan is tangential.
[03:53:14.105 --> 03:53:23.770]  Now, tell me that Donald Trump could have a relationship with a 40 plus year Klansman, and everybody just brush it over, and if he eulogized him, how that would be done.
[03:53:24.230 --> 03:53:30.652]  But they tell you he's racist and can't give you anything whatsoever to prove it.
[03:53:30.652 --> 03:53:33.773]  Okay, Kevin, look, Trump made it a point in a campaign.
[03:53:33.773 --> 03:53:35.494]  He went to places like Detroit.
[03:53:35.494 --> 03:53:39.035]  He said, we're going to revitalize our inner cities.
[03:53:39.035 --> 03:53:42.876]  Can he do that if these urban areas are all controlled by Democrats?
[03:53:42.876 --> 03:53:44.617]  Are they going to cooperate?
[03:53:44.617 --> 03:53:47.718]  And will the urban communities demand they cooperate?
[03:53:48.800 --> 03:54:00.685]  No, they're not going to cooperate because they're invested in the fallacy of Barack Obama, I call him Baby Black Jesus, and they really can't put any effort into Donald Trump.
[03:54:00.685 --> 03:54:07.788]  If Trump goes in and he's successful in the inner cities with true empowerment zones, it would be the end of the Democrat Party.
[03:54:07.788 --> 03:54:12.630]  Now, our team, and not to be self-promoting, but our team is going to do this.
[03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:13.170]  We're going to help
[03:54:13.710 --> 03:54:14.051]  We're good.
[03:54:26.581 --> 03:54:27.702]  We're good to go.
[03:54:48.443 --> 03:54:53.446]  And that's what you gotta love about this guy, that he's saying, you know, and I know what I'm going to run into with these clowns.
[03:54:53.446 --> 03:54:55.627]  They're not going to do anything for me, but so what?
[03:54:55.627 --> 03:55:00.790]  How are you going to stop somebody from putting in, you know, a business that employs blacks?
[03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:04.452]  Eventually, you know, the black community will wake up and start to get it.
[03:55:04.452 --> 03:55:09.515]  Okay, Kevin, look, you're obviously living reality.
[03:55:10.345 --> 03:55:12.026]  Tell people a little about your background.
[03:55:12.026 --> 03:55:26.414]  How did you come to be someone who understands these issues, whereas it seems like the vast majority of the black community are kind of imprisoned with this Democrat plantation, as they call it.
[03:55:26.414 --> 03:55:27.635]  Tell us about your background.
[03:55:29.272 --> 03:55:31.294]  Well, I have a talk I like to do.
[03:55:31.294 --> 03:55:36.638]  I say, a funny thing happened on my way to prison, which of course I've never been, but my father was in prison.
[03:55:36.638 --> 03:55:41.181]  His brother, my uncle, who chairs my birthday, he was in prison.
[03:55:41.181 --> 03:55:45.244]  If I'd been raised on my father's side of the family, I undoubtedly would have been to prison.
[03:55:45.244 --> 03:55:46.505]  I probably couldn't have escaped it.
[03:55:46.505 --> 03:55:51.029]  I would have been the best drug dealer in Indianapolis, pardon me, Indiana.
[03:55:51.781 --> 03:55:55.922]  But I was raised by my maternal grandparents when my mother died.
[03:55:55.922 --> 03:55:57.622]  Now, how do you avoid it?
[03:55:57.622 --> 03:55:59.163]  First, I'll tell you this.
[03:55:59.163 --> 03:56:04.344]  I have never, since I had a thought in my brain, wanted to be a Democrat.
[03:56:04.344 --> 03:56:06.504]  I saw them for what they were.
[03:56:06.504 --> 03:56:08.885]  As we say in the black community, game, no game.
[03:56:08.885 --> 03:56:11.986]  So I knew these clowns were gaming us from the beginning.
[03:56:11.986 --> 03:56:17.567]  From the moment I was five years old, I watched the Democrats give a speech, I went, I'm nothing like that.
[03:56:18.147 --> 03:56:23.770]  So my grandparents, who were Democrats by the way, instilled in me the thing that said, you're not that.
[03:56:23.770 --> 03:56:26.652]  You're going to be accountable and all these other things.
[03:56:26.652 --> 03:56:35.136]  It was Ronald Reagan who woke me up to it because when he lost, I don't remember what he lost, but I remember looking at him and he gave a speech and I said, that's not the speech of a loser.
[03:56:35.136 --> 03:56:37.658]  That's a speech of a guy who hasn't won yet.
[03:56:38.291 --> 03:56:42.813]  And I can't describe what that means, but people probably listening know what I'm talking about.
[03:56:42.813 --> 03:56:47.296]  There's a loser speech, and there's a, no, I just didn't win this time speech.
[03:56:47.296 --> 03:56:48.476]  And that's what I saw in Reagan.
[03:56:48.476 --> 03:56:50.257]  And I was like, that's my guy right there.
[03:56:50.257 --> 03:56:51.518]  My grandparents hated it.
[03:56:51.518 --> 03:56:51.898]  Shut up.
[03:56:51.898 --> 03:56:52.638]  We don't like him.
[03:56:52.638 --> 03:56:53.539]  We like Democrats.
[03:56:53.539 --> 03:56:55.300]  And I was like, I don't care who you like.
[03:56:55.300 --> 03:56:56.280]  I like him.
[03:56:56.280 --> 03:56:57.881]  Now, here's what's interesting, Joel.
[03:56:57.881 --> 03:57:06.605]  People love these Horatio Alger, these come to Jesus, these stories about Democrats converting to be Republicans, like Sheriff Clark and others.
[03:57:06.605 --> 03:57:07.926]  I've never been that stupid.
[03:57:08.596 --> 03:57:08.956]  I don't know.
[03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:35.254]  So, when I wrote my first book, The Big Black Lie... Okay, Kevin, Kevin, we're coming up on a break.
[03:57:35.254 --> 03:57:38.476]  I want to tell everyone to go to TheBlackSphere.net.
[03:57:38.476 --> 03:57:40.057]  Look at Kevin's website.
[03:57:40.057 --> 03:57:41.298]  Kevin, thanks for being here.
[03:57:41.298 --> 03:57:42.199]  You're so clear.
[03:57:42.199 --> 03:57:43.880]  You give us so much insight.
[03:57:43.880 --> 03:57:49.043]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[03:57:49.043 --> 03:57:53.807]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[03:57:53.807 --> 03:57:58.330]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[03:57:58.490 --> 03:57:58.630]  I think?
[03:58:18.831 --> 03:58:22.433]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[03:58:22.433 --> 03:58:27.175]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[03:58:27.175 --> 03:58:35.258]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[03:58:35.258 --> 03:58:39.460]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[03:58:39.460 --> 03:58:40.741]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:58:44.628 --> 03:58:52.894]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[03:58:52.894 --> 03:58:54.114]  A 360 win.
[03:58:54.114 --> 03:59:00.679]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[03:59:00.679 --> 03:59:08.204]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:59:08.604 --> 03:59:13.288]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:59:13.288 --> 03:59:19.793]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:59:19.793 --> 03:59:27.579]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:59:27.579 --> 03:59:34.104]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:59:34.104 --> 03:59:35.605]  10% off on auto ship.
[03:59:35.745 --> 03:59:38.189]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[03:59:38.189 --> 03:59:40.151]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[03:59:40.151 --> 03:59:47.542]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:59:47.542 --> 03:59:50.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
