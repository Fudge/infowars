[00:00.000 --> 00:21.140]  You know, I don't say this a lot on air, even though I should probably start every broadcast
[00:21.140 --> 00:29.120]  by saying it, because I really don't care what the enemy thinks.
[00:29.120 --> 00:31.300]  I know they don't listen to me anyways.
[00:31.300 --> 00:36.520]  They're so delusional, but the listeners need to know this.
[00:36.520 --> 00:41.680]  The listeners need to understand this, because you are the activists, you are the resistance,
[00:41.680 --> 00:48.000]  you are America, you are the renaissance, you are the light and the country's eyes.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.960]  You're the spirit of 1776.
[00:52.960 --> 00:58.040]  You are the descendants, whether you weren't even related to those people as an American,
[00:58.040 --> 01:06.160]  you can take on that amazing historical birthright of Providence.
[01:06.160 --> 01:12.340]  God loves children, drunks of the United States of America, as Von Bismarck said, but getting
[01:12.340 --> 01:17.080]  back to the main issue, for I had all the incredible news, over the top, this country's
[01:17.080 --> 01:26.400]  the middle of an absolute 21st century technological information civil war with the globalist.
[01:26.400 --> 01:29.960]  You've got the globalist factions and you've got just people that want to have the country
[01:29.960 --> 01:33.760]  be decent and try to move forward and try to not be evil.
[01:33.760 --> 01:42.120]  We don't have a lot of time to turn this around, we're trying to turn it around, we're trying
[01:42.120 --> 01:49.000]  to right the ship, but it's not some heroic thing to right the ship, it's survival instinct,
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.960]  and that's what I'm getting at here for people.
[01:51.960 --> 02:00.000]  When I get attacked and I get lied about in really unbelievable ways that really only
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.760]  somebody like Trump has to go through, it's done because they fear the information, they
[02:06.760 --> 02:11.320]  fear the platform because it gives you a voice, a bigger voice, and they fear the guess we
[02:11.320 --> 02:13.240]  have on.
[02:13.240 --> 02:22.240]  But folks think that when I'm being destroyed ritualistically every day in the media that
[02:22.240 --> 02:28.200]  I'm losing or you're losing, and we're not, we're taking the culture back, we're putting
[02:28.200 --> 02:33.720]  ideas into the ether that are now becoming the dominant understanding and are changing
[02:33.720 --> 02:34.720]  the world.
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.400]  We're exposing world government, the fact that it's unelected, we're exposing that the
[02:37.400 --> 02:43.760]  globalists are very satanic and anti-God and anti-family, and we're winning, and we're
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.640]  forcing them to engage in Chinese government style, communist style censorship.
[02:48.640 --> 02:55.240]  We're forcing their hand and it's blowing up in their face big time, and I can list
[02:55.240 --> 02:58.880]  a bunch of those examples when we come back from break.
[02:58.880 --> 03:05.040]  So when I say I'm honored to be lied about and attacked, this is 21st century war, and
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.040]  I'm not having to get arms and legs blown off like soldiers have going back to the start
[03:09.040 --> 03:14.320]  of this country, millions and millions of dead, and all the other men and women that
[03:14.320 --> 03:17.560]  have fought for their families and fought for justice throughout history, all that blood,
[03:17.560 --> 03:23.840]  sweat, and tears, this is how Hillary Clinton is striking back, and if it's not sending
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.720]  a hit team to kill me because she knows she could get caught in this modern system, but
[03:29.720 --> 03:33.960]  it's just trying to destroy my name to be able to get the word out, that's fine.
[03:33.960 --> 03:39.000]  See I'm willing to sacrifice myself so that we beat these people, and that's how to pure
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.880]  survival, not out of being a hero.
[03:41.880 --> 03:44.240]  Our back is against the wall, folks.
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.200]  You can't even submit to these people, they just want total tyranny and to disease your
[03:48.200 --> 03:55.360]  mind, they want mental illness, they want collapse, that's their plan, it's public.
[03:55.360 --> 03:59.000]  So there is not even capitulation, it's not like we're going to be assimilated by this
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.160]  new world order, it wants us out of the way.
[04:03.160 --> 04:09.600]  We've got all the characteristics of an alien force operating through humans, and everybody
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.160]  knows that, every culture knows that, and that's what the Bible says, that's what it
[04:13.160 --> 04:14.160]  is.
[04:14.160 --> 04:15.160]  Fallen Angel.
[04:15.160 --> 04:19.080]  Now I don't get into UFOs and all this other stuff, I'm just telling you, we're dealing
[04:19.080 --> 04:23.040]  with an off-world force that wants us to kill each other, and wants us mentally ill and
[04:23.040 --> 04:26.960]  doesn't want us to work together, and you read the WikiLeaks, it's written like an alien
[04:26.960 --> 04:34.600]  would write something to turn the people against themselves and blow the planet up.
[04:34.600 --> 04:42.000]  So it's that, I mean, I'm on a suicide mission because it's total death if we lose for everybody.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.280]  So I'm winning, you're winning, we're winning.
[04:46.280 --> 04:49.640]  They just want to make it look like, you stand up and promote freedom, and suppose the deep
[04:49.640 --> 04:53.160]  state you're going to be destroyed, the truth is they're the ones being destroyed.
[04:53.160 --> 05:00.520]  I rise every day like the Phoenix, every day I come back.
[05:00.520 --> 05:04.320]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWarsLife.
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.400]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[05:08.400 --> 05:11.160]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[05:11.160 --> 05:14.160]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.480]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[05:18.480 --> 05:24.560]  like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[05:24.560 --> 05:27.920]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[05:27.920 --> 05:33.080]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[05:33.080 --> 05:35.960]  these reactive oxygen species.
[05:35.960 --> 05:41.040]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[05:41.040 --> 05:45.840]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[05:45.840 --> 05:48.720]  species and other free radicals.
[05:48.720 --> 05:53.640]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[06:23.640 --> 06:52.320]  It's already March 2.
[06:52.320 --> 07:03.360]  The Ides of March, that's when they kill Julius Caesar, right in the middle of March.
[07:03.360 --> 07:07.280]  You wear the Ides of March.
[07:07.280 --> 07:15.920]  Are we about to see the fall of President Trump?
[07:15.920 --> 07:23.080]  I don't go with the hype with CNN and all the other globalist run disinformation outfits
[07:23.080 --> 07:29.480]  propaganda.
[07:29.480 --> 07:37.840]  But I can sense the will of the people, I can pick up the spirit of the population, and
[07:37.840 --> 07:42.760]  I can talk to the man and woman on the street.
[07:42.760 --> 07:49.680]  And I can tell you that Trump has dented his aura.
[07:49.680 --> 08:01.120]  He has put a big fat dent and a big old goose egg right on top of his head with a hammer
[08:01.120 --> 08:12.280]  with the statements he's been making in these listening sessions he's been having with victims
[08:12.280 --> 08:17.880]  of the shooting and also members of Congress and Dianne Feinstein hunched over like the
[08:17.880 --> 08:23.360]  archetypal witch without even wearing the green makeup looking more witch-like than
[08:23.360 --> 08:25.600]  the witch in a Wizard of Oz.
[08:25.600 --> 08:28.920]  And you gotta ask why is he doing that?
[08:28.920 --> 08:34.520]  And I made some phone calls this morning and last night and he said, listen, it's Ivanka
[08:34.520 --> 08:36.640]  and it's Jared.
[08:36.640 --> 08:38.880]  And I don't want to sit here and bash Ivanka and Jared.
[08:38.880 --> 08:43.600]  They're from New York, they grew up basically in little glass fish bowls.
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.400]  And to a goldfish that lives in a tiny little fish bowl they think guns are scary.
[08:47.400 --> 08:50.000]  I mean, I get it.
[08:50.000 --> 09:00.960]  You're domesticated and your idea of fun is shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue and you're
[09:00.960 --> 09:07.920]  all suave and fancy pants.
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.360]  It sounds reasonable to give a little up but all of us know the goal is to always have
[09:12.360 --> 09:17.400]  us give up, give up, give up, give up and take bites out of it until it's all gone.
[09:17.400 --> 09:21.200]  And we've got Dianne Feinstein and we've got Michael Moore and we've got New York Times
[09:21.200 --> 09:27.160]  and we've got Chuck Todd on the Sunday morning shows saying we're going to repeal the entire
[09:27.160 --> 09:28.880]  thing and take all your guns.
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.440]  And we know about the UN treaty that Obama signed that says the abolition of civilian
[09:33.440 --> 09:37.200]  firearms is our goal.
[09:37.200 --> 09:52.320]  Civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[09:52.320 --> 09:55.040]  What is a power monopoly?
[09:55.040 --> 10:01.880]  Well, if you've got a fish in a fish bowl, if you don't give it food and if you don't
[10:01.880 --> 10:09.040]  give it water to keep the water filled, when it evaporates, it will surely die.
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.720]  And when you have a goldfish, it is a lesson to your children of a monopoly of power because
[10:15.720 --> 10:23.040]  if you don't feed little Goldie, little Goldie is going to shrivel up like a skeleton.
[10:23.040 --> 10:28.280]  Can't tell me how many times I've been over to a kid's house or in a party or you know
[10:28.280 --> 10:32.720]  some place and see a starving Goldfish or a couple of them old skinny and looking out
[10:32.720 --> 10:33.720]  what food.
[10:33.720 --> 10:40.360]  Hey, why don't you feed your fish or why don't you go dump them in the lake?
[10:40.360 --> 10:42.920]  And that's kind of what leftism is.
[10:42.920 --> 10:44.320]  They want to run everything.
[10:44.320 --> 10:45.560]  They're control freaks.
[10:45.560 --> 10:49.440]  They're like collectors, people that collect, you know, 400 dogs and cats or whatever and
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.160]  there's feces three feet tall and they just got to have more and more and more.
[10:53.160 --> 10:55.240]  It's mental illness.
[10:55.240 --> 10:58.960]  And that's what Satanism is, is they want dominance, they want power, they don't want
[10:58.960 --> 11:05.120]  any responsibility and they want to wreck things and control them and they want to look
[11:05.120 --> 11:10.960]  over and see a bunch of starving, yapping dogs, begging to them in some dirty, flea-infested
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.680]  yard because it makes them feel powerful.
[11:15.680 --> 11:17.000]  Notice that about mentally ill people.
[11:17.000 --> 11:29.480]  They like to, they like to mistreat animals and that's what it is.
[11:29.480 --> 11:35.960]  And so I don't blame Ivanka and Jared, they're Goldfish and I guess you could say Donald
[11:35.960 --> 11:46.320]  Trump looks like a big Goldfish but getting serious here, Trump is no Goldfish and his
[11:46.320 --> 11:48.280]  sons aren't either.
[11:48.280 --> 11:52.960]  And when you've got Eric Trump running around saying, well, I think not letting folks buy
[11:52.960 --> 11:58.400]  a semi-automatic rival shield or 21 is reasonable and bump stocks, ban those.
[11:58.400 --> 12:01.840]  What happens then, every time somebody uses something in a crime, we got to ban that?
[12:01.840 --> 12:13.200]  Well, there won't be any baseball bats or screwdrivers or butcher knives or cars or anything.
[12:13.200 --> 12:23.200]  So let's just stop right there and look at where we are.
[12:23.200 --> 12:29.800]  There are a lot of signs that Trump is starting to buckle and we've had sources that have
[12:29.800 --> 12:37.160]  been worried about him being compromised for extracurricular activities other than his
[12:37.160 --> 12:43.240]  wife, which is not a good thing to do, but I am not a hypocrite in my life.
[12:43.240 --> 12:49.320]  I am certainly very heterosexual, I'm not promiscuous, but the point is I don't judge
[12:49.320 --> 12:52.920]  people for what they're individually doing, it doesn't hurt somebody else.
[12:52.920 --> 12:55.160]  I judge them by their fruits because I've read the Bible.
[12:55.160 --> 13:00.520]  You look at people like King David, again, who had the same problem Donald Trump does,
[13:00.520 --> 13:04.040]  but his heart was good so God said he was chief among men.
[13:04.040 --> 13:07.120]  So you have to really read the Bible to understand it.
[13:07.120 --> 13:11.080]  It's not hypocritical, it makes a lot of sense.
[13:11.080 --> 13:17.320]  America, because Trump wasn't a hypocrite and said he stood up for these things and did
[13:17.320 --> 13:25.720]  stand up for them, gave him a pass on some of the moral issues.
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.600]  But we're in a society where the vice president won't get on an elevator with an unattended
[13:30.600 --> 13:31.600]  woman.
[13:31.600 --> 13:38.320]  He went up away from Berkus, but I understand why he's doing it, but this whole crazed behavior
[13:38.320 --> 13:44.480]  about men and women coming together from the left is going so far left, it's coming back
[13:44.480 --> 13:49.120]  to basically Orthodox Islam.
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.800]  I mean where a woman hugs you and if you touch their back, prairie home companion, you're
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.840]  fired and they said, no, that's what he did, he touched a woman's back when she was fawning
[14:00.840 --> 14:01.840]  over him.
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.480]  It's like saying women throwing their panties at Elvis Presley, climbing up on top of him.
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.080]  If Elvis hugged one of them, oh my God, it's rape.
[14:10.080 --> 14:18.840]  That's like saying of two mammals out in the field like each other and the male comes
[14:18.840 --> 14:21.920]  over to the female, that's rape.
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.720]  It's an attack on the species, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:25.720 --> 14:28.240]  So that's it, we're going to go through these clips, we're going to look at what Trump's
[14:28.240 --> 14:30.520]  doing, we're going to reckon order the situation.
[14:30.520 --> 14:33.400]  We've already moved the ball way down the field, we've already gotten out of the TPP,
[14:33.400 --> 14:35.840]  we're already renegotiating all these bad deals.
[14:35.840 --> 14:41.040]  They're talking about depression if he does these steel and aluminum deals.
[14:41.040 --> 14:44.000]  We don't really have any steel or aluminum production compared to what we did, it's down
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.400]  to over 80% since the 1950s and what we have is leaving because they have internal tariffs
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.400]  against us with their taxes and regulations in China and other areas where no one can
[14:55.400 --> 14:56.900]  compete.
[14:56.900 --> 15:01.560]  And the industries come here and said we can hire people and we can do this because again,
[15:01.560 --> 15:05.600]  China lowered their tax from 15% to zero to counter Trump.
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.240]  So he said, okay, I'm going to put tariffs on a 20%.
[15:09.240 --> 15:10.320]  What does that basically do?
[15:10.320 --> 15:15.640]  It matches what the Chinese have done and then gives them a five point ding.
[15:15.640 --> 15:24.160]  He's being very fair and they're calling it on CNN, a depression, oh, in Germany so mad
[15:24.160 --> 15:25.160]  on and on and on.
[15:25.160 --> 15:31.640]  We've got so many tariffs and controls on our goods going into Europe, it's insane.
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.920]  So Trump's doing a lot of good and I think that he's just putting out this rhetoric so
[15:36.920 --> 15:40.240]  they give us a deal that's really horrible so nothing happens and then he has the cake
[15:40.240 --> 15:41.960]  and eat it too, but it doesn't matter.
[15:41.960 --> 15:45.840]  You can't intellectually play that game.
[15:45.840 --> 15:51.080]  You can't do that with bedrock issues or we lose the intellectual battle down the road.
[15:51.080 --> 15:52.080]  We'll be back.
[15:52.080 --> 16:00.160]  Let's get this article news straight ahead.
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.160]  Ever since ID Stronghold created RFID blocking wallet technology over 10 years ago, major
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.240]  designer brands have tried to create their own versions, but do they really work?
[16:09.240 --> 16:13.640]  We let real people test designer brand RFID blocking wallets using the same rigorous
[16:13.640 --> 16:16.080]  testing ID Stronghold wallets go through.
[16:16.080 --> 16:17.680]  So how did the designer brands do?
[16:17.680 --> 16:22.180]  I expected notable brands to perform well and I was pretty surprised to see that it was
[16:22.180 --> 16:23.680]  not fully protective.
[16:23.680 --> 16:28.240]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising
[16:28.240 --> 16:29.240]  that they do.
[16:29.240 --> 16:33.440]  Get a stronghold on your credit cards license and other critical data with ID Stronghold
[16:33.440 --> 16:34.440]  wallets.
[16:34.440 --> 16:36.600]  Other RFID blocking wallets simply aren't the same.
[16:36.600 --> 16:39.120]  I stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[16:39.120 --> 16:42.960]  I would definitely recommend ID Stronghold wallets to my friends and family.
[16:42.960 --> 16:43.960]  Check the label.
[16:43.960 --> 16:46.520]  If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[16:46.520 --> 16:49.160]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold wallet.
[16:49.160 --> 16:53.240]  Get the most trusted brand in RFID blocking wallets and protect yourself from electronic
[16:53.240 --> 16:54.240]  tick-locketing.

[16:58.840 --> 17:02.600]  One out of four people listening to my voice right now could die from heart disease.

[17:06.160 --> 17:07.160]  warning signs.

[17:30.200 --> 17:35.640]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.

[18:09.280 --> 18:13.360]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.680]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.680 --> 18:23.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[18:38.280 --> 18:43.480]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[19:59.840 --> 20:22.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:22.040 --> 20:24.640]  Waging war on corruption.
[20:24.640 --> 20:32.280]  This is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[20:32.280 --> 20:34.200]  I almost forgot.
[20:34.200 --> 20:37.040]  It's March 2, 2018.
[20:37.040 --> 20:42.600]  Texas Independence Day is a celebration of the adoption of the Texas Declaration of Independence
[20:42.600 --> 20:48.720]  on March 2, 1836 with this document signed by 59 delegates, settlers in Mexican Texas
[20:48.720 --> 20:56.920]  officially declared independence from Mexico and created the Republic of Texas.
[20:56.920 --> 20:59.520]  And some of my ancestors are on that baby.
[20:59.520 --> 21:06.960]  So we see the continued march on from people wanting to live under freedom and you can
[21:06.960 --> 21:09.280]  look at Texas and say, well, is it true freedom?
[21:09.280 --> 21:14.200]  Well, compare it to Mexico with the wealth and the freedom and the prosperity and the
[21:14.200 --> 21:20.640]  science and the technology, you can see that there was a lot more freedom here and a lot
[21:20.640 --> 21:29.360]  bigger step away from colonialism and to independence.
[21:29.360 --> 21:34.360]  But the left teaches that Texas and all these other areas belong to Mexico when there's
[21:34.360 --> 21:37.680]  a reason there's been six flags over Texas.
[21:37.680 --> 21:46.080]  Just because it was a war zone that no one could keep until the Scottish and Irish, mainly
[21:46.080 --> 21:52.760]  settlers and then German and English came in.
[21:52.760 --> 22:02.560]  They were the ones out of Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia that came in at the behest
[22:02.560 --> 22:09.040]  of the Mexican government to fight the Comanche.
[22:09.040 --> 22:15.840]  There was no Mexican government passed areas of South Texas and Galveston and out into
[22:15.840 --> 22:20.680]  West Texas and places like San Antonio and South Texas.
[22:20.680 --> 22:27.320]  There was Spanish missions that were armed forts and that was it.
[22:27.320 --> 22:39.480]  And the only reason Anglo settlers were let in by the Anglo rulers of Mexico was to kill
[22:39.480 --> 22:42.760]  the Comanche and that's a fact.
[22:42.760 --> 22:48.480]  And kill the Comanche we did and also intermarry with them as some of my ancestors did.
[22:48.480 --> 22:53.320]  But you never hear anybody say they're a Comanche because everybody that was a Comanche
[22:53.320 --> 22:57.480]  changed their name to another tribe because if you told somebody you were a Comanche even
[22:57.480 --> 23:02.920]  until the 1920s, they'd try to kill you because a lot of folks, you know, had their mama and
[23:02.920 --> 23:04.600]  their daddy killed by them.
[23:04.600 --> 23:10.640]  They remembered it and you've got these images of these sweet loving people and that was
[23:10.640 --> 23:13.080]  a far, far different.
[23:13.080 --> 23:16.320]  The Comanche, you know, terrorized all the other Native Americans and had them all scared
[23:16.320 --> 23:21.360]  and took over basically much of the Midwest all the way up to Illinois, right down through
[23:21.360 --> 23:32.000]  Oklahoma into South Texas because they tortured and killed basically everybody they came across.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.840]  You know, they were the ones that would cut the islands off and bury it in an ant bed.
[23:35.840 --> 23:40.800]  And then the Apaches, which were a sweet lot compared to the Comanche, but were out in
[23:40.800 --> 23:46.960]  areas the Comanches didn't want desert starting in West Texas out into Arizona.
[23:46.960 --> 23:48.960]  They had a few of the Comanche tactics.
[23:48.960 --> 23:56.080]  And of course, there was another loving group called the Caranquilla, who were down on the
[23:56.080 --> 24:01.280]  Texas coast, as we know it today, and they were cannibals.
[24:01.280 --> 24:08.400]  And they quite a few Spanish letters went back about, you know, the people going on
[24:08.400 --> 24:11.840]  shore to get water and being eaten.
[24:11.840 --> 24:17.920]  So let's just really be honest about what was going on around here.
[24:17.920 --> 24:19.040]  Let's be honest.
[24:19.040 --> 24:26.360]  There were people that ate their enemies, and that wasn't the only tribe that did that.
[24:26.360 --> 24:33.920]  And there were people that killed everybody but young women and children.
[24:33.920 --> 24:37.160]  And so that's why they were wiped out.
[24:37.160 --> 24:43.000]  And that's why groups affiliated with them got marched off to be killed.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.640]  And I'm not saying that was a good thing.
[24:45.640 --> 24:52.160]  I'm saying people need to understand the reality of what went on in this country and how it
[24:52.160 --> 24:54.840]  was carved out and what was done.
[24:54.840 --> 24:59.960]  Like Mexico claims California, California, the Russians claimed for a while.
[24:59.960 --> 25:01.080]  So did the Spanish.
[25:01.080 --> 25:04.760]  So it goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:04.760 --> 25:06.800]  And that's a fact.
[25:06.800 --> 25:14.440]  They don't teach in colleges what you just heard.
[25:14.440 --> 25:19.320]  They teach evil white people came down here because they wanted to continue slavery, even
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.880]  though, again, less than 2% had slaves.
[25:23.880 --> 25:25.800]  And that Mexico is this wonderful free place.
[25:25.800 --> 25:29.560]  Oh, is that why Santa Ana lost Guatemala as well in other states of Mexico?
[25:29.560 --> 25:31.640]  No, he was a tyrant.
[25:31.640 --> 25:35.200]  Now we're going to go to break here in a few minutes and I'm going to get focused, but
[25:35.200 --> 25:38.480]  I want to do a little bit of Texas Independence Day here.
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.840]  Is Trump going sideways on us?
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.360]  I think the answer is rhetorically, yes, even sitting there and acting like he's appeasing
[25:48.360 --> 25:53.080]  and giving validity to victim disarmament policies when the Democrats admit they want
[25:53.080 --> 25:58.000]  the abolition of the Second Amendment is a tactic so that they bring forward such a
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.800]  Larsonist bill that the whole thing gets shelved.
[26:01.800 --> 26:03.240]  He knows they don't have the votes.
[26:03.240 --> 26:07.480]  It's a tactic and it worked on DACA.
[26:07.480 --> 26:10.520]  He gave him something reasonable, which he would have actually let him done.
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.560]  They said total AMSI, total open borders.
[26:13.560 --> 26:17.200]  But this isn't something where what he was saying, I think was reasonable is what he
[26:17.200 --> 26:19.400]  said in the campaign.
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.560]  This is going back on what he said in the campaign, even if it's rhetorical and it has
[26:23.560 --> 26:31.640]  again dented his aura of being a person that delivers and a person that's a promise keeper
[26:31.640 --> 26:39.000]  and it makes me sick and it's made people even more angry because they love Trump.
[26:39.000 --> 26:47.720]  And so it's, you know, like a spurned woman, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned a Bible
[26:47.720 --> 26:50.800]  verse or is that always forgetter is that Shakespeare?
[26:50.800 --> 26:54.920]  Maybe Shakespeare quoted it, but it is Bible verse when we look and believe me, we all
[26:54.920 --> 27:00.000]  know if you've had a woman scorned, even if they leave you just to make you try to come
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  groveling back to them and then you don't man, do they get mad?
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.640]  They'll cut their own nose off despite their face just to get at you.
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.000]  Hell hath no fury like a woman spurned.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.120]  And that is William Congrave.
[27:13.120 --> 27:15.640]  See, I can't even get it right.
[27:15.640 --> 27:23.440]  First written as heaven has hell hath no fury like a woman's score, but it was in old English
[27:23.440 --> 27:27.920]  there in another way, but I'm digressing.
[27:27.920 --> 27:28.920]  Hell hath no fury.
[27:28.920 --> 27:34.680]  Well, hell hath no fury like an electorate that has been betrayed over and over and over
[27:34.680 --> 27:40.200]  and over again and where betrayal just becomes compromise.
[27:40.200 --> 27:46.880]  You can't compromise with people who are the essence of betrayal.
[27:46.880 --> 27:47.880]  You can't do it.
[27:47.880 --> 27:48.880]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[27:48.880 --> 27:57.280]  I just briefly want to thank the listeners during our fundraising drive of the last 24
[27:57.280 --> 27:58.280]  hours.
[27:58.280 --> 28:00.480]  We're going to continue live transmission until six o'clock tonight.
[28:00.480 --> 28:08.440]  Well, I'll be back Sunday, four to six p.m. I am taking my children on a short vacation
[28:08.440 --> 28:09.440]  next week.
[28:09.440 --> 28:13.000]  I'm sure the media will announce that I because of all these false allegations have quit them
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  in hiding.
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.640]  We just say these things so we can then show you how we know the enemy when they do it.
[28:20.640 --> 28:25.040]  I told you they were banning our YouTube, then they denied it, then they said they were,
[28:25.040 --> 28:29.000]  then they admitted it was for political reasons and then they reinstated it.
[28:29.000 --> 28:38.920]  They totally banned Dr. Corsi's YouTube channel, our DC Bureau man, and then returned it today.
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.960]  And that's a whole civil war inside YouTube that's amazing, where YouTube admits rogue
[28:43.960 --> 28:46.080]  employees are doing this.
[28:46.080 --> 28:49.720]  Well, CNN says they're contacting people at YouTube and saying, go do it.
[28:49.720 --> 28:53.960]  And I told you it's all fraud and they had all these TV shows celebrated and it's now
[28:53.960 --> 29:19.960]  blown up in all of your dirty lion faces.
[29:19.960 --> 29:45.700]  Now, thank you so much.

[31:00.420 --> 31:03.700]  InfoWarsLive is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[31:03.700 --> 31:08.300]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[31:08.300 --> 31:13.220]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory
[31:13.220 --> 31:15.240]  health and normal breathing.
[31:15.240 --> 31:16.740]  This is pollen blood.
[31:16.740 --> 31:21.580]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[31:21.580 --> 31:27.740]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms by running nose, itchy watery eyes,
[31:27.740 --> 31:29.340]  and excessive mucus production.
[31:29.340 --> 31:34.100]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[31:34.100 --> 31:40.220]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[31:40.220 --> 31:45.020]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[31:45.020 --> 31:48.660]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[31:48.660 --> 31:53.860]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at infowarslife.com
[31:53.860 --> 32:00.620]  or by calling toll-free, triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[32:00.620 --> 32:01.620]  I'm so excited.
[32:01.620 --> 32:07.060]  The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to
[32:07.060 --> 32:11.740]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[32:11.740 --> 32:17.180]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[32:17.180 --> 32:20.220]  boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[32:20.220 --> 32:26.500]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[32:26.500 --> 32:32.780]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[32:32.780 --> 32:37.860]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[32:37.860 --> 32:44.500]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[32:44.500 --> 32:48.940]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[32:48.940 --> 32:50.620]  hormones in your glands.
[32:50.620 --> 32:53.420]  It is amazing.
[32:53.420 --> 33:02.740]  Red pill, now available at infowarslife.com, and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[33:02.740 --> 33:31.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:33.580 --> 33:34.580]  That's right.
[33:34.580 --> 33:38.860]  Look at some of the unbelievable stories at infowars.com.
[33:38.860 --> 33:45.580]  As we've pointed out, they're not just fining people in Germany, France, and Sweden, thousands
[33:45.580 --> 33:51.900]  of euros if they even say that Islam is not a religion of peace and that it's associated
[33:51.900 --> 33:57.820]  with violence and oppression of women, but Marilla Penn has been criminally charged yet
[33:57.820 --> 34:05.820]  again and is facing two years in prison for saying that ISIS is as big a threat to Europe
[34:05.820 --> 34:11.500]  and that the Islamic-ISIS invasion as Hitler was, which is totally true.
[34:11.500 --> 34:15.460]  In fact, Hitler wanted to Islamify Europe.
[34:15.460 --> 34:17.300]  I've read his writings where he said that.
[34:17.300 --> 34:22.980]  I mean, talk about a crazy man, because he wanted to totally take over the Middle East,
[34:22.980 --> 34:23.980]  the whole world.
[34:23.980 --> 34:27.180]  He had it all figured out, and now they've done the same EU model, and the globalists
[34:27.180 --> 34:31.660]  have got it all figured out how they're going to take over our lives.
[34:31.660 --> 34:36.980]  So of course, we see these articles every day now, like it's no big deal, Sweden.
[34:36.980 --> 34:43.380]  Woman interrogated and imprisoned for posting a joke meme about Islam, and we'll show you
[34:43.380 --> 34:49.780]  the joke meme if we can scroll down for TV viewers, for radio listeners that's on infowars.com.
[34:49.780 --> 34:57.860]  No criminal faces two years in jail after authorities grilled her on support for multiculturalism.
[34:57.860 --> 35:00.860]  A woman in Sweden that's interrogated by the police under DNA tagging was subsequently
[35:00.860 --> 35:06.540]  imprisoned for the crime of sharing a joke meme about Islam on Facebook, and Facebook
[35:06.540 --> 35:07.540]  reports the police.
[35:07.540 --> 35:09.580]  They used the former Stasi in Germany.
[35:09.580 --> 35:14.420]  The 32-year-old woman from Gothenburg drew the attention of authorities after she posted
[35:14.420 --> 35:20.260]  the image below, which depicts a Muslim man having his brain removed and then being wrapped
[35:20.260 --> 35:23.420]  in Islamic headdress.
[35:23.420 --> 35:30.140]  While the meme may be considered offensive, what happened next was truly Orwellian, a
[35:30.140 --> 35:34.020]  reporter alerted police to the post claiming that the woman had expressed herself in a
[35:34.020 --> 35:36.980]  threatening manner towards a protected group.
[35:36.980 --> 35:47.380]  The reporter passed on the tales of the woman's identity and her place of residence, and basically
[35:47.380 --> 35:55.700]  the meme is you put, you take a brain out, you put poop in the brain, you put a turban
[35:55.700 --> 36:00.820]  on it, you know, he's had brain surgery, and then you're out physically attacking people
[36:00.820 --> 36:02.980]  in the street, you're an Islamist.
[36:02.980 --> 36:07.660]  The woman profusely apologized for the post claiming she thought it was aimed at members
[36:07.660 --> 36:12.820]  of ISIS, all asserting that her best friend was Muslim, oh, of course, grovel properly,
[36:12.820 --> 36:18.140]  and that she was ill at the time with a fever, which she posted the image, oh, I love how
[36:18.140 --> 36:22.660]  they grovel instead of saying it's our free speech, you globalist thugs.
[36:22.660 --> 36:26.500]  This did not satisfy authorities who proceeded to interrogate her about her thoughts on Sweden's
[36:26.500 --> 36:31.260]  multicultural society, and by the way, they run the Sweden culture minister as a Muslim
[36:31.260 --> 36:35.420]  that says it's his job to get rid of it, the rid of Swedish culture, and whether she had
[36:35.420 --> 36:39.700]  something against Muslims, well, they had something against her, the woman insisted
[36:39.700 --> 36:43.900]  she was against the Islamic State, non-individual Muslims, well, you can't do that.
[36:43.900 --> 36:51.700]  However, Gothenburg prosecutor Sarah Torskog, if I'm pronounced that right, decided to proceed
[36:51.700 --> 36:55.340]  with charges of hate speech, and the woman now faces two years in prison, and this is
[36:55.340 --> 37:01.140]  what they're trying to get here, when Comedy Central and everybody go, Jones has had his
[37:01.140 --> 37:04.980]  YouTube struck, and it's about to go down for hate speech, no, they said bullying is
[37:04.980 --> 37:08.820]  what they said, and by the way, they had to restore it because that was even a fraud.
[37:08.820 --> 37:13.540]  Hey, you shouldn't take somebody's speech for what you call bullying, that should be
[37:13.540 --> 37:18.340]  done in the courts, if you can prove it, oh, think of that, actually proving something,
[37:18.340 --> 37:23.820]  and then you have to expand on it from there, but now, oh, they had a big Gizmodo article
[37:23.820 --> 37:32.060]  about Infowars Washington YouTube taken down with tens of millions of views, very popular
[37:32.060 --> 37:36.300]  channel, and everybody celebrated it, and people are all over the news, I mean, I've
[37:36.300 --> 37:40.980]  got stacks of it here going, yay, yay, they're on our website, and the comment section, yay,
[37:40.980 --> 37:47.380]  we took down one of their, one of their YouTube's, yay, we did it, we hate free speech.
[37:47.380 --> 37:53.220]  This morning, all the strikes are gone, and it's back, because YouTube came out and told
[37:53.220 --> 38:00.780]  Bloomberg, we've had some rogue employees targeting conservatives, and we apologize,
[38:00.780 --> 38:05.460]  and you know why they're apologizing, because we have their executives on video saying they're
[38:05.460 --> 38:11.300]  blocking us because of our views, not for bullying, but never fear, they've got the
[38:11.300 --> 38:16.300]  young Turks coming out, calling it my anti-semitic meltdown, we'll play some of it, and it is
[38:16.300 --> 38:29.660]  incredible, they say I'm an anti-semi for saying George Soros worked with the Nazis.
[38:29.660 --> 38:35.500]  You talk about jumping the shark, ladies and gentlemen, Soros' father wrote a book, Soros
[38:35.500 --> 38:42.540]  wrote a book, and Soros was on 60 Minutes saying he helped round up Jews and felt no
[38:42.540 --> 38:46.500]  remorse, and we're going to play the clip next segment, and then I'm going to play
[38:46.500 --> 38:54.540]  Sink Uggur, who named his group after the young Turks, who killed over a million and
[38:54.540 --> 39:01.980]  a half Armenians, Christians, and he says it doesn't exist when it's totally recognized,
[39:01.980 --> 39:09.460]  the Associated Press wrote it about it at the time, and it's completely documented.
[39:09.460 --> 39:15.420]  But instead, the Los Angeles Armenian community loves him and donates to him on record and
[39:15.420 --> 39:18.340]  likes it.
[39:18.340 --> 39:25.980]  Talk about Stockholm syndrome, you talk about being cucks, shame on you, if you won't stand
[39:25.980 --> 39:30.460]  up for your own people, I will, because if somebody doesn't stand up for you, nobody
[39:30.460 --> 39:41.700]  stands up for me, and this whole electronic lynching, that's right, continuing.
[39:41.700 --> 39:45.140]  As we've exhaustively documented, Sweden is an authoritarian country that prosecutes
[39:45.140 --> 39:49.100]  people for satire and telling the truth, and it goes through 70-year-old people being put
[39:49.100 --> 39:54.460]  in jail on all the videos of it, and they have these diversity concerts, and then the
[39:54.460 --> 40:00.940]  women show up, and then the men line up 30, 40 deep and rape them, bloody, and the police
[40:00.940 --> 40:10.020]  do nothing, it's a religion of sacrifice in Europe, that's what Satanism is, is sacrificing
[40:10.020 --> 40:20.100]  your culture, giving in, being a cuck, on one end of it, hundreds protested in Sweden
[40:20.100 --> 40:23.460]  after police told women to stay inside or walk in pairs up a series of violent gang
[40:23.460 --> 40:29.180]  rapes of teenage girls, and the police chief came out and said, it's Muslims doing it,
[40:29.180 --> 40:34.580]  and that police chief got fired, and then Tommy Robinson, who was just on today earlier
[40:34.580 --> 40:40.500]  during the 24-hour broadcast, he's been banned off Twitter for saying the police statistic
[40:40.500 --> 40:48.020]  that 90-plus percent of pedophilia and raping girls, which is a myth, grooming as well, is
[40:48.020 --> 40:54.460]  Muslims, but so the Muslim radicals are really doing it, but then there's newspaper headlines
[40:54.460 --> 41:01.340]  everywhere saying that I hugged a woman once, which they thought was grooming, which wasn't
[41:01.340 --> 41:10.540]  even true, and that then becomes in Newsweek, sex assault.
[41:10.540 --> 41:16.100]  Think about that, but they just put the headline up hoping you just see the headline, see,
[41:16.100 --> 41:19.420]  hoping you just believe it. There's another clip on InfoWars where a professor comes over
[41:19.420 --> 41:26.740]  to a pro-gun table of a young student group that's checked it out and has it and is handing
[41:26.740 --> 41:32.540]  out information, and he says, oh, you're Russian-funded. The Second Amendment's Russian. It's Russian.
[41:32.540 --> 41:38.860]  Notice in that fake EEOC complaints put in against me by two employees that were dating.
[41:38.860 --> 41:45.820]  It says, and he was there with a Russian operative handling him. Just, oh, it's total proof. See,
[41:45.820 --> 41:51.900]  you know, it's like Hillary Clinton's lawyer. Her personal lawyer is the one that filed
[41:51.900 --> 41:56.380]  this on us, and you can just read it, and it's like, oh, throw a little bit of Russian
[41:56.380 --> 42:00.060]  in there. You're like, that's ridiculous. No, not to Democrat followers. They'll hear
[42:00.060 --> 42:06.860]  that and say, see? See, he's got Russians telling him what to do in the office. I want

[45:02.980 --> 45:08.060]  Victor, you're calling, go ahead. Yes, hi Alex first, I just want to mention,
[45:08.060 --> 45:13.860]  if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time. I've ordered
[45:13.860 --> 45:18.980]  several of the products over and over because it's amazing. In particular, silver bullet,
[45:18.980 --> 45:23.140]  I, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little
[45:23.140 --> 45:27.700]  raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet and it like, I'll still feel a little
[45:27.700 --> 45:32.340]  sick, but it won't last as long. And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the
[45:32.340 --> 45:36.540]  pollen block. Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people like you that then find
[45:36.540 --> 45:40.300]  the whole operation because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very
[45:40.300 --> 45:43.860]  small percentage of them buy a lot of the products. So thank you. But when you mentioned

[47:28.900 --> 47:36.020]  of those who look on and do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission you are the
[47:36.020 --> 47:44.820]  resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[47:44.820 --> 47:47.900]  So we've got a blueprint to bring the country back. The globalists know it and they're
[47:47.900 --> 47:52.900]  attacking us on every front savagely. It isn't about us though. It's about you and
[47:52.900 --> 47:56.660]  platforms where you still have free speech and they want to exhaust us. They want to
[47:56.660 --> 48:02.500]  wear us out but you're sick of hearing about censorship. They banned thousands of conservative
[48:02.500 --> 48:06.940]  and libertarian and Christian and veterans and gun sites on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube
[48:06.940 --> 48:16.460]  the last two weeks. But now thousands of them have come back and YouTube says we're sorry.
[48:16.460 --> 48:23.100]  Rogue employees did this and you didn't do what we said you did. Now you're not going
[48:23.100 --> 48:32.420]  to hear apologies from Stephen Colbert or Jordan Klepper or any of these comedians
[48:32.420 --> 48:37.580]  that read off teleprompters who pose as newsmen and their job is to murder truth. You're not
[48:37.580 --> 48:40.980]  going to hear apologies from CNN who's running the campaign. You're not going to hear apologies
[48:40.980 --> 48:45.100]  from SNBC. You're not going to hear apologies to you, the viewer and listener that they
[48:45.100 --> 48:50.740]  lied to. They knew those videos said there were not crisis actors. This was a real shooting.
[48:50.740 --> 48:58.460]  They banned a video that started like that. While the young man Mr. Hogg is on TV and
[48:58.460 --> 49:02.180]  on Twitter calling me a piece of you know what and calling me all these names and I'm
[49:02.180 --> 49:07.300]  saying young man please come on I'd like to politely debate you. I'm not going to talk
[49:07.300 --> 49:15.900]  to the likes of you that says nobody died. Using him to ban the free speech but because
[49:15.900 --> 49:26.140]  you stood up because you stood up to it because you got upset because Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com
[49:26.140 --> 49:32.700]  DrudgeReport.com because he did that and made it because Drudge cared. All the rest even
[49:32.700 --> 49:36.380]  the conservative and libertarian media thought oh well we'll have a competition out of the
[49:36.380 --> 49:43.700]  way of Alex Falls. No I'd be a domino. You'd be next. But Drudge day after day he linked
[49:43.700 --> 49:51.620]  yesterday to how they banned Corsi and they put it back up today and apologized. See Drudge
[49:51.620 --> 49:59.700]  has rational self-preservation traits. He's not a moron. But even the conservative sides
[49:59.700 --> 50:05.100]  cheered even the Washington Times kind of cheered like yay yay let's start banning
[50:05.100 --> 50:14.660]  things we'll get more attention you morons. They're going to shut you up next you idiots.
[50:14.660 --> 50:20.260]  I mean they really are idiots. Don't you know governments always pick some group first that
[50:20.260 --> 50:26.740]  they want to demonize to set the precedent. Then they end up arresting people. Are you
[50:26.740 --> 50:38.500]  really that historically illiterate. What is your problem. Well yet again Drudge pulls
[50:38.500 --> 50:43.340]  the bacon out of the fire and you pulled the bacon out of the fire. By the way Drudge pulled
[50:43.340 --> 50:46.700]  his own bacon out. I want to explain that. Not to say you didn't do something good didn't
[50:46.700 --> 50:59.860]  have courage in a world of cowards just doing the right thing is heroic. But he's not satanic
[50:59.860 --> 51:05.860]  you see a satanic mindset doesn't even get its own preservation it wants one level one
[51:05.860 --> 51:14.940]  dimensional somebody's going down that makes me bigger no that makes you smaller ding ding.
[51:14.940 --> 51:18.300]  I want to get to the young Turks bizarre deception I can't play the whole thing it's like eight
[51:18.300 --> 51:25.020]  minutes long. These are the people that are funded by Qatar and other Gulf state dictatorships
[51:25.020 --> 51:33.780]  and name themselves after the brown shirt paramilitary that Hitler modeled the S.A. off
[51:33.780 --> 51:38.780]  of he modeled it up Benito Mussolini and the young Turks Hitler wrote this you can look
[51:38.780 --> 51:45.500]  it up the the the S.A. the thugs in the streets the paramilitary before Hitler took power
[51:45.500 --> 51:51.860]  the gangs were modeled after the young Turks and he's a Turk with the name young Turk
[51:51.860 --> 52:00.300]  and and and Islamist is funding and then he gets up there and he says George Soros I'm
[52:00.300 --> 52:05.220]  anti-Semitic because I said George Soros was a Nazi collaborator George Soros said he's
[52:05.220 --> 52:11.660]  proud that he survived by doing that so so let me see if a foreign country occupied and
[52:11.660 --> 52:16.260]  then I help round up my own family so I'd live I'd be called a collaborator I'd be called
[52:16.260 --> 52:19.820]  the lowest form of scum worse than the people that came in and took over because they're
[52:19.820 --> 52:27.540]  bad they're usurpers but you're a traitor and by some bizarre alchemy that they've got
[52:27.540 --> 52:33.220]  PR out there CNN ABC news that was go Alex Jones lies and says George Soros was a Nazi
[52:33.220 --> 52:36.500]  collaborator I don't know his dad wrote a book he wrote a book he went on 60 minutes
[52:36.500 --> 52:41.060]  trying to hide it in plain view back in what 1999 when he thought everybody was so dumb
[52:41.060 --> 52:52.820]  they just buy into it and that was his job in his 1415 16 was rounding Jews up in Hungary
[52:52.820 --> 53:03.540]  and then he's got the nerve to point his finger and then have a young Turk a young Turk it's
[53:03.540 --> 53:12.140]  all hiding in plain view how'd you like a rubber faces in it a young Turk an arrogant
[53:12.140 --> 53:22.180]  dim-witted buffoon oh but there's no there's no connection to the Nazis with George Soros
[53:22.180 --> 53:30.220]  and it's anti-Semitic I've attacked a Holocaust survivor next we'll hear Hitler was a Holocaust
[53:30.220 --> 53:34.020]  did you know Hitler was a Holocaust survivor according to this logic I think that's terrible
[53:34.020 --> 53:37.020]  I don't think he was a Holocaust survivor I don't think Heinrich Himmler was a Holocaust
[53:37.020 --> 53:45.780]  survivor I don't think Zeb Dietrich was a Holocaust survivor or Klaus Barbie Joseph
[53:45.780 --> 53:54.340]  Mengele perhaps I know the Nazi survivor of Nazi wealth is the head of the unelected
[53:54.340 --> 54:03.740]  EU Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Junker let's I'm running out of time here here let's go to this clip
[54:03.740 --> 54:10.540]  of Soros first it's the claim that the the August protest was some sort of a left-wing
[54:10.540 --> 54:14.580]  plot who he might ask would say something so offensive an elected representative who's
[54:14.580 --> 54:18.900]  serving right now in the U.S. Congress and look at the background George Soros is one
[54:18.900 --> 54:24.140]  of those people that actually helps you know back these individuals who is my understanding
[54:24.140 --> 54:31.140]  is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted
[54:31.140 --> 54:36.620]  god son yes yes went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the
[54:36.620 --> 54:51.420]  Jews that side was it difficult but not not at all do you think George Soros funded the
[54:51.420 --> 54:56.260]  neo-nazis who marched in wouldn't be interesting to find out these conspiracy theories were
[54:56.260 --> 55:03.620]  first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones is this lost on anyone George Soros is a famous
[55:03.620 --> 55:11.180]  Nazi collaborator but now let's hear from the young Turk named after a genocidal organization
[55:11.180 --> 55:15.980]  can't make this up let's hear from him Alex Jones has received a considerable criticism
[55:15.980 --> 55:22.460]  for first of all everything as he should he's lunatic makes a wild conspiracy theories about
[55:22.460 --> 55:29.300]  pig bear human hybrids and and on top of that he's deeply anti-semitic now why do I say
[55:29.300 --> 55:36.500]  that for a number of reasons he has attacked George Soros over and over again with references
[55:36.500 --> 55:40.420]  to his background he attacked Michael Wolf who wrote the book about Donald Trump they
[55:40.420 --> 55:46.980]  both having to be Jewish should pause back that up since Michael Wolf writes this book
[55:46.980 --> 55:56.260]  everybody criticizes him he's Jewish and so I'm attacking Jews because George Soros is
[55:56.260 --> 56:00.660]  a Jew who worked with the Nazis so it's anti-semitic talk about him this is a get out of jail
[56:00.660 --> 56:04.460]  free cars what he's saying Wolf writes this phony book everybody decries it he's known
[56:04.460 --> 56:10.500]  in New York as a fraud and then well I mean just hear it from sink himself here it is
[56:10.500 --> 56:16.780]  over and over again with references to his background he attacked Michael Wolf who wrote
[56:16.780 --> 56:22.420]  the book about Donald Trump they both having to be Jewish he will you'll see it in a second
[56:22.420 --> 56:28.660]  as well says the Soros worked with the Nazis it's just like to say someone who I don't
[56:28.660 --> 56:33.380]  know if you know the Soros survived the Holocaust Alex Jones the worst guy on earth anyway we're
[56:33.380 --> 56:39.140]  gonna get to what happened today in a second but in his midst of his lunatic attacks against
[56:39.140 --> 56:44.500]  Americans of Jewish descent he started with Michael Wolf this is a little while back and
[56:44.500 --> 56:49.100]  they should give you some context and he said oh Michael Wolf he looks bad and then he put
[56:49.100 --> 56:53.020]  up a picture of Brian Seltzer started railing on him and saying that he looks like Michael
[56:53.020 --> 56:58.860]  Wolf and they're all the same now Brian Seltzer's not even Jewish I say they have psycho looking
[56:58.860 --> 57:03.460]  smiles and and and so do other people that we black people like we never this is just
[57:03.460 --> 57:07.340]  so desperate so weird anyways I'm gonna come back up a little bit more of it then we've
[57:07.340 --> 57:11.300]  got Larry Pratt is really upset with Trump he really concerned never seemed was concerned

[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:33.660]  day it is the resistance to globalism and i'm your host alex jones so the young turk
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:45.340]  sink the gulf state dictatorship funded al gore funded creature that's where the old prune
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:51.540]  caught line caught with fake memos of course as well the other fake newsman dan rather
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:58.660]  now floats around over in that cesspit of the young turkeys and i really shouldn't joke
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:03.380]  about this because it's so serious i can't believe it they've got all over the news saying
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:10.740]  george soros never helped the nazis and that i'm lying attacking a holocaust survivor
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:17.460]  this is so sick but see their followers will believe anything so think of the logic he helped
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.020]  for years round up jews because he was a teenager and he could get in and find their hiding spots
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.060]  and get them to tell them where their money was and claim that they were going to get
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:31.580]  them out and then they take their money and give them over the nazis and then give the
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.420]  money to the nazis and keep part of it and they got super rich off that and that's where
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:40.620]  george soros came from man you talk about having some baggage and being whacked out
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:48.380]  and being screwed up and then you got a guy named after a genocidal organization who denies
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.780]  that the young turkeys ever killed any christian armenians they killed a million and a half
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.940]  of them that's not admitted on there saying i'm the worst person in the world well guess
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:02.780]  what sink you can't shut me up buddy and i've got over 200 radio stations and all these
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:10.540]  tv stations and we are kicking your political behind up and down the street buddy you know
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.580]  george soros might actually be one of the worst people in the world but you say i'm one of
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:20.740]  the worst people in the world even though they've had hundreds of investigative reporters
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:25.540]  hundreds usually sounds like an exaggeration saying i mean it's probably thousands crawling
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:32.500]  up and down doing everything they can to try to find somebody to tell lies or to twist
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:37.660]  things and i was just thinking about the latest stuff and it actually made me feel sorry for
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:43.020]  the individuals because they're being used but i have to do what i have to do and i just
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:48.980]  thought about some of the sad issues that those folks have and i just i actually feel
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:54.100]  sorry for them but it makes me even more angry at the globalist it's crazy but this is the
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:58.460]  level of deception we're dealing with so let's go back to the young turks and leader here
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.820]  he is and then he put up a picture of brian stelter started railing on him and saying
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.700]  that he looks like michael wolf and they're all the same now as it turns out brian stelter
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.500]  is not jewish but of course i'll show i never said brian stelter was jewish see how the
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:17.500]  deceptions are so fast you have to like listen every three seconds he goes oh look michael
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:24.180]  wolf jewish look at look how he looks and say that i said these guys have these crazy

[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.180]  again oh now i called him jewish but he's not see oh see alex is wrong again he's just
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:06.940]  lie to your audience every word let's go back to mr. turd yes we're done he doesn't know
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.980]  he's like look at him so in fact here let's show you the video but just look at stelter
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.900]  again to put him on screen i think this all the broadcast should be is just a photo of

[01:06:54.220 --> 01:07:06.380]  the mind of man the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:15.740]  well i've been interviewing larry pratt for 20 years at least 20 years and i've never
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.780]  seen him as concerned as when he was on last night during the marathon broadcast that we're
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:26.540]  now into what hour 30 of we'll be back this sunday 4 to 6 p.m. with a sunday transmission
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:32.900]  we're 10 hours a day live now with david night his great transmission the david night program
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.300]  and then you've got in fours lives there's truly alex jones and you've got owens shroyer
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:41.620]  in the war room with roger shone and others we're going to go to larry in a moment from
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:46.740]  godowners.org and he was very very very concerned about trump we're going to play some of these
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:52.340]  clips and really look at the backlash i think trump has knocked a big dent in his aura of
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.700]  being this guy that totally delivers and never backs off because it was one thing to say
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:08:00.060]  we'll look at amnesty for some dreamers because he'd always said they've been here decades
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:03.820]  and weren't criminals we could fast track that that's reasonable the democrats came
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:09.180]  back and said we want total open borders total you know 20 deep chain migration just unending
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:14.620]  so the whole thing was killed but see he always said he would be reasonable and that was reasonable
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:20.460]  he didn't do that with this he said no we're not going to you know repeal any of this it's
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:23.900]  the criminals and now we've got all these clips i don't think i need to play them again but
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:29.740]  just so we so we have them let's play a few and then go to larry pratt trump i like taking
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:35.100]  the guns early then do process i mean as you turn into diane feinstein did you get a brain
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:40.740]  transplant here it is i take the firearms first and then go to court because that's
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.580]  another system because a lot of times by the time you go to court it takes so long to go
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:52.420]  to court to get the due process procedures i like taking the guns early like in this crazy
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:58.420]  man's case it just took place in florida he had a lot of fires they saw everything to
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.420]  go to court would have taken a long time so you could do exactly what you're saying but
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:06.700]  take the guns first go through due process that that is the dream of the gun grabbers
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.820]  that's actually bloomberg's plan this is just they just say oh you you see a psychologist
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:15.580]  you can't have guns no there's already laws you say i'm going to kill people and the police

[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:25.220]  shooting of the church he'd been in a mental institution he escaped he had a dishonorable
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.580]  discharge and he went and bought the guns they didn't put the database they need to court
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:33.180]  marshal the commanding officer over that and they'll start getting that the database i'm
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:37.780]  going to learn perhaps what we got him on but i can't even hardly play these clips the
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:42.060]  other ones let's play the feinstein wicked witch at the west garbage because it's it's
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:48.860]  just unbelievable here it is add that to this bill that would be great to end if you could

[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.700]  of states have just always say this we're going to get it passed we're going to get
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:24.900]  it passed if you can add domestic violence paragraphs pages into this bill i'm all for
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:29.540]  it it's already there mr. president so i know what he's doing he's taking the you know what
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:33.540]  out of them as they say in england but you can't do something because it advances their
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.620]  flawed fake system when they're admitting they want abolition of the second amendment
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:41.460]  is the goal piece by piece larry pratt gunners of america thank you for joining us and you're
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:48.100]  busy busy man what is the state of the situation right now let me just comment on one thing
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:56.100]  the president was saying you've already expressed a correct outrage for him to say we're going
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:02.420]  to take care of due process after we've grabbed you and thrown you in the clink what and he
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:11.300]  referred to the dirt bag down in florida were thirty nine times the police came to his house
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:17.900]  they didn't do a thing why would we think that somehow being able to throw somebody
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:24.740]  in jail fixes something that was not a problem until their own sloppiness and lack of desire
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:30.420]  to interact with people that have been reported by who knows how many neighbors and people
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:39.380]  at school this was a bad dude and apparently everybody knew it except the sheriff so don't
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:43.620]  don't talk about clearly a stand down and we need to be on offense that they had all
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:48.820]  the warnings he was on the drugs they stood down all the defaults were not followed we
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:53.300]  have the protections in place and as you said they're always trying to keep us from having
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:59.260]  select teachers armed which is the answer that sure is the answer and isn't it interesting
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:05.860]  that except for congressman massie and maybe a couple of senators you just don't hear anybody
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:10.820]  talking about arming teachers they're the ones that are going to be there during the
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:16.740]  first five six minutes of a dirt bags attack that's when most of the people get killed
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:22.260]  sometimes that's all that's all it lasts is five or six minutes and we're not talking
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:26.460]  about arming teachers now to the president's credit he didn't say he would support that
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.860]  but he's also supporting that the shredding of the second what's the word on capitol hill
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.220]  i know you got feelers out is he just doing like doc and being reasonable and then they
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.940]  won't be reasonable he's not really being reasonable he's playing along with their
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:44.140]  false logic what what are your time you got some of the top lobbyist you know in the halls
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:48.900]  right now what in Haiti's is going on and what are the republican lawmakers saying well
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:54.540]  we're still hoping that this is a faint the way it was in doc and that he's ultimately
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:13:00.940]  going to spring the trap and the situation will be resolved but it doesn't sound that
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:06.180]  way because he's used different language on this he doesn't have he hasn't talked about
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:14.260]  how he might be able to walk about to walk it back so we think this is a big big deal
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:20.100]  and we hope people will continue to as many times a day as they can manage contact the
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:24.780]  white house to tell them that this is the end of the second amendment and it will also
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:33.740]  if you carry this out be the end of the republican party they're going to get wiped out in 2018
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:38.980]  elections if this is what they have brought to the table for the voters to judge them
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:46.580]  on they will be judged and found wanting this is an incredible betrayal and the president
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:53.740]  seems to be rather more serious about this than he was with DACA again I'm still leaving
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:59.140]  the door open at least a crack hopefully the president is gaming this but it increasingly
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:04.780]  doesn't sound that way it was and even if he's trying to set a trap it was a very reckless
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:10.700]  thing to say man I just feel like I'm not I'm not put on an actor I just felt nauseous
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.460]  I mean I have been so committed he's done so much good it means Larry they must have
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:19.300]  been compromising he's been fighting so hard and they're just all around him and he's been
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:24.380]  good my gut knows he's good and and my gut thinks they're turning him I I think what
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:30.140]  you think my gut tells me this is so sad Larry the way we've seen him and I think I mentioned
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:35.500]  this last night is that the president is not a conservative we've never heard him refer
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:41.220]  to prominent conservative thinkers he doesn't express himself as if he's looking at the
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:50.220]  economy as Ludwig von Mises might a famous libertarian economist the guy has been a fighter
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:56.180]  against the establishment Republican and Democrat alike and when he was doing that most of the
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:00.700]  time we would be saying right on those are good things that you're opposing and fighting
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:08.300]  for and he came across as a fighter and hopefully he still is but now we're we're talking about
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:14.540]  a major turn where he doesn't seem to have a rudder because it would he doesn't seem
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.980]  to be a concern for the first time I read CNN headlines this morning and some of them
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:22.500]  were true they're basically saying he's rudderless and he's become suddenly become rudderless
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.500]  let's come back in the last segment and ask why and what do we do but here's the good
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:29.740]  news Larry Pratt's not gonna roll over I don't care what they do to me you see what they're
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:33.220]  doing to me folks it's a hundred percent fake I'm not rolling over Ted Nugent's not rolling

[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.380]  thing you heard from somebody because you want to sit there with a bunch of grieving

[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:16.700]  testing ID stronghold wallets go through so how did the designer brands do I expected

[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:26.620]  wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.860]  that they do get a stronghold on your credit cards license and other critical data with

[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:38.420]  waging war on corruption alex jones the big question for larry prapp we're going to
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:46.060]  him in just one moment got owners dot org is what is the political calculus when the
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:51.620]  left is already been so brainwashed to hate trump and reagan democrats are still gonna
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:59.220]  vote for trump if he delivers on the economy which he is all you do is turn your base off
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:06.020]  and demoralize them to not fight when he already re-announced his campaign at 900 days out
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:12.140]  980 some days out because they're already campaign against him he needs his base fired
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:19.340]  up engage foaming at the mouth not disillusioned and maybe the calculus is if they do this
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:23.220]  with everybody awake because now maybe the second amendment's under attack maybe it's
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:27.340]  super sophisticated 3d chess I mean I can kind of war game this but I don't think that's
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:31.260]  what it is I think it's him trying to get points with the press to get them off his
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:35.940]  back and I think that'll just make him intensify george w bush rat you know the ratified and
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.260]  assigned on to biden's all the assault weapons stuff it's republicans that keep giving us

[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:11.660]  have to put into motion here because let me tell you this is like a James Bond movie around
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:17.300]  here and we we we've got to have counterintelligence intelligence we've got to have it all this
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.500]  isn't this is the info war and we're at this level now where it's every day I have to make
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.540]  the right decisions or we go down which will be its own spectacular victory against the
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.380]  global's that's gonna blow up really big if they kill me or set me up or whatever I mean
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.260]  it's just we see them launch the attack and then the support comes but what's scary is
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:37.860]  it's like spiritual it's always just enough to beat them and it's always just enough just
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:41.340]  and I'm like God we had a whole bunch more money we could really beat them or we or you
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:46.700]  know it's always just enough just enough just enough so you guys it's like magic you just
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:52.980]  come through with exactly what we need never really more and I it's it's it's it's God
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.900]  going back to Larry you've got the floor of the last four minutes I appreciate you holding
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:00.260]  while I plug keep us afloat here down under that or G and you have the number out as well
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:04.900]  in closing you heard my points what does what's the calculus I mean even he was Machiavelli
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:10.980]  he's winning why is he doing this and what do we do to get him back on the straight narrow
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:16.020]  well the folks go to gun owners dot org they can give a substantial boost to getting the
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:23.180]  president back in line getting back on the rails gun owners dot org you can sign up right
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:29.340]  link from the front page to get the free email alerts and there what enable you to be like
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:33.500]  Paul Revere you can just spread the word and you can get your email sent up from what we
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:38.700]  send you and the whole thing probably takes less than 30 seconds now the battle that we're
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:43.780]  fighting right now besides trying to get the president back on the rails is to stop the
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:49.900]  gun bill that's in the Congress because they're talking about putting Diane Feinstein semi-automatic
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:57.780]  ban on what at one time was a good piece of legislation that's some time ago now but the
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:03.020]  that I think they've if they really try to do that would almost certainly be an important
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:10.860]  mistake because they would be putting something up or they may not even have 40 votes for
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:17.540]  that measure and if they they will then leave their tank a fourth the bridge and it's going
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:22.980]  to block the ability of other measures in the gun control agenda to get across that
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:29.180]  bridge so we think that they if they proceed that way they're likely to find that they've
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:34.900]  shot themselves in the foot and let's hope that we can indeed pull that off and once
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:41.220]  we're in that posture once it's the Feinstein bill they're blocking somebody awesome senator
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:46.340]  a good guy has to do is say I object to the next move which would be to get around it
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:54.380]  to set aside bring up other gun control measures one person saying I object and the whole enterprise
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:27:00.260]  gets shut down and we can hold them in that position for a fairly long period of time
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:07.140]  while we continue hopefully to build our own support our own forces who would have thought
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:13.100]  because he did the right thing after Vegas and pointed out that it was all illegal what
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:18.540]  happened there was a stand down Islamic connections you name it and then it and then the media
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:23.340]  backed off because the story fell apart whatever really happened and then now with this this
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:28.220]  is blood in the water I've got a it looks like an exclusive about another county with
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:32.980]  our connections in Florida where another person says they're going to shoot people as a democrat
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:39.620]  sheriff and the reporters they've let the person go so I mean I just it just continues
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:44.900]  to happen doesn't Trump understand that this will destroy him does he understand that the
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:49.500]  base isn't going to put up with us you would think the answer that would be of course he
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:55.700]  understands that but right now the question is legitimate because what he's done is certainly
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:28:01.020]  not helpful to himself and unless he has some plan as I was mentioning earlier to game the
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:07.660]  democrats and some of the anti-gun republicans he's headed down the wrong path and he'd better
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:12.580]  for sure have a way back to where he came from because otherwise it's not going to end
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.900]  well politically for him at all well exactly in fine sight and others body language was
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.900]  just they were in ecstasy because her own party's about to throw her overboard this makes her
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:25.900]  look strong to go ahead and get the nomination yeah rubbing her hands go like a giant rat
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:30.660]  and so I mean there's a wicked witch of the West it's an incredible photo I'm so glad
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:35.140]  you got it well sir if it wasn't for gun owners at org because I was there watching it to keep

[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:30.420]  and i've talked to the veritas and all the other people that caught them on video youtube
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:34.580]  saying our job is to censor alex jones people like him and they have facebook and twitter
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:41.180]  employees going also american flags and veterans just veterans are called dumb rednecks black
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:47.380]  white hispanic you're scum too you really realize these people these they're globalist
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:53.900]  they think of everybody who's pro america as some dumb idiot they got video from campus
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:58.820]  reform where a professor one of the head professors of the university walks over and goes oh i see
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:06.140]  your paid by the russians and it's it's in our a stuff an antisocialism pamphlets and
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:10.860]  pro gun pamphlets and then the guy sits there and debates them and goes i really know that
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:16.860]  you're russians and then this fake eoc complain about me they just with ripp that hillary clinton's
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:21.900]  it's hillary's former personal lawyer he brags about it he worked for her when he got out
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:30.580]  of college at georgetown and was her personal assistant and then a lawyer for her he says
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.900]  i'm a you know a liar and all this stuff and that this this eoc thing will just add
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:42.500]  to all that so he makes a political statement in it and then they say that i have a russian
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:49.100]  operative that handles me in the eoc report i mean folks you know how desperate they are
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.460]  that they're now putting an eoc complaint that there are russians yes daria was born
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:59.460]  in russia yes she's an army veteran yes she's a patriot and it's so crazy how about discriminatory
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:05.780]  they're saying we're bad because someone born in russia works here and that's the proof
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:11.140]  and again she's a combat veteran whole nine yards honorably discharged you honorably serve
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:18.140]  your country and you are a russian background and you are the devil and you are just convicted
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:23.020]  i was going to mike sternovich because he is i was thinking about him like three days
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:29.900]  ago i'm not kidding i'm sitting there at night driving home i'm thinking about him well he
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:32.700]  had the idea to protest google i mean we've done it before as well but he had the idea
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.660]  we have to get out there with our censorship and then they had the whole charlotte fil thing
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:40.380]  and then google said oh people are planning to attack us so we knew it was a setup so we
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:45.260]  cancelled them but i was thinking about it and then i get home and the text comes in saying
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:48.300]  hey we got to do this for our lives we got to fight for the first amendment right here
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:51.740]  this is the takeover you got to do it alex and so he's been busy the last few days he's
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:55.260]  we've got him on to talk about it he's absolutely right stop by south west is coming up a couple
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:59.140]  weeks in austin they're all going to be here and he wants to coordinate this from behind
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:01.980]  the scenes so they don't know and we're coming when you're coming and i think he's a good
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:06.860]  leader so i'm gonna let him honcho this but i'm gonna work with him but watch this channel
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:09.980]  when the south by southwest is going on for what we're gonna do it's gonna be legal and
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:16.100]  lawful but they're so scared of us physically showing up because they they they only want
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:20.860]  cyber control they're they're totally afraid of grass roots so mike sort of what would
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:25.980]  you say historically the point we've reached now with just this whole cornucopia of insanity
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:30.940]  and trump's starting to go sideways and but our youtube course his youtube channel was
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:35.420]  taken down they put it back up today youtube apologizes and said we have rogues i mean
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:41.820]  well what is what this is a real civil war in the country well alex i'm usually a positive
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:48.460]  and upbeat guy but i'm not positive and upbeat about this it's life or death now this isn't
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:52.980]  the usual oh we're under it we're always under attack this isn't the usual we're under an
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:58.380]  attack thank you the support share links no no no this is we're done we're off the internet

[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:10.420]  to ban christians from facebook what they're doing now is if you write christian content
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:16.420]  on facebook snopes will say well we're fact checking this and this actually isn't true
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:22.020]  and then facebook threatened to ban a christian website called the babel on b they do satire
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:29.380]  and jokes because snopes fact checked a satirical funny article to ban them so this is not about

[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:05.940]  even matter if all you do is christian comedy so this is not a joke this is not a fun thing
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:10.380]  and and and by the way the first method is church all over the country is is removing
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:14.540]  crosses because they're offensive in europe they're moving crosses from catholic churches
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:19.980]  presbyterian baptist this is a total ecumenical un global takeover the popes are globalist
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:24.900]  they're making their moves are absolutely right and i meant to mention that all over christian
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.100]  youtube's prager universities in a lawsuit because they're trying to ban them and have
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:34.900]  banned them very professional very loving very very well done very very fatherly that's

[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:46.620]  and notice google assistant says christ is a fictional character so yes this is an assault
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:52.420]  one this is crazy you should think google facebook twitter would want one of the biggest minorities
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:57.020]  in the country now christians you know of every group to to be on their platforms but no they
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:02.860]  want to socially control you this is incredible yeah they want to take away our guns they
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:06.820]  want to take away our free speech and they want to put christians in death camps and
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:12.060]  they can clip that snippet but they'll never argue it they'll never say oh they'll go oh
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:15.540]  look cernivish claims they want death camps why why do they want to take away our guns
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.740]  and why do they want to take away our free speech rights and our rights to peaceably
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.380]  assemble and censor us what is the end game of that they want to bankrupt people they
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:28.180]  want to ruin people's reputations they want to destroy people they went after pamela
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:33.940]  galler's daughters for jewish women merely because of who her mom is these girls are
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:38.700]  now facing death threats from jihadis this is not a joke alix this is not a fun thing
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:42.540]  well i know that jihadis are the foot soldiers of the left now they mean we now know they
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:47.940]  are the muscle yeah so people go oh mike you've been a little somber lately you've
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.820]  been a little well right because i'm a realistic person and i know that they want us murdered
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:57.060]  they want us killed now and it isn't just you and me and people on the front lines now
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:01.700]  if you're a listener and you're just a christian who wants to tell some jokes and have fun with
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:07.820]  your friends and maybe go to church on sundays and pray you're now a target by facebook you're
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:12.260]  now a target by snopes they will do everything they can to run you off the internet they will
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.980]  do everything they can to disarm you they're saying that we want to disarm you we want
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:19.980]  to take away your free speech rights they want to take away every means we have to fight
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:25.300]  back that is how you have a holocaust that is how you have whole positive death camps
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:30.100]  that's how you have the so and my client as you know snopes the young turks media matters
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:34.260]  is all funded by george soros who are all now saying he's a holocaust survivor and then
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:38.460]  i'm defaming him that he fought the nazis when he was admittedly a nazi collaborator
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:43.500]  in his own words it's next level snopes runs it all and everywhere in front of our stuff
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:48.100]  your stuff they put snopes even in front of fox news and then snopes just says this is
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.180]  not true snopes basically says a muslim didn't attack a few months ago with a truck in new
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:58.140]  york i mean they just do whatever they want yeah well and the latest and that's why i
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:04.300]  think the attack on the babel on b is really such an important thing because as you know
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:10.300]  youtube has given me a community guideline strike because i uploaded a video of a protest
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:16.100]  by antifa not anything that i said not anything that i've done all i did was journalistically
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:21.300]  uploaded a video of a protest of antifa and facebook has issued me a community guideline
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:25.980]  strike and censored my channel they're going after journalism because they don't want this
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:31.500]  is what i have to tell the christians i have you have to listen antifa and jihadis are
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:37.300]  the foot soldiers of the left and that is why youtube is banning anyone if you report
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:42.100]  on antifa they don't want the christians to know because eventually antifa their protest
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:45.540]  and me and albs they're coming for you they're coming for your church they they they come

[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:00.340]  defense of the second amendment in defense of internet freedom that was the promo that
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:06.340]  we put out and then we got banned on youtube and they reinstated us they were blocking
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:12.420]  us uploading and they banned our sub channels they banned dr. coursey's dc channel which

[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:25.660]  from him that's what this is all about is building these economies is how we're going to turn
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:30.300]  things around but Mike let's get into your your idea absolutely we got a protest Google
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:34.420]  we got a protest out by Southwest you're going to come when having a studio you've got some
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:38.220]  ideas I was already planning to do it but I'm going to do it a few unannounced times
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:41.660]  and things I'm just leaving it that as you know the inside documents say I'm banned from
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:47.900]  their campus what do we need to do to take this to the next level to fight back yeah
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:53.300]  we need all of our people and this is not optional this is a red alert because again
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:52:00.020]  it's just not about Alex or me or anybody else it is about the war on Christians again
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:05.860]  when Facebook is threatening Christian comedy websites with censure and banning that tells
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:11.460]  you all you need to know about what is going on all of these anti-Christian anti-freedom
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:16.700]  tech companies are going to be in South by Southwest so legally and lawfully we need
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:21.500]  to show up and just peacefully assemble and ask them why do you hate Christians why do
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:27.260]  you censor websites why do you not allow honest reporting on a Tifa or do you endorse political
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:32.020]  violence do you endorse what is happening on the streets and we need to again peacefully
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:37.020]  and lawfully just ask these tech companies at South by Southwest why do you hate Christians
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:41.580]  why do you want to censor people why do you support Lewis Farrakhan and the nation of
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:47.060]  Islam which hates Jews because everybody tries to always say oh you know Cernovich and Jones
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:51.860]  we love we love the Jewish people we love Israel we we have no problems at all this is nonsense
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:58.420]  and a lie but Lewis Farrakhan and Keith Ellison they actually are anti-Semites Lewis Farrakhan
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:02.940]  gave a speech where he said Keith Ellison was a member of us at the nation of Islam
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:08.380]  this is his speech this is an Alex and me conspiracy theory this is actually real life
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:14.020]  and Farrakhan had said if you want the door open you got to wait for a Jew to open it
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:19.260]  for you this is Lewis Farrakhan not me not Alex Keith Ellison nevertheless holds up
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:25.260]  the antifa handbook supports domestic terrorism he supports anti-Semitism so the people who
[01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:30.340]  hate the Jewish people are not us they're not real Americans because we tolerate everybody
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:35.060]  I was about to say have you seen the young Turks saying that I'm anti-Semitic for saying
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:39.060]  George Soros was a Nazi collaborator and that because I said Brian Stelter has a crazy
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:43.460]  look and smile I'm anti-Semitic and I said he was a Jew I never said any of that the
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:48.460]  level of crazy lying is just insane how much can they turn it up from here I think you're
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:53.380]  right I think it's just they want to kill us yeah well that's the issue is they want
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:59.420]  to lie about us without us being able to tell the truth and the young Turks their engagement
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:04.420]  is terrible they don't get views like they used to and and by the way we should ask Google
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.700]  why do you promote sync have you read what sync and his partner wrote about 14 year old
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:15.460]  girl they said well they said women are subhuman and genetically mutants and because they don't
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:19.260]  all want to have sex with him and then he talked about young 15 year old girls in the
[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:24.620]  house I'm not gonna say what he said well what do you expect from you know this is
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:29.820]  long as this didn't fall too far from the tree yeah so we should ask you to why is
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:35.260]  it that you promote most heavily somebody who referred to 15 year old girls as again
[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:40.300]  I can't say it don't say it or they'll say we're bullying but yeah yeah that's what they
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:44.620]  said though so that we quote them and then we get banned I mean this is the level we're
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:48.260]  at and Mike you're a lawyer though don't you agree I've talked to top lawyers and they
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:51.700]  say no you've got the suit now that's why YouTube's backed off because they know we're
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:55.300]  not playing games we have them all the whole chain saying they're censoring saying it's
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:55:00.340]  for political laughing about it and now they're backing off at least on you know me they should
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:03.980]  back off on you and others but that's because we fought back as a lawyer is this not torches
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:09.940]  interference well it's antitrust there's a number of things that you want Facebook and
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:14.500]  Google control 88% of the advertising market their big weaknesses the antitrust exactly
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:18.620]  but what I mean is CNN admitting that they're involved with YouTube trying to shut me down
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:22.540]  another company involved with a third party trying to shut someone down is that not torches
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:28.460]  interference that's definitely unfair business practices for sure it's conspiring against
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:33.980]  you so yeah there they're major lawsuits to be had that said the number one priority
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:38.820]  is to get us banned they want to do it while you fall asleep right you fall asleep you
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:43.660]  wake up your band oh we can't do anything about that's how it always is then they want to
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:48.180]  take all the Christians and round up all the Christians just like Facebook is now having
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:52.980]  snow Facebook is now putting Christians in ghettos just like Matt drugs predicted I can't
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:58.740]  believe how did drugs predict all this well he knew I'll tell you what else I do not like
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:02.980]  politics all I ever cared about was going to the gym lifting weights and doing my grill
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:08.220]  and mindset stuff and then I read a book on the Cambodian genocide which the media never
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:14.940]  talks about because it was left wing and a big presence he supported it yes I saw the
[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:20.260]  parallels between the killing fields what was happening in Cambodia that is the path
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:25.060]  that we're on today and when I read that book I actually cried I was member I was traveling
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:29.380]  through Cambodia and you know learning about the people in the culture I read the book
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:34.020]  survived on the killing fields I was crying and I realized I have to get involved because
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:38.780]  if I don't if you were in Cambodia you just thought well you know I'm just a middle class
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:44.220]  person or I'm just a regular person I'm going to sit this right if you had glasses you were
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:51.740]  dead yeah so now if you're if you are a Christian they're going to put you in the killing fields
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:56.860]  are coming that's all I can say is that anybody who studied history knows that the only reason
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:01.260]  you want to censor and disarm people is so that they are powerless and helpless and you
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:05.580]  can take them away into the night and put them in the gulag yes it's a formulae every
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:09.580]  time they're following an exact plan Europe's about two years ahead of us you're Mike you're
[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:13.220]  right we're you're not just saying this they're following an exact plan so I'm going to come
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:16.620]  back and talk about the Google protest people to be ready for this we're not announcing
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:21.980]  it yet and then other solutions with Mike Sarnovich from the guerrilla mindset absolutely
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:25.980]  essential people that you realize this is happening and that's the reason we've got
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:30.220]  patriots in government that are more and more working with us because they understand that
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:35.060]  wow you conspiracy theorists were right this is an authoritarian takeover you bet so let's
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:39.340]  all get together and let's stop this let's come together we can do it I can feel it I
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:44.180]  can feel it right now I know the spirit of liberty is rising that's why the enemy is

[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:42.780]  if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:54.740]  country back you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:25.540]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:30.900]  to Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:36.740]  They say that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it I am a novice historian
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:44.980]  I've read 800 books on history I probably listened to another 100 or 200 or more actually
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:50.380]  I think about on the treadmill or I need to start doing that again I used to listen to
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:57.340]  historical you know screeds while I was exercising I'll admit the last seven eight nine years
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:04.020]  I've been so busy I don't read history anymore but I have that body of knowledge and there's
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:09.500]  no doubt that we've got an authoritarian system and now that they're getting it in place they're
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:17.620]  hyping up the left is the chosen instrument worldwide to bully and attack and kill everybody
[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:23.620]  else Mike Cernovich is back I guess he thought it was a longer break because I know the end
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:27.140]  of the hour is only two minutes not four like the others but Mike is back and I just wanted
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:30.900]  to he's got the idea and I agree we need to get on the street and that just means you
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:35.180]  with a sandwich board out there a bumper sticker or whatever it is but we need to have some
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:40.380]  big demonstrations kind of like flash mobs I don't use that term flash liberty peacefully
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:44.860]  and just say you know everybody be waiting maybe have an email list or something like
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:50.460]  that you know that's what we'll do go sign up at info wars dot com info wars dot com
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:57.020]  afford slash newsletter and we should create a new email for people that want that see
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:59.940]  we had an app that had some issues we're launching a new one that's even better that's going
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:04.180]  to have live alerts that that's really the answer is everybody to get the apps and Mike
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:07.620]  we need to meet I don't even want to meet and talk and then and then we both been busy
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:11.460]  but let's just talk about the war games people kind of get the idea of what's coming is we
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:15.620]  have to really really protest Facebook Twitter Google we've got to let them know and we've
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:21.140]  got a pissing their Cheerios coming up the South by Southwest yeah this is our last
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:26.660]  stand if we don't succeed it's just over that's what I tell people if you like me thanks
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:31.700]  been good to know you it's over it's done free speeches over in America if you're a
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:34.660]  Christian and you think you can just go to church and they're going to leave you alone
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:39.300]  you're wrong they're coming for you they're coming for you harder than me because the
[02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:44.620]  Christians are the biggest obstacle they have to the death camps the Christians are the
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:52.940]  ones who had Jews during the Holocaust Christians will not allow this death march to go forward
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:58.620]  so it's over if we don't if we don't take legally lawfully if we don't have conversations
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:03.660]  because notice you and I don't ever try to censor people we don't try to say why won't
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:08.420]  you I can't even do it I can't even file a complaint on CNN and play their own game
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:13.460]  for bullying I just can't do it it's it's it's like it's too cowardly well look what's
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:18.580]  seeing into that grandma could you imagine if you were I went to an elderly Hillary
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:23.580]  Clinton's house and said did you know that you were involved in Russian activity people
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:29.500]  would crucify us it would be over they would say look at these monsters but meanwhile CNN
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:34.260]  and here's why I don't like these people they're gutless why don't you go to clappers house
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:38.900]  why don't you go to deep states house and address them and confront them why don't you
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:44.420]  go to Michael Moore CNN if you're so tough Michael Moore attended an anti-Trump protest
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:50.660]  in New York they just want to bully by Russia yeah they just want to bully Nana that's all
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:54.540]  they want to do they're not they have no integrity that's why they want to go after you but what
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:59.500]  they did is bullying they should be banned if the rules were applied equally they would
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:05.780]  they're just real bullying this is real bully yeah we don't do that go up to Nana hey Nana
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:09.980]  did you know you voted for Hillary Clinton hey Nana did you know that you spread a meme
[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:15.500]  from Russia terrific I don't know how even Glyn Greenwald and liberal people were like
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:20.300]  I'm appalled this is nauseating what they're doing oh tough guy big tough Drew you're so
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:24.860]  tough why don't you come confront me why don't you confront Alex why don't you confront Clapper
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:29.460]  why don't you confront somebody other than somebody's grandma they won't do it so that
[02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:34.820]  is why South by Southwest I will be in Austin Texas Alex we have to meet well still a few
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:41.620]  more minutes let's do a few more minutes and we got our next case I want to talk about that
[02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:42.620]  and people this is it it's right that's why they're so care of demonstrations because
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.580]  that because they know that's where they can't shut us down and they don't want this to start
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:48.580]  a chain reaction it's other censorship that's why they backed off on us for now because they
[02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:57.180]  realized we got the momentum we have the initiative now is the time to strike stay with us introducing
[02:04:57.180 --> 02:05:03.900]  cell force by info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:10.020]  mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy they are your body's cellular engines cell

[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:21.220]  engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency then they start
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:27.220]  producing reactive oxygen species top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:33.540]  cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found in
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:38.860]  cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market the stronger the antioxidant
[02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:44.780]  the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals

[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:51.260]  kill the nr a kill people burn dana lows kill her she's a murderer which which which
[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:55.940]  she's a witch well if she you know she sinks and drowns she's not a witch but if she floats
[02:07:55.940 --> 02:08:02.260]  she is which i mean it's it's it's so medieval to see people degenerate back into like varlots
[02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:08.580]  whether it's like a cinema yeah we want communism so good will buy smart phone and buy everything
[02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:12.460]  pay you know and like we'll go to go to venezuela while they're eating out of trash cans for
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:16.820]  five years shut and like that thousands a week dying of starvation shut up you don't
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:21.060]  know it's a wonderful thing if i'm gonna do it which which in fact let's play a second
[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:24.340]  of this and go back to mike sarnovich about how we need to take action here it is let's
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:29.820]  let's play clip of which which do we have it ready okay well cue it up later and we'll
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:33.460]  get it i would hook all those computers up sound if we can do that it'd be great anyways
[02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:38.740]  which which seriously they've gone crazy i know there's elites behind them in money but
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:44.540]  it's like an 89 year old crazy nazi collaborator where they think they can go on cnn abc news
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:49.740]  is they've obviously put a pr funding out he funds sink uger who's got the name of a
[02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:54.900]  christian genocide organization just what you're pointing out the young turks killed a million
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:59.340]  and a half christians that's the biggest genocide outside russia and poland and we we've ever
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:04.620]  seen in ukraine so there's the fourth biggest christian genocide in modern history fourth
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:10.020]  biggest i guess in history you know a million five that's not chopped liver dead people children
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:14.980]  you name it you know pregnant women run through and then he's saying i don't know if you saw
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:18.900]  the clip that i'm a the worst person in the world that george soros is a holocaust survivor
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:25.420]  i didn't like the magnitude of of them defending this they think they'll get away with it what
[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:33.020]  type of swiney creature is this well they know that if they get rid of us they can engage
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:39.220]  in a genocide here in america the young turks are fighting at the bit to destroy christians
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:43.060]  here so that that's the whole game and by the way they're going after jews too there's
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:48.740]  a lot of drama on twitter right now from people who have called us falsely anti so just for
[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:55.220]  the record i just about any bigotry hatred they all know that though right they they
[02:09:55.220 --> 02:10:00.940]  all know and they're all liars and they are coming for the jewish people and they're finally
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:04.980]  realizing that now i see on twitter people from town i am seeing a lot of even liberal
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:10.300]  jews are waking up when you're right i see it i apologize i'm getting a lot of that yeah
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:14.900]  so they're actually freaking out a little bit because they realize people like me and
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.540]  you i don't sit around all day thinking about jewish issues i don't really it's not i don't
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:24.580]  even ever ask myself what somebody is if they're interesting and cool i don't even like i'm
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:29.660]  sick i'm not obsessed with race or religion that's funny they'll call me an anti-semite
[02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:33.660]  for making fun of somebody and i go what are you i even know the guy was jewish i just
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:37.700]  knew the guy was an idiot you know i'm not not not talking about this at all well i make
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:42.380]  so to sink for how he looks i'm not bashing turks in general and it's anything with stelter
[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:46.540]  he said i said stelter's a jew i already said this but and i didn't and then he just he
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:50.540]  just lies and says i attacked him because he's jewish and then he says but he's not jewish
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:54.740]  he just makes up all these things i'm wrong about that aren't demonstrably false show the
[02:10:54.740 --> 02:11:00.340]  video sink he doesn't but they're and what they're doing so the funny thing is they want
[02:11:00.340 --> 02:11:05.340]  to get people like us out of the way because they know that we would stand with any oppressed
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:09.580]  jewish minority and they know if they get us out of the way then they can go and they
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:13.140]  the jews are going to be in the concentration camps with the christians too if the left
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:18.740]  has their way just go read what lewis barricade has to say they're in public well expanding
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:26.980]  off of that main line leftists teach that teach that jews are bad and that and then
[02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:31.340]  george soros says that israel needs to be given over to the muslims so that's a fact
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:35.860]  and then the jewish movements in america are led by george soros a nazi collaborator what
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:42.900]  fruitcake planet did we wake up on well that was the problem is a lot of people were brainwashed
[02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:48.900]  into thinking that we're throwing dog whistles or whatever which we're not but meanwhile farrakhan
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:55.580]  in the nation of islam overtly say that jews are satanic this is what they say not me not
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:59.900]  me not you we would never say because we don't believe it so that's what's going on but that's
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:06.140]  why we have maybe we need to set up a separate website or something but those of you especially
[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:11.420]  if you're in austin texas i'm going to be in town i don't want to travel but i realized
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:16.060]  i'm so burned out by traveling else but i realized this is life or death and this is
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:21.740]  our last stand if they destroy us here we're dead yeah let's go ahead and pick the date
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:25.380]  that we're going to or or or a few days when we're going to do it so people can get here
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:29.140]  they can be in place they can be ready and then we'll announce live on air hey two hours
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:35.140]  this uh so when it stopped by southwest i try to avoid it when is that it's like march
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:41.380]  nine through the 14th i think something like that okay okay so yeah oh my god it's like
[02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:44.740]  a plague descends on us all these zombies trying to get a job that doesn't exist it's
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:49.820]  a giant pump and dump to rip people off in my view it's it's incredible uh so uh yeah

[02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:15.700]  led into this other town hall to do this uh i wonder behind the scenes they chanted burn him he's
[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:20.660]  been on the war room before i believe is i recognize him but jacob engels thank you for
[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:26.180]  joining us today great to be on the program so major new controversy earlier working on
[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:30.580]  a big story of another potential stand down in florida in the making another mass shooting
[02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:34.020]  we want to know as much as you can tell us about that but also just the whole state of the burn
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:41.060]  the gun owners meme that's going on you know it was really really sad uh to see how cnn edited
[02:22:41.060 --> 02:22:46.900]  the gun control panel that i participated in the first segment they were very fair very uh decent
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:51.700]  but the second segment where i brought up the fact that it wasn't too long ago in the 1960s
[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:56.740]  jim crow south that that state and county government systematically disarmed black citizens so they
[02:22:56.740 --> 02:23:02.340]  couldn't fight back against oppression and against really great things cnn didn't include that they
[02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:07.060]  didn't include references to what happened in 1933 in germany when they confiscated weapons
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:12.180]  eliminated free speech and censored the media so it seems that cnn only wants one narrative and
[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:15.620]  that's the narrative of all coming for your guns if you need to turn them over now because the
[02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:21.940]  government is good and we'll take care of you and that is asinine we have that clip don't we
[02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:27.380]  let's go ahead and roll that clip of jacob by engels and then flipping out here it is
[02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:32.260]  that's why i can't tell you an emotional response what's wrong with legislation
[02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:37.620]  legislation is not a bad thing you have kids who should be grieving right now and instead
[02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:42.500]  adults are putting them on national television hold on this i have to object to i've never seen
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:47.940]  more motivated people come to a camp where i want to tell their story about what they demanded
[02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:52.500]  they are these are not kids they hijacked four of them and the narrative and then got a bunch of
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:56.820]  other people are going they're motivated they watched their friends die and you're gonna you're
[02:23:56.820 --> 02:24:02.420]  gonna you're gonna bash on them who show of hands would be comfortable raising the age to purchase
[02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:09.620]  semi-automatic weapons to 21 three of you it's an arbitrary age it's like the drinking age is an
[02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:14.500]  arbitrary age making a hundred with it being a higher arbitrary age yeah you have 18-year-old
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:18.900]  still in high school and you're gonna sell them an assault weapon or any weapon for that matter
[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:25.140]  it shouldn't be there at 18 you let them have a car dumbo 18 to 20 year olds this whole arrested
[02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:30.020]  development thing now where they're where they call 35 is they say the new 16 these people are
[02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:36.340]  all into how they're little i love being lazy and dumb i enjoy it i can't listen to these idiots
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:41.540]  anymore jacob what is it like being around these morons you know it's very interesting when i when
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:46.660]  i went to the holding room in cnn and started talking to people before the panel as soon as
[02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:52.900]  they realized that i wasn't for gun grabbing that i wasn't for knee jerk reaction gun control measures
[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:57.620]  and that i would instead want to review the the laws on the books and force them properly
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:02.100]  and address the issue of mental health and pumping people full of psychotropic drugs
[02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:06.100]  i was ostracized in the room they don't want to talk to me anymore and then on that panel
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:11.780]  i had to fight tooth and nail to get my point across and that sjw blonde chick in the front just
[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:18.020]  kept talking over me and and kind of matronly i'm older than you i'm an adult sit down and shut up
[02:25:18.020 --> 02:25:23.540]  young man and that was really disappointing i tried hard and then i got some good points across
[02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:31.220]  but cnn again seems to term it to to come for our guns and to convince the american people
[02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:36.260]  that anyone who doesn't agree with that are somehow child murders and that's sick it's depraved and
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:43.300]  quite frankly i think it's a little demonic well it is and all i know is they said that i said nobody
[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:47.700]  died or they were all brought in from california it was all fake then they take my videos down
[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:51.860]  where i said the opposite and then they'd have hog and people run around call me a piece of you
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:56.660]  know what all sorts of names and then say you wanted to debate me when i said do it he back down
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:26:01.860]  and they call that bullying it's just it's crazy you know the guy is being flown around that well
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:06.500]  they're being flown around not hog a bunch of other young people on private jets to go around
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:13.140]  and like get other groups of people to run around to be anti-gun this is crazy well david hog simply
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:19.460]  put is full of hogwash that individual and they'll call that bullying and and i'll sue him if they
[02:26:19.460 --> 02:26:24.260]  take this video down i am that they know already because he's an adult world he's a spokesman
[02:26:24.260 --> 02:26:29.060]  calling me a piece of sh it for s i mean see and they can say it all they want i can
[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:34.660]  be calling me a piece of you know what and then you can't even make a joke saying he's he's wrong
[02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:42.340]  david hog and everyone else who's standing up from that tragedy that happened put themselves in
[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:46.980]  the public arena and adults around them knew that they were putting them in the public arena and
[02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:51.140]  when you're in the public arena you're a public figure it's fair game i would argue that they're
[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:55.460]  too young and they're not developed enough to have been put in that position but adults made
[02:26:55.460 --> 02:27:01.940]  that decision for them and they've encouraged it so now their proposals are going to be scrutinized
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:07.860]  and that is only fair what do you make of the other town hall where they're saying burned
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:15.540]  anilose right out of money python it's it it just begs the question are these people mentally
[02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:22.900]  competent or are they so deranged from the election of donald trump that they have no
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:27.460]  longer control over their mental faculties and i don't think they have control over themselves
[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:32.100]  and it's really sad because our americans are fellow humans they're people that we want to help
[02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:37.940]  become better individuals but it seems they've lost complete and total control oh you ought to
[02:27:37.940 --> 02:27:46.020]  see them in austin uh not bragging but the county is going to get into it the point is
[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:50.340]  is that i'm not even welcome in my own hometown i was born in dallas with a lot of families from
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:54.180]  here i've been here since high school and i've had family here since before it was a state
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:59.300]  before it was its own country when it was mexico and the californians they're not really californians
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:04.660]  but the little globalist bots they get in my face everywhere and then when i speak back they go oh
[02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:09.460]  you're bullying it mad when i get back in their face that's mental illness you get to somebody's
[02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:15.460]  face and they can't believe it when they get back in yours that's exactly the point i've been consistently
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:20.660]  called nazi spat on and anytime i go to defend myself they know let's talk about intellect
[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:27.220]  let's talk about logic let's be real here and talk one on one and say oh oh you can't question me
[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:34.580]  oh my opinion is fact uh uh they just start having this past that's right control what's
[02:28:34.580 --> 02:28:38.820]  coming out of their mouth it's scary i want to ask you briefly on the other side where you think
[02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:42.820]  this is all going and then get a little bit of that story you say you're working on without

[02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:42.100]  who was on the broadcast was like monday and he said don't worry alex it's rug people at google
[02:33:42.100 --> 02:33:47.140]  and youtube the channels will all be back well they took course he's down it's back they were
[02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:51.380]  they had ours blocked it's back military arms channel was down i just got a text that's back
[02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:57.780]  looks like thousands of sites are all coming back and he goes the relationship with the government
[02:33:57.780 --> 02:34:02.740]  and google is very good it'll be back and i want to i think it's the pressure and drugs report and
[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:08.900]  everything coming back and and and and you know them exposing it but patenik did say that it was
[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:14.100]  rogue people inside so we're going to find out about this in just a minute but finishing up
[02:34:14.100 --> 02:34:19.300]  he's laughing he likes my invitation like there you go i always go crazy in the third hour i wanted
[02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:24.260]  to go ahead and finish up with the gentleman that we're talking to jacob engels who is on the
[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:29.140]  singing in panel and who heads up a newspaper there in florida heads up the central florida post
[02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:33.380]  where is this going now what do you make of trump starting to go sideways
[02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:36.740]  in his rhetoric on the second amendment i mean it's like they transplanted his brain
[02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:44.660]  with that of diane feinstein's i sincerely hope that our president is using this as a
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:52.420]  negotiating tactic and technique to give the democrats and the liberals an idea of hey we'll
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:56.500]  come to the table we'll work with you we'll give you a little bit of what you want and then
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:35:00.980]  he drops the hammer at the last minute it's kind of like when you're asking for an investment you
[02:35:00.980 --> 02:35:04.820]  ask for the stars if you need ten million dollars why not ask for twenty million dollars the investor
[02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:09.140]  might give you fifteen and you earn a little extra so i hope that's where he's coming from
[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:14.420]  with this tactic and i'd be very disappointed if he is actually moving in that direction
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:23.940]  i don't think he is but it's it's it's it's rhetorical it hurts the general movement
[02:35:23.940 --> 02:35:31.300]  but can you get into the story you're working on dealing with um that situation a new potential
[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:37.540]  crisis yes one of my sources gave me a call today there is a local college here in central
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:42.740]  florida and apparently yesterday there was an instant between a few students teacher
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:48.500]  got involved there's a little bit of a scuffle campus security responded and and when this
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:54.420]  individual was being removed from the room and then detained for the police he made a comment
[02:35:54.420 --> 02:36:00.980]  something to the effect of i'm going to go get my gun and come back to everyone now the police
[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:07.300]  what i'm told by my sources then baker acted this individual but the concern we're having right now
[02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:12.660]  is that there was no check done there was no real investigation to even if he is a danger
[02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:18.340]  uh even if he has access to weapons so our main concern now is that he's being baker acted
[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:23.300]  hopeful of psychotropic drugs and then we'll just be haphazardly released back out into
[02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:29.540]  the world where if he does have access to something and he is mentally unstable and now
[02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:34.980]  he's got harmful chemicals in his body that is uh tailor made for disaster i really really hope
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:40.980]  that the police are investigating this and and and not uh being as sloppy as they were down in
[02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:47.860]  uh broward we will watch this very closely a jagga bingles the central four to post thank you
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:52.980]  thanks for having me on alex you bet thanks for your courage you go into that den of vipers and
[02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:59.380]  cnn now again you just heard me introduce that dr steve pocheting is here here's one of the
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:04.500]  headlines gizmodo youtube terminates account of info wars bureau chief had nothing to do with the
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:09.540]  shootings did not saying they were actors talking about trump striking back against the globalist
[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:14.740]  politically that's what they're scared of the kewin on the storm all that meanwhile youtube mocks
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:25.700]  critics amid censorship fight now the reason this is important is that youtube says they hired 10
[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:32.500]  thousand sjw's that's the criteria it's also come out in the news and lawsuits that you can't be white
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:37.300]  or asian they've just said no more whites or asians and again that makes it sound like oh affirmative
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:43.540]  action no it's like discrimination plus they're now the left of saying well asians didn't own any
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:49.060]  slaves but they're still bad so it's like oh people that work harder in school and do all this stuff
[02:37:49.060 --> 02:37:53.780]  they're inherently bad and by the way whites are weighed on the line like the top nine richest
[02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:59.140]  slots are asian groups whites are like whites are they're with blacks if you name it on average
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:38:03.380]  it's it's a lot of rich white people but there's also a ton of poor ones that's what bernie sand is
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:10.500]  uh white people don't know what it's like to be poor hey honey moon of the soya union
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:16.500]  you know they know how to treat those christians yeah we can just do it hey sorry i want to be a
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:22.260]  big man i'm gonna be one someday all right let me get serious and he does that bozo the clown
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:26.420]  hair it'll look like he's Einstein when he's really an idiot looks like he's like these
[02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:31.860]  straight jacket we gotta take that picture and put him in a straight jacket all right i'ma stop
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:37.220]  i'll receive a chin it joins us on google and the big internet war uh that it looks like i don't
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:41.380]  want to say we've turned the tide but it's starting to turn where they're just saying it's a mistake
[02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:46.980]  we're sorry isn't the real headline google was hacked by its own employees in an internal civil
[02:38:46.980 --> 02:38:52.900]  war to purge conservatives and libertarians in like a desperate mutiny i mean that's what really
[02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:58.020]  happened suddenly youtube blank justin goes google says we had employees that did that who were
[02:38:58.020 --> 02:39:03.540]  unauthorized we're now removing them we apologize to conservatives that's the headline so this is
[02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:10.180]  spectacular but they've released it like a flatulence in church very very quietly very very easily
[02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:14.820]  but still it sounds like a giant whoopee cushion despite what they tried i mean
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:19.300]  how big is this because you obviously have sources inside intelligence you didn't want to give but
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:27.220]  you told us don't worry this was coming what really happened i can't say words you rift
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:33.940]  it's almost impossible it's exactly what i told you nothing's gonna happen to you you're too important
[02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:39.860]  to the republic and i mean like flatulence in the church who could come up with that kind of
[02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:45.540]  rift that's why you're popular oh stop stop stop you're the god that predicted this so so well
[02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:52.820]  i had a very hard prediction alex let's let's go back to our history you and i and others have been
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:59.620]  on the forefront of whatever we could call it a info war revolution the people at google the people
[02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:07.780]  at amazon and all the other institutions got a wake-up call and that wake-up call came very quickly
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:14.580]  after you and i had that discussion but there were people within the government and i i again i go
[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:20.980]  through this there are loyalists within our government in many many of our 18 intelligence
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:28.100]  agencies who are very concerned about what happens to this country right or wrong they are
[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:34.900]  committed as much as i am you are to the sustaining of the republic remember the presidency is
[02:40:34.900 --> 02:40:40.100]  temporal from our point of view we want to maintain the integrity of the republic so that
[02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:47.300]  the nation's state has a capacity for transaction for national security and for the ability to
[02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:53.860]  encourage entrepreneurship this is what it's all about but when entrepreneurship becomes a massive
[02:40:54.420 --> 02:41:00.260]  fashion organization which it could under google and the boys who started it came out of the soviet
[02:41:00.260 --> 02:41:06.580]  union and yours truly helped to get those boys out of the soviet union we don't like what happens
[02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:11.620]  so those of us who've been involved in conflict those of us who are involved in taking down the
[02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:17.380]  soviet union it's not me the cia and others who were involved in military intelligence
[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:23.060]  understand very clearly that we're not going to reduplicate the soviet union and the guys of
[02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:30.820]  google amazon or any other institution so they are in fact beholden to the different segments of our
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:35.220]  intelligence community that's a simple there is a civil war within the companies within the
[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:39.940]  institutions within the police departments because if it wasn't for drudge and the listeners getting
[02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:45.220]  upset and making a major news story i mean that obviously helped people also in the inside make
[02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:50.260]  the moral argument to make sure this stopped because somebody hired these 10 000 scallywags
[02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:57.540]  brought them in to do this lynching well however it occurred it occurred but you're correct i've
[02:41:57.540 --> 02:42:03.060]  said to you for a long time ago only four percent of the american population was involved in the
[02:42:03.060 --> 02:42:08.980]  revolutionary war we can take that to about four to three percent right now of the americans who
[02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:15.060]  were involved in the active participation to make sure that we don't have these kinds of interference
[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:22.580]  in our democracy in our republic you happen to be the voice of that movement as you well know
[02:42:22.580 --> 02:42:28.340]  and that voice will not be still if people like myself and others are involved and that's where
[02:42:28.340 --> 02:42:35.860]  we come in and say enough is enough where alex stone alex uh jones is extremely important to
[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:41.380]  the integrity of the republic that's as simple as that well everybody we're just a focal point
[02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:45.540]  it's everybody on this show it's everybody it really is it's everybody and it's matt drudge
[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:50.180]  and and and let's come back and talk about what you think is going to happen next tomorrow's news

[02:47:13.220 --> 02:47:17.700]  all right final segment in this hour joe gilbert normally hosts on fridays and the fourth hour
[02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:22.580]  but i'm going to commandeer the next two segments of that because we've got the military arms channel
[02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:28.740]  tens of millions of views hundreds of millions of views i've seen it i couldn't see it anymore because
[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:32.260]  they deleted the channel i couldn't go actually look it up but it was banned to see what it had on
[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:36.100]  there but we can have those statistics back now they just reinstated that today so first they
[02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:41.380]  reinstated info wars and now hundreds of accounts we know of so i guess that must be thousands but
[02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:47.780]  then they hit course he last night deleted him and then it was back up this morning so this is an act of
[02:47:47.780 --> 02:47:52.420]  mutiny and i'm really worried about somebody killing the president that works in the white house or
[02:47:52.420 --> 02:47:56.580]  you know something like that because i deal with leftist and they're so deranged now
[02:47:56.580 --> 02:48:03.140]  trump derangement syndrome that that is real they're so crazed that that they're i don't think
[02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:08.180]  we're out of the woods because they're still shadow banning they're still curtailing libertarian
[02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:12.660]  talk but their naked attempt to ban everything really blew up in their face is that what you're
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:19.700]  getting at dr pacenic yeah it's pretty much i'm not worried that uh anybody's going to assassinate
[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:26.500]  or hurt trump because i'm quite familiar with the secret service and for over 30 years they've
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:32.260]  been exceedingly exceedingly good it's one of the few institutions that we really don't appreciate
[02:48:32.260 --> 02:48:39.620]  it's a 24 7 job when i ran the psychiatric units at st elizabeth's we reported literally on a weekly
[02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:46.580]  if not daily basis this is back on the 70s guys into anyone who had a psychiatric problem or who
[02:48:46.580 --> 02:48:52.580]  might in any way hurt the president so the secret services will very well staffed i know they're
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:57.140]  working very hard right now but i'm not worried about that actually i'm not even worried about the
[02:48:57.140 --> 02:49:02.500]  left what does concern me and i'm going to change it a little bit is that we uh trump
[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:08.900]  announced the tariff of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum what that does is really
[02:49:10.020 --> 02:49:16.580]  create a tariff war which at this particular point in time i do not agree with it's something
[02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:23.860]  that has major ramifications particularly for our closest allies canada mexico brazil south
[02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:30.260]  isn't he doing it as a negotiating point he may be but he invoked national security which isn't
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:36.180]  exactly a negotiating point and he said it's really quite simple where we're at the tail end
[02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:42.500]  of a steel deficit and we really want to increase the price of steel as it comes in
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:49.620]  well that's not exactly correct we we don't uh have that type of steel deficit our companies
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:55.700]  new core us steel are important companies but they can't produce the amount of steel that we need
[02:49:55.700 --> 02:50:01.780]  in the various industries at the prices that we had with imports of steel coming from canada and
[02:50:01.780 --> 02:50:08.340]  aluminum and particularly for you say it's going to trigger inflation yes that's correct it's triggering
[02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:15.140]  not only inflation but a major uncertainty in the stock market we've lost about 500 billion dollars
[02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:20.740]  over the past two days and we're heading in for what we call a fifth day of distribution and a
[02:50:20.740 --> 02:50:27.060]  major major pullback in all the major companies including the steel and aluminum companies as
[02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:32.980]  well as the car companies and every other ancillary service so other than the left the left has nothing
[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:39.140]  to do with this this is really total economic uh what i wouldn't call warfare but it begins
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:44.180]  economic warfare well sure it's a form of an embargo but china you know it keeps lowering
[02:50:44.180 --> 02:50:49.620]  their taxes to counter us and what are we supposed to do i mean we got deindustrialized
[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:55.460]  this way i agree that maybe just announcing he's doing it so saying i may do it it has caused
[02:50:55.460 --> 02:51:01.540]  some jitters but you know i i don't know they're trying to push a depression could be triggered
[02:51:01.540 --> 02:51:05.220]  from this but i thought the depression was already happening and then they came along with smooth
[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:11.940]  haulings no not really there was no depression our economy is quite strong and what happened is
[02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:18.020]  mr pal with the federal reserve i admire what he does hinted very clearly that we're going to have
[02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:24.260]  four increases in interest rates so that's when the uh stock market pulled back a thousand points
[02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:30.100]  or more because we weren't used to having an increased gdp and at the same time having a
[02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:33.780]  increase in interest well that's actually a good point i criticized the rates just because they
[02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:37.220]  didn't do it for obama they hit it for trump i kind of thought they were trying to hurt
[02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:40.740]  things but you're right if the economy is booming back you're supposed to raise interest rates
[02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:48.500]  which encourages savings correct but on the other hand the the stock markets don't know exactly when
[02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:53.300]  those interest rates come in and how much it will affect it particularly when there's announcements
[02:51:53.300 --> 02:51:58.020]  that there will be three and possibly four more importantly you have to understand the amount
[02:51:58.020 --> 02:52:02.740]  of steel that we get from china is less than five percent it's two percent what we're really
[02:52:02.740 --> 02:52:08.340]  concerned about i mean in general both in the national military area and in the business area
[02:52:08.340 --> 02:52:14.020]  where i'm involved as well is that we have allies like canada we can't afford to alienate them we
[02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:20.980]  have germany that's an ally britain depends very heavily on our ability to have imports of their
[02:52:20.980 --> 02:52:27.060]  steel and to have exports that we can bring to them in the process of brexit we're hurting them
[02:52:27.060 --> 02:52:31.940]  at this point you're right there trump has promised them better trade deals this is kind of a slap
[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:39.060]  to britain that's correct Alex and in a way what i'm cautioning trump to do is to listen to mr
[02:52:39.060 --> 02:52:45.540]  corn and to wilbur ross and actually the guys at goldman sacks and the others will understand
[02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:50.580]  the ramifications of a terrace so let me bring this up listeners hear that they go goldman sacks
[02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:53.860]  that's the globalist that got us this position well if goldman sacks starts working for the
[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:57.700]  country that's a different deal and i know there's been some power structure things but you've got
[02:52:57.700 --> 02:53:01.860]  you've got the head of goldman sacks blank find kind of shooting his mouth off against trump
[02:53:01.860 --> 02:53:05.700]  and making jokes about china is going to be supreme but then it is going to be goldman sacks
[02:53:05.700 --> 02:53:09.220]  underwriting you know a lot of this other stuff so what give us a little inside baseball from your
[02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:16.100]  sources about what's going on at goldman sacks goldman sacks is a it's an investment banking i've
[02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:21.060]  been a managing director kidder it wasn't at the same quality goldman sacks but it's pretty much the
[02:53:21.060 --> 02:53:26.660]  same thing you have diversified entities within that structure you have people who are exceedingly
[02:53:26.660 --> 02:53:31.540]  good these are people who are traders although the trading factor into goldman sacks i think was
[02:53:31.540 --> 02:53:38.100]  eliminated what they're very good at is analyzing the economic ramifications of certain acts that's
[02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:43.380]  what happens associate tout genet and all the major investment banking firms i wouldn't call
[02:53:43.380 --> 02:53:49.460]  goldman sacks literally a globalist they thought they fund america they fund various areas of the
[02:53:49.460 --> 02:53:55.540]  world but in fact contrary to the most the common idea the zionists will take over and goldman sacks
[02:53:55.540 --> 02:54:01.220]  will take over a Rothschild that's nonsense now because in an era where we're heading into quantum
[02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:07.940]  encryption like we have a company like bfbt we're way beyond the ability now to affect the digits
[02:54:07.940 --> 02:54:16.260]  one and zero on a simple level so anything that uh trump says has an exponential factor to it it
[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:21.940]  radiates so quickly out there that china is not just concerned about itself it's really concerned
[02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:27.780]  about the fact that it's going to affect many many of the countries around asia southeast well
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:31.780]  trump said he was going to renegotiate naft and get a lot of this has been unfair to our country
[02:54:31.780 --> 02:54:37.700]  so we need to negotiate this and isn't he just fulfilling his promises no he hasn't effectively
[02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:43.860]  negotiated nafta he has not effectively looked at the tariff agreement he has not worked out the
[02:54:43.860 --> 02:54:49.140]  ramifications of what a tariff means well then what is he well then who is advising him then
[02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:55.540]  i would say cohen ross i don't know who the specific individuals are that would have told
[02:54:55.540 --> 02:55:00.740]  him to say look i'm going to impose a tariff immediately on steel and aluminum and i'm a
[02:55:00.740 --> 02:55:06.980]  day trader and i can tell you that market was pulled back so quickly that four days in a row
[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:12.180]  we had what we call distribution which means we may be headed for another major pullback of 500
[02:55:12.180 --> 02:55:17.060]  no i got it you're saying this can cause a major stock market correction so but but here's the thing
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:22.660]  trump's policy so far had brought the economy back so uh i mean it comes to kind of like dance
[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:28.580]  with the one that brung him he's been right so far uh then uh you know why sit there and say this is
[02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:33.380]  wrong i mean i i got mixed feelings across the board but i think we're gonna see what happens
[02:55:33.380 --> 02:55:40.980]  let me ask you this question uh politically what do you make of um just all the stuff we're seeing
[02:55:40.980 --> 02:55:44.820]  with the democrats and all their calls for impeachment and all the rest of it you're
[02:55:44.820 --> 02:55:50.100]  saying you're not worried about that no that's just absolute nonsense what's far more significant
[02:55:50.100 --> 02:55:55.300]  is what we were doing here on your show almost a year a year and a half ago when we said hope
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:56:00.500]  hicks has to leave jarred cushion will be leaving oh that's a question what do you have any information
[02:56:00.500 --> 02:56:08.900]  on why hope hicks left yes uh the reason was very simple she was very seductive very uh effective
[02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:15.780]  but as a Greenwich graduate uh she knew better than to seduce the man in the white house if she had
[02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:22.020]  nothing else to do and being close to the president doesn't necessarily mean you're being manipulative
[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:27.540]  and seductive being close to the president means you're being discreet and she knew her family and
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:33.540]  Greenwich was involved in public relations she should have been a lot more discreet than seduce
[02:56:33.540 --> 02:56:39.460]  the man porter who was already on the watch list with the fbi john kelly could not afford to have
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:45.620]  this kind of nonsense going on in the white house and in fact really insisted on cleaning this out
[02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:50.420]  and this is one of the reasons why we in the community intelligence and military community
[02:56:50.420 --> 02:56:56.660]  insist on having and john kelly insist on having a madis probably a McMaster he'll may go to fort
[02:56:56.660 --> 02:57:03.140]  bragg and we have a Pompeo and cia not because we want military control but we need a commanding
[02:57:03.140 --> 02:57:08.500]  control system that has accountability with a hope hicks with a jarred cushion or within a
[02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:14.420]  lot we have no accountability jarred cushioners now up on the crosshairs of being indicted for
[02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:18.260]  criminal activity but you said a year and a half ago they're going to go up in for china and now
[02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:23.780]  Mueller's off on china stuff that's not this mandate well let me ask you this let's do five
[02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:28.820]  more minutes have the next guest coming on but let me ask this back in two minutes my only point
[02:57:28.820 --> 02:57:33.620]  is is they want to get trump and and so okay kusher gets some money from some foreign banks
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:38.900]  that's before he was even it's like why is Mueller going after kusher i'm trying to protect kusher
[02:57:38.900 --> 02:57:42.260]  it's just you've got the clintons have done 50 million things worse
[02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:52.500]  let's talk to victor in florida victor uh you're calling go ahead yes uh hi alex first i just want
[02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:58.980]  to mention if people just go and try the products they will be ordering all the time i've ordered
[02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:04.740]  several of the products over and over because it's amazing in particular silver bullet i as soon
[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:09.700]  as i start to feel like i get a little stick you know maybe like a little raspiness in my throat
[02:58:09.700 --> 02:58:14.740]  i drop some silver bullet and it like i'll still feel a little sick but it won't last as long and
[02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:20.180]  i just ordered the body the alpha power and the pollen block well let me just say something victor
[02:58:20.180 --> 02:58:24.420]  it's people like you that then find the whole operation because a very small percentage of people
[02:58:24.420 --> 02:58:28.580]  buy products and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products so thank you but when you
[02:58:28.580 --> 02:58:34.340]  mention the uh the silver bullet colloidal silver it's got thousands of reviews a 98 percent review
[02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:38.740]  it is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country discounted
[02:58:38.740 --> 02:58:41.860]  high quality colloidal silver and it's not a silver bullet but the closest thing you're
[02:58:41.860 --> 02:58:51.940]  gonna find to a silver bullet top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons
[02:58:51.940 --> 02:58:59.780]  in the food and water supply that are making us fat sick and stupid so what do we do about it
[02:58:59.780 --> 02:59:06.500]  well for starters don't just sit there and take it fight back with the all-new supercharged

[02:59:48.980 --> 02:59:51.700]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:51.700 --> 03:00:07.620]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:00:07.620 --> 03:00:24.180]  all right dr. c botanik is our guest bestselling author work the state department and other
[03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:28.100]  agencies are just a great source of info different respect you may not totally agree with all of it
[03:00:28.100 --> 03:00:32.740]  but it's always thought provoking and it ends up being pretty accurate down the road we just
[03:00:32.740 --> 03:00:38.340]  went to break and i was asking the question that my daughter called me i guess they're off school
[03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:42.660]  today i'm about to come home and she was wanting something i remember why was i saying hold over
[03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:47.620]  what was the question dr botanik i got you to hold over for the issue was mewler and you said well
[03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:53.300]  mewler and dyke uh trump and is he dangerous the answer is no what happened and i've said it for a
[03:00:53.300 --> 03:00:59.860]  year or so and most people didn't pick it up i said i think mewler is making amends for what he
[03:00:59.860 --> 03:01:06.580]  participated in 9 11 mewler comes out of st paul's he was really a war here in vietnam and and he got
[03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:12.180]  co-opted by the bushes i think what's happening now is mewler is working with trump quite frankly
[03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:18.100]  and he's not right this month ago from sg silver bull and all those guys and more and more could
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:24.420]  that actually be happening yes because mewler can do the one thing that trump can't do within his own
[03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:29.940]  family and that is to fire jerry kushner although trump himself has been very annoyed with this
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:35.380]  young man by the way i never i want you to finish but i never believed that until the indictment
[03:01:35.380 --> 03:01:40.980]  came out and it's a bunch of russians getting funded by soros and stuff to manipulate the election
[03:01:40.980 --> 03:01:45.780]  which we knew really went on not russia itself but people using russian companies so when i saw
[03:01:45.780 --> 03:01:51.620]  that i thought it is mewler actually really been turned back to trump yeah uh mewler is more
[03:01:51.620 --> 03:01:56.420]  interested not so much in the russian affairs that's just i think to cover what he's really going
[03:01:56.420 --> 03:02:01.940]  after is manifold who we talked about i said a year and a half ago get rid of him he was corrupt
[03:02:01.940 --> 03:02:08.420]  he's corrupt uh kushner is the equal corruption to manifold kushner brought in manifold equally
[03:02:08.420 --> 03:02:14.420]  corrupt and this is more than just the russian uh the chinese control 6 6 6 5th avenue the is
[03:02:14.420 --> 03:02:18.500]  what we said a year and a half ago that's what they're looking at kushner for is the chinese money
[03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:24.420]  and not only chinese money but israeli money the money that comes from bank lumi is in the
[03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:29.700]  hundreds of millions of dollars and he has a major loan as he quote is our diplomat to the
[03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:36.660]  middle east he asked also major loans from an israeli loan company which he hadn't identified
[03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:43.060]  he has other major loans he's had bankruptcy in his in his paper he is a total disaster i said
[03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:49.540]  from day one this was a stupid incompetent corrupt individual who mirrors very much what his father
[03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:56.020]  was who was indicted and convicted and went to jail under christie now trust me in a corrupt state
[03:02:56.020 --> 03:03:02.340]  like new jersey for his father to go to a corrupt prison you have to be exceedingly corrupt and
[03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:08.580]  that's corrupt kushner and trump knows that and he has to get rid of him then why in haiti's what he
[03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:13.860]  bring him into the center of the white house because he has a daughter you you have a daughter if
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:18.900]  your daughter asked something and and he thinks the world of his daughter and he sent her out to
[03:03:18.900 --> 03:03:25.060]  sell i love my daughters but if they i mean they had some son buying buildings called 666 for three
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:30.820]  times what they were worth i'd say he was married to a moron well what can i tell you i can't get
[03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:35.380]  involved in their private relations no i don't even hate kushner the point is i don't even dislike him
[03:03:35.380 --> 03:03:39.540]  i didn't really know because he never talks i don't know if he's good or bad or what's going on i
[03:03:39.540 --> 03:03:43.460]  don't wish any harm upon him and i mean you know getting loans for your buildings whatever he's not
[03:03:43.460 --> 03:03:47.860]  running the government i don't think there's an issue i mean in chinese money unless he's in the
[03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:51.620]  white house i mean who cares who helps you buy a building as long as you're not in the government
[03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:57.300]  right well that's correct but that's not the issue he's been going into negotiations with russians
[03:03:57.300 --> 03:04:02.820]  who owe him money he's been going into negotiation in israel and picked out the most corrupt of all
[03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:08.740]  leaders and i've said it before bb i've said a few years bb has to leave israel there's no question
[03:04:08.740 --> 03:04:14.900]  about it bb is so corrupt that their own police department has already indicted him for several
[03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:20.180]  hundreds of millions of dollars and bb is on the verge of wanting a war to distract from the
[03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:26.100]  internal so you've got bb you've got kushner you have all these other guys all unfortunately jews
[03:04:26.100 --> 03:04:32.020]  and kushner is an orthodox jew who makes it even worse for us jews but he's basically corrupt well
[03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:37.540]  i i i don't know all the you know internal war battles that go on all this stuff i just know
[03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:41.300]  that the president's moving the country forward and i don't really see the corruption so i just
[03:04:41.300 --> 03:04:44.740]  think i'm gonna leave the whole thing alone but whatever we'll see what happens it's crazy thank
[03:04:44.740 --> 03:04:50.020]  you dr pochanic appreciate you well we got the military arms channel coming on they got banned

[03:07:23.060 --> 03:07:28.820]  sites we link to are gone so i can't keep track of how many fish there are in the sea what we do
[03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:34.020]  know is this attack happened we know it's taking place and we know they lied about what we were
[03:07:34.020 --> 03:07:38.020]  saying and doing to do it so we were bullying children said nobody died well that's our right
[03:07:38.020 --> 03:07:42.580]  to do you know it's bull but we didn't do that so now bloomberg comes out two days ago and goes
[03:07:42.580 --> 03:07:47.300]  they apologize youtube says that they hired 10 000 people and they mistakenly flagged up that wasn't
[03:07:48.740 --> 03:07:55.780]  wasn't uh wasn't hateful or wasn't bullying but it all started last friday when cnn said they were
[03:07:55.780 --> 03:08:01.540]  advising youtube employees on what to take down that's the really unfair business practices that's
[03:08:01.540 --> 03:08:07.140]  sabotage if you've got a hamburger place and i call regulators and i'm there with the regulator
[03:08:07.140 --> 03:08:12.100]  saying see there's still milk on the malt machine shut them down and then across the street i've got
[03:08:12.100 --> 03:08:18.020]  two foot long cockroaches bigger than chihuahua's and i mean that's basically what's going on here
[03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:23.380]  you've got the leftist youtuber saying kill president kill me kill the honoree burn danilosh
[03:08:23.380 --> 03:08:27.860]  murder everybody kills police and that that's all fine the word is up they're going all those the
[03:08:27.860 --> 03:08:31.940]  police stand down and look at all these eyewitnesses saying two shooters and they banned that and
[03:08:31.940 --> 03:08:37.700]  then say it's something else so he popped in i appreciate uh tim uh joining us from the military
[03:08:38.340 --> 03:08:44.260]  arms channel on youtube it's back for now we click the about there and read all about it they've
[03:08:44.260 --> 03:08:51.060]  got 680 000 subscribers massive views and they just review guns they just do basic stuff people like
[03:08:51.060 --> 03:08:54.980]  it and you know we have a right to guns we have a right to watch people with guns look at hollywood
[03:08:54.980 --> 03:08:58.980]  shows how to misuse guns but they're okay nobody's saying imagine walking in a movie theater that
[03:08:58.980 --> 03:09:02.900]  shows guns being shot you know some stupid Arnold Schwarzenegger movie or whatever like
[03:09:02.900 --> 03:09:07.300]  i demand this movie be shut down for hate they're showing guns this is showing how to
[03:09:07.300 --> 03:09:12.260]  you properly use a gun think about the magnitude of this censorship so he joins us for the seven
[03:09:12.260 --> 03:09:17.540]  minutes we have because i've commandeered uh the time uh here from the great joe gilbert is coming
[03:09:17.540 --> 03:09:22.180]  up in a moment normally hosts this hour on friday uh what is your take on this why do you think it
[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:27.220]  happened and then uh some of our channels that got restored they didn't even say that we won our appeal
[03:09:27.220 --> 03:09:32.020]  they just restored them uh this is a big deal it sounds like a mutiny happened the leftist
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:38.580]  at google like an internal hack or something this is crazy yeah you know what alex it's kind of hard
[03:09:38.580 --> 03:09:43.140]  to kind of figure out what exactly is going on because google is so tight-lipped but what we do
[03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:48.660]  know is because they've actually admitted to it uh publicly is that they have targeted conservative
[03:09:48.660 --> 03:09:54.980]  speech uh and they have targeted firearms channels and that's of course where um my domain is i just
[03:09:54.980 --> 03:09:59.220]  talk about firearms i i i don't even really review firearms i just take them out and show
[03:09:59.220 --> 03:10:03.460]  historic firearms shoot them have fun and show the safe responsible use of firearms but i'm
[03:10:03.460 --> 03:10:08.340]  constantly being targeted by youtube but i'm also quite politically active i um whenever
[03:10:08.340 --> 03:10:13.380]  our second amendment rights come under attack i go political i go political on youtube facebook
[03:10:13.380 --> 03:10:18.500]  instagram pretty much all of my social media outlets but in this instance you know i read an
[03:10:18.500 --> 03:10:26.020]  article that the google had contracted with the southern poverty law center to hire 10 000 moderators
[03:10:26.020 --> 03:10:29.860]  to go through and clean up the the hate speech or what they're calling the fake news
[03:10:30.580 --> 03:10:37.300]  and somehow we got caught up in this web so it's really unclear if it's a coordinated attack by
[03:10:37.300 --> 03:10:41.780]  mom's demand action and every town matters because we do know that these guys have private facebook
[03:10:41.780 --> 03:10:46.180]  groups and they coordinate attacks against us on facebook to try to get our pages taken down
[03:10:46.180 --> 03:10:50.100]  we've caught them doing it multiple times is that what's happening here at youtube
[03:10:50.100 --> 03:10:57.140]  we don't know but what i can tell you is uh 48 hours ago my channel was one strike away from
[03:10:57.140 --> 03:11:02.980]  being uh completely shut down and so i went in through my account my network rep and disabled
[03:11:02.980 --> 03:11:07.540]  every single video on my channel and released one video saying guys uh this is what's happening
[03:11:07.540 --> 03:11:12.340]  youtube is targeting gun channels right now and this was over a weekend there was nobody at youtube
[03:11:12.340 --> 03:11:18.020]  we could contact to try to get it resolved and it took me until 48 hours ago to get those account
[03:11:18.020 --> 03:11:25.060]  strikes lifted i had one night of peace i wake up the next morning and i have that pink page of death
[03:11:25.060 --> 03:11:30.660]  that says uh you've been given account strikes again on the exact same videos they just lifted
[03:11:30.660 --> 03:11:38.900]  the strikes against and so it's kind of amazing it has to be coming from within youtube to a degree
[03:11:38.900 --> 03:11:44.260]  um and i say this because when i got my first account strike i immediately disabled all my videos
[03:11:44.260 --> 03:11:49.620]  the only people that could see my videos at that point were myself and youtube even if you had a
[03:11:49.620 --> 03:11:55.700]  link to one of my disabled videos sure but i mean tim if you read the the bloomberg article it says
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:12:00.660]  they hired them and youtube said it was mistakenly done by their employees that they're in but the
[03:12:00.660 --> 03:12:05.780]  truth is they're just ignoring the brass hoping they don't notice that's why this is mutiny this is
[03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:10.820]  a big news because i understand from on top google wants to quietly censor everybody and
[03:12:10.820 --> 03:12:14.660]  kind of restrict this and play games but i'm saying they've gotten over zealous jumped the
[03:12:14.660 --> 03:12:20.260]  shark and that's now blown their whole operation wide open it has and and not only that they say
[03:12:20.260 --> 03:12:24.820]  that they're fixing it but they're not i mean they fixed it for me for 48 hours they go right back
[03:12:24.820 --> 03:12:28.980]  and strike my account again and now i'm fighting again for my very existence on youtube and this
[03:12:28.980 --> 03:12:33.780]  is how i make a living right um and that's how a lot of us make livings and you have a contract
[03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:37.780]  with them and you follow their rules and then they lie and say you haven't and again in the digital
[03:12:37.780 --> 03:12:42.500]  world if you're banned from something that's like a utility like this this is a thousand times bigger
[03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:46.500]  than not begging somebody's cake because it's a gay cake or whatever and which i say bake the
[03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:51.300]  damn cake the point is this is unbelievable discrimination across the board against a class
[03:12:51.300 --> 03:12:57.780]  of people this is this is like hitlerian yeah it is i mean really you hit on you touched on
[03:12:57.780 --> 03:13:03.060]  a very key point there uh we all have signed the same agreement with youtube millions of us all
[03:13:03.060 --> 03:13:08.180]  have the same contract with youtube but for some reason different groups are treated differently
[03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:12.740]  right prairie university has a lawsuit against them right now because um they're a conservative
[03:13:12.740 --> 03:13:16.820]  think tank and their videos are being struck and removed but then on the other side of the house
[03:13:16.820 --> 03:13:20.980]  you have the liberal point of view the exact same commentary about the exact same subject yet their
[03:13:20.980 --> 03:13:26.660]  videos aren't being you believe that videos of two year olds giving transvestite men money at strip
[03:13:26.660 --> 03:13:33.300]  clubs in in but bizarre stuff and then prairie university is completely milk toast and scientific
[03:13:33.300 --> 03:13:38.660]  and totally polite and they were banning them exactly it's crazy it is it's all be it's all
[03:13:38.660 --> 03:13:43.140]  politically motivated i mean we know that it's and and and they've admitted as much and if you go
[03:13:43.140 --> 03:13:48.180]  and look at the chief business officer one of the the executives he recently did an interview with
[03:13:48.180 --> 03:13:53.060]  another arge youtuber and he is from the check republic i forget his name but um but he said
[03:13:53.060 --> 03:13:57.140]  that there's four core principles that youtube live lives by freedom of speech freedom of community
[03:13:57.140 --> 03:14:02.180]  and freedom for everybody to to be treated equally and to earn a living really then then why is it for
[03:14:02.180 --> 03:14:06.020]  the last two years i've been fighting for my very existence on youtube this is this isn't the first
[03:14:06.020 --> 03:14:11.460]  time this has happened alex they constantly harass us they demonetize us every video we upload
[03:14:11.460 --> 03:14:16.260]  they won't monetize us uh we went through the whole adpocalypse right now we've we've had 70
[03:14:16.260 --> 03:14:20.660]  percent of our revenue taken away some claim 90 percent and it's never come back yeah i know
[03:14:20.660 --> 03:14:25.220]  they did 96 percent on us for a while and then it hurt them so bad they went back to like 70
[03:14:25.220 --> 03:14:31.060]  absolutely uh this is what they're doing and and and you're totally on target so why do you think
[03:14:31.060 --> 03:14:34.580]  they had to reverse because it became a big national issue with drudge exposing it and things
[03:14:35.380 --> 03:14:39.380]  i think so i think you know of course i have my own uh a little filing the firearms community
[03:14:39.380 --> 03:14:45.220]  is as a whole is is very vocal so everybody got pissed off right and and i even told my followers
[03:14:45.220 --> 03:14:49.220]  here's the phone number they you know here's the email address blow up their phone lines blow up their
[03:14:49.220 --> 03:14:53.700]  inbox and we pressured google and then they have to come out and say oops guys sorry we made a mistake
[03:14:53.700 --> 03:14:58.020]  but then they turn right around and do it again and it's all we need to start demonstrating i think
[03:14:58.020 --> 03:15:01.380]  we need to have on the street demonstrations against google facebook twitter you name it
[03:15:02.340 --> 03:15:05.780]  i i think so i i think it's time that we start applying pressure to them because
[03:15:05.780 --> 03:15:10.420]  we can't just set silently by when when they treat us differently and you you point out
[03:15:10.420 --> 03:15:15.380]  a very key point alex we have a contract that we're all working under but how but legally
[03:15:15.380 --> 03:15:19.300]  how can you treat one party differently than the other when you have the exact same verbiage
[03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:22.980]  and you've all agreed to the exact same terms of use and community guidelines
[03:15:22.980 --> 03:15:27.620]  why are you targeting one group and discriminating against them yet saying this is okay my six my
[03:15:27.620 --> 03:15:31.700]  six-year-old son can get on google and type in um putting on a condom and it's just straight up
[03:15:31.700 --> 03:15:37.700]  pornography and that's allowed on google on youtube it's it's it's unbelievable wow we'll

[03:24:42.740 --> 03:24:49.860]  about of course is uh not a deep state uh the term deep state would badly miss the mark the
[03:24:49.860 --> 03:24:56.420]  conservative media use the term deep state uh the reality is police state uh deep state simply
[03:24:56.420 --> 03:25:02.420]  means an entrenched bureaucracy self-serving people that are opposed to change and the dark reality
[03:25:02.420 --> 03:25:09.380]  that was a subversion of democracy that obama said in place from the get-go is a police state and we
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:16.340]  see it uh being done by his minions i want to define for you the proper term by the way uh the
[03:25:16.340 --> 03:25:20.500]  definition of a police state is going to read it to you the inhabitants of a police state
[03:25:21.220 --> 03:25:26.180]  experience restrictions on their freedom of expression to communicate their political views
[03:25:26.180 --> 03:25:31.620]  and are subject to monitoring and enforcement political control may be exerted by a secret
[03:25:31.620 --> 03:25:37.780]  force that operates outside the boundaries of the normal constitutional state so we experience that
[03:25:37.780 --> 03:25:44.580]  uh from barack obama in uh 2012 when they interfered in the election with the irs we experienced
[03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:51.540]  it of course with the doj and fbi interfering in the 2016 election and we're experiencing it these
[03:25:51.540 --> 03:25:56.820]  days with uh their minions in youtube and the people that control the uh the means of expression
[03:25:58.340 --> 03:26:05.300]  preventing conservatives from communicating uh the the deep state is a is a police state apparatus
[03:26:05.300 --> 03:26:11.700]  uh and that is the sad reality uh had hillary clinton won uh the united states would have been
[03:26:11.700 --> 03:26:16.580]  finished and we would have been had a permanent police state uh and we're still fighting against
[03:26:16.580 --> 03:26:21.220]  it you know as we speak but joe i got interrupted i was about to leave this is so profound you're
[03:26:21.220 --> 03:26:27.700]  right deep states the old cog for an emergency nuclear war type deal it's police state entrenched
[03:26:27.700 --> 03:26:32.420]  in a deep state structure that are trying to bully us into submission and they always spin
[03:26:32.420 --> 03:26:36.500]  when i talked about a police state under you know clinton and others that i was anti police no a
[03:26:36.500 --> 03:26:40.740]  police state means a tyranny controlling your speech controlling your mood but controlling
[03:26:40.740 --> 03:26:46.260]  your life and that's what the big corporations and combines and the leptis mobs and antifa and black
[03:26:46.260 --> 03:26:51.860]  lives matter are doing when they say cops deserve to die because they're bad on cnn you deserve to
[03:26:51.860 --> 03:26:59.060]  die that is the government police stating the police that's correct the uh the the deep state
[03:26:59.060 --> 03:27:03.380]  term i think we need to throw it out it really didn't describe what we're up against and we saw
[03:27:03.380 --> 03:27:09.140]  it in the last few days how all these youtube channels uh were subverted there's a uh a nexus
[03:27:09.140 --> 03:27:14.660]  between the police state and their economic interests like google youtube amazon washington
[03:27:14.660 --> 03:27:21.300]  post and they're trying to impose their will on freedom of speech freedom of movement and uh
[03:27:21.300 --> 03:27:25.540]  all we can do is keep fighting back i think we won the war the last few days but it's something
[03:27:25.540 --> 03:27:30.660]  that constantly have to be vigilant yeah it's who wants it the most we won this battle so far
[03:27:30.660 --> 03:27:36.900]  you know they're gonna hit again you know they're coming back uh it's just constant i mean i'm here
[03:27:36.900 --> 03:27:42.500]  in southern california i'm looking out at the uh reagan library from my window and i always remember
[03:27:42.500 --> 03:27:48.980]  those uh profound words of ronald reagan that uh tyranny is only one generation away you have to
[03:27:48.980 --> 03:27:54.100]  be vigilant and uh unfortunately these people will never stop they're always coming back with
[03:27:54.100 --> 03:28:02.260]  with new excuses new schemes uh new terminology uh to to prevent the constitutional republic
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:06.660]  from thriving and existing i'm going to talk about that more as we as we get into my segment
[03:28:07.540 --> 03:28:10.820]  well i almost wish i wouldn't have commented that earlier this segment was important to have some
[03:28:10.820 --> 03:28:15.220]  of the people that have been banned on uh why do you think they've backed off so far but they
[03:28:15.220 --> 03:28:23.300]  they say it's a mutiny like their own people got too zealous uh i think the uh look there's a uh
[03:28:23.300 --> 03:28:30.100]  there's a strong foundation of constitutional uh people in this country there are people the middle
[03:28:30.100 --> 03:28:36.580]  class is very strong and supports the free market system and whenever they uh go too far and they
[03:28:36.580 --> 03:28:40.420]  think they've gone too far they back off a bit because they've got so many schemes in their
[03:28:40.420 --> 03:28:44.820]  pocket they're waiting to come back with the next one so i i think uh that's right they're testing
[03:28:44.820 --> 03:28:49.860]  and we and we fight they back off like guerrilla go they're right back with joe gilbert stay with

[03:33:21.620 --> 03:33:32.420]  Welcome back to Info Wars the Alex Jones show. I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the
[03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:39.060]  left coast. Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones store and get my new film of course Art of the

[03:33:44.660 --> 03:33:50.660]  minutes. Coming up next segment I'm going to have Kevin Jackson the of the black sphere you know him
[03:33:50.660 --> 03:33:57.860]  as a Fox News commentator and he's going to give some some insights. I want to first give you some
[03:33:57.860 --> 03:34:04.420]  of my takes about what's been happening the last couple weeks. The Parkland shootings it's still
[03:34:04.420 --> 03:34:10.420]  all about the FBI and competence and corruption. The FBI has been missing all these shooters even
[03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:14.820]  though they had them under their fingertips Dylan Roof, Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hassan,
[03:34:14.820 --> 03:34:22.500]  the Sarnaya brothers, the Boston Marathon bombers, of course the Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen
[03:34:22.500 --> 03:34:28.500]  they investigated this guy for like two years. They said oh no problem just go back your business.
[03:34:29.140 --> 03:34:35.620]  Now what are the odds that the FBI was not all over Stephen Paddock the Las Vegas shooter
[03:34:36.340 --> 03:34:40.820]  and that's why they cut off all the information because heads would have rolled. You think maybe
[03:34:40.820 --> 03:34:46.660]  the FBI is covering up something that they had a connection to Paddock where's the videotape the
[03:34:46.660 --> 03:34:54.420]  hotel videotape all the information was cut off. So the FBI still has the chutzpah to tell us if
[03:34:54.420 --> 03:35:01.860]  you see something say something it's completely useless completely irrelevant the the best slogan
[03:35:01.860 --> 03:35:09.220]  we can live by is be prepared to protect yourself have a weapon because the FBI or police are just
[03:35:09.220 --> 03:35:14.820]  going to wait outside they're making a big deal about Parkland that four deputies waited outside
[03:35:14.820 --> 03:35:20.820]  people forget that in the Pulse nightclub shooting the entire SWAT team set up outside for three hours
[03:35:20.820 --> 03:35:28.500]  while everybody who had been shot bled to death. So how would you like to live either have some
[03:35:28.500 --> 03:35:33.860]  people on the inside like a school where there's a few teachers with weapons or have the the people
[03:35:33.860 --> 03:35:39.620]  with the weapons that are supposed to save you hanging out outside. Now I want to talk to you
[03:35:39.620 --> 03:35:47.380]  about the Parkland Promise program we're learning a lot about Broward County's very deadly promise
[03:35:47.380 --> 03:35:56.020]  program this is why Nicholas Cruz was not arrested like so many other liberal social engineering
[03:35:56.020 --> 03:36:02.900]  projects rather than saving the world it is proving to be very deadly. Now on the website
[03:36:02.900 --> 03:36:09.140]  the promise program for Broward County calls for change and intervention and it says they're not
[03:36:09.140 --> 03:36:13.940]  going to arrest teenagers for crimes essentially they're whitewashing their behavior and sending
[03:36:13.940 --> 03:36:20.420]  them back to school into the community to commit more crimes here's the quote from the Broward
[03:36:20.420 --> 03:36:26.340]  County Sheriff website this is the promise the promise is to safeguard the student from entering
[03:36:26.340 --> 03:36:33.300]  the judicial system well well well what about safeguarding the public from the criminal how
[03:36:33.300 --> 03:36:39.860]  did it work out 17 dead students one is going to jail for life what would have been better
[03:36:40.740 --> 03:36:46.660]  now then there's a quote also on their website eliminating the school to prison pipeline
[03:36:47.380 --> 03:36:51.940]  Broward County is committed to keeping students engaged in school and out of the justice system
[03:36:51.940 --> 03:36:57.460]  well how about this let's have a new slogan we promise to let you commit as many crimes as you
[03:36:57.460 --> 03:37:04.900]  want until you or your classmates end up dead that's the real promise they made to Nicholas Cruz
[03:37:04.900 --> 03:37:11.700]  and the community that's how Trayvon Martin lost his life in a similar program he was not held
[03:37:11.700 --> 03:37:17.700]  accountable for many crimes they stopped arresting students and it eventually led to the confrontation
[03:37:17.700 --> 03:37:23.620]  with George Zimmerman where he had a weapon to defend himself and Trayvon is dead because of these
[03:37:23.620 --> 03:37:30.420]  types of programs so the promise program I want to give perspective it's just the same social
[03:37:30.420 --> 03:37:37.540]  engineering by these utopian geniuses these big thinkers on the socialist part of the world that
[03:37:37.540 --> 03:37:43.700]  believe they know how human nature should be uh remember mount satong he said we're going to put
[03:37:43.700 --> 03:37:47.780]  all these farmers and collective farms and they're going to produce more food they're going to be
[03:37:47.780 --> 03:37:53.700]  happier they just don't know it until we force them onto these farms that caused the great famine
[03:37:53.700 --> 03:37:59.860]  50 million chinese people starved to death of course here in america and detroit the democrats
[03:37:59.860 --> 03:38:06.580]  were controlling detroit for 60 years the greatest american city with all the jobs and great economy
[03:38:06.580 --> 03:38:12.020]  industry mayor colman young was a socialist the idea was let's raise taxes put all these
[03:38:12.020 --> 03:38:17.540]  regulations on business and it's going to work out just great well all the businesses left
[03:38:18.100 --> 03:38:25.780]  and detroit turned into a disaster so with nicolas cruz we know that he got expelled for having
[03:38:25.780 --> 03:38:33.780]  quote bullets in his backpack well you think maybe he had a handgun and they just downgraded it to
[03:38:33.780 --> 03:38:39.780]  bullets so he wouldn't be arrested i think that's probably what happened liberal social engineering
[03:38:39.780 --> 03:38:44.740]  is a disaster it's always been a disaster but they don't give up they just say well
[03:38:45.780 --> 03:38:50.500]  it's going to work out great next time you know the va hospitals yeah well we're going to have
[03:38:50.500 --> 03:38:56.180]  the affordable care act you're going to say 5000 per family you can keep your doctor keep your plan
[03:38:56.180 --> 03:39:01.620]  and it's not going to work out like the va it's going to just going to be great so the bottom line
[03:39:01.620 --> 03:39:07.540]  is the the socialist liberalist ideologues they actually know that none of this is going to work
[03:39:07.540 --> 03:39:13.780]  out but they thrive on chaos if everything is peaceful and good if people go to church they
[03:39:13.780 --> 03:39:18.580]  earn a good living they love their country there's no justification for radical change
[03:39:19.300 --> 03:39:24.420]  they have to create this chaos through all these schemes so they can say well give us the power
[03:39:24.420 --> 03:39:32.260]  we'll fix the chaos that we created and we'll make it right for you and that's how evil some of these
[03:39:32.260 --> 03:39:37.540]  schemes are they they cause intentional harm they know will cause damage they would rather Nicholas
[03:39:37.540 --> 03:39:43.300]  Cruz not be arrested and say let's say he's got bullets in his backpack don't talk about the handgun
[03:39:44.340 --> 03:39:49.860]  and they know that he'll create the chaos they can use one day to to usurp the constitutional
[03:39:49.860 --> 03:39:55.780]  republic i want to show a video from my film there's no place like utopia it's called the weight
[03:39:55.780 --> 03:40:03.380]  of the poor and it shows you how today's democratic party is trying to bring down the constitutional
[03:40:03.380 --> 03:40:09.220]  traditional american republic and replace it with this socialist ideal can we roll that video
[03:40:09.220 --> 03:40:23.300]  so here you've got this communists are trying to overburden the system
[03:40:24.900 --> 03:40:32.100]  they use poor people they use minorities they want to create a system that can't be sustained
[03:40:32.100 --> 03:40:42.100]  and by overburdening it they want to collapse the system this is the flower thiven theory
[03:40:43.460 --> 03:40:47.460]  and they did it to new york in the 70s they bankrupted new york with this process
[03:40:49.540 --> 03:40:52.340]  the idea is that they can collapse the system they can replace it
[03:40:52.340 --> 03:41:03.220]  but this perfect society is perfect world
[03:41:04.580 --> 03:41:10.980]  now this is how you can see that the democrat party wants to sow chaos they became a radical
[03:41:10.980 --> 03:41:17.620]  socialist party compared to the 1980s the democrats worked with ronald reagan to implement huge tax
[03:41:17.620 --> 03:41:26.100]  reform and tax cuts today the democrats 100 together they knew that if america succeeds
[03:41:26.100 --> 03:41:31.860]  they will fail so they all voted against the tax cuts they know that if america works that
[03:41:31.860 --> 03:41:37.700]  they lose power so they're out to stop donald trump at all costs even at the cost of their
[03:41:37.700 --> 03:41:44.740]  constituents and that's why you see little adam schiff lying every day on tv about how
[03:41:44.740 --> 03:41:52.260]  uh uh trump is going to be impeached and all these innuendos that he puts forth so this is
[03:41:52.260 --> 03:41:58.260]  today's democrat party it's it's self socialism uh it's not the open calls for communism and
[03:41:58.260 --> 03:42:03.140]  destroying the republic uh they don't say we want to kill you anymore they say we want to help you
[03:42:03.860 --> 03:42:10.740]  and the way we're going to help you is by uh taking away all your rights and uh making the
[03:42:10.740 --> 03:42:17.140]  promise program for nicolas cruz so he only has bullets in his backpack uh this is where we are
[03:42:17.140 --> 03:42:23.860]  today and if you look closely at everything we've talked about earlier with with alex the uh the
[03:42:23.860 --> 03:42:32.260]  deep state is a police state and these are the types of schemes that go on uh i'll be back with

[03:48:06.740 --> 03:48:15.220]  black lie and race pimping the multi trillion dollar business of liberalism uh kevin jackson
[03:48:15.220 --> 03:48:22.100]  welcome to info wars hey joel thanks for having me real quick uh update i'm with genesis on the same
[03:48:22.100 --> 03:48:28.020]  network as alex actually not salem okay thanks that we got that from your website by the way kevin's
[03:48:28.020 --> 03:48:33.620]  website the black sphere the black sphere dot net uh kevin you've been talking about it for a long
[03:48:33.620 --> 03:48:38.980]  time you've seen my film there's no place like utopia where i went to south side chicago i talked
[03:48:38.980 --> 03:48:45.780]  to a lot of black people they they love obama because he's one of them they're proud of his heritage
[03:48:46.340 --> 03:48:52.180]  but when i talked to them about his policies they said we're getting poorer we want more cops not less
[03:48:52.180 --> 03:48:59.860]  cops we don't want illegals in our neighborhood we want jobs they seem to be very conservative but
[03:48:59.860 --> 03:49:06.020]  they're still supporting the democrats like 90 percent what's happening on that front and can
[03:49:06.020 --> 03:49:10.420]  that ever change those numbers i don't think those numbers look we've both been there and
[03:49:10.420 --> 03:49:17.060]  there are a lot of people that wanted obama black folks and uh he got in there he gave it a shot
[03:49:17.060 --> 03:49:22.340]  and he blew it i mean he was the mookie wilson of baseball not the jack mookie robinson rather not
[03:49:22.340 --> 03:49:28.180]  the jackie robinson and black folks know it you know now look they've invested a lot in this guy
[03:49:28.740 --> 03:49:34.100]  and it you know you can't just throw him to the wolves because that will validate the white man
[03:49:34.100 --> 03:49:38.740]  and as we know in in america today you can't do anything to validate white
[03:49:39.460 --> 03:49:44.980]  look at chuck schumer that doesn't want to vote for a qualified judge why simply because he's white
[03:49:44.980 --> 03:49:51.780]  it has nothing to do with qualification so just the idea that we have this overt racism and uh you
[03:49:51.780 --> 03:49:56.660]  know i heard you talking in the last segment about that sneaky racism it's not sneaky it's right in
[03:49:56.660 --> 03:50:02.580]  your face the congressional black caucus makes everything about white versus black it's not
[03:50:02.580 --> 03:50:09.140]  only that though it's woman versus man it's muslim versus christian or jew and on and on and that's
[03:50:09.140 --> 03:50:17.220]  what they do is divide so as far as obama's concerned look he's circa 19 uh circa 2008 these last
[03:50:17.220 --> 03:50:23.540]  years news um and and the people that still support him or lost his last year's easter eggs and i'm
[03:50:23.540 --> 03:50:31.300]  going to tell you the day of trump that has exposed obama for what he is which is an abject fraud is
[03:50:31.300 --> 03:50:38.100]  long overdue the exposure of the democrats and their racism is long overdue and how they're not
[03:50:38.100 --> 03:50:43.380]  only that they will attack not only based on race they're attacking donald trump just because he
[03:50:43.380 --> 03:50:49.940]  doesn't fit the narrative of the intelligentsia who want to believe that they are better at picking
[03:50:49.940 --> 03:50:56.980]  leaders than we are okay well kevin tell me when what was the exact time and how do you think
[03:50:56.980 --> 03:51:02.660]  the civil rights movement got away from martin luther king's vision of let's judge people by the
[03:51:02.660 --> 03:51:08.660]  strength of their character and not by the color of their skin how did it all turn around you know
[03:51:08.660 --> 03:51:15.300]  it's it's so strange that we we as conservatives have allowed the republican party to fight for us
[03:51:15.300 --> 03:51:22.180]  i mean we've got a sissy in our fight and when did it happen it happened in the 60s under lbj
[03:51:22.180 --> 03:51:29.220]  who with the along with the democrat elitist decided you know what we will continue to trick
[03:51:29.220 --> 03:51:34.500]  black people into believing that we have their best best interest in mind and that by the way
[03:51:34.500 --> 03:51:41.220]  that ruse continues to this day so when they when they set out to do this it was it was a real
[03:51:41.860 --> 03:51:46.900]  strategy and and this to be blunt and this may make some people mad probably not with alex's
[03:51:46.900 --> 03:51:52.820]  audience but just to be blunt it was let's keep black people just stupid let's keep them completely
[03:51:52.820 --> 03:52:00.260]  stupid let's rewrite history and so you've got a party of republicans who pre-black people wrote
[03:52:00.260 --> 03:52:06.020]  almost every civil rights legislation that protected black people started the nra to get black
[03:52:06.020 --> 03:52:12.820]  people guns started the freedman's bureau to get black people educated have all their white republican
[03:52:12.820 --> 03:52:17.860]  names on every hbcu that's historically black colleges and universities in the country fought
[03:52:17.860 --> 03:52:23.460]  against the clan fought against segregation fought against jim crow etc and they can't sell
[03:52:23.460 --> 03:52:29.460]  that concept to black people today because you know what you hear joel you hear well that was the
[03:52:29.460 --> 03:52:35.300]  republicans from the past and the democrats have flipped you know everybody's flipped nothing's flipped
[03:52:35.300 --> 03:52:40.580]  planned parenthood is a is a you know a scourge against black people it's very clear what it's
[03:52:40.580 --> 03:52:46.100]  meant to do it's to keep black people from breeding right and i can give you the statistics around
[03:52:46.100 --> 03:52:51.860]  how it's how it has done that when you look at the abject racism of hillary clinton and robert
[03:52:51.860 --> 03:53:00.740]  and her husband bill giving the eulogy to a clansman robert bird and democrats saying nothing by the
[03:53:00.740 --> 03:53:06.660]  way barack obama eulogized him as well they all said he had a a tangential relationship that's
[03:53:06.660 --> 03:53:11.940]  exactly what bill clinton said he had a tangential relationship with the clan 40 plus years in the
[03:53:11.940 --> 03:53:17.940]  clan is tangential now tell me that donald trump could have a relationship with a 40 plus year
[03:53:17.940 --> 03:53:23.460]  clansman and nobody and everybody just brushed it over and if he eulogized him how that would be
[03:53:23.460 --> 03:53:28.980]  done but they tell me they would be yeah it can't give you any any uh you know anything whatsoever
[03:53:28.980 --> 03:53:34.500]  to prove it okay kevin look uh trump made it a point in a campaign he went to places like
[03:53:34.500 --> 03:53:40.900]  detroit he said we're going to revitalize our inner cities uh can he do that if these urban
[03:53:40.900 --> 03:53:46.580]  areas are all controlled by democrats are they going to cooperate and will the urban communities
[03:53:46.580 --> 03:53:52.020]  demand they cooperate now they're not going to cooperate because they're invested in the
[03:53:52.020 --> 03:53:58.260]  in the uh you know the fallacy of barack obama uh i call them baby black jesus and they really
[03:53:58.260 --> 03:54:03.620]  can't put any effort into donald trump if trump goes in and he's successful in the inner cities
[03:54:03.620 --> 03:54:10.020]  with true empowerment zones it would be the end of the democrat party now our team and not to be
[03:54:10.020 --> 03:54:14.740]  self-promoting but our team is going to do this we're going to help president trump put together
[03:54:14.740 --> 03:54:20.740]  a plan they will actually do this in fact i've got meetings set up to do exactly that but don't
[03:54:20.740 --> 03:54:26.100]  think that they're going to usher us in they have to have trump fail they would do anything they could
[03:54:26.100 --> 03:54:32.660]  to make him fail even if it means black kids don't go to college black kids stay in substandard schools
[03:54:32.660 --> 03:54:38.580]  black kids stay in you know high crime areas don't think for one second the race pimps known as
[03:54:38.580 --> 03:54:44.020]  a congressional black circus clowns are going to do anything to help black folks it will not happen
[03:54:44.020 --> 03:54:49.380]  so trump to answer your question he'll do it in spite of them and that's what you got to love
[03:54:49.380 --> 03:54:53.060]  about this guy that he's saying you know and i know what i'm going to run it run with these
[03:54:53.060 --> 03:54:57.300]  clowns they're not going to do anything for me but so what how are you going to stop somebody from
[03:54:57.300 --> 03:55:02.900]  putting in you know a business that that employs blacks eventually was you know the black community
[03:55:02.900 --> 03:55:10.740]  will wake up and start to get it okay kevin look uh you're obviously live in reality tell people
[03:55:10.740 --> 03:55:17.380]  a little about your background how did you come to uh be someone who understands these issues
[03:55:17.380 --> 03:55:23.620]  whereas it seems like the vast majority of the black community are uh kind of imprisoned with
[03:55:23.620 --> 03:55:30.580]  this democrat plantation as they call it tell us about your your background well i have a the talk
[03:55:30.580 --> 03:55:35.220]  i like to do i'd say a funny thing happened on my way to prison which of course i've never been but
[03:55:35.220 --> 03:55:41.380]  my father was in prison his brother my uncle who the chairs my birthday uh he was in prison if i've
[03:55:41.380 --> 03:55:45.540]  been raised on my father's side of the family i undoubtedly would have been the prison i probably
[03:55:45.540 --> 03:55:50.980]  couldn't have escaped it i would have been the best drug dealer in indianapolis and pardon me indiana
[03:55:50.980 --> 03:55:57.940]  but i was raised by my mater maternal grandparents when my mother died now how do you avoid it first
[03:55:57.940 --> 03:56:04.660]  i'll tell you this i have never since i had a thought in my brain wanted to be a democrat i saw
[03:56:04.660 --> 03:56:10.500]  them for what they were uh as we say in the black community game no game so i knew these clowns were
[03:56:10.500 --> 03:56:14.900]  gaining us from the beginning from the moment i was five years old i've watched the democrats
[03:56:14.900 --> 03:56:20.900]  gave give a speech i went i'm nothing like that so my grandparents who were democrats by the way
[03:56:20.900 --> 03:56:25.300]  instilled in me the thing that said you're not that you're going to be accountable and all these
[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:30.340]  other things uh it was ronald reagan who woke me up to it because when he lost i don't remember
[03:56:30.340 --> 03:56:34.100]  what he lost but i remember looking at him and he gave a speech and i said that's not the speech of
[03:56:34.100 --> 03:56:40.660]  a loser that's a speech of a guy who hasn't won yet and i can't describe what that means but people
[03:56:40.660 --> 03:56:45.380]  probably listening know what i'm talking about there's a loser speech and there's a no i just
[03:56:45.380 --> 03:56:50.100]  didn't win this time speech and that's what i saw in reagan and i was like that's my guy right there
[03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:54.340]  my grandparents hated it shut up we don't like him we like democrats and i was like i don't care who
[03:56:54.340 --> 03:57:00.500]  you like i like him now here's what's interesting joel people love these racial algae or these come
[03:57:00.500 --> 03:57:06.420]  to jesus these stories about democrats converting to be republicans like sheriff clark and others
[03:57:06.420 --> 03:57:11.940]  i've never been that stupid to be a democrat i knew the history of the democrat party i knew
[03:57:11.940 --> 03:57:16.980]  they were the most vile creatures on the planet and all they've done is become they dressed up
[03:57:16.980 --> 03:57:23.860]  in silk suits that got crocodile smiles and so i knew that and as i matured and understood history
[03:57:23.860 --> 03:57:29.060]  i said i understand the game that you're playing that you've marginalized black folks and you don't
[03:57:29.060 --> 03:57:33.940]  care so as i when i wrote my first book the big black line okay kevin kevin we got it we're
