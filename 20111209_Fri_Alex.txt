[02:08.840 --> 02:11.960]  in the larger strategy that's what General Hamed ghoul thinks they're doing as
[02:11.960 --> 02:17.200]  well former head of Pakistani intelligence I had asked Aaron as I ran out
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.640]  of time I've forgotten to get this to run over to the other studio notice how
[02:20.640 --> 02:24.360]  the office and get this for me because this is also crazy because I've seen a
[02:24.360 --> 02:28.960]  lot of other things going on and driving in this morning I was listening to
[02:28.960 --> 02:37.640]  San Antonio radio am at mainline neocon and then I tuned in to 93.7 rock and
[02:37.640 --> 02:46.200]  roll scams of the dial and it was a ad for don't end up in a FEMA camp get
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.160]  storeable food today and don't go to the refugee camp to get the food which is
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.000]  actually true that's how they sell the camps in the first phase is all their
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.920]  emergency centers for the society collapsing we always said that's how
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.120]  they do it's how the Nazis did it and sure enough in the emergency centers
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.880]  establishment act it says all that I'm just gonna come out and say hi we're
[03:07.880 --> 03:13.040]  wearing Nazi uniforms and swastikas and we're going to you know first they start
[03:13.040 --> 03:16.400]  shutting down the society shutting down their competition they bring in a
[03:16.400 --> 03:21.000]  depression by design for certain groups lock down certain city areas and then
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.640]  start arresting people first questioning and releasing putting their hands on you
[03:25.640 --> 03:29.880]  cuffing you getting normal law-abiding citizens accustomed to being picked up
[03:29.880 --> 03:33.480]  by the police that's what the drills at the schools are all about so that when
[03:33.480 --> 03:38.280]  they finally pick you up to take you away forever you don't resist it's all a
[03:38.280 --> 03:42.560]  psychological warfare program and it trains the cops to always put their
[03:42.560 --> 03:47.280]  hands on citizens who aren't in the criminal class and to take blood and to
[03:47.280 --> 03:54.720]  taser people and to ban protest and all of this is a program a psychological
[03:54.720 --> 03:59.640]  warfare program when I saw this news last night we had Stuart Rhodes on about
[03:59.640 --> 04:09.960]  it it was amazing because I also found a news channel five story that was totally
[04:09.960 --> 04:17.240]  separate in Tennessee mainstream TV one of the big stations in the state
[04:17.240 --> 04:24.600]  reporting that the state under federal auspices is going door-to-door asking if
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.200]  you have storable food and the state means well because Stuart's talked to
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.400]  some of the some of the state police involved and then they give it to the
[04:33.400 --> 04:39.560]  feds and the feds put you on a list and and then separately they confirmed at a
[04:39.560 --> 04:44.720]  storable food outfit in Tennessee that the feds came in without a warrant and
[04:44.720 --> 04:48.360]  said give us your full list and they wouldn't so they basically blew up and
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.800]  left and said we're coming back so something's going on with this food
[04:52.800 --> 04:58.040]  thing and I'm well we'll be right back it is a big transmission lined up today

[05:20.800 --> 05:26.200]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[10:20.000 --> 10:24.880]  about your storeable food and then Oathkeepers has an alert that's up at
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.320]  info wars.com federal agents demand customer list from Mormon food storage
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.920]  facility I'm gonna get Kurt Nemo to integrate the news channel article and
[10:33.920 --> 10:37.800]  this one into our own because there are executive orders about food
[10:37.800 --> 10:44.280]  confiscation during emergencies well I mean they can sign executive orders and
[10:44.280 --> 10:47.880]  then they've got them on the books for gun confiscation they're criminals the
[10:47.880 --> 10:52.160]  government in the past the Supreme Court has said that they could sterilize
[10:52.160 --> 10:59.400]  Native Americans in the 30s and that black people weren't human I mean our
[10:59.400 --> 11:05.720]  government for a while was linked up with Hitler just because these crooks
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.440]  have a bunch of paramilitary goons who think it's cool to go out of people's
[11:10.440 --> 11:14.720]  food supply raw milk's not able storeable foods not bad the Amish aren't bad
[11:14.720 --> 11:19.520]  the government's bad people running this government are bad I mean there's more
[11:19.520 --> 11:23.240]  news and Holder has been caught perjuring himself and he says well no he
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.200]  said nobody lied at the DOJ that's a quote and here's a headline he says it
[11:28.200 --> 11:34.360]  has nothing to do he went on to say it has to do with your state of mind so he
[11:34.360 --> 11:38.400]  says no one is lying and it has to do with your state of mind these are people
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.360]  caught shipping guns into Mexico drugs back into the country and laundering the
[11:42.360 --> 11:48.640]  money New York Times last Sunday finally admitted it AFP on Monday and and he
[11:48.640 --> 11:54.760]  gets up there and says I didn't lie DOJ didn't lie it meant our intent our
[11:54.760 --> 11:57.760]  state of mind we weren't trying to lie of course they said they weren't trying to
[11:57.760 --> 12:01.480]  blame it on the Second Amendment those memos have been made public by CBS two
[12:01.480 --> 12:06.880]  days ago we wrote a more detailed article at info wars.com so they are a pack
[12:06.880 --> 12:13.000]  of criminal liars tyranny is when the government hijacks the population it's
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.480]  when the government is taken over by criminals and it happens in every case
[12:16.480 --> 12:23.800]  to every culture no empire and no nation has ever lasted more than 235
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.280]  years you bet you we are the record holder America the United States is
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.160]  long in the tooth and criminals have taken over all the major power positions
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.040]  Horsine went in and said I don't know where the money went when he gave the
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.920]  orders to take the private accounts and then resigned I mean do you get it they'll
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.520]  do anything and why because all of the federal regulators are his former
[12:49.520 --> 12:55.200]  employees the head of the CFTC is his former right-hand man who was invested
[12:55.200 --> 12:59.400]  in MF global and has disappeared and no one in the mainstream media saying why
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.680]  is he disappeared where is the money it's just well we're gonna learn from
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.480]  this so the money's gone okay well thank you thank you mr. Mr. Corzinal well
[13:09.480 --> 13:11.400]  thank you very much yes I don't know where we're going they're like oh that
[13:11.400 --> 13:15.740]  sounds very reasonable oh thank you and you've got holder up there saying I
[13:15.740 --> 13:22.920]  didn't lie to you okay we did know but we didn't mean to lie when we lied I mean
[13:22.920 --> 13:28.360]  do you get it folks these are dangerous criminals who run homeland security and
[13:28.360 --> 13:31.960]  they will stage terror attacks you better believe that there's a new
[13:31.960 --> 13:35.480]  announcement they're out today homegrown terrorists are gonna strike and
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.440]  homeland security says their new main focus is domestic right wing groups and
[13:40.440 --> 13:43.240]  and they're and the right wingers are gonna blow stuff up any minute we've
[13:43.240 --> 13:46.800]  got all rest them because the right wingers exposed us shipping guns into
[13:46.800 --> 13:51.720]  Mexico and and our stealing money that's what's really happening is the
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.800]  patriots know who these crooks are have studied them and have been on top of
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.200]  this and now our credibility is going straight up straight up like a Saturn
[14:00.200 --> 14:06.360]  rocket okay heavy lifting right into orbit above these criminals we've got
[14:06.360 --> 14:11.040]  the high ground they know it they don't like it so what are they gonna do they're
[14:11.040 --> 14:14.000]  gonna start wars they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on domestic groups
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.320]  and sick the paramilitary steroid heads on us and that's not gonna work either so
[14:20.320 --> 14:24.600]  oh it is just disastrous let's go ahead and play part of the exchange on C
[14:24.600 --> 14:30.240]  span yesterday with Eric Holder up there caught lying memos all public
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.800]  shipping guns into Mexico and then blaming the Second Amendment for it a
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.720]  false flag caught red-handed that has killed hundreds of people including
[14:39.720 --> 14:45.760]  three police officers and three Border Patrol agents confirmed confirmed so
[14:45.760 --> 14:51.600]  they could blame the Second Amendment it was never about tracking the guns and
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.320]  tracking the drug money the banks that run this country oh they sure track the
[14:56.320 --> 15:02.880]  drug money oh absolutely they run the entire operation including the aircraft
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.800]  shipping the drugs in source Bloomberg AP Reuters three hundred and seventy six
[15:07.800 --> 15:12.960]  billion dollars in two-year period walk over your Wells Fargo running the giant
[15:12.960 --> 15:19.480]  aircraft leasing them paying for them running them running the aircraft the
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.400]  war on drugs is to bust anybody shipping in large quantities that isn't
[15:24.400 --> 15:32.200]  laundered to the globalist operation period end of story you know what
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.040]  let's just go and go to this clip here it is what are you gonna do to clean up
[15:36.040 --> 15:41.840]  this mess well first let me make something very clear and in response to an
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.760]  assertion that you made it pause back it up I'm gonna start over again notice
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.440]  even the toughest questions he got from that particular congressman is how are
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.040]  you gonna clean up this mess that's like asking a rapist that busts in a house
[15:54.040 --> 15:58.520]  and rapes a woman he's lusting after and knocks her teeth out and shoots her in
[15:58.520 --> 16:02.520]  the head and the cops show up there's a dead woman there and then they say how
[16:02.520 --> 16:08.440]  you clean up this mess like it's a mess he intended to engage in this crime it
[16:08.440 --> 16:15.320]  isn't a mess it isn't an accident it isn't oh gee I didn't build you know
[16:15.320 --> 16:20.600]  this five-story balcony correctly and my wife went out there and it fell and she
[16:20.600 --> 16:24.720]  died and so I get a involuntary manslaughter charge for negligence
[16:24.720 --> 16:28.680]  that's not what we're talking about we're not talking about cleaning up a mess
[16:28.680 --> 16:34.320]  we're talking about dirt bag criminals staging a terror attack of guns on our
[16:34.320 --> 16:39.040]  country in Mexico to blame the Second Amendment caught red-handed by these
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.080]  terrorists these are terrorists go back to the terrorists go back to him what
[16:44.080 --> 16:49.400]  are you gonna do to clean up this mess well first let me make something very
[16:49.400 --> 16:54.400]  clear and in response to an assertion that you made or hinted at nobody in the
[16:54.400 --> 16:58.880]  Justice Department has lied but I was the letter withdrawn the letter was
[16:58.880 --> 17:04.040]  withdrawn because the information in there that was inaccurate Justice
[17:04.040 --> 17:07.520]  Department letter of February okay well tell tell me what's the difference
[17:07.520 --> 17:13.040]  between lying and misleading Congress in this context well if you want to have
[17:13.040 --> 17:17.120]  this legal art conversation it all has to do with your state of mind and whether
[17:17.120 --> 17:20.680]  or not you had the requisite intent to come up with something that can be
[17:20.680 --> 17:25.360]  considered perjury a lot information that was provided in that February 4th
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.400]  letter was gleaned by the people who drafted the letter after they interacted
[17:29.400 --> 17:32.160]  with people who they thought were in the best position well who have the
[17:32.160 --> 17:38.560]  information okay now now the way stop right there they ordered subordinates
[17:38.560 --> 17:45.080]  who weren't part of the program to write a letter that'd be like if the cops came
[17:45.080 --> 17:51.800]  here to question let's say me for a hit-and-run they think I hypothetically
[17:51.800 --> 17:56.840]  was involved in and they're here to interview Alex Jones and I won't talk
[17:56.840 --> 18:01.200]  to him I just say go talk to the secretary and then of course the
[18:01.200 --> 18:04.920]  secretary is gonna go I don't know if two weeks ago Alex Jones ran over
[18:04.920 --> 18:10.880]  somebody and drove off from the scene and then it turns out that I did run over
[18:10.880 --> 18:14.520]  the person and then and then they're sitting there going well that was
[18:14.520 --> 18:17.720]  because the people who were involved didn't know anything about it that's
[18:17.720 --> 18:22.920]  right and you had people when you were subpoenaed by Congress go and lie for
[18:22.920 --> 18:27.600]  you who supposedly weren't involved and it turns out you have publicly said you
[18:27.600 --> 18:33.120]  didn't know and now it's known that you didn't know and that Janet Reno
[18:33.120 --> 18:41.280]  Napolitano that's right miss Napolitano misses Janet Napolitano I'm sorry
[18:41.280 --> 18:45.120]  the future with Janet Reno same type of criminal creature same clone whatever
[18:45.120 --> 18:52.720]  off off the same devil's apple card here they are here they are just in
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.600]  everybody's face lying lying in the memos CBS has them oh we're gonna do this
[18:56.600 --> 19:00.000]  and blame the second amendment won't it be great yeah what a bunch of dirt bag
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.120]  crooks and if you don't think these people won't stage terror attacks that
[19:04.120 --> 19:08.240]  attorney general was the deputy attorney general that when Oklahoma City
[19:08.240 --> 19:14.240]  happened and was in it to his eyeballs he's a very dangerous person that's a
[19:14.240 --> 19:18.200]  that's a hardcore criminal people are like that's shocking to say hey they
[19:18.200 --> 19:23.360]  ship guns into Mexico to blame it on the second amendment
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.520]  okay let's finish up the clip as we go to break we'll come back here it is now
[19:28.520 --> 19:35.000]  that's a you know a question of because there have been inconsistent submissions
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.120]  to Congress you know you yourself testified that you'd only heard about it
[19:40.120 --> 19:44.320]  a few weeks earlier and then in November you said that probably was a few
[19:44.320 --> 19:52.640]  months as late as October 7th in response the allegations that you lied on

[24:19.720 --> 24:26.160]  control criminal government that does whatever it wants whenever it wants
[24:26.160 --> 24:33.840]  however it wants and again it's not fun this is not a game it's not a joke we
[24:33.840 --> 24:39.760]  have a government that ships guns into Mexico to get people killed so they can
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.800]  take our guns away that is terrorist face it and driving into work this morning
[24:45.800 --> 24:55.000]  I saw not one not two not three not four but five state police cars in a 20 minute
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.800]  drive riding people tickets and I watched and they're pulling cars over
[24:58.800 --> 25:05.840]  there might have been going five six miles over the speed limit I mean it is
[25:05.840 --> 25:15.560]  so incredible to see this kind of stuff going on it is so amazing to see this
[25:15.560 --> 25:21.480]  type of garbage here they are nickel and diming people while they have a
[25:21.480 --> 25:25.480]  completely criminal government and it's on record that illegal aliens across the
[25:25.480 --> 25:28.640]  United States are above the law and the state police all over the country just
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.240]  leave them alone and the state police have admitted it to my face but while the
[25:32.240 --> 25:36.840]  citizens have the book thrown at them show that the state of Texas could buy a
[25:36.840 --> 25:45.640]  600 plus thousand dollar 34 foot speedboat to interdict criminals on Texas
[25:45.640 --> 25:49.600]  waterways we sent a crew out yesterday when they were showing it off the media
[25:49.600 --> 25:55.160]  you could buy six boats I went and looked it up that were as big as this and
[25:55.160 --> 25:59.720]  almost as fast for the same price but why not they've got plenty of money why
[25:59.720 --> 26:03.840]  not have ten million dollar helicopters everywhere harassing people while
[26:03.840 --> 26:07.880]  while while mafia government sits there and robs the daylights out of
[26:07.880 --> 26:12.680]  everybody that's the same all over the country you're about small town mayors
[26:12.680 --> 26:19.320]  giving themselves eight hundred thousand dollars a year you read about this stuff
[26:19.320 --> 26:25.960]  and it just goes on and on and on and on and on let's go ahead and finish up
[26:25.960 --> 26:32.160]  with the other clips down we played all of it where he's where he's up there
[26:32.160 --> 26:38.400]  saying nobody at the DOJ has lied and he says it has to do with your state of
[26:38.400 --> 26:43.400]  mind I mean just the arrogance of these people and then look at this article out
[26:43.400 --> 26:49.680]  of USA Today White House unveils a new strategy to combat homegrown terror a
[26:49.680 --> 26:55.520]  White House unveiled a strategy Thursday aimed at battling homegrown
[26:55.520 --> 27:00.600]  terrorism that emphasize better coordination with local authorities the
[27:00.600 --> 27:05.360]  United States has made significant progress in degrading Al Qaeda's
[27:05.360 --> 27:09.120]  capabilities who they put in charge in Libya and get on airplanes I mean it's
[27:09.120 --> 27:13.720]  just pure bull when you know about their stuff President Obama noted today that
[27:13.720 --> 27:17.440]  22 of the top 30 Al Qaeda operatives have been killed or captured under his watch
[27:17.440 --> 27:20.840]  intelligence officials suspect the terror organization is increasingly focused
[27:20.840 --> 27:25.400]  on seeking US-born collaborators to carry out attacks and it goes on to say
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.720]  they're now looking at domestic groups and fighting the strategy has brought
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.200]  outlines for fighting extremism and then you go through the national security
[27:34.200 --> 27:38.960]  strategy and it's the libertarians the gun owners the returning veterans yada yada
[27:38.960 --> 27:43.120]  yada the normal deal shifting the whole thing over now as you see with the TSA
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.000]  PSAs where every terrorist is a white person clean cut and every person
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.920]  reporting them as a so-called minority we're already basically the majority in
[27:51.920 --> 27:57.520]  this country all the quote minorities together so and they admit yes we're
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.480]  rebranding so first they sold to white people all the brown people are terrorist
[28:01.480 --> 28:04.920]  you go to the police shooting ranges you know that's who they're shooting people
[28:04.920 --> 28:09.120]  in turbines or brown-skinned people in the little pop-ups and then now they
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.080]  cuz white folks are like well we said you know us we're not really racist but
[28:12.080 --> 28:15.080]  still he's not a white guy I mean you know brown guys are a little bit
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.480]  different than us and now it's okay well now we're just gonna say all the white
[28:18.480 --> 28:21.960]  people are terrorists too and so they're done everybody's a terrorist nobody can
[28:21.960 --> 28:26.160]  be trusted except the government they're gonna take our rights away to fight the
[28:26.160 --> 28:29.000]  terrorists when they're not getting the underwear bomber on the airplane
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.300]  confirmed congressional testimony when they're not protecting a major
[28:34.300 --> 28:39.320]  Hassan for two years on record when they're not getting the shoe bomber on
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.280]  just mentally ill patsy's or when they're not shipping the guns into Mexico to
[28:44.280 --> 28:50.880]  then destabilize things and blame the second amendment I mean there it is and
[28:50.880 --> 28:56.680]  imagine what else is going on with these people it's incredible and now in
[28:56.680 --> 29:02.120]  Tennessee they're going door-to-door and they went to a Mormon cannery that's

[34:32.720 --> 34:36.240]  religious part of how the elite are operating because I know they've taken
[34:36.240 --> 34:39.160]  over the World Council of Churches National Council of Churches I know
[34:39.160 --> 34:44.040]  they're putting their propaganda in at every level I know all of that is
[34:44.040 --> 34:51.120]  happening and I know they've taken over many of the churches and so that's
[34:51.120 --> 34:54.560]  part of their program when you say devil Messiah that means their their
[34:54.560 --> 34:58.560]  counterfeit shirts at the Rockefellers have set up at others so I want to just
[34:58.560 --> 35:03.480]  until we go out you know to the end of the hour here I want to let you roll
[35:03.480 --> 35:07.600]  here you don't need to thank me or any of that you know normal pleasantries just
[35:07.600 --> 35:12.240]  you just get right into the five points the Iran point and then what they got
[35:12.240 --> 35:15.840]  into what the elite believes gonna happen in 2012 because I know who your
[35:15.840 --> 35:20.080]  source is Dr. Montief talked to him and the other source in from who's now died
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.880]  of cancer last year and so I want to just hear from you what they have to say
[35:23.880 --> 35:28.240]  because so much of what they've broken down has come true and unfolded
[35:28.240 --> 35:31.560]  Lindsay Williams thanks for being with us here on short notice from since
[35:31.560 --> 35:38.160]  yesterday I feel so honored that years ago God would have allowed me to be asked
[35:38.160 --> 35:43.080]  to be the chaplain to the elite of the world for a three-year period and then
[35:43.080 --> 35:47.120]  to keep in touch with these people over these years so that I could come here
[35:47.120 --> 35:53.800]  today on the Alex Jones show and save you major heartache if you had listened
[35:53.800 --> 35:59.960]  you do it those of you who did listen to Mr. Ken Tom before he died if it's
[35:59.960 --> 36:03.480]  written on a piece of paper it's worth the paper it's written on you didn't
[36:03.480 --> 36:08.760]  lose one single penny in the MF global collapse and bankruptcy here the other
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.280]  day because you listened to what he said this is how the elite can save you
[36:14.280 --> 36:21.720]  these men are old 708 is the talking is our men you will not lose a single penny
[36:21.720 --> 36:26.160]  in the dollar collapse and I think you'll be next year but from what they're
[36:26.160 --> 36:30.120]  telling me you will not lose one penny in the dollar collapse if you were just
[36:30.120 --> 36:34.400]  merely followed the guidelines of the things we're trying to tell you that
[36:34.400 --> 36:38.800]  the elite are telling me the brothers Messiah agenda which I'm going to get
[36:38.800 --> 36:44.320]  into today you you your family will not be corrupted your children will not
[36:44.320 --> 36:51.520]  suffer the onslaughts of this agenda in 2012 because you have heard the truth
[36:51.520 --> 36:55.320]  right here on the Alex Jones show and you know what to do I'm gonna try to do
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.520]  exactly what Alex just said I'm gonna try to give it as fast as I can I'll
[36:59.520 --> 37:07.280]  begin first of all with Iran I was contacted within the last week this is
[37:07.280 --> 37:13.040]  only days ago and my elite is a friend let me know everything is going to
[37:13.040 --> 37:19.080]  happen with Iran but it is going to be a conflict with Iran but it is not going
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.880]  to take place right now now I'm sticking my neck out a long ways today I have no
[37:23.880 --> 37:29.880]  choice I must tell you what is being told to me so that you can prepare for
[37:29.880 --> 37:36.000]  what is going to take place they want a conflict with Iran now you remember three
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.880]  years ago I went to Mr. Farm and I said is there going to be a conflict with
[37:40.880 --> 37:45.000]  Iran he laughed over the phone and said no not for at least two and a half years
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.560]  well it happened exactly like he said I'm telling you now according to my
[37:50.560 --> 37:57.720]  elitist contacts there is going to be a major conflict with Iran it will
[37:57.720 --> 38:03.320]  probably take place well up into 2012 it is not going to happen this month next
[38:03.320 --> 38:07.000]  month or possibly the following month they would only have our worships over
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.640]  there Russia has their worships over there Syria is a major issue China has
[38:12.640 --> 38:20.960]  said I will come to the rescue of Syria if NATO goes in Iran has said that they
[38:20.960 --> 38:27.080]  will go to the rescue of Syria if we do anything over there so that puts China
[38:27.080 --> 38:34.440]  Russia Iran the United States of America on the collision course I know it's
[38:34.440 --> 38:40.600]  right now so touchy they showed a picture of our drone they actually captured
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.560]  the drone that we sent over Iran and showed a picture of this thing that it
[38:45.560 --> 38:50.840]  is a star drum unbelievable my son showed it to me on the internet last
[38:50.840 --> 38:56.440]  night so all of these things are being done to harass intimidate every way they
[38:56.440 --> 39:01.960]  can to get Iran upset because they do not want Israel to shoot the first shot
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.560]  they do not want the United States of America to be had the shot that was
[39:06.560 --> 39:11.240]  heard around the world they want to harass and intimidate and anger Iran to
[39:11.240 --> 39:17.400]  depart that Iran will do the first and then it came out as to why you know
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.800]  sometimes it's really not what the elite do as much as it is the reason why they
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.600]  do it and the reason why they're going to are doing what they're doing in Iran
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.640]  what do they do to North Korea why don't they take on other nations who have
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.800]  the bomb why is it that they pick on Iran so much why is that the number one
[39:37.800 --> 39:42.600]  issue right now the reason why is the thing that is very important let me
[39:42.600 --> 39:48.440]  read it again it is people please you must you must shout this across this
[39:48.440 --> 39:52.960]  nation I'm so glad that I have the privilege of being on one of the most
[39:52.960 --> 39:59.560]  prominent conservative radio talk show host program today Alex Jones and
[39:59.560 --> 40:04.400]  Genesis Network that is doing such a marvelous job because I have the
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.880]  opportunity to let millions of people know today folks you must stop this
[40:09.880 --> 40:16.400]  president of ours you positively must know what the agenda is whereby he is
[40:16.400 --> 40:20.960]  connected with the elite and what the elite had told me about our land is
[40:20.960 --> 40:26.080]  connected with what he plans to do he's in trouble right now his ratings are
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.360]  down the economy is in shambles the unemployment lines are getting longer
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.360]  and longer and another route to you you've got to know this and whatever you
[40:35.360 --> 40:39.160]  see what happened I hope it wouldn't rage you okay but Lindsay Lindsay I want you
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.840]  to go over all that but the time we've got them let you take us out to break
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.480]  here so I'm turning my mic off and you know we're sitting back it's hard for
[40:45.480 --> 40:49.760]  me not to jump in because my brain burns with you know points I want to make get
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.440]  into the religious angle and what their devil messiah is because that's the point
[40:54.440 --> 41:01.840]  you didn't get to yesterday yes there is a alright let me try to find the word
[41:01.840 --> 41:08.040]  here right quick okay do you really have a think tank and back about five or six
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.440]  months ago I was given the fire the budget and burst off the elite for the
[41:12.440 --> 41:18.920]  year 2012 and I was so startled until I didn't do a single radio talk show for
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.720]  over two months I couldn't I was scared to death with what I had and when I
[41:23.720 --> 41:27.320]  when there was the devil's messiah now you've heard me speak with this before
[41:27.320 --> 41:31.440]  because for Mr. Farman I rolled the phone together back to three years ago he
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.160]  used the expression one day devil's messiah and I couldn't quite understand
[41:35.160 --> 41:39.560]  what he was saying and I didn't understand it very until now and you see it
[41:39.560 --> 41:47.560]  during 2012 folks please 2012 will be the most eventful year in 2000 years and
[41:47.560 --> 41:52.120]  one of it one of them is because of the devil's messiah program and Mr. Farman
[41:52.120 --> 41:56.160]  used that expression and I said Ken what are you talking about and he went on to
[41:56.160 --> 42:01.400]  explain it is not a part of the book of Revelation it has nothing to do with the
[42:01.400 --> 42:07.200]  endocrine rather it is the program whereby they had to demoralize America by
[42:07.200 --> 42:13.160]  removing the God that made America great from our society before they could
[42:13.160 --> 42:17.480]  bring in the New World Order they have amazingly succeeded through our
[42:17.480 --> 42:23.360]  spirits through our churches 501c3 for the church for the spirits they put in
[42:23.360 --> 42:27.440]  evolution so that people would think they were evolutionized animals and act
[42:27.440 --> 42:31.560]  like them they brought in the drug craze they've gotten us in war after war
[42:31.560 --> 42:36.080]  they demoralized our nation and brought us to the point where they could bring
[42:36.080 --> 42:42.880]  in that demoral the immoral program which is devil's messiah and this coming
[42:42.880 --> 42:52.160]  year 2012 they have an an agenda that is accelerated to the devil's messiah
[42:52.160 --> 42:58.160]  program it is so sparkling until when I tried to put this in the DVD I had I
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.400]  couldn't I really couldn't say it the words would not even properly describe
[43:03.400 --> 43:07.760]  what these people were doing we actually had to show it in about 10 to 15
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.560]  minutes of DVD clips in order to explain to you what the devil's messiah
[43:12.560 --> 43:18.720]  program is and it basically is during 2012 they have certain goals that they're
[43:18.720 --> 43:24.040]  going to bring in one of them is to bring our nation to the point that we
[43:24.040 --> 43:30.560]  were beg for plead for and what the new currency and the New World Order and part
[43:30.560 --> 43:35.120]  of doing it is to so demoralize the nation that will have no conscience
[43:35.120 --> 43:41.240]  whatsoever as to what we should do morally so the devil's messiah program is
[43:41.240 --> 43:47.200]  a demoralization program for the year 2012 accelerated during that year now
[43:47.200 --> 43:52.760]  when we were on set doing this new DVD 2012 the beginning of the end I asked
[43:52.760 --> 43:56.920]  an individual to be with me who is one of the outstanding financial advisors of
[43:56.920 --> 44:00.840]  America and right on the set I didn't know he was going to do this right on
[44:00.840 --> 44:05.080]  the set he said wait a minute chaplain he said my son experiences the other day
[44:05.080 --> 44:09.880]  I said what are you talking about he said my son always home schooling he said
[44:09.880 --> 44:14.960]  we moved out to out of the city and into the country we thought that in a
[44:14.960 --> 44:18.760]  smaller town environment we would not put up with what we put up with in the
[44:18.760 --> 44:23.000]  city so we put him in the public school he said my son he's a teenager by the
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.320]  way he said he came home the other day and he said daddy I gotta tell you what
[44:27.320 --> 44:32.560]  I saw he said we refused to watch it he said we had no church appeared on the
[44:32.560 --> 44:37.000]  television he said every classroom in America that has a television showed
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.480]  this and he said it was a president of the United States of America talking
[44:41.480 --> 44:45.200]  about the very thing that I've heard you talk about and he wanted to tell me
[44:45.200 --> 44:50.240]  that the president of the United States of America was saying and we've got it
[44:50.240 --> 44:54.480]  on this new DVD record is so you can see it but the president of the United
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.000]  States of America said about the demyelization program the Debra's
[44:59.000 --> 45:05.000]  Messiah agenda which I was you will not hear this expression Debra's Messiah
[45:05.000 --> 45:12.360]  from any of the news media it is their personal code words for their program of
[45:12.360 --> 45:18.040]  demyelization of the United States of America it is even being promoted by the
[45:18.040 --> 45:22.160]  president of the United States of America in the classrooms of our country
[45:22.160 --> 45:27.600]  and you are going to be faced with a demyelization program for you and your
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.640]  children in 2012 that will bring us to the point that people will no longer
[45:32.640 --> 45:37.280]  have a conscience to turn down the new world or the system folks you must be
[45:37.280 --> 45:42.280]  guarded against it now let me tell you what 2012 is so vitally important to
[45:42.280 --> 45:48.280]  this and this again goes back to the think tank of the elite and when I was
[45:48.280 --> 45:53.240]  told this for five months ago it started me so much I started doing my own
[45:53.240 --> 45:59.680]  Bible study why is it that 2012 is so important no no no no now it's not the
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.720]  modern calendar that is not the only reason yes it don't take the modern
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.040]  calendar for for granted after all that was a very advanced culture for that
[46:09.040 --> 46:14.960]  time and they did develop a calendar and I think it's December the 21st 2012
[46:14.960 --> 46:19.960]  they'll bring this present dispensation to an end and start a brand new one and
[46:19.960 --> 46:25.640]  don't take that for granted but that is not what it's based on the elite and I'm
[46:25.640 --> 46:30.520]  sorry to have to say this but in many instances the elite know more about
[46:30.520 --> 46:35.280]  prophetic scriptures than what the average pastor does and I say that having
[46:35.280 --> 46:40.400]  been a pastor with church for 12 years myself the think tank of the elite have
[46:40.400 --> 46:45.960]  come to the conclusion that in 2012 there are going to be some divine
[46:45.960 --> 46:52.120]  manifestations but whenever I told you why they came to this conclusion
[46:52.120 --> 46:57.080]  pastors I have never heard this in any department in America I never gave it
[46:57.080 --> 47:02.280]  myself I never said until this was told to me back a few months ago and when I
[47:02.280 --> 47:07.360]  saw it I was utterly done found it I'll give it as quickly as I can and Alex
[47:07.360 --> 47:10.440]  again thank you so much for kind of giving me the floor here because you're
[47:10.440 --> 47:17.080]  right I have a right to say why 2012 and not the year 2000 there's a very
[47:17.080 --> 47:22.520]  definite reason why everybody I mean every Christian I know myself included
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.840]  when the year 2000 came around I knew something was going to happen in the
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.520]  divine realm I'm not talking about the coming of Christ I'm talking about so
[47:31.520 --> 47:36.640]  many bits in the divine manifestation realm but it didn't happen nothing took
[47:36.640 --> 47:41.640]  place and I must admit I was disappointed because I know that from
[47:41.640 --> 47:47.720]  the from the Old Testament that from Adam until Christ was for a thousand
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.000]  years I mean no question about knowing this go to the genealogy to the Old
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.640]  Testament you'll find it for yourself we know that from Christ and until right
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.080]  until the year 2000 was approximately 2000 years it might have been give a
[48:02.080 --> 48:06.040]  take a little bit because the woman calendars off but not much now I must
[48:06.040 --> 48:11.200]  go to the scriptures please write this down and this is exactly what the elite
[48:11.200 --> 48:16.800]  note down pat they know it's gonna happen second Peter in the New Testament in
[48:16.800 --> 48:23.040]  God's holy word second Peter chapter 3 verse 8 it says one day is with the Lord
[48:23.040 --> 48:28.560]  as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day please read the context all
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.040]  of you get your Bible to open them up after the program don't you change that
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.560]  dial now and after the program open them and look for yourself at the context of
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.880]  second Peter 3 8 and you'll find out that it's talking about a relationship
[48:40.880 --> 48:47.880]  between the seven days of creation in the book of Genesis and that God's
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.400]  time table is in six days he created the heavens and the earth the seventh day
[48:52.400 --> 48:57.280]  arrested we know the seventh day is like unto the millennium of a 1,000 years
[48:57.280 --> 49:02.320]  and you take the other 6,000 and what do you have it brings us up to the year
[49:02.320 --> 49:08.640]  2000 if it goes as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day in the mind
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.880]  and the type the way that God thinks well what is that put places it places the
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.160]  year 2000 and this is the reason that many of us felt that something would
[49:18.160 --> 49:24.560]  take place in the year 2000 and I was disappointed the elite know why
[49:24.560 --> 49:29.320]  something's going to take place in 2012 I asked you the question for lack of
[49:29.320 --> 49:34.800]  time to give the explanation please get the link the explanation on our DVD
[49:34.800 --> 49:40.800]  series 2012 the beginning of the end and why is it happening in 2012 there's a
[49:40.800 --> 49:47.760]  reason why at what age did the ministry of Jesus Christ begin it did not begin
[49:47.760 --> 49:52.720]  at his birth his birth was very insignificant it was in a manger in a
[49:52.720 --> 49:59.360]  stable and nobody came to it except the the shepherds now the last man didn't
[49:59.360 --> 50:03.120]  come on to a pocket possibly two years later reach your Bible folks I learned
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.120]  Christmas time they've got the wise men shepherds are out on the church alone
[50:07.120 --> 50:11.760]  in a scene but it's not true look at your Bible you'll find out that the wise
[50:11.760 --> 50:17.120]  men came about two years later to a house to see a young child and the
[50:17.120 --> 50:22.320]  one person that came to his birth was the shepherds and when they came nothing
[50:22.320 --> 50:27.120]  would it be not broadcast all over the countryside even the I've shown so when
[50:27.120 --> 50:31.560]  they had it on it had one back in those days it was so insignificant but one
[50:31.560 --> 50:37.680]  day the ministry of Jesus Christ began please go to Hebrew tradition he's
[50:37.680 --> 50:42.840]  called Bob Mitzvah it's approximately 20 years and again the globalist are
[50:42.840 --> 50:46.800]  completely obsessed with numerology the occult everything and they've claimed

[54:10.080 --> 54:14.120]  we've got Steve Shank coming on the longest continually operating storeable
[54:14.120 --> 54:17.640]  foods company in the nation where I've gotten my storeable foods I bought them
[54:17.640 --> 54:20.960]  from three or four other places and they were all terrible or old this is
[54:20.960 --> 54:26.080]  fresh quality made in America but the reason is they're getting flooded with
[54:26.080 --> 54:29.560]  phone calls and they called us this morning and I made some other calls
[54:29.560 --> 54:33.640]  other storeable foods outfits are as well because of article out of news
[54:33.640 --> 54:40.000]  channel five in Tennessee door-to-door assessment for disaster preparedness
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.480]  and amongst the 22 questions is they don't list the questions there but we've
[54:43.480 --> 54:47.320]  talked to the locals they are asking you have storeable food firearms stuff like
[54:47.320 --> 54:51.600]  that says 22 questions are asked they may include what is your primary way of
[54:51.600 --> 54:55.720]  getting in information during a disaster emergency what special assistance
[54:55.720 --> 54:59.120]  might you need from emergency responders but this is being handed back to the
[54:59.120 --> 55:03.400]  feds and then we have oathkeepers confirming from their Tennessee head
[55:03.400 --> 55:07.040]  that a and of course the group doesn't want to be named but they've been there
[55:07.040 --> 55:13.320]  and confirmed it that a Mormon cannery they're a smaller one people going by
[55:13.320 --> 55:17.840]  storeable foods I was visited by the FBI so we don't know this is isolated to
[55:17.840 --> 55:23.360]  this or was connected to this but storeable food is getting huge now and
[55:23.360 --> 55:26.600]  I heard it on a rock and roll station this morning I'm not don't go to a FEMA
[55:26.600 --> 55:30.160]  camp be prepared and and so the well we're gonna talk to Steve shank about
[55:30.160 --> 55:33.200]  it because if he knows anything about this and I've talked to him he there
[55:33.200 --> 55:36.200]  isn't any information but he could speak to it generally he'll be able to
[55:36.200 --> 55:40.720]  break it down for us when he pops in and then Bob Chapman going back real quick
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.480]  Lindsay we're almost out of time here and I appreciate you coming on we'll have
[55:43.480 --> 55:47.400]  to check in with you in the near future again now four five six months pass and
[55:47.400 --> 55:50.320]  I just like on the twinkling of an eye like wow we got to get Lindsay Williams
[55:50.320 --> 55:56.440]  on so so so the yes I mean for those that studied the Bible it things are
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.120]  repeated over and over again what happens in a Zeke yield and manifest in
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.400]  another way I know it's very complex but theologians understand it and
[56:03.400 --> 56:08.320]  certainly does manifest itself so so finishing up with the timetable of why
[56:08.320 --> 56:13.600]  the elite from reading the Bible believe 2012 is such a big year 2012 is a massive
[56:13.600 --> 56:19.160]  info year in 2000 years because the cars of when Jesus Christ began his
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.240]  ministry the prophets of the scriptures would have given anything to live in
[56:23.240 --> 56:28.520]  2012 this is the most exciting year you ever live in you remember 12 years of
[56:28.520 --> 56:33.560]  age that Christ was taken by his parish to the temple and in modern day Hebrew
[56:33.560 --> 56:37.880]  tradition would have been carpalmets and when they would hear him and joking
[56:37.880 --> 56:42.560]  harm I want to reach his words how is it that you sought me wish you not that I
[56:42.560 --> 56:47.000]  must be about my father's business at what year did Jesus Christ begin his
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.280]  earthly ministry you you have to hear the whole background to this he began it
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.920]  at 20 years of age what 2000 nothing happened there was something catastrophic
[56:56.920 --> 57:01.200]  the most unusual you've ever seen going to take place sure you're saying at the
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.480]  end of his 12th year about to become 13 that's why it's at the end of 2012 they
[57:06.480 --> 57:10.520]  think all this stuff is going to happen because it's 6,000 years from Genesis
[57:10.520 --> 57:17.880]  with 12 years added on the end that's basically what the this former old
[57:17.880 --> 57:23.320]  company CEO told you there will be divine manifestations is what they're
[57:23.320 --> 57:28.060]  saying I did not say divine intervention you remember that when Daniel was
[57:28.060 --> 57:32.000]  starting the lounge there the book of Daniel God did not save him from the
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.040]  lounge then if they went to the lounge then wouldn't that's not going to come
[57:36.040 --> 57:39.240]  back and save you from the new world whatever that's going to give you enough
[57:39.240 --> 57:42.920]  sense and understanding to know what to do so that you can live another life
[57:42.920 --> 57:45.160]  through what the new world orders going to give you
[57:45.160 --> 57:49.160]  I'd like me to act in a bendigo the three Hebrew children glad did not keep
[57:49.160 --> 57:52.720]  him from going to the fire furnace he went in the fire furnace with them and
[57:52.720 --> 57:58.120]  what about the seven fat years and the seven lean to yes and the king went down
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.600]  into the fire furnace and he said wait a minute how many did I throw in there and
[58:02.600 --> 58:08.200]  the soldier said three and he said I'll see you further down there and the
[58:08.200 --> 58:12.440]  truth is back and on to the son of God you are going to see the adage I
[58:12.440 --> 58:16.040]  guarantee you that you have been on your program at least once a month
[58:16.040 --> 58:20.600]  interpreting what's happening in 2012 we want to see some of the most

[58:24.560 --> 58:28.760]  programs you're going to see unusual things about the financial world take
[58:28.760 --> 58:33.040]  place in 2012 it's got a full first for much of the scriptures you will be

[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.840]  frequent guests here on air then Bob Chapman is going to join us but at 40
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.960]  after we're gonna have Steve Shank on of e-foods direct dot com the biggest and
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.960]  longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation because we
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:53.380]  ran a story yesterday Oathkeepers reports and picked up articles out of new
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:57.400]  channel 5 out of Tennessee where there's door-to-door assessment for disaster
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.200]  preparedness and one of the things they're asking him with 22 questions we've
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.560]  talked to folks is you have storeable foods firearms it's it's a federal
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.560]  snooping operation the state police who Stewart and others have talked to
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.800]  mean well and the and the people they've got involved mean well but they
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:18.880]  they're feeding it back to the feds and then on top of that Oathkeepers alert
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:24.720]  federal agents demand customer list from Mormon food storage facility and of
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.080]  course e-foods directs the biggest in the country they're out in Utah but they're
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.800]  not affiliated with this group and of course Stewart didn't release the name
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.880]  of the group because they're obviously a little concerned so people are like
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.440]  running around trying to find out what group it is we know who the group is we
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:42.240]  haven't released the name but we may do that or or get them on air so people are
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.240]  trying to find out well what group is this they came in to the group they
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.360]  said we want your customer list they said no you know we don't keep list and
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.960]  plus you don't have a warrant the feds got mad and left so that's what's going
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.200]  on on that front and we're gonna get an update from him because they've never
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.840]  had the feds visit them or ask for a list but this has always been a concern
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.360]  and it shows because it's confirmed they're going door-to-door asking about
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.120]  emergency preparedness and they've got weird billboards up saying get prepared
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:14.840]  but then listing it as a thing that's extremist the Southern Parvy Law Center
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:21.840]  and others to store food so very bizarre that all of this is going on but it
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.880]  fits into the bill being passed to have indefinite detention of American
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.560]  citizens use the military domestically KBR of Halliburton now activating the
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.880]  FEMA camps preparing the teams nationwide we got those internal memos
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.000]  and the fact that they're getting the subcontractors ready I'm not saying that
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.560]  they're going to execute this but the point is they're getting it lined up and
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:49.520]  ready and you notice there's warships in the med the Persian Gulf Russia making
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.680]  threats nukes being moved around Pakistan threatening Pakistan cutting off
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:01.640]  supply lines in Afghanistan China's who the other president saying we may have
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:08.560]  war with the United States prepare for war three days ago so this is super
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:14.960]  creepy and then I have why net news out of Israel I one of their big
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.360]  publications risk of Israel US strike on Iran has tripled senior risk analyst at
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:26.160]  Barclays Capital says chances of military operation increased from five to ten
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.960]  percent of 25 to 30 percent in the past year and then they also have another
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:35.440]  article here on this on Reuters so we're going to get Steve Pachennik's update on
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.000]  all of this Steve Pachennik of course co-wrote many of the books and was the
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.520]  advisor on the all-time best-selling and military adventure novels they're so
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:51.800]  realistic of course with Tom Clancy he's got a MD and psychiatry from Harvard
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.000]  and also a PhD from Cornell Medical College and one of the only people ever
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.280]  get both those at the same time and I can't go over his illustrious bio and he
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.320]  of course has worked on overthrowing foreign leaders you name it I mean to
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.160]  try to get into it we some day we got to get Steve Pachennik on about himself and
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.040]  everyone's talking about himself and any stories he can tell us this because
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.840]  they're so interesting but Steve Pachennik.com of course helped us expose
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:22.840]  and I've since talked to a national media figure and then talked to the
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:28.560]  individuals they put me in contact with at very high level in the current CIA and
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:33.960]  they just say we want to tell you you're right about bin Laden very bizarre three
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.360]  weeks ago to have this person reach out to me just to say I just want to tell
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:45.040]  you you're right about bin Laden very very strange to to have that happen and
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.640]  I'm just gonna leave it at that but there's a rebellion going on in the
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.320]  government right now against all this stuff that's happening and that's pretty
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.600]  much been admitted Steve Pachennik told us about it months ago the daughter
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.280]  Pachennik joins us now doc all this crazy stuff happening and Pakistan what's
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:09.280]  really going on right now well you I'm always glad to be in your show Alex and I've got to tell you how important your show is really going on what's
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.440]  happening in Pakistan is we have literally created a civil war in Pakistan in the
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:23.080]  attack of our killing 22 Pakistani officers as part of a long-term attempt
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:30.560]  by the CIA not by our military but the CIA to create a government a shadow
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.320]  government within Pakistan and what we're literally doing in the Pakistani
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:41.160]  state is to divide the ISI the interstate intelligence unit against each other
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:46.080]  the plus the military the Pakistan against the civilians civilians against
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:51.120]  civilians because we no longer trust the Prime Minister or any element within
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.920]  the inter-service intelligence agency which we created 20 30 years ago to help
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.520]  us fight terrorism so what's happened is we have got used drones to kill
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:06.360]  Pakistani soldiers and others when we felt have not been helping us and we
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.160]  have created literally the American shadow state in Pakistan we have gone
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:16.520]  in and created what's called the key unit within ISI ISI is the inter-service
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:23.240]  intelligence and out breaking and outsourcing of the CIA 20 30 years ago
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:29.440]  to fight but the estimate of the ISI has been working with the military
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.680]  government and the Prime Minister to try to stabilize it so we are now in a
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.000]  civil war that we've created by the CIA civilians under Panetta and we have
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  disrupted the entire state of Pakistan and breaking it down now Pakistan more
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.840]  than Iran or any other state is the most dangerous country that we can take
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:56.680]  apart because of the nuclear bombs that are there and their ability to use it
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:02.560]  and the ability for them to break away from any central control now even the
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.680]  CIA senior analyst including Luther I tell who's one of the top CIA operatives
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.280]  who created the plan for the Afghanistan Iraq borders and having our
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.280]  soldiers in the CIA said this is a bad situation going to worse and one of our
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:26.160]  senior generals who was fired by Panetta and Obama a distinguished admiral by the
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.360]  name of Dennis Blair who's the director of national intelligence said
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:35.200]  repeatedly the CIA cannot run these drones continuously into Pakistan and
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.240]  CIA that is not a covert operation covert is first law is short period of
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.480]  time a long period of time is a military action and we have to we have to have
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.440]  transparency rules of engagement and he was fired for that so within the
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:56.280]  military we are having a major war between the military the army the Navy
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:02.440]  and the civilians the civilians are in control of an organization that is
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:07.160]  totally out of control now and what's happening is the American public is
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.680]  paying twenty billion dollars twenty billion just to pay off some of the war
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.640]  laws that we have to create in this secret government or the American
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.760]  shadow state in Pakistan it is so serious that not one legislator has
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.600]  talked about it not one republican contenders talked about it and of
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.920]  course our president of the United States never mentioned it and instead he
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:36.040]  made this absurd comment that he killed Osama bin Laden so what we have is
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.960]  disinformation we have lying and we have a war where our brave men and women are
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:46.600]  being killed for a strategy that makes no sense and objective we could never
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.400]  reach which is stabilize Pakistan and instead we have created a very own
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:57.200]  problem thanks to the CIA once again running the drones when in fact no carry
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.520]  superiors like Dennis Blair and others from state tax have said we have take we
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:08.480]  have to take over the drone activities in Pakistan and elsewhere in order to
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:15.000]  make the collateral damage on top of that to make matters worse we now have
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  lobbyists you won't believe this Alex I know the audience won't believe us who
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.680]  are going around to lobby for a group called the M.D.K. the fans name is
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:31.680]  Musa Hadid who are Iranian terrorists who I fought against in the 1970s and 80s who
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.880]  killed many of my operatives and civilians and contractors who worked
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:41.720]  for Homeini but Homeini who took us hostage during the same period of time
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:47.840]  never killed one of my hostages on the State Department but the M.E.K. which did
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:53.960]  kill six to ten of my people on the field in the 70s have hired the following
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.080]  people to lobby this group to the Secretary of State Clinton to tell them
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:04.120]  to de-list this terrorist group the M.E.K. for money so each one of the following
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.880]  people have received $30,000 to de-list the terrorist group there was Howard Dean
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:17.320]  and Governor Rendell, General Wesley Clark, General James Jones, CIA Director
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:22.360]  Wolsey, CIA Director Gross and one of the greatest whores of all in the
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.600]  lobbyist is Fran Townsend who you see on CNN repeatedly as a quote expert in
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.720]  counterterrorism and then she was exposed last night by Anderson Cooper
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:36.520]  which sees a CNN contributor for also being a whore for lobbyists for a drug
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.200]  company in smallpox where they had nothing to do with it then we had
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.680]  Rudy Giuliani all of whom were hired for $30,000 to $50,000 mind you this is a
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:52.720]  well-known terrorist group that's killed my people our American people and have
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.720]  been paid 30 years later to de-list them from the terrorist group so basically we
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:03.160]  now have an industry where you can hire politicians and ex-politicians to use
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.240]  their prestige to say that that group of let's say Osama Ben-Lon is not a terrorist
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.280]  or Al-Qaeda is not a terrorist this is what's happening now in the United States
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.240]  well I mean Steve, Dr. Steve Pachinic sir guess we gotta go to break when I come
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:21.160]  right back but it's like that everywhere look at MF Global where he's the CEO he
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.480]  takes the money and he tells them I don't know where the money went in front of
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.480]  Congress the ATF's been caught shipping guns into Mexico and the memos have now
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.520]  been released but they were gonna blame it on the Second Amendment and have
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.720]  that's a false flag event and and and now it's just government totally for sale
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:43.040]  you've got the Solara group you've got a 500 million given to an energy company
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.640]  that never even built anything I mean it is it in a corrupt world it's
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.080]  accelerating we'll ask you why on the other side and then there's proof of
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.440]  what you're saying about the CIA trying to cause a civil war riots in Pakistan
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:00.000]  for a secret deal with US to pay 2.3 million blood money to free CIA agent
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.360]  who shot dead two men what happened man you used to be energetic happy and wow

[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.320]  folks we had general hameed ghoul on who the media is called the real head of
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.280]  al-qaeda the point is we've had him on out five six times over the years because
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:25.000]  a lot of people listen over in pakistan and he's a national figure there and he
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.600]  said they're trying to start a civil war but he went on to say that's probably
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:36.040]  what it is and he gave evidence but he said it is it is a crazy plan because
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.960]  it's only going to unify pakistan in his words and he said I don't like it but
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.520]  now the military basically is running pakistan I want to get dr. Steve
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.880]  pacinic who you could say at that same peer level as a counterpart somebody
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.440]  like general hameed ghoul is also very crafty individual and intelligent but
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.560]  here's daily mail associated press you name it this is just a last week and
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.000]  then it happened again months before that riots in pakistan after secret deal
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.560]  with us to pay 2.3 million blood money to free CIA agent who shot dead two men
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.800]  and they tried to claim diplomatic immunity and he's out shooting people
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:19.920]  it was also reported that he was trying to give uranium to some of the so-called
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:27.960]  muja hadeen tribal groups dr. pacinic is a real expert on this what do you make
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:34.800]  of that case with the CIA agent what was the name Raymond Allen Davis what did
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.400]  you make of that situation and of course that's more credence to the to the
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.600]  destabilization program and do you agree with ghoul that it's having the
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:48.240]  opposite effect number one I'm not a great admirers I told you repeatedly
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.760]  over the years because of the CIA and there I think one of the things I must
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:59.040]  say that having worked for president Carter who fired 4,000 CIA operatives at
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.880]  the time I thought he was wrong in retrospect I think he was right the CIA
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:08.080]  is totally out of control and then it has been very inept in managing the CIA the
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:13.040]  CIA is totally corrupt they have been no strategy that totally dysfunctional even
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:18.360]  as one of the senior officials has said as I said Bruce Raigel who created the
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:23.720]  program what they're creating is not only a nationalized program what they're
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:30.200]  doing is destabilizing the entire area far beyond already in a failed state so
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.600]  let me explain what that means Pakistan is really a tribal area did not be
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.600]  unified there are eight or nine families that control the entire country and are
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.080]  totally corrupt Benazir Bhutto was corrupt her husband who's now the
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:49.040]  president of Pakistan was in prison when I was there and I worked with the senior
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:54.040]  official Yahub Khan who put him in prison and I have been working with the
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.960]  Islamic fundamentalist 20 years ago where I went to school with him and they
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.640]  were trying to make a revolution in a civil way and that would happen because
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.400]  there is no plan the CIA has no objectives and it's totally dysfunctional
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:13.080]  that's why the military must take it over they have created a dysfunctional
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.840]  state now they won't be unified I think the general is correct in certain ways
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.360]  I think it's much more serious than that I think they're going to be so
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.560]  fragmented because the AFTA that's called the federal industry tribal zones
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.000]  where we have a lot of problems and hundreds of Pakistani soldiers were
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.040]  killed before Mr. Arif was in charge and Mr. Arif gave us the United States and
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.520]  the CIA permission to come in and become a shadow state within the Pakistan
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.440]  so you have to understand what that means that means within our own country we
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:51.480]  will have foreign troops to be a shadow state to try to destabilize every state
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.080]  from New York the East Coast all the way to California there is no more
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.480]  Pakistan what it is now they're not going to unify what will happen is they will
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:05.920]  fractionate and then groups will take those bombs and use them at will where
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.120]  ever they need to because we can't control it and what happens and as our
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:16.440]  troops are honorable warriors have left Iraq and Afghanistan and 100,000 will
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:21.800]  be leaving they have spent their lives in their bravery for a
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:27.000]  strategy that makes no sense in the meantime the CIA took it over destroyed
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.040]  Pakistan just throwing trying to destroy Iran that won't work so we have two wars
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:37.760]  that are in effect going on at this particular point but we call it covert
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.800]  operations it's not a covert operation they are literally wars one is a civil
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.320]  war that we have created with this president all right let me ask you this
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:53.440]  then doc doc this is important what is the strategy then in Pakistan what is
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.960]  what what are they what is the strategy then what do they think they're doing
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.480]  the strategy was that we were to take over the United States the CIA wanted to
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.440]  take over the divisions of the ISI which is called Kestivation that's that's the
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.360]  term they use which wasn't working with the United States to quote kill
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.760]  terrorists well those terrorists with a movement of Dean that we created in
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:20.000]  Al-Qaeda group and Al-Qaeda were all that we created in other words we created our
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.280]  own mess 20 years ago we go in there to try to clean up that mess and instead we
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.760]  created more of a mess so we have no strategy we have no focal point you
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.440]  don't have a Kissinger you don't have a baker you don't have a force you don't
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:40.040]  have a point of strategy where it says we need to stabilize the country in order
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:45.400]  to maintain stability instead we destabilized it is just waiting for it
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.040]  to be destabilized China's backing stay there doc stay there finish up when we
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:56.560]  come back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.120]  website it's got incredible information StevePachinick.com
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:41.480]  Pachinick spelled P-I-E-C-Z-E-N-I-K or just try to spell it right in Google get
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:45.240]  it for you StevePachinick.com our websites of course are prisonplanet.tv
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:51.280]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com so you disagree then with Gull saying that he
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:55.440]  thinks this is unifying the country or perhaps Gull saying that try to put a
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.680]  good face on it but I do see your point if they do try to cause a civil war
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.960]  they're not gonna be able to shift some new government and control that it's
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.480]  gonna break the country up but but as some would say that's what Israel that's
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:16.600]  what India might be wanting so I understand from your perspective there
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.000]  seems to be no method to this madness finishing up on Pakistan a brief comment
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.640]  on Russia the attacks now on Hillary the warships Russian and US in the med the
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.960]  Chinese president saying prepare for war with the US I mean they haven't talked
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:37.680]  like that as you know in decades what is this escalation globally all about
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:43.000]  Dr. Pachinick? It's very simple what they see is a weakness in the president of the United States
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.920]  when Russia sees a weakness in the president like Obama who cannot assert
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:52.480]  his will or is not strong they start to attack the president I have to give
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.360]  credit to Hillary for standing up and saying to Putin that in fact you are
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.280]  crooked but furthermore first of all you have to know who Putin as Putin worked
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.360]  in the Stasi under Marcus Wolf for 80 years he was talking by East Termin
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.280]  intelligence in effect I will tell you something that'll be talking to most
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.040]  people we in the intelligence community put Putin back in there in order to
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:18.920]  stabilize Russia after we took down the Soviet Union the reason we did that is
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.920]  Nelson was totally corrupt it really could it was dismantling the entire
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.920]  Republic and ironically in the game of stability in national interest Putin is
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.760]  really let's say the output sourcing of CIA and intelligence work at a time when
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.640]  we really were effective in doing what we need so Putin is a good grace to the
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.720]  US government in turn he's told to pull it because he knows he's getting to
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:49.120]  become increasingly wealthy by supplying gas and oil to Germany he himself has
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.480]  been able to play games with China but in effect Hillary has done an excellent
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:58.720]  job of saying don't put us too far because we can come back and hurt you
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.240]  the way we did under the Soviet Union now the one thing I will ask Hillary to do
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.680]  is to be not to de-list the MEK which her husband that grew up the Musa had
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:13.240]  been the people's liberation army out of Iran was the terrorist group that her
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.080]  husband put on the list as terrorists but he didn't put on the list as terrorists
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.680]  that's excellent China in turn as having an economic problem they're not
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.640]  exploding as much as they can they have to pay more money for their middle class
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.960]  and they're having over 75,000 riots a year which they should have and actually
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.800]  the Chinese middle class and students are being thrown out because there's not
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.160]  enough work for them and I would say to my Chinese compatriots to continue to
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:43.760]  fight the Chinese government the Congress party is encroaching as a new
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.040]  time so very well into private entrepreneurs so what's happening is
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:52.840]  in order to distract the attention away from China they're trying to put up the
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.760]  protective force structure into East Asia and we in turn correctly are moving
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.160]  our naval bases the same fact that's commanding for the Pacific we're moving
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.120]  all our naval assets into the states of Malacca the China Sea in order to deny
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.480]  access to the Chinese transport systems so that if they get out of control
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:16.560]  because it's an area called the Spratly Islands where there's a lot of oil and
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:21.160]  China has illegally claimed the order belongs to them so they are now in a
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:27.120]  small conflict with Vietnam Cambodia the Philippines and Indonesia we in turn and
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.800]  I think it's a very good strategy Hillary's done is made the Vietnam our
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:38.400]  ally Indonesia our ally Myanmar which was suppressed our ally and Cambodia which
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.400]  I worked on the Khmer Rouge and the disarming so from that point of view
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.320]  what's happening is we are effectively moving our strategic interest to the
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:52.080]  Far East in order to contain and deny access to the Chinese in terms of
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.080]  Europe we have a real problem but not as much of a problem as everybody
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:01.400]  believes our exports to Germany France and Italy are not as great as everybody
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:05.840]  thinks what is a problem is again the issue of the core signs of the world he
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.960]  is totally corrupt now I say this not as a psychiatrist as a man who changed
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:14.640]  regimes but I was also a managing director of a major investment banking
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.360]  firm which I took down in six months because of their own corruption that
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.400]  was kid of Peabody so I knew exactly what Corzine did he did all the balance
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:28.240]  sheet our county which means that what the what the Senate is looking at is on
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.640]  the PL profit and loss statements on the balance sheet official what he did was
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:39.200]  unofficially take all the monies from the farmers our hard-working farmers and
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:46.920]  American citizens use that 600 million to invest in high risk 37 to 1 ratio risk
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:52.120]  in other words if I put in the dollar I'm betting on $37 that I can make the
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:56.560]  money on it he put risked it on sovereign debt on an off balance sheet
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.240]  accounting that means if you and I did that you and I would be in prison
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.520]  Corzine must go to prison there is no if ands and buts about it I speak as a
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:10.440]  former managing director as a former gunslinger in the private industry and
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.760]  you know very well as a former individual who brought in the head of the
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:19.560]  SEC to clean out a guy named Gary Lynch Corzine must go to prison if he does not
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.440]  go to prison it will be an indication to our farmers to our citizens that the
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:29.600]  system is so corrupt that not even the most corrupt of all of them will be
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:34.040]  up to what will be it's on a rating so we have a problem here and if the if our
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.520]  judicial system can handle it our legislative system can handle it than
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.080]  the people of the United States the farmers and the American people must
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.160]  handle it personally because he is corrupt all right doc doc we're out of
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.760]  time hopefully we can get you back up next week for an update I'll come on
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:53.200]  next week I like it thank you very much Alex and thank you audience all right
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:58.560]  thank you for coming on with us wow yeah I mean of course I can get away with
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.720]  leveraging 600 million to now 3 billion missing and say I don't know where the
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.840]  money went I mean that's ridiculous he was the CEO and for the first time in
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:10.600]  the mercantile's history just say the money's gone you're not getting it most
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:15.720]  of you and people's private accounts of companies they they bought and then they
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:20.920]  looted the accounts just amazing if they can get away with that the sky's the
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:29.720]  limit now we have seen a giant homeland security movement in this nation to
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:35.760]  demonize patriots people that prepare people that homeschool it's already done
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:41.840]  the dies already cast I mean the the just department has now been caught and
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:47.840]  it's been confirmed in perjury shipping guns themselves to Mexico not just
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.560]  selling them out of gun shops to destabilize Mexico to take control of
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.520]  other drug cartels and to then blame the Second Amendment that CBS News New York
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:02.360]  Times they are criminals so the sky is the limit and I've told you this for
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.560]  years the banker bailouts what's happening in Europe they're gonna implode
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.680]  the world economy to bring in the world government you've heard Lindsay Williams
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:14.000]  you've heard Gerald Salente Max Kaiser you've heard Steve Pachinic they all
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:22.040]  agree Dr. Paul Greg Roberts Bob Chapman Ron Paul collapse collapse by design and
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:28.160]  so I get up here many revolutionaries finance the revolution by robbing banks
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:33.800]  or by robbing stagecoaches in the old days the founding fathers did that no
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:40.680]  bite by taking British ships we don't do that we use the free market system
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:46.480]  promoting things I believe in to fund the nightly news the daily radio show
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:50.840]  TV that the award-winning films that reach tens of millions a piece the
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:56.400]  websites that reach millions a day now with the truth we don't do like the
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.720]  communists and others you know in modern times out robbing people to fund
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:07.160]  themselves I promote things I believe in and now everybody's getting into the
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.640]  food business there it is hysterical I listened to San Antonio radio I listen
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:20.320]  to two radio stations this morning San Antonio a.m. in between listen to voice
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.240]  messages and then I tuned a 93.7 KELB J and heard an ad for a storeable food
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.680]  company saying don't end up at the FEMA camp basically you never stand on a
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.640]  bread line of your own bread taking everything that you know Steve Shanks
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.200]  basically put out of the years and saying it I mean that means it said all
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:43.080]  time proportions when everywhere I tune and on TV I see storeable food storeable
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.080]  food the funny thing is we're not going to be mean and say the companies most
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.600]  these companies you see out there are either selling old food or foreign food
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.640]  that's still somewhat old or they're trying to get Steve shank who's got the
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:59.200]  biggest factories biggest outfits in the country to have him produce for him and
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.840]  he's so busy he's like no I'm not doing it and a lot of people claim to be oldest
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:07.440]  or the best no Steve shank is I've looked into it and he's where I've got my
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:11.640]  storeable food I bought it other places and it had MSG or weird stuff or was
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.600]  made in China just incredible I get my storeable foods for me foods direct.com
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.880]  now I didn't get him on today I got him on to be an informational expert for us
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.360]  because of what's happening in the country and then I automatically turn into
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:28.640]  a food pitch because with my sponsors I believe in them I promote what I do
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:35.760]  gold silver food guns pro family I mean I home schooling I do it you know
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.480]  whatever you hear me promote I do it except for one area because we some
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.040]  things we can't buy that aren't made in Mexico or somewhere else most of our
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:47.840]  products are made in America some aren't or part of it isn't you know the glue
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.880]  for the DVDs is made in China sorry they don't make it anywhere else you know
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:56.480]  I mean yeah they're made in the US but part of it's from China the point is I
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:01.280]  walk-to-walk I talk to talk and then when I talk to talk I walk-to-walk so I
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.000]  got Steve I will have him this segment the next and then into eight after this
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.920]  a part of a segment than two others because I got him on a little bit late
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:13.200]  here I called him and said please come on because you know we're getting calls
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.800]  from people saying that they're calling you and all this stuff because of two
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:26.440]  different news articles I've got here in front of me here is news channel five
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.720]  dot com the big one of the big TV stations there in Tennessee in Nashville
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:36.240]  and it says that for emergencies they're doing door-to-door assessment for
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:41.240]  disaster preparedness and our contacts in Tennessee have confirmed they won't
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:44.680]  say what the 22 questions are but it's do you own firearms do you have
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.040]  storeable food the news says they asked 22 questions but then don't tell you the
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:53.720]  22 questions so we know so we have this article then Stuart Rhodes is confirmed
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.960]  he knows the name of the place there don't want to be public it's a small
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.240]  Mormon cannery you know where they you know sell storeable foods people can
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:04.960]  bring their own farmers and get it stored because they believe not just in
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.360]  getting selling you food they want to teach you how to do it which everybody
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.200]  used to do my grandparents on my dad's side you know candle the day they died
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:15.520]  and I guess that's weird and evil but that's what you know the grasshoppers
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:22.520]  don't store food the aunt does and the ant survives but continuing here you know
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:27.000]  any frontier stocker into into storing food it's just it's fun to do it's it's
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.600]  good to can your own food and you do it but but there Tennessee chapter head
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:39.600]  Rand Cardwell went to it confirmed they went to this Mormon cannery the feds
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:45.280]  came in FEMA and wanted to know their list of who was buying food and they
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:49.120]  said a we don't keep list and B we're not going to give it to you you know you
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:53.960]  don't have a warrant get out of here but this story's gone huge it's just
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:57.320]  absolutely gone huge and so people been calling us they've been calling a food
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.320]  saying well have the feds come to you no no no read the article it's not a
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.880]  foods direct it's a small outfit so we don't know if there's some group they
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.720]  sold to that the government's concerned about but why would you be concerned
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:13.000]  about you know drive peas or whatever but I believe because of Tennessee and the
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.640]  checkpoints everything it's a testing site with the roadside checkpoints the
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.880]  TSA all of it is centering around T Tennessee and the states that are around
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.160]  it that's the center of the country the heartland of the nation you know the
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:30.120]  volunteer state and Tennessee was basically founded Texas most my ancestors
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.560]  were from Alabama and Tennessee the point is is that you talk about Texas you
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.800]  know root and toot and fighting for freedom that's all out of Tennessee so
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.280]  the system does not like Tennessee period and there's definitely stuff going on
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:46.240]  there but we don't know exactly what's happening yet but you add this into other
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.320]  stuff that's gone on executive orders about you know food hoarding so with one
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:56.720]  arm the government says get ready store food and then with the other though then
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:00.080]  it's like ooh I had the awesome police chief here a couple days ago in studio
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.840]  and after he's like why are you in the storing food Alex and I'm like well the
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:08.360]  government store stuff food and weapons so and the cops all that were with him
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.320]  thought it was you know well I guess they were laughing at him or me they
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:15.120]  claimed they were listeners but the point is you're crazy with all this
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:18.600]  coming down on you to count on the government to have storeable food for
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.040]  you so I've the long five six-minute preface we'll keep them as long as we
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.280]  have to get this covered and go to Bob Chapman but but but Steve shank you are
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:31.080]  the national expert that's why I've got you here you've been in this 40 years you
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.520]  are the big outfit you are the quality food you are the real McCoy you you're
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.520]  not all these other people rushing in now that folks are finally concerned and
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.440]  getting food you were country when country wasn't cool you were canning food and
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.040]  when it wasn't cool because it's you know part of your common sense belief
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.360]  system so you are the preeminent expert on this is why we've got you here but
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:56.880]  I'm still gonna turn into a pitch for food because I don't care people need to
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.280]  get it I know you said I'm not coming on to pitch food I said I want you on to be
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.720]  our expert so you're here tell us what's going on
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.040]  awesome we've got Steve shank joining us for the first time ever from from
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:14.880]  video sky Steve are you there I am Alex it's nice to hear your voice again it's
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:17.120]  a good to have you know we're going to break in a few minutes you know I'm
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:24.040]  long-winded but break down your view at a preliminary level on this this
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:31.000]  information from Tennessee well I I think it's really interesting that one of
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.400]  the things that we've always done Alex is is we've concluded that everything
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.720]  has an advantage for us if we look at it the right way when when the Patriot Act
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.520]  was passed and it was indicated that if you had a disaster and you weren't
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:51.840]  capable of of re of sustaining yourself for 30 days that you'd be required to
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.960]  go to a gathering center this was quite offensive in some perspectives but if
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.160]  you think about it if in fact the relief organizations were going to try to
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.840]  support the people who hadn't properly taken care of themselves they'd have a
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:13.720]  really hard time delivering breakfast lunch and dinner to five million homes
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:19.600]  at any given point in time cannot be done that's that's the strongest argument
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.920]  for families actually taking responsibility for themselves so what
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:28.960]  we've always said and and and you and I've had many conversations on this
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:34.160]  subject is that those who are capable of preparing and taking care of
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.800]  themselves must do it it's not only not only their personal responsibility that
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:44.200]  are families but it's their patriotic duty as Americans to take care of
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.600]  themselves so that the relief organizations who are willing and
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:52.120]  prepared to take care of families can be free to take care of those who are
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:57.200]  unable or unwilling to take care of themselves when the disasters come so
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:04.400]  much more a common-sense perspective let me address immediately the subject of
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:09.440]  the of the Tennessee issue as I understand it some agents went in and
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:15.800]  we're asking one of the LDS canary operations for their records and
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:20.920]  appropriately the response was no we don't keep records of things like that
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:27.440]  is not something that that we do and in our case we're a large nationwide
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:32.320]  organization we're shipping food all over the country and we're into other
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:40.680]  countries in fact and so food is is is a very private and personal thing if you
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:43.960]  walked up to your friend and said how much money do you have in your savings
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.960]  account they'd consider it kind of offensive some people in the climate
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:54.560]  that we have if if you walked up to them and said how many guns do you have they
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:58.480]  considered somewhat offensive and that would be private personal information
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:03.800]  how much gold do you have that type of thing is is what the German governments
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.120]  tried to get the kids to tell their parents by giving him candy during
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:13.040]  World War two but the fact is that very simply food is so personal it's the
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.720]  greatest dependency that we have and the wisdom of preparing yourself and
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:24.040]  storing and having the ability to control that you see people can't control
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:30.560]  the disasters that occur the man-made events that are referred to in some of
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.880]  the FEMA council to get prepared people can't control any of that but they can
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:41.160]  control their greatest dependency by having a supply of food so having said
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:46.600]  that very simply our perspective on the records that we have of people that use
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:52.520]  their credit cards and and pay cash and do whatever they do to get themselves in
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:57.520]  a situation where they have reliable security for their family all of those
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:04.120]  records are encrypted kept off-site and very very secure and we don't see that
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:08.600]  as necessary because of the federal government being hostile we see that as
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:15.240]  just an extremely important issue of privacy you can't go into a bank and
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:21.280]  and say to the manager of the bank hey listen I know John Schmelz and I want to
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.440]  know how much money is in his account that's a personal thing and your food
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:30.280]  being even more basic than money being even more basic than ammunition and
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:35.400]  guns being even more basic than just about anything else for families that
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:41.640]  are concerned about taking responsibility and and fulfilling their
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:46.080]  patriotic duty to be responsible Americans and take care of themselves
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.520]  that's a very private matter and it's just as secure and just as importantly
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:58.280]  done so as would be your bank account or anything else that you have I mean what
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:03.000]  does this tell us though because we know that police department state
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.040]  departments they've been hoarding food for years now the fact that they are
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:12.200]  wanting to know this why do you think they're going door-to-door in Tennessee
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:18.840]  why are they focusing on Tennessee is Tennessee a a beta test what's your gut
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:28.040]  on that well my my my gut is that yes it can possibly be I love that ringer
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:39.800]  that's awesome my gut feel on the Tennessee issue is that there are
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:48.120]  elements within the the federal organization that that are are interested
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:52.640]  in tracking and finding out what's going on with the folks you can look at it
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:57.560]  from a positive standpoint and say well gee whiz now I know that some of the
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:03.480]  work in Tennessee is being done by just saying hey we we want to make sure people
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:08.600]  are listening to us and preparing and we want to take a survey to see how many
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:12.280]  people are doing it so we can we can we can encourage it more
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:17.920]  unfortunately from our past history that has not been the motivation in many
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:23.240]  cases for gathering information on the part of the of the system so I think
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:28.600]  that it would be well taken by families to be concerned with this I would think
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:35.760]  that it would cause people if there is that much interest and it it is somewhat
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.040]  negative from the standpoint of our personal freedoms I would think that the
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:45.640]  wise thing for families to do is to take this as a as a maybe a red flag that
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:50.680]  says hey guys if it's that much of a concern and it could be a negative
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:55.320]  issue it might be something that people need to consider really getting serious
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:00.480]  about getting themselves prepared well that's my next point is that government
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:04.840]  has always made fun of being prepared because they want you dependent unless
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:07.280]  you're in Switzerland well they've got their head screwed on straight they say
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:12.360]  have a year of food have firearms know how to use them that's because Switzerland
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.160]  wants to be sovereign and secure and then expanding on that now the feds as you
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:21.160]  know the last few years do have billboards up they are saying have some
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:24.960]  storable food but I think that's just so when things collapse they can say oh see
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:29.840]  we warned you knowing most people really aren't getting prepared but I mean look
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.200]  at all the stuff that's happening everything we talked about years ago is
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:36.960]  coming true it's just this is real insurance you can't believe in paper
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.440]  insurance you can't believe in a paper dollar the way this world's going you've
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:45.960]  got to believe in friends and family your relationship with God and then
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:53.840]  physically food water firearms and property and look I've moved to the
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:59.880]  country I've got a well I'm putting in the solar I got a garden I mean I I know
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.920]  what's coming the second great depression and but then there's the issue my
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:08.080]  wife says well what do we do we're here in the country people know we've got food
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.000]  the government could come do something and I'm like listen they're criminals
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.560]  I'm not going to be in the worst position of having nothing and then well
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.760]  nobody'll want me because I have nothing I've got to be ready just because in
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:23.240]  the course the answer is then have some of it hidden offsite and don't put all
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:26.720]  your eggs in one basket that's what I've done I've got nice stuff spread out so
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:29.720]  much good luck and then well what are the government demands it these are
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.520]  criminals they can't take all our food they can't take all our guns some people
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.120]  say well I'm not going to buy a gun they might confiscate it because they might
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:41.920]  want to confiscate it is why you need it it shows how important a gun and food
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:47.040]  is when you go into a situation like this it'd be like well the government of
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:50.800]  this steamship is trying to confiscate anybody that has life rafts in their
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:54.760]  rooms and it's like well since you want it I'm not gonna hide my life raft you
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.960]  know that's that's in the closet that is it blown up so since you're asking for
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.560]  it here go ahead and have it it's your life raft it's not theirs and so you
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:08.000]  don't not have a life raft because the government might try to come take it do
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.840]  you see my point it's like people saying I don't want to have kids the world's
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:14.800]  just too bad well we wouldn't be here if our ancestors had that same attitude he
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:17.960]  went through a lot more than we're going through physically I will assure you
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.120]  you know it's like I don't want to have kids they could die in a car wreck I mean
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.160]  it's this total give-up on society attitude I know you've heard it before
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.720]  well I don't want storeable food because the government will find out if the
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.200]  government's that criminal you better well have some storeable food and you
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:38.440]  see my point Steve I know I'm ranting oh absolutely absolutely and you know what
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:42.880]  we try and do we know that a lot of people look at people like us folks like
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:46.440]  us and say boy they're half a bubble off with one or on the water or a brick
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:50.360]  shy of a load and taco short of a blue plate special because they're they're
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:56.560]  into this right-wing radical stuff this all that this this news article and
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:03.240]  these events in Tennessee are showing us is that we become more and more

[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:53.840]  Tennessee and then of course obviously being the biggest storeable foods and
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:58.320]  most reliable in the country eFoodsDirect.com the J. Michael Stevens
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:05.960]  group they got just massive phone calls about it and it's just just unbelievable
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.520]  to see how crazy things are getting but ladies and gentlemen if you don't have
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:14.920]  firearms and you don't know how to use them you're crazy and if you don't and
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:18.600]  if you don't get basic training for them and store them right you're crazy as
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.400]  well and I'm not trying to lecture you here but this is all common sense the
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:29.160]  system wants us domesticated and in every case from Stalin to Pol Pot right
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:32.480]  through they use food as a weapon Henry Kissinger said they'd use food as a
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:38.720]  weapon in State Department of Random 200 the UN said it at 96 at their World
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.920]  Food Conference that's why they're trying to shut down family farms and
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:46.560]  ranches but look America's fighting back here's the hill today I meant to get to
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:52.280]  this earlier with Steve farm dust bill approved in the house the legislation is
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:57.880]  needed HR 1633 because any dust including hay is considered a toxic waste
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:04.360]  $10,000 fines it passed 268 to 150 now that's the EPA shutting down most our
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:09.400]  power plants now that aren't general electric owned this is a military economic
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:13.080]  attack on us by the bankers they don't like the wealth of this country they
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:17.960]  want to consolidate it they want you under their control defeat them grow
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:22.840]  gardens so what if the cops come and say you can they have to inspect it in
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:27.440]  areas of Oklahoma and Michigan they're crazy authoritarian so they need to be

[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:26.200]  recommend you do because I know you've you've given advice for years on the
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:30.040]  food if things do break down it's not the government you're gonna have to worry
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:33.440]  about probably it's gonna be thieves looking for it what do you do with the
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:39.040]  food well very simply you should try and keep it in a secured area if you in
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.320]  terms of temperature and storage that type of thing keep your food is as
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:50.280]  comfortable as you are but be very careful treat it like it is your wealth
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:55.240]  it is your life so don't be talking about it a great deal encourage your
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:01.680]  friends and family to to store their own but the best attitude that I can I can
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:08.520]  give you is that food is your greatest dependency and the way that you maintain
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:14.960]  your freedom food is freedom right now so what you have to do is look at it from
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:20.320]  the standpoint if you don't want to take a totally negative attitude toward the
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.560]  government and the possible confiscation of things if you just want to be
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:29.640]  reasonable and say look it's my personal responsibility to care for those I love
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:36.040]  it's also as an American my patriotic responsibility to take care of my
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:41.040]  family so that they're at stay there stay there stay there and finish your

[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:31.320]  take them but we will next week absolutely jaren I know we've got a lot
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:36.560]  of big guests and now Ron pulses he's coming on Tuesday but we're gonna not
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:41.080]  get too many guests next week at least an hour or two a day because I want to
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:43.520]  hear from you all this is happening because I do hear from you in the
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.760]  comments the emails and everything else that's happening there is so much
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:52.840]  crazy news here that we're gonna get to it's all just off the charts that we're
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:58.520]  gonna be breaking down and we're gonna get Bob Chapman's take on it and you
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:02.360]  know what take some financial questions for Bob Chapman specific questions for
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:10.200]  Bob Chapman 800-259-9231 800-259-9331 but going back to Steve
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:13.520]  Shank and again I had the idea to get him on today because we were getting calls
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:17.400]  they were getting calls because the feds have gotten GPS everybody's doors
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:21.880]  they've got executive orders about food confiscation shut down of media in an
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:25.640]  emergency but now they're testing the takeover of the media for the first time
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:34.760]  ever last month what the 9th of November they are now manning the FEMA
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.560]  camps and we got the FEMA documents in cold Kellogg Brown and Root and they're
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:44.160]  now getting company set up to within 72 hours notice when they pull the trigger
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:49.320]  man camps all over the US for civil emergencies environmental whatever the
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.920]  Pentagon's hiring internment specialists they're training everybody for urban
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:58.400]  warfare and riot control look at what's happening in Europe and and people even
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:02.200]  as this is happening can't believe what's happening by admitting it's
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:07.280]  happening and saying it's wrong people will be aware of it and say no and know
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:11.800]  it's staged as the next phase happens look I went to urban warfare drills 13
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:15.600]  14 years ago I knew this was coming and I knew it'd take them a while this is a
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:19.760]  long-term strategic takeover the globalists have the country but they
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:23.640]  really want to transform it and when I witnessed military training to confiscate
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.000]  our guns roundup citizens search our houses and since then now it's admitted
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.360]  I told you nine years ago TSA would be on the highways I watched a TSA meeting
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:39.560]  on C-SPAN for two hours so I mean I know what they're gonna do because they've
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.200]  told us I knew they'd bankrupt Europe and announce a bank of the world then
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:47.240]  they'll bankrupt the US merges all in you'll pay three taxes at least directly
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:52.040]  to the criminals they now admit in Time Magazine Newsweek it is Bank of the
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:56.320]  World Goldman Sachs at the head of it taking over Europe getting rid of their
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:00.160]  sovereignty at some of the news the Prime Minister of England has vetoed it
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.720]  for the first time ever England has used its veto to not enter this because
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:08.760]  that would be the end of England sovereignty so wild stuff's gonna start
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.400]  happening reportedly they wouldn't even shake Cameron's hand there was a big
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.120]  argument or Sarkozy and Merkel like I had those articles like ten minutes ago
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.160]  all there they're here in my stack I'll get to them the news is coming in so
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:27.400]  fast I can't even I can't even deal with it right now finishing up with our food
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:31.600]  expert he's also our sponsor but I want to get him on just to break down what
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:37.320]  he's seeing I'm seeing total media saturation now which means obviously
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:41.480]  people are finally get taking action I know you've had to add more factories
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:45.840]  massively increase your year out buying a food for crops that aren't even planted
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:53.320]  yet to keep prices down at eFoodsDirect.com but Steve just briefly is
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:12:00.000]  this the greatest food buying you've ever seen oh it's absolutely absurd I
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.840]  have never and the thing is is that what we're doing as Americans is we're
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:10.080]  competing with other countries China and India the big population countries of
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:15.560]  the world are out there farming the planet and what folks don't realize is
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:22.800]  that that we literally are in a battle for our food and what has to happen is
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:28.760]  realize that events like in Tennessee are just an indicator of how important
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:32.920]  food is if it's drawing that kind of attention some of it negative in this
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:39.480]  case the fact is is that we as Americans you as a family have to look at the fact
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:44.120]  that you are competing for your food today the reason food prices are going
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:48.880]  up so much is these other countries are coming on and buying the raw materials
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:53.320]  that we're out there fighting to get so that we can process the food and get it
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.120]  to family so that they can put it into their storage and in fact a lot of those
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:00.160]  families are eating the food right now because the food costs in the grocery
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:07.080]  store are so high so this is right now you might say it's a war for freedom but
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:13.560]  we are in a worldwide food war right now so get yours is the only thing I can say
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:17.840]  and by the way you saw this you saw this Steve five years ago saying watch
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:21.720]  it's the commodities are gonna go up and now you watch any financial show they
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:26.000]  admit the elite are getting out of paper currencies and going into farmland and
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  food production and they're saying that's the next big bubble Alex Alex they
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:37.880]  are dumping their gold to go into food they're dumping gold now remember when
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:43.240]  we said that it was paper going to gold and then eventually the only currency on
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:48.560]  the planet would be food that's where we are people large investors are dumping
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:54.120]  gold to get into food they're buying the agriculture what we're doing and what
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:58.080]  what I've concentrated all my time on right now is buying raw materials out
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:01.360]  ahead of time so that these other countries don't buy them away from us so
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.320]  Americans can have food that's where we are and this Tennessee thing should only
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:10.480]  like the fuse that says this thing is in the process of exploding right now you
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.040]  are absolutely right you've been right the way you've been calling it for the
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:17.920]  last ten years Alex well I wish I wasn't right we're watching the new world

[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:56.440]  everybody what's happening out there okay so the rest of the hour Bob Chapman
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.560]  every Friday joins us always gracious to do that former military intelligence the
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.240]  largest private silver and gold broker for a very long time had the largest
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:09.200]  private newsletter put out the Gary Allen report for years helped publish
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:14.240]  Nundair call a conspiracy Gary Helen Sun now runs Politicub wow talk about the
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:20.680]  Sun being the room the dad but all of that is going on and look I've got
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:23.800]  insane news here in front of me but the five minutes we've got before we got a
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.840]  break it's quite frankly I'm looking for my Cameron articles where I've got a
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:31.400]  bunch of mainstream articles where they're saying Cameron says no to the
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:34.880]  new world order and stuff I'm gonna dig those out coming up to get Bob's take on
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:38.320]  it but Bob I know you I'm always there on top of it I haven't asked you if you
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:41.600]  saw it yet but it just came out two hours ago do you know about Cameron
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:46.440]  vetoing this super EU stripping all the countries of their sovereignty because
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:50.000]  they realize England would forfeit all its sovereignty to the euro and he's a
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.720]  globalist but and he said he was going to support it but what does this veto
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.680]  mean and then you've you wrote an article and others have written it
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.800]  mainstream articles admitting this is a total destruction of sovereignty how are
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:07.320]  things going in Europe where you live for many years and study things what's
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:13.360]  happening right now how big is this I think that England and the US for a
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:18.360]  long time have wanted to take the euro down as we all know England never
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:24.720]  belonged to the euro but they did and do belong to the European Union and it
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:32.440]  looks like they made the excuse look we want concessions and the cozy from
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:36.960]  France and Merkel from Germany said no we're not going to do that this is good
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:43.160]  I'm not joining your group you're not going to do that to my country and the
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:49.200]  group is what they want to do and and this will eventually affect England but
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:57.880]  not immediately because this ESM the European stabilization mechanism only
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:05.640]  would they apply to the 17 countries that are in the euros on the other 10 that
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:10.880]  don't use a euro they'd get it later and that includes England so English is
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:14.480]  saying look we're not going to do that we're not going to allow you to have a
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:21.960]  committee in Luxembourg and I'm going to allow you to have 17 or 27 secretaries
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:25.120]  of the treasuries is what they'll call them so you'll understand what they are
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:30.520]  finance ministers we're not going to give them immunity to do what they want to
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.600]  do to tell governments what they can spend and how they can spend it within
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:42.560]  their own confines of their own country and they want to control the budgetary
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:48.520]  and fiscal policies of each of the 17 countries originally and then later the
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:55.000]  other 10 and ostensibly you'd have a new world currency the euro which the
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.800]  other 10 wouldn't even be part of anyway so England's saying look we're not
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:03.860]  going to do that it's surprising but then again really is it you know they've
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:10.600]  been ambivalent about joining the euro for years they stayed out of it Denmark
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:16.240]  Sweden stayed out and they've come back for vote since and they've stayed out
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:22.240]  they voted to stay out and so what's going on here it's a power struggle and
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:28.080]  quite frankly I think it plays right into Germany's hands because 65% of
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:35.480]  Germans never wanted to be in the euro the same number if not 70% depending
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:41.240]  upon whether you count men or women women are higher they're 70% they did not
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:49.760]  want the European Union and Germany was forced into it they said look they being
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:54.960]  America and England and and France and particularly America and France if you
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:19:02.480]  want to reamalgamate Germany bring your country together then you gotta stand up
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:08.880]  and be in the euro and the European Union so helmet Cole gave in and that's
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:15.080]  what they did it cost the western Germans will call them give millions of
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:18.720]  trillions of dollars oh yeah for those that don't know Germany is still
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:22.560]  basically occupied but back when they you know started merging the two
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:26.800]  countries it was occupied you know from the east and from the west and Germany
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:30.520]  didn't even really have a say from my research I mean wasn't even helmet Cole
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:35.760]  still a quasi-puppet I mean I was only to go the French had to kick England in
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:39.240]  the US out remember what the goal did and he grabbed his own nukes back and
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:43.560]  all that that's right you remember all that was a big stand down right there
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:49.640]  but the goal was for France and that was the end of it he didn't care about any
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.840]  other all yeah he was ready to order the military to get to a fight all right
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:55.800]  because the bankers don't take your country over it's like oh well Hitler
[02:19:55.800 --> 02:19:59.120]  took over well we'll take it and then France had to say no get out of here

[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:29.560]  taking your calls 800-259-9231 your financial questions for him and I've I
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:33.400]  will at the next segment get into a ton of stuff and yes I'm wearing a top hat
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:39.160]  folks I was in a shop in Arkansas and they were selling hats and they had a
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:43.840]  top hat and I thought I would I thought I'd buy one because John Corzine is
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:47.400]  gonna be on the nightly news tonight it's not gonna really be John Corzine but
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:52.920]  I'm gonna do a little bit I occasionally do a little comedy bit and so look for
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:58.240]  that tonight 7 o'clock in fours nightly news all right going back to Bob
[02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:02.480]  Chapman finishing up with a euro I then want to get into the incredible MF
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:05.840]  global testimony where he just said I don't know where the money is gee I'm
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:10.240]  I'm really upset I don't know where it is I the money disappeared and then I
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:14.840]  resigned the next day and the head of the CFTC that worked for me for many
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.520]  years at Goldman Sachs he's invested he's disappeared and and the Congress is
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:23.680]  basically well that's all right the money's missing and first time in 150
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:31.000]  years at the Chicago Mercantile you know now the CME group that this has
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.160]  happened but we're just not gonna worry about it so a new precedent is set Bob
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:43.080]  Chapman please continue well the precedent is that in the Corzine affair
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:49.120]  we'll call it MF global they're in commodities commodities are different
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:54.080]  than the other two major markets which are bonds and shares in fact the bond
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:58.120]  markets a hundred times bigger than the share market and the commodity market
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:04.960]  makes up about 1% of everything so it's a very small market and I've always
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:08.880]  told people to stay away from it and the reason why is you got to be a pro to
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:13.840]  be in there and the agreement that you sign is a worth of paper it's written
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:18.880]  on they can hypothesize what's in your account and they will rehypothecate
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:22.120]  from on I understand for those of you don't know
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.680]  hypothecation is lending so if you have an account with some margin account
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:31.800]  which you have to have then they can take the things that which are in your
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:37.600]  account and use them and sometimes lend things that are in there money whatever
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:43.400]  and they were not only doing that they were re lending it again which in the
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:49.880]  United States is illegal in Europe it is legal and they use that loophole but
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:57.320]  the bottom line here on the sub bains oxley is that mr. Corzine is the CEO
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:06.320]  of the country company had to sign off on the contents of the audit and he had
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:11.920]  to know that there was money that was being misappropriated and this didn't
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:18.120]  happen a month ago when we saw it and it was happening six seven eight months
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:24.040]  before and that means the CFTC had to have known about it all they're saying
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:29.560]  they didn't well of course they did and of course being Corzine's friend the man
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:36.720]  that runs the CFTC I think he probably looked the other way like they and the
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:42.600]  FCC have for so many many years with politically connected or financially
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:50.880]  connected people and I think he is as guilty as can be I think his testimony
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:28:00.320]  touched upon subjects where it wouldn't subject him to prosecution if they're
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:04.440]  gonna find a way to prosecute him criminally they're gonna have to do their
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:11.120]  own digging and that avoidance is what that appearance was all about and
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:15.160]  there'll be more appearances and he'll do the same thing what they're all
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:22.320]  looking for and it was more than him involved is fines and if I was running
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:26.720]  the CFTC I'd say well that's simple you 15 guys over there you did all this
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:32.680]  stuff and women's to 1.2 billion dollars so come up with the money and pay the
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:36.760]  people back and then we'll kick you out of the business so you can't do this
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:40.960]  again but they won't even do that it's like the big banks caught laundering
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:45.880]  376 billion in two years they paid a hundred and ten million dollar fine on
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:53.760]  it we did the math on that it's like what point zero three jump change we saw
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:58.800]  that when Michael Milken as well he stole three billion gave the government a
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.000]  billion and lived happily ever after yeah but that was that was the one-third it's
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.880]  like I rob a bank and I've got five million dollars and I give them a hundred
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:10.040]  dollars so the cops pull up and they go mr. Jones we need the hundred dollars
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:13.880]  oh there you go there's a hundred other of the giant bags of cash I'm stealing I
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:21.320]  mean it's just it's just lunacy well it shows you how a systemically corrupt our
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:27.640]  system is and it is really a criminal syndicate and it's getting worse
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:31.920]  undoubtedly all right I want to come back cover news headlines and get your
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:37.480]  quick take on it in a news blitz Bob and then I want to get to some phone

[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.640]  earlier but I didn't have it in my hand daily mail we're on the we're on our own
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:02.740]  now Cameron uses the veto for first time to opt out of new treaty to save the
[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:06.800]  euro and give more power to Brussels doesn't save the euro they always
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:10.680]  designed it to implode they admit that to give them unlimited power just
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:14.680]  incredible power grab happening economic domination and they scapegoat
[02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:19.160]  Germany like it's running at all the bureaucrats the globalists it's the
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:23.880]  banks Germany's fitting the bill again they always spin it off into some
[02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:28.200]  scapegoat the Germans never could had a vote to enter this the Germans don't want
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:32.680]  to bail out they want out of the euro they don't want to give people money
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:38.440]  continuing the snub moment Sarkozy dodges Cameron's handshake where they
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:46.960]  swift body swerve after Prime Minister says no to treaty changes so here's
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:53.040]  another one a Mercosie that's Merkel and Sarkozy combined letter to EU now is the
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:57.880]  time to strip countries of sovereignty I mean they admit they want to be
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:03.600]  countries anymore unbelievable here's another one you in calls for eco
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:10.680]  fascist world government at Durbin summit and we are going to have Lord
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:16.400]  Christopher Moncton on tonight from South Africa bureaucrats in the UN
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:20.080]  climate summit in Durbin have outlined plans for the most draconian
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:26.520]  harebrained and madcap climate change treaty ever produced and each country
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:29.880]  and each individual will have their climate debt of course paid to the
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:37.200]  bankers you can't make this up and that dovetails with dust from hay $10,000
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:43.720]  fine calling killing the soil a crime against earth here in America of course
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:46.320]  not on other countries it's it's the globalists have invested in other
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:52.920]  countries they want to shut us down oh my gosh continuing here we've got all of
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:56.160]  those reports by the way that's out of the Hill newspaper that's that's not me
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.120]  saying that you can't make this stuff up hey you can't have a garden in your
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:05.160]  yard hey you can't sell lemonade hey you can't have cell raw milk the awesome
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:08.400]  police chief didn't believe me when I said no they arrest people for selling
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:12.960]  raw milk now they have a year-long stings like come on Alex knock it off I
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:17.400]  mean I don't know how he could be charming and seem smart the awesome
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:24.160]  police chief and not know all this stuff's going on I mean who are these
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:29.560]  people in the system that are just so willfully ignorant of everything now he
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:32.680]  didn't try to weasel out of the whole thing with the fast and furious which
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:36.240]  is confirmed now to be totally staged in the government memos to be blamed on
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:40.800]  the second I want to get Bob's take on that and also speaking of that Eric
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:44.760]  Holder yesterday we play the clip in the first hour he says that that no one at
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.560]  the DOJ has ever lied and that even though they said that they weren't over
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:53.400]  it it was their intent yes they knowingly lied but they didn't intend to
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:37:01.400]  mislead Congress more lawyer games Bob Chapman what do you make of the fast
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:05.080]  and furious the latest information on that front and then what do you make of
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:10.320]  in Tennessee News 5 reports they are going door-to-door asking about firearms
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:15.480]  guns preparedness and and the articles like it's no big deal it's just
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:18.400]  innocuous doesn't mention that we've talked to the folks on the ground it
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:24.040]  says there's 22 questions but they don't Bob they don't ask you you know about
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:27.720]  things except your food and firearms and stuff but the article doesn't even tell
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:32.440]  people that Bob what's your take on just all this craziness well they're
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:37.640]  lining everybody up they'll test it there in Tennessee and the next thing you
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:42.120]  know it'll be all over the country and everybody will expect it and they'll
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:46.680]  come with their questions and do you answer their questions are just that
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:51.480]  you don't tell them you get food you don't tell them that you grow food in
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:57.040]  the backyard you don't tell them you got any guns if they ask you say no well
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:00.400]  you're not on the subpoena you don't have to tell them anything yeah I don't
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:04.440]  even answer the door and when the census person keeps banging out the door and I
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:08.320]  say look criminal I don't care that you're a monkey and got a tag they're
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:11.760]  saying you're some federal officer this illegal to come here and ask me all
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:15.760]  these questions you can ask me how many people live here now are you gonna leave
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:20.240]  them I tell you that or are you gonna sit there with your fake your fake 50
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.240]  question garbage and they say sir it is the law and I go they call the cops I
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:29.280]  slam the door on them I'm sorry Bob go ahead yeah but that's okay I mean that
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:35.600]  is what I'm saying don't tell them lie to them I mean that's all they do I mean
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:40.680]  let's play their game and so you don't tell them you've got anything and as we
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:45.960]  now know they're going to both food manufacturers and asking which we did a
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:52.200]  program on I guess yesterday who's buying all the food and that's why I told you
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:39:00.560]  know I still started telling people to buy food in 1965 now of course the two
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:05.200]  batches they bought in between they've eaten since but the food was always good
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:12.840]  and it's better today the way it's prepared but like Steve said it is the
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:17.640]  most important thing besides water I mean you've got to have those two things
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:23.120]  and you don't want all the government or anybody else know what you've got well
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:28.720]  I mean the fact that children yeah don't you tell anything to anybody about
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:35.440]  anything that you've got what do you think of holder just caught red-handed
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:40.440]  lying and saying well I didn't intend to mislead you you know in certified
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:43.880]  testimony he was running the whole operation it's all been confirmed and
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:47.440]  he's just there it says well I didn't mean to me misleading when I lied to you
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:52.880]  I mean what an incredible criminal well that's right and that's what this is
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.960]  evolved to there's always been lying you know go back to the third century
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:05.040]  before Christ you've got the same thing but it has been refined today into a
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:10.640]  very fine art and they'll do it as a criminal syndicate and you can expect
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:17.360]  them from them you you can't expect a level playing field or a fair a fair
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:23.800]  legal field for you to operate in you can't count on the courts and the law
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:30.040]  to defend you you've got to do it you have to do to survive and yeah some
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:34.400]  people say why should I have gold or silver or firearms they might take it
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:37.480]  well why should then just why not go jump off a cliff now because somebody
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:41.680]  might kill you the world's always tried to take what you've got that's why we've
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:45.240]  had checks and balances to try to protect ourselves now they're going out the
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:51.080]  window we're all in danger what do you make of the NDA a passing and the in
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:55.120]  in the indefinite attention of citizens military on the street them and doing
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:59.760]  that now and the FEMA documents we got where they've got Kellogg Brown and
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:03.840]  Root who built the camps that's Wall Street Journal six years ago now
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:08.160]  actually preparing to man them does that not show us that they're really
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:14.840]  concerned about collapse yeah and the the outcome of collapse which is chaos
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:20.280]  and you know they'll put people in these camps to save them from all the chaos
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:25.200]  when in fact it's a pressure suppression technique but it was to be
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:33.560]  expected because America didn't do what a code had done during the 70s and 80s
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:38.880]  and 90s to stop these people nobody wanted to pay attention and is still in
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:44.960]  denial and they're getting information now from yourself and others all over
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:49.360]  the world and there's no excuse for them to be in the position that they're in
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:55.840]  today and yeah but I've been doing but I mean I've been to a picnic a rodeo in a
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:01.360]  world's fair and I've never seen Bob them actually prepared to activate the
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:06.680]  camps and to fully staff them I'm sorry go ahead no that's true and now they have
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:10.720]  the reason to do it through this legislation and of course throwing these
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.560]  senators out of office and the congressman at the house that's going to
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:25.440]  help but it's a little bit late isn't it I mean this shows you the dynamics the
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:34.000]  the the absolute positive reason to have Ron Paul is our next president and
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:40.360]  people like him in Congress if we can accomplish that we can beat these people
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:44.840]  we could turn all this stuff around by the way there's hit pieces out today by
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:49.560]  the dozen saying Ron Paul okay he's probably going to win Iowa but it's
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:53.440]  just a fluke ignoring he's been in second or third place for the last six
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:57.560]  months everybody else falls by the wayside there are so many skeletons in
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:03.240]  Gennrich's closet that he'll never be president he's a ringer I mean and they
[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:07.560]  keep trying to mantra Ron Paul can't win Ron Paul can't win God literally always
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:12.240]  works this way here is a great part of the solution a sign that America wants
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:17.400]  to go back to the Constitution here he is on a silver platter but you notice
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:22.320]  he's not you know a kindle liar you know with a cutesy suit and everything
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:27.000]  he's an old man but he's a statesman and a scholar here is our chance and if
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.640]  America lets these criminals keep us from electing Ron Paul but see here's the
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:35.160]  thing they know Iowa is a caucus state where it's old-fashioned hands that's
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:38.240]  why they know he's going to win they plan on cheating in the other areas of the
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:42.680]  with the machines but again they're so scared Bob because if he wins in Iowa
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:46.880]  and starts winning in landslides then their machines it's been proven get
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:51.920]  caught if they they can only cheat in five to ten point increments they can't
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:55.960]  get too big a cheat from the experts I agree with Bev Harris and others too big
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:02.960]  a cheat they can't do it well let's put them there it means the existence of
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:09.920]  every one of you children grandchildren all your progeny for centuries to come
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:15.240]  will even live in bondage if you don't elect that man I can't tell you
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:21.320]  strongly enough I've been in this for 53 years and his life is run parallel to
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:27.000]  mine only he was a doctor and I was a stockbroker but we're only two months
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:31.720]  apart and that's nothing to do with anything but anyway no it does it I
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:34.800]  mean people you're born you know people you're born at the same time you're from
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:39.480]  the same same culture some everything it's it's same experiences to I mean
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:45.520]  it's like brood mates or something now I want to go to Tim Nancy John Kevin and
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:48.280]  Phil and we'll do a little bit overdrive we'll finish that with Bob Chapman but I

[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:09.960]  Bob yes I was curious to find out if you guys have a ratio in your head do
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:13.800]  that's gonna trigger a banker collapse or a bank run in America well there's
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:16.880]  already bank runs all over Europe centering around Greece because the
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:20.340]  government's just taking it out through wire transfers paying it directly to the
[02:47:20.340 --> 02:47:26.320]  bankers Bob Chapman a metric or numbers to look for our signs of an impending
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:33.280]  bank run or holiday well I think the best thing to do in the country that
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:38.320]  you're in is talk to people who work in banks and say you know do you have a lot
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:44.120]  of people taking money out in the teller if you may says do we I don't know how
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:49.800]  much it is but it's a lot and and that's the way you find out I had like well we
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:54.880]  were on a lot you and I in Greece over the last couple of years I've been
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:59.080]  telling everybody get you euros out of the bank and they're doing it what are
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:03.640]  they withdrawn probably one third to forty percent of the money and in each
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:08.400]  country it's going to continue wasn't two weeks ago I told people to get your
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:13.280]  euros out of the bank in Germany and France and all these other places take
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:18.480]  the money and buy gold and silver whatever way you can the best deals you
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:23.040]  can make for yourself and by the way MF global MF global is causing people to
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:30.560]  get their money out of the bank as well sorry go ahead Bob and if you have gold
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:34.840]  coins you can get out of harm's way I mean what do you think for centuries the
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:42.240]  British and in other armed forces have sewn in British sovereigns into the
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:48.000]  clothing of airmen and others as well and they still do it I don't know what
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.600]  coins are using right now but they are sovereigns they use people right to me
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:56.240]  and tell me these quarter ounce British sovereigns even their soldiers in the
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:00.520]  field are issued them let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio you're on the
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:05.360]  air with Bob Chapman go ahead John a hugely important article by the former
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:10.720]  Pakistan chief of the Pakistan military that completely blows away this phony
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:16.240]  war on terror and if you can get it Alex it's called ISAF aggression against
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:22.080]  Pakistan the ISAF standing for the NATO and he says those 28 Pakistani
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:26.440]  soldiers who were killed by the drone a couple weeks ago were not only
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:31.920]  deliberately murdered but they were killed because they were attacking LCI
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:39.480]  al Qaeda forces there and these al Qaeda forces sent an SOS to NATO and
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:43.600]  American aircraft and gunships who rushed to the rescue of these trapped
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:48.160]  militants and he says the two Pakistani post came under intense fire from NATO
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:52.600]  the Pakistani officer commanding the post immediately contacted NATO and warned
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:56.800]  them that they were being attacked and now I've seen that in other reports no
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:00.720]  al Qaeda works for the globalist that's that's on record but what was the
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:05.320]  headline on the article you're talking about John ISAF aggression against
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:08.560]  Pakistan it was an information clearinghouse I think this this shows
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:13.560]  that ISAF aggression against Pakistan we'll look it up briefly going to
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:20.000]  break but thank you John Bob what's your take on Pakistan oh you know they've
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:28.280]  had American troops airborne special forces guarding that facility for the
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:33.320]  last three or four years that I know of and you know one of our subscribers is
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:39.840]  in that group and so we know what's going on there and so I think what they
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:45.680]  want to do is neutralize Pakistan's nuclear ability by taking it over and
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:49.920]  I just don't know how they're gonna go about they're gonna use civil war be
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:54.640]  civil war is the pretext to physically invade but you think Afghanistan's bad

[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:19.080]  air hi Alex and Bob and I just want to thank you for your most excellent work
[02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:26.120]  thank you and I I have a question about mortgages and I'm wondering what will the
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:33.840]  banks do with mortgages if and when the dollar is further devalued or crashes can
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:37.920]  the mortgages be paid off with devalued dollars or will the mortgage balances be
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:43.840]  revalued and I'm wondering I have some cash should I pay off my home now and or
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:48.040]  and leave me with very little cash or I'm just confused well it's always hard to
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:51.520]  give individual advice because we don't know all the factors but personally Bob
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:57.040]  what would you do off of her question well first of all I take the cash and I
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:01.960]  buy a golden server second of all I wouldn't worry about paying off anything
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:07.760]  third of all nobody knows what they're gonna do until we get there what is get
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:14.880]  there when the dollar becomes devalued and you have less purchasing power than
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:20.440]  you had before and still the outstanding bill is higher what about that what
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:23.960]  about the question about it because I'm always wondering now they've done
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:29.720]  different things what about this he got a $300,000 mortgage you owe $200,000 on
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:34.120]  it and they they devalue the currency so it's easy to pay off but a lot of times
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:39.200]  they just increase the mortgage and have some national mortgage holiday how do
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:47.360]  you see that happening Bob well as I was saying the people the bankers the
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:53.320]  government in all likelihood would say you have to pay off the original amount
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:58.960]  and we have to do that you would lose house and the reason they would they
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:03.720]  would do that is that they could nationalize housing that way yeah I
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:09.320]  understand some people can't pay it I'm saying if the dollars devalued will they
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:14.920]  increase the note of the house no it'll stay at the same level but the dollar
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:20.760]  will have far less purchasing power so they'll keep the mortgages in your
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:25.400]  research at the same amount they are now that's right and that way you'll lose
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:33.520]  your home they got 6.8 million right now in foreclosure default and over the next
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:39.400]  three years they'll have about 11 million and let's say three years from now
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:45.520]  hypothetically the dollar dropped two-thirds in value well they'd end up
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:49.920]  maybe with another level of a million homes and and the ones that they didn't
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:55.320]  have they'd make offer for own them all and then they tell everybody in the
[02:57:55.320 --> 02:58:00.240]  country that we own them all and if you want to live in them you pay us rent but
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:06.200]  with that comes instructions as to where you're gonna live and so on and so
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:09.440]  by the way the feds are already doing that they're already saying they may
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:13.640]  nationalize a bunch of houses and do that and then under federal rulings they
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:17.120]  say you don't have rights they can come in and inspect what you're doing because
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:22.000]  you live in a government house that's right and I'm sorry to interrupt you but
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:26.640]  I wrote about this eight years ago when I predicted the fall of Franny and Fanny
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:31.400]  and Freddie and they would the nationalization thereof that's what's
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:36.240]  happened now the next step is total nationalization of homes God stay there

[03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:52.640]  quick Alex you've had a number of information pieces on county sheriffs I
[03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:58.040]  have a question I guess in the Constitution it says that sheriff is a
[03:00:58.040 --> 03:01:05.640]  principal authority for those that are in the know and informed and all that they
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:14.680]  need to get together and work together at Tampa County Sheriff form organized
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:23.040]  direct and probably most important arm a Malaysia no that's right and that's
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:26.360]  right then the feds will have trouble demonizing it and making it look bad
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:29.800]  you know the way the open carry folks have done things is the right way to
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:33.880]  flaunt our rights so that people learn their ours we're gonna exercise them
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:38.040]  back off and stop acting like they're bad the second amendment is not put in a
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:42.720]  black bag like it's a porno magazine and and you're absolutely right the feds
[03:01:42.720 --> 03:01:45.760]  are trying to get rid of sheriffs all over the country they've got the cities
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:50.000]  trying to take those over or the states abolish them and it's just like taking
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.600]  the senators away from the states and making them generally elected not not
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:58.080]  appointed by the legislature it's all about getting rid of the states and
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:04.080]  sheriffs are a key in the fight Bob Chapman I agree completely and it's always
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:08.520]  been that way and the gentleman's correct and we've got to get these sheriffs
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:13.160]  to work together and they are they have any meetings and they know what these
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:17.760]  meetings discussed that what does the federal government want us to do well
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:22.400]  they wanted to do you you to do all their dirty work so they don't have to do it
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:27.880]  well said Phil thank you I'm going quick here Michael in Canada you're on the
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:34.040]  air with Bob Chapman go ahead question for you Alex yeah what's your opinion on
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:37.600]  this whole Occupy Wall Street movement that's happening like across like US
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:42.560]  right now well it's an incredibly complex issue George Soros controlled
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:47.320]  grip since in the news today put the call out six months ago that in October if
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:50.720]  you didn't like the corruption of Wall Street show up in protest they left it
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:55.000]  nebulous to get everybody out there then they had the media put attention on it
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:59.200]  and say we love Obama give us communism which didn't really speak for Occupy
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:03.920]  Wall Street now it has come out that from the beginning George Soros and
[03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:08.040]  others have been trying to steer it but because they failed to steer it they
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:12.160]  have a pincer attack of shutting it down while still controlling the elements
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:16.280]  of it here's world that daily today occupies nerve center staffed by Soros
[03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:21.800]  activists professional radicals caught red-handed running so-called leaderless
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:28.520]  movement so that's an article right there Bob Chapman a final word on that
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:32.160]  exactly the way you depict it I think the only good thing that's come out of
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:38.040]  it is a lot of people attended these different meetings and gave their two
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:42.920]  cents worth about the middle of the road or slightly to the right version of what
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:46.880]  they were doing and how they were wrong and I think they had quite an impact and
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:52.880]  so I think that was positive although we can't control what's positive people went
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:57.280]  out and did it and I think that's wonderful yeah and so Obama and Soros
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:00.800]  are trying to flush their creation down the toilet and again folks beat and I
[03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:06.720]  appreciate your call caller from from Canada you know my point is is that
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:11.400]  people everything is it was simple like is it good or is it bad like is the US
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:15.520]  military good or is it bad no military is good at the tops run by evil people
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:19.960]  yeah I mean again this is a little more sophisticated and so if there's no doubt
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:23.720]  I get criticized for even saying it's got Democratic operatives in it which it
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:28.240]  does let's just be honest about it they know revolution's coming they want to
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:34.560]  try to steer it Bob that's correct that's absolutely correct and I'm glad
[03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:42.360]  they're flushing it gives the people who want to demonstrate on their own the
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:46.920]  opportunity to do so exactly again you don't need to go out because the ad
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:50.160]  busters and told you to and then we're gonna call to get rid of the middle
[03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:54.720]  class and just Wall Street's bad period no the mega banks are bad they're the
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:58.800]  monopoly is going after a real free market all right Bob great job great to
[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:13.920]  have you with us Lord well we'll see you back live next Friday
