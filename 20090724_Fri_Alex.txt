[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:34.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.320 --> 00:44.080]  well the Associated Press is reporting 197 million plus dosages of the
[00:44.080 --> 00:52.680]  experimental swine flu vaccine are ready for the American people and the
[00:52.680 --> 00:57.840]  Daily Oklahoma is reporting 12,000 US children to be swine flu vaccine
[00:57.840 --> 01:04.920]  guinea pigs of course back in 1976 it broke out of the US military base killed
[01:04.920 --> 01:09.600]  one person so they inoculated millions of Americans thousands and thousands and
[01:09.600 --> 01:13.360]  thousands of deaths resulted but I was thinking maybe later in the show today I
[01:13.360 --> 01:19.280]  could play part of that 60 minutes from the 1970s going over all the deaths and
[01:19.280 --> 01:29.060]  the people that were paralyzed because after all that was 30 plus years ago what
[01:29.060 --> 01:35.780]  33 years ago maybe people have forgotten and to if you just step back from this
[01:35.780 --> 01:43.920]  and go a couple hundred deaths worldwide from this supposed flu 37,000 on
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.360]  average die a year in the United States alone half a million people die
[01:48.360 --> 01:52.800]  worldwide every year it's estimated by the World Health Organization die of the
[01:52.800 --> 01:59.200]  common flu different varieties of it right at half a million every year it's
[01:59.200 --> 02:02.560]  four hundred something thou you can pull up the average if you want the point is
[02:02.560 --> 02:10.640]  they say 37,000 in the US right at half a million worldwide can you imagine what's
[02:10.640 --> 02:14.760]  going to happen in the fall and winter when the regular flu hits and tens of
[02:14.760 --> 02:19.400]  thousands die and they've already run the headlines that hundreds of thousands
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.000]  of Americans affect the headlines over a million Americans infected with the
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.480]  virus well yeah we're all infected every year with hundreds of different flu
[02:27.480 --> 02:35.120]  and cold bugs that don't do anything to us I mean this is a week week week week
[02:35.120 --> 02:48.480]  week week flu but the establishment doesn't care they are hyping it up like
[02:48.480 --> 02:57.680]  it is the end of the world and hyping up in France and in England and in the
[02:57.680 --> 03:03.280]  Netherlands and all China and the United States and India and Africa and all
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.920]  these UN organizations and we've got to vaccinate the poor and we've got to
[03:06.920 --> 03:12.280]  vaccinate girls especially and we've got a when you win this crew of eugenicists
[03:12.280 --> 03:18.760]  that run the World Health Organization have been caught over and over again
[03:18.760 --> 03:26.200]  adding different chemicals and hormones to vaccines to sterilize men and women
[03:26.200 --> 03:31.160]  alike they've been caught on record and the official United Nations biological
[03:31.160 --> 03:40.040]  diversity assessment UN law policy 1992 1996 their agenda 21 all of its states
[03:40.040 --> 03:43.720]  the goal of world government is population reduction and then you have
[03:43.720 --> 03:50.720]  Dr. Peter Singer and Dr. Eric Pionka and Dr. Holdren and Dr. Ehrlich on and on
[03:50.720 --> 03:55.960]  every major White House or congressional advisor in every case

[04:11.520 --> 04:15.920]  want a world government so they can carry it out that's what in game my film
[04:15.920 --> 04:20.560]  states two years ago that's what mainstream news reports today it is an
[04:20.560 --> 04:26.200]  incontrovertible fact and so we have these eugenicists that are constantly
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.560]  killing foster children and black people and military veterans and troops and
[04:31.560 --> 04:36.520]  anybody they can get their hands on homeless in chemical biological and
[04:36.520 --> 04:42.120]  radiological tests and now they want to force us to take something coming up in

[11:15.840 --> 11:19.200]  now I'm actually more and more in those moods where I want to go absolutely
[11:19.200 --> 11:25.080]  eight and that's probably because I'm working out again that's probably what
[11:25.080 --> 11:29.600]  it is and I'm now remembering why I would sedate myself with large steaming
[11:29.600 --> 11:33.600]  plates of food because you eat all big old plate of food maybe drink a few
[11:33.600 --> 11:39.320]  those seckeys and you don't feel like tearing people's heads off but
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.640]  nevertheless nevertheless ladies and gentlemen we have an important radio show
[11:44.640 --> 11:52.360]  lined up for you today we have Luke Radowski and Stuart hell from we are
[11:52.360 --> 11:58.920]  change joining us first today before the congressman and Bob Chapman and our
[11:58.920 --> 12:05.160]  Jamal pop in and you talk about leadership you talk about taking action
[12:05.160 --> 12:11.040]  you talk about getting involved you talk about being on the front line not
[12:11.040 --> 12:14.560]  that any of the attacks on these guys are effective but it is that they're
[12:14.560 --> 12:20.160]  being attacked by the mainstream media alternative media co-intel pro shows you
[12:20.160 --> 12:28.320]  that they're doing the right thing member last year German talus the New
[12:28.320 --> 12:33.200]  York post associated press and others reported supposedly out of the nowhere
[12:33.200 --> 12:39.200]  out of a dark alleyway ran out like some type of 28 days later ghoul zombie and
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.560]  attacked a poor girl in a wheelchair savagely now we had all the witnesses
[12:44.560 --> 12:49.600]  the police would worked hard to not let the surveillance camera stuff be released
[12:49.600 --> 12:56.480]  it was a bush event allora bush event turned out the guy who attacked him
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.360]  with his daughter in the wheelchair was a bush operative so I told mr. talus
[13:01.360 --> 13:06.000]  who was facing all these years in prison do not plea bargain go to the mat fight
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.560]  as hard as you can listeners raised if five or six thousand dollars to help him
[13:10.560 --> 13:13.600]  that got him a decent lawyer they threatened him tried to get him to
[13:13.600 --> 13:17.440]  plea bargain it went to jury and he was found not guilty in the New York post
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.560]  had to retract it Luke has been set up and arrested where security guards walk
[13:22.560 --> 13:27.920]  up and public events and tell him leave they then with police hold him by the
[13:27.920 --> 13:33.600]  arms and say you will not leave you're now charged with trespassing so Luke is
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.360]  finding that and we've seen national media attacking him and others and we've
[13:39.360 --> 13:43.200]  also seen operatives now attacking saying how dare listeners of my show you're
[13:43.200 --> 13:46.080]  the main ones give him four and a half thousand dollars to try to get a lawyer
[13:46.080 --> 13:53.040]  to defeat that now you notice who they're going after it's wherever Luke is
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.960]  they're going after because they see him as the leader of course the big secret
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.720]  to all this we're going to look and stir it in a moment the big secret to all of
[14:00.720 --> 14:06.160]  this is that
[14:06.160 --> 14:09.920]  Luke is not the leader except in spirit just like I'm not a leader except in
[14:09.920 --> 14:14.640]  spirit except in symbol and emblem it's emblematic
[14:14.640 --> 14:22.240]  it's a totem a logo a symbol a sign of a standard
[14:22.240 --> 14:25.520]  and the symbol is courage having the police come up and say we're going to
[14:25.520 --> 14:29.360]  plant bombs on you on video so corrupt they say we're going to plant bombs on
[14:29.360 --> 14:32.240]  video we're going to put you in prison for terrorism even though you're not a
[14:32.240 --> 14:35.440]  terrorist stop having your first amendment stop protesting outside
[14:35.440 --> 14:40.080]  Silverstein's offices on a city sidewalk even with permits
[14:40.080 --> 14:44.000]  and they grab his camera and say this is a gun police in uniform said this is a
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.520]  gun we're going to show it's all in truth rising
[14:47.520 --> 14:50.880]  and the reason we are changing so successful is it's an idea there is no
[14:50.880 --> 14:54.480]  leadership constantly i'm at dinner with media and
[14:54.480 --> 14:57.200]  people and they say we know you really run we are
[14:57.200 --> 14:59.840]  changed we know you're directing all these young people
[14:59.840 --> 15:03.280]  well i want to tell the cia and everybody else
[15:03.280 --> 15:06.640]  and you should know this because you surveil us this is leaderless this is
[15:06.640 --> 15:09.680]  an idea and as they say in beef or vendetta paraphrasing
[15:09.680 --> 15:13.920]  other historical quotes this body this flesh and blood can die it can be
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.720]  defeated but ideas ideas are bulletproof and if you're
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.880]  willing to carry the ball for liberty and freedom and have the courage
[15:22.880 --> 15:30.160]  i love the texas rangers credo a man in the wrong can't stand up
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.280]  can't defeat a man in the right a man in the right who
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.000]  keeps on a coming and so
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.640]  that's why they've arrested members of we are change la for no reason on video
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.440]  for protesting peacefully and then they had to go to court and beat it
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.360]  but the good news is there's info wars groups there's liberty committee
[15:51.360 --> 15:55.360]  liberty groups there on paul
[15:55.360 --> 15:58.880]  there are we are change groups nine eleven truth groups and countless other
[15:58.880 --> 16:01.760]  groups forming they can't get us all it's like
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.440]  10 000 x wings going in against the death star instead of just 30
[16:07.440 --> 16:10.560]  so launch your x wing folks get up into the sky
[16:10.560 --> 16:16.880]  get out there on the raceway take action against the enemy
[16:16.880 --> 16:21.120]  and win the race folks get the green flag get the checkered flag
[16:21.120 --> 16:24.000]  because i'm trying to use a race car analogy because steward house done some
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.560]  race car driving and race car training steward house with la we are change
[16:28.560 --> 16:32.720]  look radowski founder of the new york we are change i saw him
[16:32.720 --> 16:35.680]  with new york we are changed i didn't want to bash at the time but
[16:35.680 --> 16:40.080]  they kind of had their un connections and things and uh he wanted to confront
[16:40.080 --> 16:43.200]  the cfr talk about the new world order make it more than just bush
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.680]  they kicked him out of the group and i said son
[16:47.680 --> 16:51.680]  because he was like 19 years old at the time i said you need to just go out
[16:51.680 --> 16:55.520]  and be a leader and start another group and he thought the great name we are
[16:55.520 --> 16:59.200]  changed before obama even did from a gondi quote
[16:59.200 --> 17:03.040]  and look at the success they've had and so yes they're going to be attacked by
[17:03.040 --> 17:05.840]  the national media they're going to have people come out of dark hallways
[17:05.840 --> 17:09.360]  with a girl on a wheelchair and ram them into them screaming don't attack her
[17:09.360 --> 17:13.120]  don't attack her but the truth came out in the end
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.600]  and this stuff is going to happen but we are changed i don't know according to
[17:17.600 --> 17:21.920]  rockefeller 35 of them swarmed the capital they gave out a whole bunch of
[17:21.920 --> 17:26.160]  members of congress dvds different films
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.320]  thermite reports peer reviewed journals explosives in the buildings
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.240]  they confronted j rockefeller really becoming the heir apparent to david
[17:36.240 --> 17:38.640]  right now one of the most powerful men in the world
[17:38.640 --> 17:47.920]  they did a stellar out-of-the-park job and all of us can emulate them
[17:47.920 --> 17:51.840]  i've even been sending emails saying oh the the j rockefeller thinks fake
[17:51.840 --> 17:55.280]  definitely coantel bro it's like i was sent some email of a guy saying
[17:55.280 --> 17:58.640]  when george bush had me arrested that was fake because the video camera zooms
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.080]  in on me uh yeah it's my video camera they then
[18:02.080 --> 18:04.960]  assault my cameraman we put that text on the screen
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.880]  this is the type of mental illness and coantel bro going on
[18:08.880 --> 18:12.800]  my only issue is you can go out and confront politicians for yourself

[18:16.640 --> 18:20.000]  are real heroes and that it's you looking in the mirror
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.600]  and that all of us can take action and go takeover city council meetings
[18:23.600 --> 18:27.360]  and senate meetings and house meetings and gubernatorial meetings
[18:27.360 --> 18:30.960]  and that we can take control of the media by going to the press conferences and

[24:27.840 --> 24:31.680]  confronting global leaders but we are changed worldwide is doing the same
[24:31.680 --> 24:35.120]  thing from japan to ireland from Canada to Mexico
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.280]  luke and steward i want to salute both of you
[24:39.280 --> 24:42.320]  alex is an honor to be on with you guys good work
[24:42.320 --> 24:46.240]  thank you so much man it's about the leaderless resistance
[24:46.240 --> 24:49.360]  well that's what makes it so powerful it is it's the idea and i didn't mean to
[24:49.360 --> 24:53.200]  make you sit on hold while i while i commended you guys but again
[24:53.200 --> 24:56.560]  the enemy is really trying to tear us down right now because they're afraid
[24:56.560 --> 25:01.680]  others will emulate and become active folks you can just ride us off and say
[25:01.680 --> 25:05.920]  we're the worst people since since blsbob but don't let that keep you from
[25:05.920 --> 25:09.600]  taking action against the new world order that's the last thing they want you
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.560]  to do is to believe the real people out there engaged in resistance there are
[25:14.560 --> 25:19.120]  look in the mirror luke tell us about uh the great victories and then i want to
[25:19.120 --> 25:22.000]  come back in the next segment get into confronting j rockefeller
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.720]  with you and steward but the big victories in a nutshell that you've been
[25:24.720 --> 25:27.360]  having and then steward out in la we are changed
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.240]  we've been confronting politicians left and right right now we're going through
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.120]  a couple you know cases i have my court case monday
[25:33.120 --> 25:36.560]  uh... with the whole mayor bloomberg arrest case we're doing big events for
[25:36.560 --> 25:40.160]  not eleven this year we're doing a lot of major things right now here in
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.200]  new york city we're trying to get everybody activated motivated
[25:43.200 --> 25:47.200]  and i rockefeller video shows you how much power we have as citizens
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.680]  with a camera to expose tyranny and make these powerful men
[25:51.680 --> 25:55.520]  run away like cowards they are and that's exactly what it's about
[25:55.520 --> 25:58.560]  motivating other people to take action and do what they want these people are
[25:58.560 --> 26:01.600]  not as powerful as they seem we are more powerful than they are
[26:01.600 --> 26:05.520]  and here is the key and i want to get your take on this and then stewards
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.640]  they want us focusing on barack obama they're already starting to tear him
[26:08.640 --> 26:11.760]  down show that he's a liar to further demoralize everybody
[26:11.760 --> 26:14.720]  so they can bring in the next right wing fake puppet instead of their new left
[26:14.720 --> 26:17.600]  wing puppet that they're currently using they don't
[26:17.600 --> 26:20.800]  like us going to the roth childs and rockefeller's houses
[26:20.800 --> 26:23.840]  they don't like you going to their senate office building and confronting them
[26:23.840 --> 26:27.920]  with with powerful info they don't like it that we're now
[26:27.920 --> 26:31.120]  shifting things off the diversion the projected
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.360]  movie screen the hologram that is the mainline puppets
[26:35.360 --> 26:40.320]  to the real power structure and now with ron paul and you guys everybody else
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.280]  we've made it about the private fellow reserve we've made it about the actual
[26:45.280 --> 26:48.960]  enemy that's conquered our country in 1913 steward
[26:48.960 --> 26:55.120]  this is incredible yeah yeah it's a wild ride Alex
[26:55.120 --> 26:58.320]  absolutely i mean what is it like to see this this type of effect happening and
[26:58.320 --> 27:00.960]  tell us real fast some of the victories you guys have been having in
[27:00.960 --> 27:05.680]  los angeles we are change oh man we're out there every chance we get uh you
[27:05.680 --> 27:10.560]  know whether it's a march and passing on information and freeway bantering
[27:10.560 --> 27:14.400]  katie and bruno and the rest of the crew jeremy are doing a great job working
[27:14.400 --> 27:17.680]  actually with law enforcement and oath keepers
[27:17.680 --> 27:21.680]  i mean we're trying to be active on every front we can because we're seeing a
[27:21.680 --> 27:24.480]  tipping point where the misdirection
[27:24.480 --> 27:28.080]  you know the hoax is breaking down and there's cracks in the walls and
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.240]  you know we're just stepping up as best as we can being flawed individuals
[27:32.240 --> 27:37.920]  to just have at it you know well you said at the tipping point i mean it's so
[27:37.920 --> 27:43.680]  asinine to have offshore banks who in who publicly created the banking crisis
[27:43.680 --> 27:48.000]  stealing 23.7 trill in nine and a half months
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.200]  i mean it's it's obvious it's obviously tyranny
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.520]  it's obviously tyranny when tsa is searching three-year-olds
[27:55.520 --> 27:58.960]  you know backpacks i mean it's baloney
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.040]  steward who are some of the folks go ahead yeah they're stepping out of the
[28:03.040 --> 28:06.320]  shadows and this is when they're most exposed you know the shadow government
[28:06.320 --> 28:09.360]  is there you know that the hubris is insane
[28:09.360 --> 28:13.840]  and you know they think they can just step out and show up in public and uh
[28:13.840 --> 28:18.080]  it's just not the case and i i hope that the way i was inspired by
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.320]  by luke and synthia mckinney and you and the other change chapters
[28:22.320 --> 28:26.800]  i'm hoping that'll grab on because uh we've got to expose these these tools
[28:26.800 --> 28:30.240]  you know the misdirection and and the hoax
[28:30.240 --> 28:33.760]  you know it's pretty plain to see once you break the mindset
[28:33.760 --> 28:38.000]  and somebody's willing to look at it well we also continue to beat them when
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.200]  they try to set us up which is a real blessing from god and a
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.160]  blessing with the supporters out there but i i want to come back and get into
[28:46.160 --> 28:50.560]  the operation you guys change groups all over the country real change not

[29:04.000 --> 29:07.840]  senators and i think the most interesting one was senator schumer of new
[29:07.840 --> 29:10.960]  york where mean steward got him two days in a row
[29:10.960 --> 29:15.680]  the second day he literally called the police from just for just asking him a
[29:15.680 --> 29:18.960]  question peacefully and the police detained us for one hour
[29:18.960 --> 29:22.160]  and schumer even came along when the police were detaining us pointing his
[29:22.160 --> 29:24.720]  fingers at us it was like yeah those are the people that
[29:24.720 --> 29:28.880]  uh you know kept asking me questions and whatever it was and they literally
[29:28.880 --> 29:32.080]  detained us for one hour means to work for peacefully
[29:32.080 --> 29:35.760]  giving evidence of explosives found at ground zero

[33:45.520 --> 33:49.360]  this is what the establishment's afraid of is the people actually going out

[33:53.200 --> 33:56.960]  government buildings going to their meet and greet public events

[34:01.520 --> 34:05.680]  month and do something like this go to a city council meeting go to

[34:09.760 --> 34:16.320]  we are already the majority we just have to show it and then the
[34:16.320 --> 34:19.440]  illusion will be shattered and everybody out there who feels like they're by
[34:19.440 --> 34:22.480]  themselves will now realize that we're the majority
[34:22.480 --> 34:25.920]  and the new world order will come crashing down in a big way
[34:25.920 --> 34:30.320]  okay uh lucrodowski going back to you tell folks what happened with j
[34:30.320 --> 34:33.840]  rockefeller and then i want to get stewart how's it take on this
[34:33.840 --> 34:38.000]  but let's start at the beginning in a nutshell
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.240]  this operation congress this this going there serving them putting them on
[34:42.240 --> 34:46.080]  notice with peer-reviewed journals both from europe and the u.s
[34:46.080 --> 34:49.200]  showing how the globalists blew up the towers
[34:49.200 --> 34:53.440]  they really did not like that at all and we put them on record they knew that
[34:53.440 --> 34:56.400]  that we had about eight video cameras there that everything would be
[34:56.400 --> 34:59.520]  videotaped everything would be on youtube and that them getting the
[34:59.520 --> 35:02.560]  evidence in their hands that's going to be on record and that they're going to
[35:02.560 --> 35:05.840]  have to do something about this j rockefeller stewart did an excellent
[35:05.840 --> 35:08.560]  job asking him a question during the press conference
[35:08.560 --> 35:11.440]  and then uh senator j rockefeller mentioned something
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.120]  about 30 people outside schumer's office that we didn't even know nothing
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.560]  about and he said he wouldn't answer the question and he ran away
[35:18.560 --> 35:22.000]  snickering and then katie said wait i don't know i want to know about the
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.040]  bill the berg group and he said well no
[35:25.040 --> 35:28.720]  different we can't talk about it right now and when katie asked when can we
[35:28.720 --> 35:32.400]  talk about it he just you know snap back saying no you can't
[35:32.400 --> 35:35.520]  and he ran away and then we ran he ran away i mean
[35:35.520 --> 35:38.960]  he just implicated himself and that's why we just filed him and asking more
[35:38.960 --> 35:42.640]  questions politely about his family starting the modern eugenics
[35:42.640 --> 35:45.680]  movement and that's when he said he has to walk faster
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.760]  and that that just shows you what kind of powers these men really are when you
[35:49.760 --> 35:53.360]  by the way if you go to encyclopedia britannica or by any
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.960]  mainstream best-selling history book on eugenics
[35:56.960 --> 36:04.160]  it says that in around 1900 uh john d the first literally funded worldwide
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.960]  eugenics and created the keiserville helm institute on eugenics the big one in
[36:08.960 --> 36:11.680]  england the big one in ireland the big one in berlin
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.120]  that he set up the cold springs harbour i mean they set up margaret sanger
[36:17.120 --> 36:21.440]  everything cancer viruses and vaccines they discovered that in the 20s
[36:21.440 --> 36:24.960]  set up the cancer hospitals and spread it in the vaccines i mean this is the
[36:24.960 --> 36:30.640]  most diabolical family if there's a first family of say satan i would
[36:30.640 --> 36:33.520]  have to say it's not even roth child though they fund a lot of this stuff
[36:33.520 --> 36:37.360]  it's gotta be rockefeller i know roth child's got more money
[36:37.360 --> 36:42.640]  but i mean rockefeller's every time you turn over a rock it's them go ahead
[36:42.640 --> 36:45.760]  i mean they have so much influence and that's why it's so important to go after
[36:45.760 --> 36:49.040]  the true source of power not the republicans not the democrats
[36:49.040 --> 36:52.480]  but the real powers behind the scenes and that's the rockefeller's the rock
[36:52.480 --> 36:54.720]  child's these huge banking families that have
[36:54.720 --> 36:59.120]  established modern eugenics and that hitler even adored them looked up to
[36:59.120 --> 37:03.040]  and when you know asking him follow you know i i didn't let up i politely asked
[37:03.040 --> 37:06.720]  him a question i was really nice to him but his attitude just shows how much he
[37:06.720 --> 37:11.040]  has to hide he ran away and he said that i should run for a congress because i
[37:11.040 --> 37:13.760]  have balls or whatever it was that's not even that important
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.680]  like his his testimony of him not even trying to answer the question looking
[37:17.680 --> 37:21.520]  guilty running away as fast as he could hobble on off
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.360]  shows you how much power we have as individuals to make these powerful
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.040]  people run away from us and look guilty just by asking them a simple
[37:29.040 --> 37:31.680]  question and that's why i encourage everybody to do
[37:31.680 --> 37:35.360]  in their local cities in their local towns go out there get active
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.960]  and ask these people real questions
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.600]  just in a nutshell lucrodowski founder of we are change worldwide
[37:43.600 --> 37:48.400]  uh how did this idea form to go deliver these to members of congress how many
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.360]  were you able to visit uh and um uh what was it like
[37:53.360 --> 37:56.880]  i mean that was a great idea by we are change la with stewart
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.800]  uh jeremy uh katie and bruno they thought up of this idea they printed out
[38:00.800 --> 38:04.320]  all these documents and we literally spent three four days going to
[38:04.320 --> 38:08.320]  offices and running into all these senators and congressmen on the floor
[38:08.320 --> 38:12.080]  over there and it was which other citizens could do i mean instead of just
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.840]  calling them or emailing them people need to make trips to these bastards
[38:15.840 --> 38:18.560]  before they totally shut the capital down and get them by the hand and say
[38:18.560 --> 38:22.480]  listen you little bastard we're not asking we're telling you stop
[38:22.480 --> 38:26.480]  destroying america i wish i lived in in dc because
[38:26.480 --> 38:30.640]  anybody could go on to uh you know the congressional offices the senate
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.080]  offices and just walk up and talk to these people with a camera it's legal
[38:34.080 --> 38:36.640]  anybody could do it i wish i lived down there because i would have been a
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.720]  friend of people every single day and that's what's so amazing and beautiful
[38:40.720 --> 38:45.360]  about what we can do as individual citizens speaking truth to power and
[38:45.360 --> 38:49.440]  exposing setting light on the real darkness in our government and all the
[38:49.440 --> 38:52.640]  corruption that's going on right now and that's why it's so critically important
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.760]  for people to stand up and be the change that they want to see in this world
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.560]  well look there's definitely no doubt that
[39:00.560 --> 39:03.680]  you and others with the spirit of liberty and just taking action
[39:03.680 --> 39:07.840]  now the globalists call it change agents because they send out their people in
[39:07.840 --> 39:10.960]  the community they're bought and paid for trying to manipulate things they
[39:10.960 --> 39:15.120]  know the powers of the grassroots we are the real change agents the organic
[39:15.120 --> 39:20.640]  change agents for liberty and freedom and uh there's no
[39:20.640 --> 39:23.840]  excuses even if folks can't go to dc your senators your house
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.520]  members they all dozens and dozens of times a
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.360]  year go to public events at grocery stores and libraries and old folks homes
[39:31.360 --> 39:37.440]  and public schools and colleges get up off your butts america
[39:37.440 --> 39:42.480]  get in there go ahead it's easy anybody could do this and even you know this
[39:42.480 --> 39:45.040]  year during our not 11 events we're going to be teaching we're going to have
[39:45.040 --> 39:48.320]  learning seminars on how to be an activist journalist how to be a real
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.560]  citizen how to be how to go out there and be effective in the political
[39:52.560 --> 39:56.800]  process by going out there asking real questions so
[39:56.800 --> 39:59.520]  we're going to be out there we're going to be doing huge events again this year
[39:59.520 --> 40:04.160]  in new york city on not 11 and we hope everybody could come out
[40:06.640 --> 40:10.480]  what else happened i mean any other tidbits we should be made aware of
[40:10.480 --> 40:13.920]  uh senator schumer called the cops on us we have a congresswoman that
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.680]  supported our new investigation that's on video that's on the videos that
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.120]  Bruno put out on weird change la we're out there i mean the videos of us
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.200]  confronting these politicians is amazing and you see the reaction of them
[40:25.200 --> 40:28.640]  being put on record serve documents that they could be held
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.320]  liable for if they don't do anything about and that's the real power it's not
[40:32.320 --> 40:35.520]  about calling or emailing them because they will ignore your calls and emails
[40:35.520 --> 40:38.000]  you have to go up in person face to face with them
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.880]  and talk to them one-on-one and make them understand that we're not going to
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.160]  back down and they're gonna well i agree with you but i mean i agree with you but
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.160]  it's more like when you call or email it's like a nat but when you go and get
[40:48.160 --> 40:50.720]  them by the hand and look them in the eyes and give them documents it's like
[40:50.720 --> 40:55.040]  an elephant gun in the info war let's go to stewart how one of the founders of
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.920]  la we are change stewart great to have you on with us in a nutshell what was it
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.960]  like to launch this event how many members of congress did you reach
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.360]  well over a dozen and i gotta say you know this couldn't have been done
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.200]  without the great work of these scientists who put together this very
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.440]  strong paper and miss mulloy who helped us to get there
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.120]  so we know we had we had a really strong package
[41:21.120 --> 41:24.960]  and uh... you know we we want about getting it into the hands of everybody we
[41:24.960 --> 41:25.840]  could and
[41:25.840 --> 41:29.920]  i've got to tell you uh... i hope the norman menetta segment gets in the third
[41:29.920 --> 41:32.080]  film the bruno's working on because
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.760]  this man was so thankful i mean the way he shook our hands and lit up
[41:37.760 --> 41:41.200]  you know when we thank him for a service in his testimony about changing the
[41:41.200 --> 41:43.200]  fact of stand-down orders
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.520]  uh... you know it it warmed the heart and the way she would actually respond to
[41:47.520 --> 41:49.680]  the maxine waters and
[41:49.680 --> 41:53.520]  uh... there is there is support i think there is no i would be happy to stick
[41:53.520 --> 41:56.880]  this in the new obama film but i've only got about two weeks
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.560]  for any final footage because i'm going to be done with it about the next month
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.960]  and a half or less so any footage you guys want i will make a section in
[42:04.960 --> 42:05.760]  there
[42:05.760 --> 42:08.480]  and the Rockefeller was perfect because i'm already doing a little eugenics
[42:08.480 --> 42:09.520]  section
[42:09.520 --> 42:12.880]  more than a little eugenics section but yes i would like to show
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.800]  put some nine eleven truth in this one and we didn't put as much of that in the
[42:16.800 --> 42:19.840]  in the first obama because that was about shattering the left right
[42:19.840 --> 42:23.520]  paradigm but yes this obama film is probably going to be the biggest film
[42:23.520 --> 42:24.720]  i've ever made so
[42:24.720 --> 42:28.080]  any we are changed as footage i can't guarantee i'll end up using it but just
[42:28.080 --> 42:30.720]  get it to me now stewart
[42:30.720 --> 42:33.520]  yeah you gotta get with bruno on that thanks alex
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.040]  yeah it was amazing back there it was amazing you know to have the team we
[42:37.040 --> 42:38.320]  had to have uh...
[42:38.320 --> 42:40.880]  how you came down for maryland change and
[42:40.880 --> 42:45.600]  uh... you know miss maloy jasper and sasha of course katie and bruno you know
[42:45.600 --> 42:48.640]  i gotta tell you these guys all just look like you know
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.680]  crooked old white guys in suits but uh... luke and uh... especially
[42:53.680 --> 42:56.320]  uh... you know bruno and
[42:56.320 --> 42:59.920]  jeremy knew who they were and we just had like every ten minutes out there's
[42:59.920 --> 43:03.040]  this guy there's that guy and let's be specific though
[43:03.040 --> 43:06.640]  because i mean i'm going from memory you guys delivered a whole bunch more
[43:06.640 --> 43:07.600]  packets
[43:07.600 --> 43:10.880]  to congressman's offices you just ran into
[43:10.880 --> 43:13.360]  a dozen or more and physically gave it to him or
[43:13.360 --> 43:16.480]  oh yeah yeah there's probably twenty or more and
[43:16.480 --> 43:19.200]  we do have a list we're working on the follow-up
[43:19.200 --> 43:22.720]  uh... you know and we're going to do everything we can with the list but we
[43:22.720 --> 43:26.400]  we were as effective as we could be over three or four days and how many packets
[43:26.400 --> 43:28.400]  did you hand out total
[43:28.400 --> 43:32.400]  uh... i'd say probably between twenty and twenty five
[43:32.400 --> 43:35.760]  okay and some of them were addressed to congressman senator some of them were
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.600]  addressed were to dear defender of the constitution you know what i got an idea
[43:39.600 --> 43:40.320]  stewart
[43:40.320 --> 43:44.080]  you guys could put that a copy of the report you sent up that we are change
[43:44.080 --> 43:46.080]  l.a. or we are change dot org
[43:46.080 --> 43:47.120]  and
[43:47.120 --> 43:51.040]  everybody could get it and mail it and send it registered to every member of
[43:51.040 --> 43:52.640]  congress in the senate
[43:52.640 --> 43:54.240]  yet till they're done
[43:54.240 --> 43:56.680]  until they're knee-deep also it is up
[43:56.680 --> 44:00.320]  it's up about bruno and uh... everybody jeremy kate did a great job all the
[44:00.320 --> 44:04.280]  documents are linked from the youtube page on the sidebar
[44:04.280 --> 44:08.480]  uh... maybe not from the rock a feller video but from uh... the dc event day
[44:08.480 --> 44:10.560]  one and two their length and it's
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.160]  you know it's ready to go all you got to do is uh... print them out and have at
[44:14.160 --> 44:16.640]  it at the one thing i would say alex is
[44:16.640 --> 44:17.440]  uh... you know
[44:17.440 --> 44:21.280]  for people to get out there but bring cameras bring a camera to film the
[44:21.280 --> 44:24.120]  camera person because what happened to talus
[44:24.120 --> 44:27.440]  uh... you know was avoidable if there would have been a few people filming
[44:27.440 --> 44:31.000]  the people doing the filming uh... i mean let's try to you know be smart and
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.040]  heads up that's right what we are or
[44:33.040 --> 44:36.960]  we are change l.a. has been charged and arrested before but it's been dropped
[44:36.960 --> 44:37.680]  correct
[44:37.680 --> 44:41.120]  because you guys did have video i mean it our weapon is video
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.920]  never working groups of smaller than three
[44:43.920 --> 44:46.720]  cameras are like two hundred bucks now for decent cameras
[44:46.720 --> 44:50.480]  everybody needs a video camera it's good to have a hidden pin camera like the
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.200]  digit net dot net folks have
[44:52.200 --> 44:53.440]  as a backup
[44:53.440 --> 44:57.840]  because you will catch the cops doing unbelievable really evil things
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.400]  once they grab your cameras you can have that hidden camera still rolling
[45:02.400 --> 45:05.920]  i gotta say that we have some support from up in the police there
[45:05.920 --> 45:09.120]  you know we were detained i guess because of pressure
[45:09.120 --> 45:13.160]  from uh... you know from schumer and and who else but we also felt that there
[45:13.160 --> 45:16.760]  was a good bit of support for us even though i want to be clear a lot of
[45:16.760 --> 45:21.400]  police are waking up they sent us a lot of documents but they're still bad ones
[45:21.400 --> 45:25.280]  like the ones that knew that uh... you know uh... german talus had been
[45:25.280 --> 45:26.880]  attacked and it was a set up
[45:26.880 --> 45:29.700]  now the secret service did testify it was a lie
[45:29.700 --> 45:33.360]  they wouldn't ruin you know ruin their career to lie for the n y p d
[45:33.360 --> 45:35.280]  but the n y p d did lie
[45:35.280 --> 45:39.520]  uh... in in that set up a very criminal group uh... on average so you can't
[45:39.520 --> 45:42.120]  deny that well listen luke and stewart how
[45:42.120 --> 45:45.680]  we're gonna have you both up in the next few weeks as we build towards a nine

[46:03.840 --> 46:04.720]  congress
[46:04.720 --> 46:06.640]  it was just incredible
[46:06.640 --> 46:10.000]  nature was not exactly what the country responded on and we have to do this
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.040]  even more
[46:11.040 --> 46:13.440]  you bet god bless you god bless you
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.320]  good to have both of you on whether sir they go ladies and gentlemen

[46:26.120 --> 46:28.480]  is another gas the congressman coming up
[46:28.480 --> 46:34.080]  is because they've got a new even better unit their base unit new and improved
[46:34.080 --> 46:36.240]  and a special discount for listeners today
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.480]  this is an atmospheric water generator i have one in my office
[46:39.480 --> 46:41.000]  one in my home
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.600]  i got one out there by the treadmill in the garage
[46:43.600 --> 46:46.840]  you have higher humidity in the garage it just fills up every day seven and a
[46:46.840 --> 46:48.040]  half gallons
[46:48.040 --> 46:50.480]  and uh... they have an even better deal
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.420]  out now this is the unit this is the system to get
[46:54.420 --> 47:00.400]  and uh... the website is a colo blue dot com e c o l o blue dot com
[47:00.400 --> 47:04.240]  and it is uh... just absolutely great to have tyler palmer on
[47:04.240 --> 47:07.000]  uh... the inventor and head of the company tyler good to have you on with
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.280]  us thank you alex thanks for having me on again it's great to be here and that
[47:11.280 --> 47:13.040]  they kick off our new uh...
[47:13.040 --> 47:15.280]  uh... echo blue twenty eight
[47:15.280 --> 47:19.440]  uh... with the twenty percent off discount for alex jones listening
[47:19.440 --> 47:22.240]  tell folks about the colo blue twenty eight
[47:22.240 --> 47:27.400]  well it's uh... the new version has a stainless steel uh... lowered tank
[47:27.400 --> 47:32.520]  uh... so what happens is if this machine takes the atmospheric
[47:32.520 --> 47:34.640]  the water that's in the atmosphere
[47:34.640 --> 47:37.120]  and condenses that humidity
[47:37.120 --> 47:41.960]  stores it in a lower uh... storage tank and then pumped it through a reverse
[47:41.960 --> 47:43.800]  osmosis system
[47:43.800 --> 47:45.960]  and three uh...
[47:45.960 --> 47:48.920]  uh... granular activated carbon filters
[47:48.920 --> 47:53.800]  in addition to having a uv light which we added into the lower storage tank now
[47:53.800 --> 47:57.200]  there are two uv lights up top in
[47:57.200 --> 48:02.360]  in the chilling tank to chill the water and have a hot water tank
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.640]  so it's sort of uh... state-of-the-art system
[48:05.640 --> 48:08.000]  uh... completely uh...
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.480]  doable off-grid and
[48:10.480 --> 48:11.800]  cutting your
[48:11.800 --> 48:13.320]  cutting your bills for
[48:13.320 --> 48:15.800]  municipal and bottled water
[48:15.800 --> 48:17.400]  uh...
[48:17.400 --> 48:22.080]  to very low level
[48:22.080 --> 48:25.560]  now explain to people that that that don't understand that
[48:25.560 --> 48:28.560]  in the first thirty thousand feet of the atmosphere there's over ten feet of
[48:28.560 --> 48:31.880]  water that's what shares shields us mainly from solar radiation
[48:31.880 --> 48:35.080]  that in the magnetic field of of the planet
[48:35.080 --> 48:38.040]  uh... of the medial states conspiracy theory we're not on the planet but there
[48:38.040 --> 48:41.040]  is a magnetic field there is an atmosphere there is water in the air
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.160]  explain to people how this grabs
[48:43.160 --> 48:45.440]  the water out of the air and then purifies it
[48:45.440 --> 48:47.760]  well uh... it has a uh...
[48:47.760 --> 48:51.480]  it i don't know if people have noticed uh... especially in the summer on a hot
[48:51.480 --> 48:52.880]  day you'll see
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.880]  uh... beads of water appearing on the outside of a cold drink
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.600]  uh... sometimes you'll need a coaster because it'll leave a ring on a wooden
[49:01.600 --> 49:02.800]  table
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.040]  and that's essentially what the machine is doing it has a cold
[49:08.040 --> 49:09.600]  and it
[49:09.600 --> 49:10.360]  uh...
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.280]  the atmospheric uh...
[49:12.280 --> 49:14.800]  air into the machine
[49:14.800 --> 49:15.560]  uh...
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.000]  the moisture in that air condenses onto that cold
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.480]  like morning do literally
[49:22.480 --> 49:24.120]  uh... as it
[49:24.120 --> 49:27.920]  it grows bigger and bigger that the uh... the droplets and then they
[49:27.920 --> 49:29.840]  eventually gravity
[49:29.840 --> 49:32.960]  uh... pulls them down to this lower tank
[49:32.960 --> 49:37.440]  once there's enough water in that lower tank it's been pumped through to
[49:37.440 --> 49:40.080]  the filtration system
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.760]  when it's done with the filtration system it's stored in
[49:43.760 --> 49:46.240]  a separate tank uh... which
[49:46.240 --> 49:48.200]  is about two and a half
[49:48.200 --> 49:51.320]  gallon tank uh...
[49:51.320 --> 49:52.800]  chill the water
[49:52.800 --> 49:56.520]  uh... from thirty nine degrees Fahrenheit to about fifty four degrees
[49:56.520 --> 49:59.800]  Fahrenheit you can set the range in there
[49:59.800 --> 50:03.160]  uh... and then there's an even smaller uh...
[50:03.160 --> 50:05.280]  hot water tank below that
[50:05.280 --> 50:08.120]  and that is about a half a gallon
[50:08.120 --> 50:12.680]  and you can dial in the uh... temperature from about a hundred and fifty seven
[50:12.680 --> 50:14.600]  degrees Fahrenheit
[50:14.600 --> 50:17.840]  a hundred and ninety nine degrees Fahrenheit
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.120]  and i want to get this special out before we break and come back for one more

[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.080]  i want to get into the whole flu fair mongering they're saying that
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:52.800]  uh they've bought close to 200 million doses
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:57.840]  of the flu shot to forcibly inject the american people now they said back in
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:02.400]  2002 they were going to make all first responders 14 million of them doctors
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:07.280]  nurses police firemen county city state workers federal
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:12.560]  workers take the smallpox shot and uh la times reported
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:16.720]  out of 14 million four thousand took it but a bunch of them died
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:20.640]  then the whole program fell apart when health and human services secretary
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:25.440]  tommy tomson refused to take it so just because they're saying they're
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:28.880]  going to make us take this in the fall doesn't mean it's going to happen
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:32.800]  but they do have a captive audience that's been trained
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:36.880]  to put up with all of this and go along with all of this and that is public
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:40.000]  school children and so there's a prisonplanet.com
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:45.520]  article paul watson wrote today that is uh reporting on a story
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:49.280]  out of the daily oklahoman 12 000 u.s children to be
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:55.040]  swine flu vaccine guinea pigs so we've had a few deaths in the u.s less than 200
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:03:00.720]  worldwide regular flu kills 37 000 according to the cdc every
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:05.760]  year in the u.s if the flu kills a couple hundred people
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:12.000]  uh coming up in the fall and winter my god if they almost shut america in the
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:16.080]  world down for less than 200 deaths and was it five or six in the u.s
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:19.920]  with people that were already on lung machines or already had h you know already
[1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:23.280]  had really bad immune systems
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:28.080]  and i misspoke earlier i had i said 197 million i don't know why that popped
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:34.480]  in my head msnbc reported us buys 195 million doses so
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:39.280]  195 million doses so i was two million wrong
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:43.440]  what does it matter 195 million of swine flu vaccine
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:49.440]  government hopes to speed development of fall vaccination program
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:52.320]  and they were saying a month into that thing breaking out that they already
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:55.280]  had a vaccine for it when it normally takes six months i mean this is a load
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:59.360]  of bull and then they admit it's already mutating constantly
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:05.840]  and changing and so how are they then going to have a vaccine
[1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:09.040]  forward if it's already changed and i saw a story in a london
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.720]  times two days ago with a top epidemiologist saying this is a total
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:16.160]  fraud it's profiteering at the bare minimum with a
[1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:20.720]  made-up vaccine for something that isn't even killing people
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:23.680]  why does the government want you to take this so bad
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:27.520]  why are they pushing this on society so
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:32.160]  hard is the big question so we'll talk about that
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:35.360]  and a lot more on the other side of this quick break

[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:34.880]  hate speech agenda restricting the first amendment

[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.840]  of corruption uh he was there fighting the banker takeover bill

[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.160]  history fan and he and he's a big supporter and fan of
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:11.200]  of my idol george washington that the media never really talk about or kind
[1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:13.760]  of puts on a pedestal because they don't want you knowing
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:16.800]  about george washington because he would then become an example
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:20.080]  for new george washington's to stand up to tyranny today

[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:31.360]  louis gohmert proudly represents the first district of texas
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:34.880]  which encompasses over 12 counties stretching for nearly 120 miles down
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:38.240]  the state's eastern border including where my family's from
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:41.920]  representative gohmert is developing innovative solutions to jumpstart our
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:44.480]  economy and offering practical alternatives for the government's
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:47.360]  bailout frenzy his federal income tax holiday
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:50.640]  and widespread national support from the grassroots level to national leaders
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:54.480]  allowing taxpayers to decide how best to spend their hard-earned money
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:58.480]  louis has repeatedly called for an end to socialization of our economy
[1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:01.280]  prior to being elected to serve in the congress louis was elected to three
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:03.920]  terms as district judge in smith county texas
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:07.280]  he has later appointed by texas governor rick perry to complete a term
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:11.920]  as chief justice of the 12th court of appeals and uh representative
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:15.280]  congressman louis gohmert sir great to have you here with us
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:18.720]  well great to be with you alex but that was such a great introduction i'm
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:23.440]  afraid to talk anymore and screw it up well you know i we watch c span every
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:27.280]  day and i have the guy selecting out clips of what
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:30.480]  you're doing as we try to sift through all these for the film
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:34.080]  and i tell you you are an attack dog for liberty and freedom
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:38.640]  if we had more people like you we wouldn't be turning into communist russia
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:42.240]  well it is heartbreaking what's going on around here and just
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:45.920]  you you see this stuff and you know how can you do this
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:51.040]  you this this has been done before you go back and read margantah the secretary
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:55.760]  of treasuries on private diary in 1940 where he says
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:00.720]  we've spent more money than ever in history and we're no better off we've
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:04.480]  still got the record on employment i mean all this stuff is not
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:07.520]  not new we're just trying to do the same things and
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:10.960]  expecting a different result but the bankers is
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:14.720]  as you have eloquently said they like it they're getting to direct the economy
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:18.960]  they're getting the part of savior to a crime i mean they hit the iceberg
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:22.160]  and then they're the hero isn't that incredible
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:26.160]  and one of the things you know it's now gotten popular to say everybody ought to
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:28.960]  read the bill i was on the floor last
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:34.640]  september when this bailout started saying guys you've got to read the bill
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:38.320]  you know this is not something we do if you just read it
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:41.120]  and i'll tell you i don't know if you will but
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:46.320]  in that bill last september and of course we we didn't vote for it until
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:50.400]  october we voted down the first time and then the stock market fell
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:56.240]  777 points and then the president i like so much was able to twist arms and get
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:58.560]  people to vote for this crappy thing but
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:03.760]  but anyway in that bill it raised the debt ceiling by 1.3 trillion
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:08.000]  so when i saw that i went well there's something else at play here than
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.520]  it's just the 700 billion dollar slush fund
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:16.080]  and alex i went through looking okay where the loopholes that not allowed to
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:21.440]  spend more than this and what i saw was you know what
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.000]  this provision that allows him to hire anybody he wants to
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:30.320]  or pay anybody he needs to to help him
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:36.800]  manage this top stuff uh went holy cow this is the golden sacks the benevolent
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:39.920]  fund right here and with that we can't even find out how
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:42.800]  much has gone to golden sacks but you probably noticed
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:48.720]  they had their biggest record um profit the second quarter this year 3.44
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:52.160]  begging well let's get into that in a moment
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:57.680]  we had congressman brad sherman on during early october and then we had the
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:02.400]  clip of senator enhoff where paulson who was working with the head of the
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:05.680]  new york fed at the time in tandem now treasurer secretary
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:10.320]  geithner came in to close meetings and said we're going to have martial law
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:13.040]  and do this anyways if you don't get behind it
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.680]  then they went out and said we're going to have a depression because congress
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:20.240]  wouldn't pass it that was financial terrorism they drove down the market
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:23.680]  there's no doubt can you speak to what happened there
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:29.360]  well i sure can actually uh you know this
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:34.880]  was in a private uh uh conference call when all of this first came up
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:37.760]  bernicke and paulson were in a conference call with the republican
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:41.120]  members congressman separately with the democratic members of congress
[1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:45.040]  and he said you know there's these toxic act assets that mortgages back
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:48.560]  securities that nobody will buy they're freezing up everything
[1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:52.480]  but you give me seven hundred billion dollars and i can get things moving but
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:55.360]  it's just nobody's bomb because they don't know what they're worth
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:58.480]  when they open it up for questions somebody beat me the question i don't
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:02.080]  remember it's ron or who but somebody asked the one the first thing that came
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:06.800]  to my mind well wait a minute secretary if you nobody knows what these are
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:09.520]  worth how do you know you need seven hundred billion dollars
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:13.280]  and his response just sent me into orbit it was
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:18.800]  well we just needed a really big number now i don't know how you do business
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:23.760]  yes i do i don't know when you buy it but you would never say that that is
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:28.800]  insane we need a big number and and to this day
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:33.280]  if we have not and i say we i was a hundred percent against it but if if
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:36.960]  that had not passed there's no way obama could have gotten 800
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:39.920]  billion dollar stimulus in a four billion dollar
[1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:43.600]  land omnibus and gotten the rest of that talk money and on
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:50.160]  but what happened was on the president did something presidents are never ever
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:53.840]  supposed to do he went out convinced by paulson
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:57.280]  it was the thing to do and said we're about to have a depression a stock
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:00.960]  crash bank failures but if we give my bozo
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:04.080]  buddy over here paulson seven hundred billion dollars
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:08.000]  then he can mitigate it it won't be so bad now
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:14.080]  300 financial experts had said all you got to do is first
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:18.240]  suspend the market market rule and allow these banks to at least
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:23.600]  carry those mortgages back security even if it's 30 percent they've got mortgages
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:27.680]  they may not be worth 100 cents on the dollar but there were some you let them
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:32.000]  be carried at 30 cents on the dollar washington mutual won't fail
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:36.480]  wycovia won't fail and we're gonna be okay and we can work our way through this
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:40.080]  but i know this is cynical but i really believe
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:43.280]  paulson needed a couple of banks to fail
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:47.360]  to scare everybody enough so that he could get them to vote for that bill
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:50.960]  so we're talking congressman then about financial terrorism
[1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:54.160]  yeah that's that's a good way to describe it uh
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:59.280]  but in that money it gosh it's a self-fulfilling prophecy when president
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:03.840]  treasurer secretary say if congressman passes bill the market's gonna crash
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:08.560]  well it didn't crash but it did drop 777 points because they scared people
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:12.560]  presidents are supposed to say we got nothing to fear but fear itself not
[1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:16.480]  either do what we say or we're gonna you know go to hell in him basket
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:22.080]  and so the market crashed and then i tell you alex my calls went from about a
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:27.600]  thousand to 100 against uh that mail out to be in
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:32.480]  about 550 in favor just look you may not like it but
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:36.800]  we can't stand another 777 point drop just and i'm going to look
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:40.080]  you may vote me out and this was so my biggest contribution
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:44.400]  look i think the world either you may vote me out but i have read this bill
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:48.880]  i cannot vote for it i'd rather lose than it be on record ever vote for this
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:51.680]  sorry thing well congressman gohmert we commend
[1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:54.800]  you because you've been proven right in hindsight now going back to what you
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:59.200]  tried to mention a few minutes ago now they use the same psychology always
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:03.440]  give them a new bailout they're calling for a new bank of the world that we're
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:06.480]  going to pay the carbon taxes to an al gore says
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:10.160]  what's wrong with paying your taxes to me what's wrong with me making money i
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:15.040]  mean this is so overtly corrupt that it's even hard for me to believe
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:18.720]  is that the blind spot that this is just so outrageously corrupt
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:23.280]  so outrageously evil seizing the whole economy seizing gm
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:27.200]  hacking pieces of it off to brazil and china and russia
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:31.360]  i'd like you to speak to that but but but then
[1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:34.480]  all these congressmen and senators keep asking where's the money where's the
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:39.120]  money in bernacky and he just says no i will not tell you how long can this go
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:43.760]  on this banking dictatorship it shouldn't go on another day
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:47.680]  but the truth is most of the people here
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:51.040]  they really think they're doing the right thing they did when they were
[1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:53.920]  voting for the bailout and stimulus and i'm
[1:17:53.920 --> 1:17:58.320]  they just really think oh well we just need to do this and i've had guys across
[1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:02.480]  the outside look louis maybe you're like even if you were right we think you're
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:06.320]  wrong even if you were right we always come back and fix things i'm going
[1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:10.400]  the soviet union didn't get a chance to come back and fix things they went
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:15.440]  bankrupt and they cease to exist you may not get a chance to come back and fix
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:19.200]  it after you screw it up bad enough well you're right congressman russia is
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:23.840]  still in shambles from what happened under 60 70 years of rule
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:29.680]  speaking of the soviet union uh there is no doubt this country's been hijacked by
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:33.760]  far and offshore banks are you supporting the bill to audit the private
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:37.520]  fellow reserve a hundred percent a hundred percent
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:41.600]  you know it we've heard from the other side of the aisle over and over again
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:46.560]  that we need transparency from the ci well how about some transparency from
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:51.120]  the fed my goodness and now you're you're so on top of things i know
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:56.720]  you've been following this uh push and and it's just draconian actually
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:01.920]  macchiabelli in the later season power but this push to develop what they're
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:08.240]  calling the systemic risk entities in america whether it's banks you know
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:15.120]  stock brokers uh different manufacturers they will designate systemic risk
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:19.760]  companies or banks and if you're designated as such
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.920]  then that means you're too important to ever allow you to fail
[1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:28.720]  well once you do that the government's going to bail you out of any hole you
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:32.720]  get in and so it allows you to run your competition
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:36.480]  out of business because you can run a deficit because you know the government
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:40.240]  will bail you out and there's also those businesses
[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:44.320]  you know that they owe their lives and livelihood to the government i mean
[1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:48.000]  it was really macchiabelli in the way these auto dealerships were
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.720]  just black unconstitutionally congressman let's let's let's talk
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:55.760]  about that right now for networks i'm going to skip
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:59.360]  this network break and take our guests to the bottom of the hour
[1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:05.200]  stay with us some stations will uh but that's a network break so i can take it
[1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:08.880]  congressman now uh revise and extend your remarks
[1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:12.960]  about the auto dealerships if they're inside cronies if i've seen this
[1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:17.200]  correctly congress even admits it then they get to keep their dealership if
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:21.360]  not they may have had it 85 years it's taken away from them with their
[1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:25.200]  customer list so this is highway robbery uh go ahead
[1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:28.800]  well it is because it allows you to completely or they
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:34.160]  to completely disregard the takings prohibition and the constitution it
[1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:39.440]  allows them to disregard the um well the bankruptcy loss
[1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:43.760]  you you can't just come in and say you you don't have a chance to submit your
[1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:47.840]  own alternative plan and you're gonna have a chance for
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:51.680]  motion relief from stay you're gonna have all these opportunities
[1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:55.440]  where they found a lazy bankruptcy judge had the auto task force
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:59.680]  dictate what would happen and we couldn't have even in congress because enough
[1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:03.760]  people are not demanding transparency we don't even know what they discuss but
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:07.680]  anyway they put a bunch of people out of business decided which dealerships
[1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:12.160]  now they say we didn't designate individual dealerships we left that to
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:17.040]  GM and Chrysler but the fact is it is so Machiavellian
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:22.000]  even if they're friends or enemies you take dealerships away from some take
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.720]  property away from some just like the old dudes
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:29.040]  and you give it to others well the ones that have it now know
[1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:33.280]  that you can take it away from them just the way you did the other guys
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:39.200]  and so everybody becomes immensely loyal to the prince as Machiavellian
[1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:43.280]  Machiavelli talked about it and so that's what we've seen here it is a
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:47.120]  seize of power in this country on an unparalleled level
[1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:50.960]  and it scares all these businesses so you're able to call in banks like you
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:54.800]  were talking about and say you either sign this or we're gonna
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:59.120]  basically have the regulators take over your bank you either sign this and give
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:03.120]  us wants to buy stock in your company or we're gonna run you out of business
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:07.840]  and and uh you know and then the president goes on television and says
[1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:14.080]  on the auto uh bailout that see these uh we've got creditors who are more
[1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:18.080]  concerned about themselves than they are about America
[1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:21.920]  good grief they're concerned about the rule of law and the rule of law says if
[1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:25.280]  you're a secured creditor then you have priority
[1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:28.480]  they flip that upside down and then had the
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:32.960]  unsecured creditors like the UAW get ownership of the company and the
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:37.280]  secured creditors were willing to take pennies on the dollar based on the fact
[1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:41.120]  that the that the president was coming after him and going to use all his
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:44.320]  his power to take them out of business if they
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:47.440]  disagreed it is really frightening what's going on
[1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:50.960]  and and you you wouldn't be aware of this Alex but because it just happened
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.440]  yesterday but ever since there has been a
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:59.120]  congress there has been you know a great political
[1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:03.120]  debate back and forth fussing about well in the last two and a half years
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:06.080]  they've changed the rules they've said you can't bring
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:11.040]  this they won't allow amendments on uh on so many bills they bring them
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:13.840]  straight to the floor they don't go through committee and
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:18.080]  and so but what happened yesterday was we've been battling
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:21.760]  the socialist health care the nationalization of health care
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:26.960]  that is going to absolutely kill senior citizens they'll put them on lists
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:30.960]  and and force them to die early because they won't get the treatment as quickly
[1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:34.320]  as they're not even letting you do mailers now i've noticed all the rules
[1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:37.200]  are changing they won't let you read bills now so
[1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:40.080]  man that shows out on top of things you are Alex
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:45.120]  yes we cannot talk about if we use the term government run health care
[1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:48.880]  then we have to pay for it out of our own pocket because that's that's too
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:52.400]  political go on the speaker's website she just
[1:23:52.400 --> 1:23:57.440]  chastises republicans bad mouths them as political as it gets
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:02.000]  but uh you know that stuff is going on but then to come in and say we can't
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:05.840]  send out the chart reflecting the new 31 entities
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:11.040]  created by this socialized medicine and we can't say government run health care
[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:15.360]  unless we say the term public option health care
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:20.800]  they will not let us send things out um you know and be on our website it is
[1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:25.920]  censorship like i would never have dreamed what happened
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:28.960]  well i mean i've been watching c-span since high school
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:32.880]  and i thought i learned some of the basic rules and suddenly everything's
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:36.800]  operating differently in fact i want to right now play a 30 second video clip
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:41.280]  of you during the cap and trade saying may i see the 300 pages
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:46.480]  and this went on for hours as they said oh you can see it but it's not up here
[1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:49.760]  just incredible here it is i figure out what we're doing
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:53.040]  how much damage the country i try to get a copy of the bill
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:59.680]  we have out here on the table 2454 that has 1090 pages in it but i've
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:03.760]  understood since debate in here that there's another 300 pages
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:07.040]  that were added in the middle of the night my inquiry is
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:10.320]  how do i get a copy of the other 300 pages that
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:14.640]  people on here on here uh or here on the floor hadn't had a chance to read or
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:18.160]  see where where do we get that before we slam this
[1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:26.480]  cram this down on the american people
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:30.480]  and she won't answer
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:34.960]  lady over and listening to the parliamentarian because she's not sure
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:38.720]  and in fact back that up she goes back and then and then answers she says oh
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:41.280]  it's there but it's not here it is go ahead
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:46.480]  go ahead and play guys the amendment is printed in the rules committee report
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:51.120]  in the rules committee report and madam speaker
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:56.640]  where would i get that report the rule was passed earlier today
[1:25:56.640 --> 1:26:00.000]  rules i'm sorry the rule was passed earlier today
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.680]  rules passed it earlier today the rule was passed earlier today
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:07.120]  right that says basically we're going to the floor
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:11.600]  without everybody being able to get a copy in the speaker's lobby is normally
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:14.480]  required the gentleman is not asking a parliamentary
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:18.960]  well that's enough it goes on for hour after hour but the
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:22.640]  point is they wouldn't let you read it so i guess that's why the minority leader
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:26.320]  when he finally got a copy had to do a leader
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:30.480]  filler buster i guess the only leaders can do in the house and and tried to
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:34.880]  read through it yep that's right he had some staff
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:39.360]  time to help get through that thing and find things that were a problem
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:43.200]  and uh it it was just incredible the stuff was in here
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:48.480]  but even on the bill itself you know it was obvious people had not read them
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:51.440]  even the thousand and ninety pages that were available
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:56.080]  because they kept getting up and saying this isn't going to cost anybody jobs
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:00.640]  weren't all this bad money going to cost jobs so i took them to the page
[1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:04.960]  not a hundred and stuff and that said look you need to read your own bill
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:09.600]  because you created a climate adjustment fund in here
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:15.280]  but it says right here i've read it to me that if you lose your job as a result
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:18.400]  of this comment bill then you're going to be
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:23.040]  probably possibly um open to an allowance that will give you
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:27.040]  and then let me flip over another couple of sections we have a crap climate
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:30.880]  adjustment relocation fee but unfortunately
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:34.960]  it doesn't allow you to relocate where your job goes to china or india or
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:38.160]  brazil and so i point those things out and they're saying it
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:42.400]  didn't cost jobs and i said whoever staffer wrote this bill knows
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:45.600]  there will be people whose jobs and i finished by saying
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:51.120]  so i guess the good news for all you guys is that are supporting this thing
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:56.160]  when the american public finds out what you have done to them by passing this
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:59.600]  bill many of you are going to get voted out and the
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:03.600]  good news for you is you may be entitled to a relocation
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:09.120]  allowance and allowance for for losing your job because of this bill
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:13.440]  well congressman uh in in closing here maybe i can hold you over but no you're
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:16.880]  in a busy schedule there's just so many questions i wanted to get to
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:21.680]  what about obama saying there's no anti second amendment bills and we're
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:25.680]  conspiracy theorist when last time i checked there were more than a dozen
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:28.880]  that just like the climate bill gives all these agencies
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:34.960]  the executive power outside congress to just raise taxes home inspections
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:37.920]  force you out of your house that's in there as you know
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:41.440]  uh saw it discussed in committee the gun bills
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:44.720]  allow him to put you on a no fly list if he doesn't like you to not be able to
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:48.960]  own a gun as well allows him to ban any guns he wants i mean they're
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:52.720]  saying they don't want our guns but the attorney general argued in the
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:57.200]  supreme court last year as a lawyer for a total gun ban i mean what's going on
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:02.080]  with that well it is absurd and it is a violation of
[1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:05.360]  the rules of the house for me to in debate
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:10.000]  indicate that the president has not been honest or that any member congress has
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:14.720]  not been honest but i was able to point out without violating the rules
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:18.560]  that whoever is putting the stuff in the president's
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:22.960]  teleprompter that he's reading they're not being honest and the poor president's
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:26.080]  reading this stuff and apparently he doesn't realize
[1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:30.000]  that it's not honest we need to find whoever is putting that step in his
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.360]  teleprompter to make sure they start telling the truth
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:38.000]  uh les is already just reads what they give him and it's not always accurate
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.720]  congressman louis gobert let me let me say bye to you here

[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.720]  he's got people in his office right now but i twisted his arm to stay over
[1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:19.760]  because last night i saw him up there making the point
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:23.040]  that hey this politically is going to kill the democrats and i and as a
[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:27.200]  republican i should be happy but uh this is hurting my country
[1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:31.280]  they're seizing the whole economy obama has the lowest approval rating
[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:36.240]  according to gallup of any president ever uh this quick into his
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:39.520]  administration so the good news is they're stalling out
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:42.640]  the bad news is there it looks like they don't care
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:46.160]  they're kind of ramming us forget the maneuvers they're going straight at us
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:50.480]  so into the breach once more this is the fight so congressman you're closing
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:53.680]  comments because during the break you were explaining that this really is
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:56.800]  america ending stuff and your own words repeat that
[1:33:56.800 --> 1:34:02.880]  well yes this is nation ending stuff when you start spending as dramatically as
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:08.880]  we've spent when you start allowing an executive to just completely
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:14.240]  usurp the the judiciary responsibility through bankruptcy the spring court
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:17.600]  and then just completely co-op the congress
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:21.360]  to where you can throw 100 million here and 100 million there and get a vote
[1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:25.040]  change and get another vote change and get stuff you want done to get the
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:29.680]  federal government full control it is nation ending stuff as we know it
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:33.840]  and so it is a battle for our survival and and i can't believe you were
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:36.880]  up seeing it last night around midnight but
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:42.640]  but the thing is i would rather stop the socialization of
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:46.640]  healthcare because once the government pays for your healthcare
[1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:50.240]  they have every right to tell you what you eat what you drink
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:53.600]  how you exercise where you live what they're already saying they're going to
[1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:56.480]  do this they're a bunch of you absolutely you hear about the
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:34:59.680]  white house science are calling for putting stuff in the water to sterilize
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:04.240]  us no i had not heard that but but i guess if we're not
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:08.240]  kidding well if we're gonna pay 700 million dollars
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:14.400]  like we voted last friday to uh to put condoms on wild horses and i know it
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:19.440]  just says non-permanent enhanced contraception whatever the heck that is
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:23.680]  but if we're gonna do that to wild horses i guess it only follows that they
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:28.080]  eventually get around to doing it to us but but this is incredible stuff and
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:31.200]  so yeah as i was saying that i'm coming from the heart
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:34.480]  i would rather stay in the minority permanently
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:38.240]  and stop this socialization this nationalization
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:42.720]  this movement towards the direction that kills the freedoms that we have
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:48.480]  then then get the majority back it is too important that we prolong
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:53.120]  this this country the freedoms that we've given i mean alex to lose them on
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:58.320]  out of watch when we've been given such an incredible gift you go back and read
[1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:02.960]  you know john adams and in his comments and when he wrote abigail after the
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:05.760]  declaration he said you know we have in our
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:11.440]  within our grasp what philosophers and dreamers have only dreamed of you know
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.600]  to actually govern ourselves but they didn't trust people
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:19.040]  that's why they said you know what let's go have one house let's have two houses
[1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:22.480]  and let's make them where they can cancel each other out stop each other we
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:26.080]  don't want them to elect a prime minister from within themselves now we
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:30.000]  want another branch where the people elect this other guy and he'll be the
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.520]  executive we're calling president and we still don't trust them we want another
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:38.080]  entity that can just completely cut them down and we'll call that the judiciary
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:43.120]  they wanted all these checks and balances and in just a matter of nine months we
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:48.560]  have seen the use of patience of those different kinds of friction so i know i
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:53.120]  get called saying we just want everybody to work together and be bipartisan i
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:56.960]  don't think they do i don't think they know what that means it means we either
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:00.000]  cave in and let them run this country into the dusty
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.440]  history or we stand in fact as as jefferson said you know
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:10.640]  the price of liberty is total vigilance but the one thing i know too is that
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:18.400]  anytime you have economic chaos people are always willing to give up their
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:22.320]  liberty to get economic stability look at hitler
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:25.920]  yeah absolutely one best example maybe the best example
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:29.920]  so we can't let that happen but it but and chuck ghoston had said this in a
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:33.680]  little bottle stay we had a while back earlier this year
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:40.080]  when you lose morality you you will have economic chaos you just will
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.320]  absolutely every time chaos that's right every time people become decadent
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:46.400]  tyranny comes we're going to have you back up
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:50.240]  next month i appreciate everything you're doing and just like i'm up late at
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:53.760]  night fighting the globalist fighting the new world order i see that you are
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:56.640]  up there when nobody else is there fighting you're there early in the
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:00.000]  morning you're there late at night i see the passion i know
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.800]  you're doing the right thing and i know you've done your research because i'm
[1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:06.800]  doing the same research in closing fire out your website tell us well what we
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:10.640]  can do sir to help you obviously this is a big crossroads
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:14.320]  a huge battle uh as the socialists like time magazine
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:18.640]  headline says we've almost got national health care they've almost got their
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:22.480]  eugenics control grid over us can you speak to
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.720]  your website how we help you and then in closing the youth brigades
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:31.040]  national compulsory service in a group outside the military
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:34.880]  under the democratic parties control and the city here in the red and black
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:38.960]  uniforms yep well our website is uh
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:44.800]  www.gomerickglht.househousa.gov
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:48.400]  gov but uh and and then what i do have a
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:52.560]  campaign website too people wanted to help because everybody helps but
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:55.760]  but i'll tell you we're in a battle for the nation's future
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:39:00.080]  and people need to be letting their representatives know how they feel they
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:06.000]  need to let their senators know and as i was talking to a guy in california
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.400]  said well and there's one thing other you can let
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:12.960]  those bad representatives around the country including the speaker
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:16.080]  know that even though you're not in their district which usually means they
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:19.680]  don't care what you think you let them know for the first time in your life
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:22.800]  you're going to contribute to an opponent outside your district you're
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:26.880]  going to contribute not only with money but you're going to go
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:31.280]  walk walk you're going to go help anyway you can unless they turn around
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:34.720]  and do the right thing by america it doesn't have to stop it just the
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:38.400]  district you're in well i agree with you this is nation
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:40.960]  ending stuff they're trying to rush it all through where
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.320]  we're seeing them begin to bog down but they've got such momentum they're
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:47.040]  sliding over is in closing and we're going to let you go sir
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:51.280]  the youth brigades national compulsory service the democrats have introduced
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:55.440]  those bills uh your take on that well
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:00.320]  you just refer to the point in history where this stuff has been done before
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.320]  uh it's done in the 1930s and uh that was not the only place it's been done
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:10.720]  that this is uh this has been done throughout history now did it
[1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:13.600]  that well that's exactly what i was thinking of
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:19.040]  but uh this is the kind of thing we've got to stop we've got to get back to our
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:25.040]  our roots to our basics and then if i could just end with this note
[1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:29.520]  and i don't try to seek to inflict religious beliefs
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:32.800]  on anybody else but they should know our history
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:37.120]  every morning when when president obama gets up and he looks out
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:40.960]  his south window there he's looking directly at the washington monument
[1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:43.920]  and i'm sure he doesn't know i haven't had a chance to tell him
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:47.760]  but when they dedicated the washington monument they put an aluminum
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:51.040]  aluminum capstone aluminum was very valuable back then
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:55.360]  is riding on all four sides of that kind of pyramid capstone
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:59.280]  but on the side facing the capital they put the latin words
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:03.840]  last day which means praise be to god the reason they had it facing the
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:06.560]  capital when they did that so long ago was
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:10.080]  that's east and they wanted the first
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:15.920]  raise of god's son when it hit the first thing in our nation's capital to be
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:21.440]  boom praise be to god and we need to get back to a place where we can actually
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:25.840]  say that because we are taking this gift we've
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:28.480]  been given and we are not being good stewards
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:32.240]  well we're glad you're there fighting and we're supporting you sir and ron paul
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:35.120]  and many others and i hope to have you back up to talk about
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:38.720]  more strategy to beat these people congressman get back to your meetings

[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  can discuss the 23.7 trillion and i've got congressman asking this week
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.560]  private fellow reserve chairman bernacky where is the 23 trillion and he says i'm
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:35.920]  not going to tell you so we're going to go over that and

[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:41.120]  have a reporter who's been on the ground in iraq recently in other
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:44.400]  middle eastern nations and to give you a real report on what's happening darjah
[1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:50.320]  mall will be joining us coming up later in the show today
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:54.240]  but uh that was an amazing amazing interview and i did skip that network
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:57.760]  break not not not local affiliate breaks but we did skip that network break we
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:01.120]  only do that every once in a while
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:04.400]  when we've got a congressman or a senator or somebody on and it's just so
[1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:07.760]  important and they've got limited limited time
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:11.440]  speaking of sponsors i tend to get so busy
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:14.880]  here on the show that i don't even get the sponsors a lot of days
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:17.280]  and i did want to thank a few of the sponsors that have made today's show
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:20.800]  possible before i get into the flu news because we're rapidly approaching the
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:23.520]  fall and the winter and all this force inoculation talk so that's
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:26.720]  coming up in a moment but all these sponsors i believe in them all these
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:29.920]  sponsors i've checked out all the i mean i turn away probably 70 80 percent of
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:34.080]  the sponsors that approach us we have to beat the sponsors away with a stick
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:38.480]  unlike most of other talk radio that's failing and imploding and falling apart
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:41.440]  people don't want to hear fake left-wing garbage or fake right-wing garbage they
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:46.640]  want to hear anti-new world order pro-liberty spirit of 1776
[1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:50.720]  people finally get it and but i do want to thank the sponsors we have
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:55.360]  and tell folks to be sure and check them out one of them is my solar backup
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:58.320]  a lot of things and cut off your electrical power hurricanes snow ice
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:02.560]  storms you name it or these stage rolling blackouts they
[1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:05.200]  do to train you to accept higher power prices that's all part of opera
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:07.920]  conditioning listeners should move towards getting off the grid and here's
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:11.120]  a good way to do just that a solar power generator is now available from our
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:14.800]  longtime sponsors lucer from science you get an emergency power backup kit which

[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:24.400]  generators need gas but in the blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:26.880]  run electricity it's the perfect emergency backup for
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:30.080]  troubled times the government doesn't own the sun yet folks so make your move

[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:50.560]  i've got another one here out of the daily oklahoma today 12 million u.s
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:53.520]  children to be swine flu vaccine guinea pigs
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:57.280]  kids receive untested shots which include ingredient linked to gulf
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:00.880]  force syndrome and paul watson's wrote a more
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:04.480]  detailed article about this up on prisonplanet.com
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:08.000]  remember and and we can also talk about this in the next hour not just financial
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.120]  stuff in fact i won't call her to call in on this subject
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:17.520]  remember that the regular flu kills according to the cdc
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:22.800]  and according to the world health organization 37 000 people on average
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:26.480]  every year sometimes it's 44 000 some years it's 30 000
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:32.320]  but on average just google average flu deaths per year they say 37 000
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:35.600]  and that i've talked a lot of doctors they say is exaggerated you know some
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:39.440]  87 year old who's had heart problems gets the flu and they die
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:43.200]  you know they say died of the flu not died of old age but
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:46.000]  regardless tens of thousands are getting killed by regular flu
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:49.600]  there's 300 million people in this country
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:54.800]  they say that i've pulled up the cdc's numbers some say 10 have died some say
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:58.320]  19 whatever let's say a hundred have died in the u.s of this
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:00.880]  flu and in every case they were on heart and
[1:50:00.880 --> 1:50:04.160]  lung machines they'd had heart attacks they'd had surgery
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:08.480]  they had another in secondary infection they had cancer they had hiv
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:11.840]  they had AIDS i mean it's ridiculous that you know the
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:16.800]  first death was a baby on a ventilator in
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:20.160]  houston who was already sick taken here for
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:22.720]  mexico months ago and put on a ventilator
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:29.280]  they're already dead and so some bug got it we all
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:31.840]  seen people at least if you live long enough you know family and friends who
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:35.040]  are based on ventilators for months they just turn them off
[1:50:35.040 --> 1:50:38.880]  so the other deaths are all people the second death in texas
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:42.160]  was a woman who had all these health problems and was old and heart attacks
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:45.920]  and autoimmune diseases when we get back i'm going to break this down

[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:51.200]  whatever you want from the data but there's only a couple things it can be
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:54.320]  you got less than 20 deaths in the united states
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:58.240]  less than 200 worldwide from this swine flu
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:02.000]  we day one told you it was genetically engineered and had virologist on
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.200]  they now admit it came from a lab somewhere that's bbc
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:08.960]  associated press roiders in fact put swine flu came from lab
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:12.720]  she just on prism planet dot tv as we simulcastle radio
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:20.560]  show people a headline not my opinion and so this flu is clearly manufactured
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:25.200]  but it's a it's it's a scare tactic it comes out of nowhere it's clearly
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:28.720]  engineered part human part bird part pig
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:33.360]  virus but they're hyping it like it's the end of
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:38.560]  the world saying we may need martial law to deal
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:41.680]  with it and if it's just a few americans died
[1:57:41.680 --> 1:57:45.040]  and they had school shut down and we're saying get ready to lock down major
[1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:48.160]  cities and went to level six under that they can force force
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:51.440]  inoculations what are they planning if they got
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:56.160]  195 million doses ready in the u.s and doses
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:59.840]  all over the world set up come on in and give it to me i don't know what you're
[1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:03.040]  talking about what are they what are they really
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:06.640]  planning and then now they're going to try to force
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:09.360]  school kids to take it because you know they tell parents it's the law you got
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:12.000]  to take shots there is no law it's all color law fraud
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  why not tag one more on there and it was the swine flu in 76
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.680]  the swine flu vaccine that killed thousands that's admitted
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:23.920]  and it broke out on a military base is this a biological warfare attack
[1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:27.120]  is this a smokescreen for obama to set up a police state
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:31.360]  and ram through his new banking reform that gives total power to the new bank
[1:58:31.360 --> 1:58:33.920]  of the world that will pay our carbon tax too

[2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:05.760]  this swine flu is really shaping up to be bad not that it's actually killing
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:09.440]  anybody or or real but that the forced inoculation
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:12.880]  the saying they're going to make school kids take it
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:16.320]  uh kvue and austin's reporting the government is calling on thousands
[2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:23.920]  of volunteers to test h1n1 flu vaccine that's all coming up in the next segment
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:28.880]  and with us to talk about this and a host of other issues
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:32.720]  and to take your calls is bob Chapman the international
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:36.400]  forecaster bob i want to get into flu in the next segment
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:43.040]  first off though 23.7 trillion every two or three months we get new numbers
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:49.600]  10 months in 23.7 trillion given to offshore banks
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:53.760]  and it's all coming to a head as members of congress
[2:01:53.760 --> 2:01:56.880]  and others continue to ask the private fed chairman
[2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:00.400]  the crook and chief Bernanke where is the money
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:04.400]  and he says i'm not going to tell you nothing this is really coming to a head
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:07.200]  i don't see obama and his people getting away with this
[2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:12.080]  without staging some terror attacks well i think what's been going on
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:18.160]  is this for many many years and i identified it about 15 years ago
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:21.680]  and when treasury had trouble raising money
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:25.200]  miraculously the buying would come out of either london
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:30.080]  or through the other uh tax havens as they're called
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:34.640]  like the caiman islands and i believe and i cannot prove this
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:40.400]  that they the fed have maintained secrets accounts over there
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:46.000]  and they do buying through there and then it shows up like they were hedge funds
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:49.440]  and they may be even be doing a private hedge fund to do it
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:55.440]  as a cover and they also would transfer funds to london and have it done there
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:02:58.720]  because the middle east particularly the arab oil and
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:02.720]  interest for years have bought lots of treasuries that was part of the deal
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:06.400]  that they made years ago so they're doing one's protection team stuff all over
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:08.960]  the world they had met in the last six months
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:13.040]  half a trillion alone that they then fractional reserve
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:16.880]  leverage but according to you and others they're not even following fractional
[2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:21.440]  now they're leveraging it with even more paper made up crap
[2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:24.800]  uh to now max keiser and other economists are saying
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:29.920]  a quantum level larger or to infinity and they expect us to pay off
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:34.000]  the infinity of debt they've made and that's correct
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:37.440]  and they think that everything that belongs to us
[2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:43.120]  doesn't it belongs to them and they think americans in particular
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:46.800]  and maybe eventually people of the world
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:52.160]  have are going to see that they could just arbitrarily take people's wealth
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:55.520]  away from them and this is where this whole thing is headed
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:00.240]  and the secrecy uh sure congress is mad about it you know why
[2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:05.280]  because they can't hide their money like people from goldman sacks and jp
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:10.000]  morgan chase and the fed and all the banks everything's going to be fed into
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.880]  goldman sacks and jp morgan the bank of england
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:18.080]  with swat teams in the military standing by to extract it
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:21.520]  bob i want to get into this after we cover the flu
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:24.400]  but i want to make sure we revisit this in great detail

[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:12.160]  is 1-800-259-9231 all right let me just recap this and
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:15.760]  get into the latest developments and get bob's take on it and then i want to
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:20.160]  move on into the banking and the 23.7 trillion that's been stolen and
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:23.120]  the latest numbers that came out earlier this week
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:29.280]  but just just recapping to make it very simple
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:35.040]  this flu is much ado about nothing you've had less than 20 deaths in the
[2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:39.600]  u.s a couple hundred worldwide regular flu kills 37 000 a
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:42.640]  year on average according to the centers for disease control here in the
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:46.160]  united states less than half a million worldwide every year
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:49.680]  sounds like a lot but half a million out of
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:55.680]  six and a half billion isn't that many last number i saw for
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:10:00.800]  some of the tropical fevers and diseases are tens of millions a year
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:04.800]  so the issue here is what is all the height
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:08.800]  why did one baby die who was already on a ventilator and premature
[2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:12.960]  in houston and did they shut down a bunch of schools why
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:16.960]  that's why i went on air at the time and i said i've got state officials here's
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:20.320]  the document saying we're really at level five about to go to level six
[2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:23.760]  when the news said we were level four people laughed at me they didn't believe
[2:10:23.760 --> 2:10:27.200]  the document with the names of the doctors and the state officials on it
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:31.280]  you could call the number and confirm it two months later
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:35.040]  it came out real document we were at level six
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:38.720]  like i told you uh now i said either this is a huge
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.320]  hoax or they're lying about the severity of it
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:45.200]  or they know it's designer and is going to mutate
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:48.160]  within days we had epidemiologists virologist on
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:51.440]  they said it's not two parts human one part pig one part bird
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:56.080]  without it being engineered like a breed of dog or a breed of cow
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:11:01.760]  you have a lineage you don't just from a wolf get a french bulldog or from a
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:05.440]  wolf you don't just get a chihuahua that's breeding
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:09.200]  there was no breeding line for this virus
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:12.560]  it just came out of nowhere whole cloth and then
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:16.400]  top scientist months later we're in the bbc and ap
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:20.880]  going oh yeah i know this virus we worked on a few years ago in a laboratory
[2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:25.120]  for the un at the world health organization this is manufactured
[2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:29.040]  from the 1918 spanish flu mixed with new flues
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:32.640]  exactly what we said we had epidemiologists and virologist on that
[2:11:32.640 --> 2:11:37.520]  said it's very similar in its spread and attacking the lungs
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:41.440]  to the 1918 that the pentagon had dug up
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:46.720]  11 years ago uh from a whaler area where it's frozen permafrost and they dug up
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:50.480]  an obese inuit woman and some other people and got
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:54.960]  live virus out of their lungs they use the human genome project to then
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:59.520]  remanufacture it and splice it so that's what these new vaccine
[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:03.040]  lines are where doesn't take six months it takes two weeks
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:06.640]  because they're actually manufacturing in whole
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:10.160]  why then release something that doesn't kill a bunch of people but scares
[2:12:10.160 --> 2:12:14.080]  everybody because it's scared regular virologists and
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:17.680]  epidemiologists because when they saw it they went my god this is fast moving
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:21.840]  fast spreading totally novel that's the type
[2:12:21.840 --> 2:12:26.880]  that kill large amounts of people and it's of the same family of flu viruses
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:30.640]  that did kill 40 million people in 1918 with the spanish flu
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:34.880]  that also broke out on the u.s military base just like the 1976
[2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:38.240]  last swine flu that broke out on the military base killed one person
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:42.000]  so they inoculated tens of millions killing thousands that's encyclopedia
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:46.080]  britannica mainstream history in fact pull up the 60 minutes i won't play the
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:49.920]  whole thing but 60 minutes on swine flu deaths you just google it i want to
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:52.880]  play a few minutes of that later but we're about to go to bob chatman
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:59.360]  with his take on this because then they had to admit it was basically a hoax
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:02.640]  and i said look either it's a hoax or they're serious but you got to take them
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:05.200]  serious they're eugenicists they're planning a world
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:10.400]  population reduction with airborne ebola spliced with the flu virus
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:13.200]  that's what eric peonca and others have talked about
[2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:18.000]  then it came out two weeks ago that the white house
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:21.360]  science czar openly wrote an 1100 page textbook
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:25.520]  called eco science with bush's one of his top advisors
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:29.360]  showing it's bipartisan fox news and ap have since picked it up
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:33.040]  we scanned the book in posted it others did as well you've seen it now
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:36.400]  saying world government to carry out forced inoculation
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:40.000]  sterilization of the public through the water through vaccines
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:43.440]  i know this sounds crazy i'm not the one saying it they're the ones that have
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:46.640]  been caught doing it there's the uh 60 minutes
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:51.680]  swine flu 1976 there it is later we'll play a minute or two but i want to go
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:55.840]  to bob the issue is we hope by exposing it
[2:13:55.840 --> 2:14:00.400]  they backed off but they're planning something you have less than 20 deaths
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:04.240]  in the u.s less than 200 worldwide and they're saying it's the most deadly
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:07.920]  level six forced inoculation we're gonna forcibly inject you
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:11.360]  we need volunteers to have it tested so they can say it's safe
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:14.960]  uh we need to get everybody ready for this then they admit that the flu vaccine
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:18.000]  itself could spread it just like they had to stop the smallpox
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:21.920]  in 2002 because it was spreading it remember that and all the deaths
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:25.200]  so that was the the model states held emergency powers act
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:28.560]  they tried to get police environment to drill and be trained to forcibly
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:32.000]  inoculate they said no remember all this already happened
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:35.040]  so the good news is we may be able to discredit it
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:39.360]  and stop it now and i'm not saying they're going to have forced inoculations
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:41.440]  i'm not saying they're going to get away with it
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:45.040]  they're saying they're going to do this they're thinking
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:48.160]  they can hype it and and scare people to take the vaccine
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:51.600]  this is a group of eugenicists that have been caught adding cancer viruses
[2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:55.040]  sterilization compounds all over the world on record
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:15:00.480]  in official u.n world bank imf documents state apartment random 200 and others
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:05.520]  why would you trust them to take anything and the virus has only killed less than
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:11.200]  20 people in the u.s they say 19 so what is going on here
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:17.360]  when it headline abc news in austin volunteers needed to test h1n1 vaccine
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:20.240]  the government is calling on thousands of volunteers to test the h1n1 flu
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:22.640]  vaccine the testing will take place at eight medical
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:26.160]  centers the united states including baler vaccine research center in houston
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:29.440]  the test will help students determine which formula
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:34.800]  works best at what dosage no one has it they say a million people have been
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:37.600]  infected with it but that's like everybody's affected with viruses every
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:41.360]  day that do nothing i mean it's a shot
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:44.560]  for something that doesn't even kill you or make you sick and they admit it's
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:48.160]  already mutated a bunch so it's not even the right vaccine
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:52.560]  then us buys 195 million doses of swine flu
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:55.760]  vaccine government hopes to speed development
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:00.480]  for fall vaccination program msnbc then i got another one out of oklahoma
[2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:05.040]  newspaper the daily oklahoma saying they're gonna forcibly inject 12 000
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:08.800]  public school kids telling them they have to take it and obama says it's three
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:12.400]  shots three different ones folks
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:15.040]  hey bob Chapman's been holding while i was ranting
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:18.800]  bob this is really starting to take shape in a scary way
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:22.880]  what do you see with your background in army intelligence counterintelligence
[2:16:22.880 --> 2:16:25.760]  what do you see here on your economic background
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:29.840]  uh baxter pharmaceutical secretly mixing live bird flu according to london
[2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:33.440]  telegraph a bunch of people die that take other bird flu vaccine
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:36.480]  trials that put that on screen folks
[2:16:36.480 --> 2:16:40.480]  what is going on here bob well first of all
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:48.560]  uh the flu in 1918 uh was injected uh into servicemen who spread it not only
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:52.400]  in the united states and europe and it became pandemic throughout the world
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:54.960]  i don't know what their intentions were at the time
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:58.240]  my grandfather died from it and my father came
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:03.280]  a whisper away from dying so uh the swine flu of 1918 known as the spanish
[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:06.480]  flu it had been had it been that effective on my
[2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:10.720]  uh six-year-old uh a dad i wouldn't be here today
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:14.080]  uh this is another experiment but this time
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:17.440]  it's bigger number one they're going to make a pile of money
[2:17:17.440 --> 2:17:21.200]  for the pharmaceutical companies the major shareholders of which
[2:17:21.200 --> 2:17:27.040]  are foundations in the illuminati uh they want crowd control they want to be
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:30.880]  able to hurt people around and make them do what they
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:35.520]  want to do and you talked about firemen and policemen refusing to do
[2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:39.520]  inoculations and things like that because obviously somebody told them
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:44.960]  the where this is while all leading to i think what they're going to do
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:48.640]  is i think they're going to use the shots to spread
[2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:54.400]  the flu that's what i think and as you have pointed out so many times they
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:17:58.640]  want to reduce population whether it's adults the children they don't care
[2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:02.560]  they just want to get them out of the way and so i i think those are the salient
[2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:07.920]  factors if you probably notice there is a journalist in austria
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:12.000]  who filed a suit against baxter and then she filed
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:15.680]  some other suits against the u n in the world bank and
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.480]  and who everybody else is involved in this thing
[2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:22.160]  and alex it's a giant scam but it's going to kill a lot of people
[2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:25.520]  because they're going to be the killer the government
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:29.280]  well we forget history and your grandfather was killed your dad almost
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:32.800]  killed it's on record that they had an inoculation
[2:18:32.800 --> 2:18:36.080]  program at one and then it came out later eight
[2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:39.120]  different military bases the troops all dropped dead
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:44.240]  they spread it it was a bio weapon same thing in 76 it broke out at military
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:48.800]  bases then it was the vaccine after i got 60 minutes right here i just put it
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:51.760]  on screen for people at prison planet dot tv
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:19:00.240]  that killed people uh and then take Gardasil biological mk ultra
[2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:07.280]  well it is it's a it's a psyop but but uh you know what's amazing here to me bob
[2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:11.680]  is that the Gardasil three years ago they had the trials killed masses of young
[2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:15.360]  women that took the human papillomavirus shot the insert for the
[2:19:15.360 --> 2:19:20.240]  vaccine live cancer virus vaccine admits it doesn't protect you from it
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:24.480]  thousands of strange 300 plus active of this human papillomavirus
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:28.320]  and then it's killing the girls in mass now it's like a test
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:32.880]  we can give it to you it kills you and then we don't even get in trouble
[2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:37.440]  and get rid of the breeders yeah they're targeting our little girls
[2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:42.880]  just like well i mean folks i just can't handle it anymore but bob let's
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:46.800]  continue along this line then into the economy
[2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:50.480]  but i hope it made sense for everybody and i want bob to comment on this
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:53.920]  the the the flu isn't killing anybody but they're saying they're getting ready
[2:19:53.920 --> 2:19:57.360]  to forcibly inject us i mean how obvious is this
[2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:01.200]  and they admit this shot doesn't even protect you from it
[2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:05.840]  silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic this very special mineral

[2:21:39.280 --> 2:21:42.800]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army

[2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:41.120]  oh
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:45.920]  bob Chapman i know i'm almost hyperventilating on this subject but it's
[2:24:45.920 --> 2:24:51.520]  it's so obvious to me and everybody else but i guess not the general public
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:57.040]  the regular flu kills 37 000 when there are normal deaths
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:25:00.480]  this winter if there are a couple thousand deaths
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:03.920]  they're gonna act like it's the end of the world forced inoculations
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:08.560]  the perfect cover for obama to get all his police state measures through
[2:25:08.560 --> 2:25:12.240]  congress his carbon taxes his new bank of the world
[2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:16.080]  where this new bank will rule the the united states i mean they're openly
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:19.120]  announcing it do you see them using this flu or
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:25.040]  thinking about using it as a cover as the stage crises they need
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:28.800]  uh... there's a good possibility of that because they could use it as a stepping
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:35.920]  stone and um... that stepping stone is very strong
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:41.520]  and uh... i i believe that uh... probably the next thing that would happen
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:45.200]  after that perhaps would be an extension of warfare
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:50.400]  perhaps in the middle east um... a uh... situation with the dollar
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:53.520]  uh... where others don't want to take it because it's fallen
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:57.680]  which could bring on a bank holiday there's a whole combination of things
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:01.680]  that they're working on here that you and i have to back into
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:05.360]  and others like us because we're not on the inside we don't know exactly what
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:08.480]  we're going we have to look at the history of what they've done
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:12.160]  and history of history and then we have to back into what we think they're
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:16.000]  going to do but there's no question this is part and parcel
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:21.760]  of something much bigger and it's not just us saying this
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:26.800]  michael savage limbaugh they're all saying obama may stage a crisis economic
[2:26:26.800 --> 2:26:30.320]  military or in the case of savage and he's like the third
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:33.920]  biggest house in the country he's saying stage a terror attack
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:37.760]  you guys at that level of the given the green light to talk about this
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:40.640]  that means a major people even in the system
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:44.640]  are concerned about it i mean i don't see obama being able to continue what
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:48.320]  he's doing without a stage crises or group
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:52.480]  of crises but because we've exposed government stage crises and terror
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:55.520]  the gaelian dialectic of problem reaction solution
[2:26:55.520 --> 2:26:59.440]  creating crises than offering the solution i don't see them getting away
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:02.880]  with it but i also don't see them continuing their operation without it
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:07.520]  i mean the gallup poll is out obama is now the lowest the the fastest
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:11.040]  drop of any president ever now beating even jimmy
[2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:15.040]  carter well then that is a mouthful as well
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:20.000]  and uh... and that's true uh... i think the approval rating i last saw her at
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:24.080]  the rest of us and was around a forty four and i haven't seen it in the news
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:28.000]  for new polls over the last week but uh...
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:32.880]  yes they're trying to get as much accomplished as quickly as possible
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:36.560]  because i think that and you do as well
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:41.280]  uh... from the polls that with and i said this in january
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:46.720]  that obama would be forty by september october in his approval rating you did
[2:27:46.720 --> 2:27:49.120]  you're right again i'm gonna get anything passed
[2:27:49.120 --> 2:27:52.160]  you're right again how did you at the peak of the obama worship
[2:27:52.160 --> 2:27:54.720]  no he was going to fall like a shooting star because
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:58.160]  you know the bigger the height the more the empty promises the faster it
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:03.200]  deflates well the reason i thought so
[2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:07.600]  but was it in in and you you saw the same thing i did
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:12.400]  uh... he is a a pupil of the brigno brzezinski
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:16.560]  and that's just one faction of say two major factions
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:20.320]  within the alumnus to run things and when we saw
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:24.800]  bowman sacks and jp morgan chase and city group and all of those companies
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:28.080]  giving these humongous amounts of money to
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:32.640]  the uh... the democratic group and
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:35.360]  as well as uh... mr obama's campaign we're talking
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:38.720]  you know millions of dollars we knew then
[2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:42.240]  that he was going to be controlled
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:46.800]  by this group and being controlled by the group means he's going to do exactly
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:50.800]  what they tell him to do i don't think that he has anything to say about
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:53.680]  anything much less what
[2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:57.200]  oh maybe a little bit but much less than george bushhead
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:00.400]  i mean they just you look at the teleprompter
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:03.520]  and that's it well bob i agree with you i'm
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:06.320]  especially when i saw clinton operative stefan operas
[2:29:06.320 --> 2:29:09.680]  a few weeks ago tearing into axle rod his counterpart
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:14.320]  that was the same position he held saying well obama lied about not raising
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:18.000]  taxes he's raising it on everybody and axle rod saying we never promised to
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:22.640]  not raise taxes and then stefan operas playing clips
[2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:26.720]  they're meant now to blame it all on obama like he's really the one running the
[2:29:26.720 --> 2:29:29.040]  show then they'll just give us a new puppet
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:33.200]  i mean this is so predictable how do we get the public
[2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:36.480]  to look past bush and obama and these puppets
[2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:42.400]  to paulson and bernacky and geitner and the roth childs and the rockfellers
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:46.240]  well that's starting to happen so we'll talk about that the economy where you

[2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:07.680]  the white house admits has been taken congressman this week in banking
[2:34:07.680 --> 2:34:10.480]  hearings we've posted the clips up on the
[2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:14.080]  websites info wars in prison planet have been asking where the money go
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:17.680]  including a half trillion to foreign banks at least and Bernanke won't say
[2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:21.040]  where it went you were explaining this is a
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:24.640]  purposeful implosion of the economy to feed everything
[2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:28.320]  into the system the carbon tax we now have the bill
[2:34:28.320 --> 2:34:32.080]  pass the house to regulate every facet of life home inspections
[2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:35.200]  the feds can kick you out of your house no judge no jury
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:38.400]  asset forfeiture Caesar sees any industries they want

[2:34:43.200 --> 2:34:46.960]  by fiat this really is
[2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:51.200]  america ending nation ending type stuff as congressman gohmert
[2:34:51.200 --> 2:34:55.680]  said in the last hour so break down the master plan what you see the enemy doing
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:34:59.200]  from your deep research and then we're going to go to calls
[2:34:59.200 --> 2:35:02.640]  well it's a full pro a full court press is what it is
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:07.120]  and they've gone for broke if you remember during the second world war
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:12.960]  uh... the japanese american soldiers uh... they had uh... a patch
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:16.080]  uh... go for broken had a pair of dice but anyway for
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:20.080]  those of you too young to remember that uh... it's a little bit of history i've
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:22.480]  but i've seen it newsreels but go ahead
[2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:26.080]  okay well you've been observing but anyway
[2:35:26.080 --> 2:35:30.400]  uh... uh... this this this calm down this breakdown
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:34.240]  of the international financial system has been all planned
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:38.160]  and what they're doing right now is stealing
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:43.600]  this stealing money they're printing it with no collateralization whatsoever
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:48.000]  and they're allowing credit and it's going to banks throughout the world
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:51.600]  and brokerage houses and in some instances insurance companies
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:56.160]  so they'll all stay solvent yes they'll all loans that they can have a payback
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:35:59.840]  but they'll be solvent the rest of everything else is going to go down
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:03.680]  with the exception of gold and silver and that's why they have continued since
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:07.360]  nineteen eighty eight in a big way for the last dozen years
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:11.600]  to suppress the prices of gold and silver because they are the canary in the
[2:36:11.600 --> 2:36:14.640]  in the coal mine so to speak no gold goes up
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:19.120]  people think something is wrong and they're right now it has gone up
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:23.200]  but it should be selling gold for anywhere between twenty five hundred
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:26.400]  and thirty three thousand dollars an ounce
[2:36:26.400 --> 2:36:31.280]  but getting back to what they're doing uh... they are funding money everywhere
[2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:35.360]  and when bloomberg demanded
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:38.720]  uh... with two two trillion dollars grow
[2:36:38.720 --> 2:36:43.360]  go to which is inconsequential now in the scheme of things
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:45.760]  uh... federal good judge said that the fed
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:50.160]  uh... when it going to the fed says well we can't tell you it's a state secret
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.400]  that was the beginning of this now i've projected at the beginning of the year
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:36:58.640]  for the numbers i was saying and then change my figures on the way out
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:01.440]  to fourteen point eight trillion dollars and of course
[2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:04.560]  we saw the twenty three point seven trillion dollars
[2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:08.800]  that was presented to congress last week so i underestimated i was
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:13.120]  conservative but that's okay it's so bad it's unbelievable
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:18.320]  and you know who knows what the real numbers are
[2:37:18.320 --> 2:37:21.840]  i mean they might be fifty trillion or a hundred trillion for all we know
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:24.960]  all we know is they won't tell us where it's going
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:30.880]  and it's being funneled into their supporters so to speak
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:36.160]  the bankers the alumnus the brokerage firms the insurance companies
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:39.440]  they want them to survive in this new world
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:44.000]  corporatist fascist state and this is what they're headed for and i'll tell you
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:45.120]  something alex
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:48.960]  referring back to what you said earlier in the program
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:53.200]  regarding the other hosts particularly savage the reason they're doing what
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:57.680]  they're doing is we are forcing them to do it
[2:37:57.680 --> 2:38:02.800]  because we are scooping them we've got the whole thing nailed
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:08.800]  and they want part of it for their ratings and that's why they're doing it
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:12.160]  absolutely in fact do you guys have that savage clip ready let
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:15.600]  let's play this because this is important and limbaugh has been saying
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:18.880]  similar things here it is
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:24.720]  oh this is classic the youtube's uh youtube's not playing that's fine we'll
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:27.520]  get to it later we have high quality computers here
[2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:32.800]  um okay here it is now i'll make another prediction i predict that very soon
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:37.200]  obama will create a crisis along the lines of the right start far right start
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:39.840]  fire i don't know what form it will take
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:43.440]  but i believe that once the minions are seen for what they are
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:47.280]  rama manuel and his gang will set off a right stock fire in this country of
[2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:49.920]  some kind and they will recall the military
[2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:53.120]  dictatorship of lincoln and stanton during the civil war
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:56.480]  when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:00.080]  i will tell you as i sit here i fear that every night as i go to sleep
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:03.760]  i put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:08.320]  control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:11.280]  know my friends i am losing a great deal of sleep every night
[2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:15.680]  because i do see this happening right before my eyes again i will repeat what i
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:19.040]  just said mark it down i again tell you that there
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:22.560]  will be the equivalent of a crisis on the order of the right stock fire
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:26.000]  i don't know where it will occur i don't know how it will occur i don't know
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:30.640]  what form it will take but during this crisis that will be triggered by the
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.440]  democrats around obama the gang that surrounds obama
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:40.320]  they will bring up lincoln they will recall the military dictatorship of
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:43.680]  lincoln in uh... in other terms during the civil war
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:48.080]  and they will do what lincoln did and they will arrest civilians without warrant
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:51.760]  in the name of saving the economy or saving the government from a right
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:55.120]  wing takeover mark my words you could put that down
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:39:58.880]  and you could put it in bronze not a nice i can guarantee you that that
[2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:02.640]  in fact guys minimize that youtube clip for me so i can see the headline on it
[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:05.520]  for folks out there on radioland driving around their cars i actually want to
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:11.360]  see it uh... the uh... name of the video is
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:14.720]  drum roll
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:21.600]  okay uh michael savage right stack fire event warning new world order
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:26.320]  manipulation and so are you saying this because they realize
[2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:30.240]  that we're going to end up winning or or why are they suddenly talking like this
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:34.320]  or bob well i i i i i i said we scooped them
[2:40:34.320 --> 2:40:38.320]  and they had ratings are dropping and they don't know what to do other than
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:42.800]  uh... you know so to speak join us and uh... that that's
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:47.200]  economic survival on their part of the united states government
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:52.880]  you know in time they created their own opposition from time to time
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:58.080]  and uh... but that's not the case here i mean there is an opposition
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:03.920]  and so but they're not sometimes they'll create proper propaganda
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:06.800]  instruments uh... if this is one of them
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:10.080]  uh... well i mean have you seen the clips of john the lines of what we're
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:14.560]  doing and have you seen the clips of stealing it too
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:18.880]  have you seen the clips of sean hanity where he says oh yeah the conspiracy
[2:41:18.880 --> 2:41:22.720]  theorist or right it's a new world order they want to set up a bank of the world
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:26.480]  see all these years it was their job to tell conservatives none of this exist
[2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:28.960]  there is no cfr there is no new world order
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:32.400]  there are two years ago i get emails saying you're a nut there's no plan for
[2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:36.160]  a cap and trade tax and then suddenly time magazine
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:41.360]  newsweek times of london every hundreds of publications come out and say
[2:41:41.360 --> 2:41:44.560]  bank of the world is good new world order is good
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:49.360]  global planetary government is good so now they can't deny it anymore
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:53.200]  they've got to play catch up and come out and say it's all real i mean i agree
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:57.040]  with you that's what i know is happening
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:01.040]  well it is and uh... i think you're going to see more of it
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:04.960]  and uh... this steamroller could run right up against
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:08.480]  the people who are running things i and you know i've said this on the show
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:13.680]  before alex i think they're terrified they never expected to run into this
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:18.560]  kind of resistance these programs are reaching all over the world
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:21.920]  it's not only america that's being infected with the truth
[2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:26.400]  it's people everywhere i mean we get we get subscribers in kazakhstan
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:30.720]  in kazakhstan and in hong kong and taiwan and chilean
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:36.480]  everywhere well winning and they're scared
[2:42:36.480 --> 2:42:40.880]  and believe me if they march the military out to try to do things to us
[2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:44.880]  the military is not going to follow unlawful orders they're just not going to
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:47.920]  do it unless they bring in foreign troops
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:51.520]  those foreign troops are never going home
[2:42:51.520 --> 2:42:55.920]  unless they have drills from missouri
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:42:59.200]  to california from texas to new york which we've confirmed they're having
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:04.080]  mainstream news the army has writers writing articles for mainstream news
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:09.040]  explaining oh the militia is going to try to attack and kill the military
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:13.120]  so we're doing drills to fight the militia and oh at this drill
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:16.720]  we practice militia attacking a security checkpoint
[2:43:16.720 --> 2:43:20.160]  you know in the hill country of uh the ozarks
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:25.760]  that's in the news as they role play with local police and citizens
[2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:29.440]  that oh the army's here to attack the militia
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:33.760]  because the militia are terrorists they're preemptively
[2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:38.000]  seeing where the resistance is coming from and the dhs reports we broke here
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:41.760]  and the um mic reports we broke here state
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:46.320]  the number one threat and what homeland security and north com is set up for
[2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:50.160]  is taking on former military and returning vets
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:53.440]  then we get the new york times where they're training youth brigades i mean
[2:43:53.440 --> 2:43:56.880]  you can't make this up folks i'm not making it up
[2:43:56.880 --> 2:44:01.840]  well the training to take on the veterans training to take on gun owners
[2:44:01.840 --> 2:44:05.360]  i had i had a piece in there about a letter
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:09.120]  to one of my subscribers who sent it in and i reprinted it
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:15.680]  about them going into a vfw post i think it was in louisiana and demanding
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:20.000]  all the records it's the pentagon and the guy that was running the show there
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  86 year old crusty x gunny says you're gonna be kidding me
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  you're not gonna get them well yeah we've confirmed that story or i'll have
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:31.120]  them destroyed we've confirmed that story that's
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:34.400]  the we've confirmed that with the vfw nationally
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:40.320]  that's happening nationwide well you know it should be assigned to everybody
[2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:44.640]  who's got a half a brain out there that you better get the cosmoline off your
[2:44:44.640 --> 2:44:49.840]  ak and ar just to make sure because the army
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:54.960]  and the marine corps they're going to need us
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:59.200]  they don't want to fight us i mean they're us they we're american so aren't
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:02.800]  they they are not going to follow unlawful
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:08.400]  orders and if they bring in foreign troops to do that
[2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:12.480]  they'll be liquidated and another thing too
[2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:15.440]  which i don't know whether the alumnus have thought about this
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:19.680]  but let's say you ship in the whole contingent of military people from
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:23.440]  mexico just as an example there's a hundred thousand of them
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:27.680]  okay they all get liquidated at the in the same time
[2:45:27.680 --> 2:45:32.080]  the government gets overthrown in mexico because there's nobody to
[2:45:32.080 --> 2:45:35.920]  protect the criminals who are running the country
[2:45:35.920 --> 2:45:41.200]  i mean you know if you're gonna play chess you gotta think ahead
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:45.200]  well that's why they're going to use
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:52.240]  psyops that's why they're going to stage attacks on troops
[2:45:52.240 --> 2:45:58.880]  engage in activities like that so that they can kind of demonize the
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:02.640]  resistance and sell the military on doing it i just don't think it's going
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:06.800]  to work because we've preemptively gone out there and reached out to everybody
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:10.720]  so they know these type of dirty tricks the establishment plays bob
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:14.800]  absolutely and don't you guys and ladies out there
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:20.160]  get sucked into any conflict you only move when you're shot at
[2:46:20.160 --> 2:46:24.080]  and you can form your own little groups just you know they're gonna have cop
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:27.520]  killers out sniping cops and sniping military when the
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:31.680]  inner cities are burning down places because the welfare checks didn't come
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:35.840]  and they're going to try to sell america on look they're burning inner cities
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:39.200]  we've got to set up military checkpoints we've got to do this for your safety
[2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:42.800]  to where we beg for it we've got to see through this
[2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:47.600]  as they try it bob well they've done that in mexico just as an example
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:55.120]  especially in the frontier areas uh they've got uh probably 60 000 troops
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:47:01.520]  you know along the border uh pursuing uh criminals and drug cartels and it's not
[2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:05.040]  the only there down south in chiapas and guerrero and
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:09.600]  and over and uh and uh and in some of the other places with his
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:13.840]  activities of that kind uh they're using that as an excuse
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:18.400]  and there's a lot of cities in that country where you see military vehicles
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:22.560]  parading up the street uh all the time and they even knock on doors and say we
[2:47:22.560 --> 2:47:25.600]  want to search a house and there's nothing you can do about it just go
[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:28.160]  ahead and do it
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:34.480]  and well nobody can say conditioning no one can say that we're not an
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:38.720]  interesting times bob well that's for sure and uh
[2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:42.800]  but you know if we can keep on pumping the true
[2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:47.680]  word to the people they'll understand and they won't get sucked in by this
[2:47:47.680 --> 2:47:54.240]  and when things get dreadful they won't make stupid mistakes which would cause
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:58.880]  harm to them their families and others and we we're gonna let you know we got
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:01.680]  to back the military and they've got to back us
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:05.360]  well it's the same thing with law enforcement i mean well you know you
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:08.960]  don't want to go ahead no no go ahead
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:12.080]  i you know you don't want to go home and and you know find out
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:16.400]  that somebody found out you were in law enforcement and that they shot somebody
[2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:19.920]  uh because you you you were told to because you were told they were
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:24.560]  terrorists and so somebody went to your house and wiped your whole family out
[2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:28.960]  and you know law enforcement there's not that many of them
[2:48:28.960 --> 2:48:33.200]  they don't have any protection they really don't
[2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:37.040]  and so they know that before they federalize i'll tell you
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:40.960]  well they know that they know the american people decide to fight
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:44.240]  against them they're dead meat and so that's why
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:47.920]  look we have foreign banks openly raping openly stealing everything
[2:48:47.920 --> 2:48:52.160]  openly butchering the bill of rights and constitution openly involved in treason
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:56.880]  this isn't rocket science we're on the side of good the globalists are bad
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:48:59.840]  they're illegitimate they're criminal and finally
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:03.280]  we are beginning to win people are talking about the private federal
[2:49:03.280 --> 2:49:05.920]  reserve they're talking about the new world order
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:09.120]  the new world order i really believe has overreached and
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:13.520]  we have to get past this loser attitude of it's all a foregone conclusion
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.960]  and it's the end of the world because the government paid for churches say so
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:23.440]  501c3 Rockefeller foundation world council of churches
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:27.360]  we have to decide we could beat these people we have to decide we could stand
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:32.000]  up and say no but they have this Borg like resistance is futile
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:37.040]  you will be assimilated mind trick they've gotten so many people into
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:40.720]  where the general public sees themselves as cowardly jellyfish and don't
[2:49:40.720 --> 2:49:45.760]  realize how dynamic and free and human they are and that we're alive right now
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:51.120]  and it's our destiny to be part of history bringing down the new world order
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:54.240]  regardless they're coming down on us we might as well give them one hell of a
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:49:57.440]  fight and that's what we're doing and that's what we're
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:03.040]  trying to get other people to do uh you know don't let them beat you
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:06.400]  and you know it's all a matter of courage
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:10.480]  and understanding who the enemy is and what they're trying to do
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:15.520]  you know i'm 73 years old everybody else my age is either dying

[2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:09.760]  high energy and vibrant health most experts agree that the water you
[2:53:09.760 --> 2:53:12.560]  drink should be at a ph level of eight or higher

[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:42.320]  um quick two quick questions with regards to the economy yesterday the
[2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:45.120]  governor of uh the bank of canada declared their
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:49.520]  recession over here in canada despite uh the neocons
[2:56:49.520 --> 2:56:53.360]  putting us 50 billion dollars into deficit and we don't know
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:56.640]  uh who owns that data how it will be paid back
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:56:59.920]  well they declared three years ago that we weren't in a recession when
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:03.680]  bob and others were saying we officially were now they've told us over and over
[2:57:03.680 --> 2:57:06.560]  again the recession's over when we're really in a depression
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:10.800]  uh what's your question uh the question was uh he's saying that there will be
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:14.640]  an eventual return to historically uh higher
[2:57:14.640 --> 2:57:18.000]  interest rate levels despite the fact that in uh 38
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:21.840]  our national bank was nationalized to get away from the international bankers
[2:57:21.840 --> 2:57:27.120]  but in 74 we joined the g7 and that took the world bank
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:30.000]  and imf and the federal reserve then took control of
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:33.840]  yeah you're you're you're totally run by the bankers just like we are i
[2:57:33.840 --> 2:57:37.680]  appreciate your call uh bob Chapman when we look at the
[2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:42.560]  economic numbers unemployment skyrocketing joblessness
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:47.040]  construction manufacturing's all down down down and they're now telling us
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:50.320]  that we're going to have a jobless recovery what type of orwellian
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:56.160]  term is that exactly that orwellian and it's going on in canada
[2:57:56.160 --> 2:57:59.920]  they're in every place else uh and of course they fudge their figures just
[2:57:59.920 --> 2:58:05.120]  like everybody else does and and so it's going to continue to deteriorate
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:08.880]  and they're going to continue to lie about having recovery
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:12.320]  i mean you're seeing that a corporate earnings are the better
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:19.040]  than uh what was anticipated that that's because they're laying everybody off
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:22.240]  absolutely they're using this to vertically integrate to radically
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:25.920]  consolidate and to give huge promises
[2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:29.840]  themselves plus they're flush with tens of trillions in bailout money they
[2:58:29.840 --> 2:58:32.640]  leveraged and that's why ben Bernanke yesterday
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:35.680]  intestine money was saying inflation is going to hit
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:43.440]  and so that'll be another tax on us back in 70 seconds with a fourth hour

[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:55.280]  well it's not exactly kind of quick but alex i think you're on the cutting edge
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:00:59.840]  of really opposing these global fascists and i'm glad to hear
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:03.600]  that at least some of the time as bob Chapman said they're they're not
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:07.200]  communists they're not socialists of any kind they're the exact opposite they're
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:11.120]  corporatist but they're using the socialist commie model
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:14.400]  look i i met a lady on the street yesterday wearing a red star on her
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:18.240]  shirt who really liked my show and thought we were battling the capitalist
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:20.480]  i tried to explain to her that the bankers
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:23.280]  want to socialize things so they can steal the money
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:25.920]  and she just couldn't understand it like you can't john
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:29.360]  well uh you know you can constantly say that set up a strawman
[3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:32.640]  but would you have somebody on that couldn't explain exactly what a
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:36.240]  socialist believes in rather than only the liars and the distorted
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:40.400]  all i know is all i see the bankers doing is funding socialists but i mean
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:45.040]  do you have a question for bob well i i'd like to point out that uh... as i say
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:47.040]  and i was uh... just the other night uh...
[3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:50.880]  uh... at my city council meeting uh... opposing of the vaccination and the
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:55.040]  fluoride in our water but but uh... and i agree with about
[3:01:55.040 --> 3:01:58.240]  sixty percent of what you're saying but i think you've got your feet in both
[3:01:58.240 --> 3:02:01.280]  camps with your anti-communism in a false
[3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:04.960]  definition uh... and at the same time you've got your other foot
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:08.000]  in the in the uh... austerity camp of the uh...
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  globalist corporate dispatches in in this libertarian so-called
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:14.880]  call for slashing and gutting up and looting
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:19.200]  what little uh... uh... get out of what little of social programs were given
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:22.000]  as a kind of a pacifier uh... uh...
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:24.960]  pacifier the bankers get ninety five percent
[3:02:24.960 --> 3:02:28.800]  then their minions get five percent and they use their minions as a weapon
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:31.760]  against what's left the middle class look john i gotta let you go
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:35.840]  because we're short on time bob can you explain to him what's going on here
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:39.200]  not in the time frame we have but i think i can say this
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:42.880]  i have spent this nineteen sixty four trying to bring the left and the right
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:45.920]  together irrespective of the differences we're all
[3:02:45.920 --> 3:02:49.360]  americans we want to win we want to beat the bankers

[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:10.800]  getting them to think getting them involved
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:14.240]  uh... you know we're in a desperate situation bob we all got to pull
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:17.840]  together against the bankers exactly and
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:21.760]  boy it's been a long time coming but it's cycled over the last
[3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:26.480]  five to eight years and and my heart goes out to all of the people

[3:08:54.560 --> 3:09:00.000]  on that subject but i wanted to go to darsham all
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:02.720]  dar has a lot of courage we've interviewed him many times over the
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:07.120]  years he was in lebanon during the last war
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:11.040]  there he's been in iraq multiple times
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:14.560]  he's an american living right here in texas out in marfa
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:17.840]  out there with the marfa lights it's originally from houston
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:20.720]  and we just his reporting's always turned out to be very very accurate he's
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:23.520]  broken a lot of major news one of the stories
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:26.720]  he just put out a few weeks ago the reason i wanted to get him back on was
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:30.320]  the u.s occupation of iraq continues unabated
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:33.520]  and i went and researched his story and others they're redrawing
[3:09:33.520 --> 3:09:38.000]  the major city maps to not count u.s military bases as part of the city to
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:42.240]  now say they're out of the city or they're withdrawing from the surge that
[3:09:42.240 --> 3:09:45.760]  put them out in little substations back into their main basis so
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:49.760]  it's a three-year-old policy so it's literal
[3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:53.040]  shell game and they've also of course rotated 30 plus thousand troops into
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:56.000]  afghanistan and pakistan and those numbers are growing so
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:59.840]  here's the democrats getting into office in 2006 in the house
[3:09:59.840 --> 3:10:04.880]  electing barack obama in late 2008 and i talked to democrats on the street and
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:07.840]  they go yeah we're we're not in iraq anymore because they had that big
[3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:12.640]  sigh up kind of like bush with the aircraft carrier mission accomplished
[3:10:12.640 --> 3:10:16.400]  i mean this is sick if bush would have tried this would be put up with it
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:20.000]  and they also make it a left-right issue ron paul isn't for the war
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:23.040]  most republicans aren't at cpaq the big republican deal
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:27.520]  he got a standing ovation against the war nobody's for this war but a few
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:30.560]  morons i know the troops want to come home 80 plus percent
[3:10:30.560 --> 3:10:35.280]  bulls i witness darjah mall joins us his new book is out
[3:10:35.280 --> 3:10:38.080]  available at better books towards everywhere the will to resist soldiers
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:41.920]  who refuse to fight in iraq and afghanistan like pat tillman
[3:10:41.920 --> 3:10:45.600]  boy they killed him deader than a hammer darjah mall great to have you here
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:49.120]  good to be with you alex thank you so much has happened since i had you on
[3:10:49.120 --> 3:10:52.240]  probably two years ago you've been out of the country most of the time hard man
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:55.520]  to get a hold of will have you back up soon but today in limited time
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:59.360]  tell us the saga the you know what you've seen
[3:10:59.360 --> 3:11:05.040]  on this quest the last few years well regarding the you know the continuation
[3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:10.480]  of the occupation of of iraq it's really amazing to me to just watch
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:15.040]  how you know folks like you and me alex who get the u.s. empire project and get
[3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:19.600]  that these occupations of both iraq and afghanistan were permanent ventures
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:23.120]  going into them i mean before they even happened it was very very clear what
[3:11:23.120 --> 3:11:25.840]  was going to be happening there was stated yeah
[3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:28.960]  and it was and you know and then we have even
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:33.840]  literally just today or just yesterday when public prime minister nuri al maliki
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:36.880]  from back that shows up in dc and is hanging out with
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:41.440]  president brock obama and he says quote if the iraqi forces require further
[3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:44.000]  training and further support we shall examine this
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:48.080]  then it's talking about 2011 at the at that time
[3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:51.520]  based on the needs of iraq so he's already of course just laying the
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:56.400]  propaganda path out there for the u.s. occupation to continue on the baited
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:11:59.520]  and then couple with what you're just saying redrawing the maps of city so
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:02.240]  now technically the bases aren't inside the cities
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:05.680]  but you know my contacts in iraq are saying patrols are still happening in
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:08.640]  bagdad patrols are still happening in other cities
[3:12:08.640 --> 3:12:12.400]  uh the bigger some of the bigger bases like the one in bagdad are still right
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:16.160]  there we're still looking at over 130 000 u.s troops
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:19.760]  there and and more flowing into afghanistan so we're
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:23.920]  really again we're just seeing a continuation of bush policy
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:27.920]  in both iraq and afghanistan but isn't this classic
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:31.840]  corporate doublespeak or soft power where obama always
[3:12:31.840 --> 3:12:34.240]  instead of bush is saying i don't care i'm gonna do what i want
[3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:39.120]  obama will say you have won i won't hire lobbyist or you have won i'll pull out
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:42.080]  of iraq or you have won i won't give banker bailout
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:45.600]  bonus money or you and then he does the exact opposite
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:49.280]  i mean he's a lot slicker because he doesn't give you a fight
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:53.680]  he tells you okay i agree with you but then goes around behind your back i mean
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:57.440]  it is really hard to stomach this well i think you're exactly right and i think
[3:12:57.440 --> 3:13:00.480]  that's actually the core of how and why he's been
[3:13:00.480 --> 3:13:03.600]  as effective as he is like you know getting most of the mainstream
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:07.200]  democrats to to really drink the obama kool-aid where
[3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:10.480]  you know hey you voted for him and he says he's gonna change everything and
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:13.920]  just because he's more charismatic and articulate and can actually complete
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:17.200]  sentences unlike bush people believe him man he's a hell of a
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:19.760]  settlement and he's he's done a really good job but
[3:13:19.760 --> 3:13:22.880]  you know the facts are stacking up against them everyone you know when
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:25.040]  people are getting kicked out of their homes and
[3:13:25.040 --> 3:13:29.040]  and and the government keeps ramping up domestic threats against people and all
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:33.120]  of this you know where we're in both occupations continuing unabated
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:36.560]  you know the facts are starting to pile up against him so i think inevitably at
[3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:41.760]  some point despite him being a very wonderful branding marketing tool as
[3:13:41.760 --> 3:13:44.720]  he's been i i think eventually the facts are
[3:13:44.720 --> 3:13:49.040]  going to kind of obscure that enough to where enough people can see it at least
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:53.680]  that's my hole well i hope you're right i mean
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:56.720]  evidence shows his approval ratings dropping but i've seen the polls it's
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:00.000]  not really over the war they've kind of put that out of
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:03.920]  sight out of mind as they put troops in afghanistan
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:07.680]  in pakistan major escalations really scary
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:12.160]  stuff menacing the russians moving more troops into those areas kind of
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:15.280]  continuing bush's sneak attack on south ossetia
[3:14:15.280 --> 3:14:18.320]  it's clear the corporate managers of both parties
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:22.960]  as the rand corporation document said six months ago need a global war
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:26.560]  to go ahead and establish this new global banking
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:32.240]  dictatorship uh so people are waking up to obama
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:36.480]  but only because he didn't fix the economy overnight as he had promised
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:39.520]  when you talk to democrats or you talk to progressives
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:42.400]  are they starting just from what you see on the ground
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:46.080]  to see through him or are they saying like some democrats i talked to or
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:49.200]  anti-war folks go well at least he's not bush at least he
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:52.960]  makes me feel good while he while he betrays me
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:56.880]  well it's unfortunately alex it's been more of the ladder where
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:00.160]  you know granted there are more and more people waking up
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:03.440]  and certainly more and more of us on the fringe that have known this all
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:07.520]  longer are seeing more people kind of enter into our community and are you
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:11.680]  know really seeing the reality but unfortunately i think most people are
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:14.400]  still saying that yeah okay things are bad and
[3:15:14.400 --> 3:15:17.040]  yeah he's obama's disappointing and he's not
[3:15:17.040 --> 3:15:21.520]  fulfilling all his promises but he took over a really desperate situation so we
[3:15:21.520 --> 3:15:24.480]  have to give him more time etc etc so really
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:28.400]  uh you know indications are that i think unfortunately the bulk of people
[3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:31.440]  are still kind of asleep walking through this
[3:15:31.440 --> 3:15:35.200]  and really just not willing to look at the fact that you know brock obama for
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:38.960]  example just talking about iraq in afghanistan you know it doesn't take a
[3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:42.480]  brain surgeon to see that he kept bush's secretary
[3:15:42.480 --> 3:15:45.600]  defense robert gates he kept all the highest ranking
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:49.760]  people in in the pentagon there from bush to just continue over i mean
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:53.440]  there's been a seamless continuation in policy we're not even
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:15:58.000]  talking about domestically but just talking about foreign policy and the
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:00.960]  u.s empire abroad we're looking at this continue on
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:06.560]  to bait it you know we're still running on the 2006 national security strategy
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:11.920]  of course which was revised under bush and and and when we look at that actually
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:16.320]  it was updated in 2008 for obama and you know let me let me read you the first
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:20.240]  two there are just two sentences from this document it says u.s interests
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:23.680]  include protecting the nation and their allies from attack or coercion
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:27.760]  promoting international security to reduce conflict and foster economic
[3:16:27.760 --> 3:16:30.800]  growth and securing the global commons with them
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:35.680]  access and in securing the global commons and with them access to world
[3:16:35.680 --> 3:16:40.000]  markets and resources in quote i mean there you have it i mean that's the
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:43.920]  that's the national security strategy that is us foreign policy
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:47.680]  any questions no there's not any questions but then they
[3:16:47.680 --> 3:16:51.360]  cynically lied to the people of the united states now in the time we've got
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:55.120]  with you get into what you saw in iraq on your first visit
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:58.640]  what you saw in subsequent visits what you really have seen
[3:16:58.640 --> 3:17:01.760]  in lebanon when you were there during the bombardment
[3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:09.600]  in 2006 well what i saw in iraq uh the first visit and all subsequent visits
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:12.640]  was you know just be you know there there was
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:16.000]  over here it's really easy for people to kind of hear the propaganda yes we're
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:20.240]  going to liberate the iraqi people uh you know make everyone safer and
[3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:23.760]  happy and bring the mcdonalds and all this stuff but when you go over there
[3:17:23.760 --> 3:17:28.720]  and you see it firsthand you see uh the mask ripped off the propaganda mask
[3:17:28.720 --> 3:17:31.760]  ripped off of the us empire project and like all
[3:17:31.760 --> 3:17:35.760]  empires through history where we talk about uh you know russia going into
[3:17:35.760 --> 3:17:40.160]  afghanistan or the british going into iraq in the early 20th century or the
[3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:45.920]  mongols or hitler or whatever i you see basically just brutal savage empire
[3:17:45.920 --> 3:17:49.120]  we're going to come in and rape intelligent take this country and take
[3:17:49.120 --> 3:17:53.280]  their resources and do what we please and leave the civilian population
[3:17:53.280 --> 3:17:55.920]  to fend for itself and that's exactly what i saw
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:17:59.360]  and that's what happened we see a devastated country we see over a
[3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:02.400]  million people dead we still see today over four
[3:18:02.400 --> 3:18:07.200]  million people refugees either within or outside of their own country
[3:18:07.200 --> 3:18:11.280]  and that situation that i saw back in november 2003 is
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:15.200]  consistently degraded with each subsequent trip that i went into iraq
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:18.720]  including up to the most recent trip i was there which was just this past
[3:18:18.720 --> 3:18:21.840]  february uh so so that's the situation there and then
[3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:26.080]  we look at what i saw in lebanon with the the the the
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:29.920]  zionist the israeli zionist aggression against the people of lebanon
[3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:35.920]  in 2006 i just actually happened to be uh flying into syria the day uh before
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:39.760]  that took place and woke up in syria watching al-jazeera and
[3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:43.600]  seeing uh the footage of the israel bombardment of bay
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:48.400]  root and specifically the airport and then things went on horribly for 34 days
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:53.200]  and killed over a thousand uh innocent civilians in lebanon
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:18:56.480]  and you know we look at that situation and again it was just
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:19:00.960]  you know there's all this propaganda or israel's right to defend itself etc etc
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:04.560]  and it was just total propaganda this was a situation i'm sure you talked about
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:08.240]  it alex where you know this was all planned well in advance totally
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:11.280]  in cahoots with the bush administration well that's now come out that they were
[3:19:11.280 --> 3:19:16.000]  planning for years to do this and some evidence is even shown
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:19.840]  they had intelligence operatives in southern lebanon who were firing some
[3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:23.440]  of the rockets and that israelis were then firing chemical weapon rounds did
[3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:27.200]  you see any evidence of that well i absolutely saw evidence of
[3:19:27.200 --> 3:19:31.760]  white phosphorus being used and and then of course the no-brainer is the fact
[3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:36.320]  that israel dropped over a million cluster bombs in just the last 72 hours of
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:40.080]  back conflicts where where literally when the truth was on the table and we
[3:19:40.080 --> 3:19:43.440]  knew the deadline was coming they dropped more cluster bombs in lebanon
[3:19:43.440 --> 3:19:47.440]  than the us did in iraq in 1991
[3:19:47.440 --> 3:19:51.200]  and that's blowing little kids legs off all day
[3:19:51.200 --> 3:19:55.040]  and it's just the way that the lebanese are then dehumanized
[3:19:55.040 --> 3:20:01.600]  um it's just out of control garja mall stay with us
[3:20:01.600 --> 3:20:05.520]  finally in the news this evening it's being reported that cyber spies from
[3:20:05.520 --> 3:20:08.640]  russia and china have now penetrated our power grid
[3:20:08.640 --> 3:20:12.640]  even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer
[3:20:12.640 --> 3:20:16.480]  to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[3:20:16.480 --> 3:20:19.840]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[3:20:19.840 --> 3:20:24.080]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all

[3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:40.400]  Iraq and Afghanistan some would say oh that's anti-patriotic
[3:24:40.400 --> 3:24:44.400]  well they're getting the military train right now to take on
[3:24:44.400 --> 3:24:48.960]  the united states population i mean our government openly
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:53.520]  the head of the naval war college thomas barnett professor gets up on c-span and
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:57.040]  says they work for wall street and foreign banks i mean it's a big
[3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:01.840]  joke to these guys they're not patriotic they don't care about america
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:07.280]  they care about the new world order and uh pat tillman saw him grow in the
[3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:10.480]  poppies and garden it and killing people and wrote letters home he was gonna go
[3:25:10.480 --> 3:25:14.080]  public and they murdered him and that's now come out
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:17.040]  and they'll murder anybody else with private lynch
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:20.640]  turned out she cowered in fear a couple other soldiers fought off the iraqis
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:23.600]  they wanted to have a poster child for women to join
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:27.200]  so they killed a bunch of her unit that survived they'd kill them at their
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:30.320]  houses in phoenix kill them at their houses in wyoming
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:34.640]  i mean these are killers not to mention all the murder the slaughter the billions
[3:25:34.640 --> 3:25:38.240]  of dollars and pallets of cash given to the troops
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:43.120]  to corrupt them the mercenaries dar i've talked to troops recently back from
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:45.680]  iraq they say it's just sewage everywhere
[3:25:45.680 --> 3:25:50.320]  collapsing society absolutely hellish you've been there
[3:25:50.320 --> 3:25:53.920]  uh they it lands it says over a million dead iraqis
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:58.640]  what is the true state of iraq well it's a it's a catastrophic situation and
[3:25:58.640 --> 3:26:01.360]  those aren't just my words but those are the words of the world health
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:06.080]  organization uh several u n reports uh international committee for the red
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:09.600]  crosses has alluded to that fact and certainly the red crescent
[3:26:09.600 --> 3:26:14.240]  society there uh again you know the people are the country has been
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:18.480]  completely destroyed and it's it's it's uh they've been looted
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:22.560]  uh their their resources are being privatized by the public government
[3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:25.600]  in direct cahoots of course with the u.s government
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:28.720]  and you know it's basically they're left in a situation where there's literally
[3:26:28.720 --> 3:26:33.600]  according to the who uh less than one out of three iraqis now even have
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:37.200]  access to safe drinking water unemployment is completely through the
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:41.040]  roof anywhere from 40 to 70 percent on any given months
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:45.360]  and uh the average home in bagdad has about two hours of electricity per day
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:48.560]  so it's really again as i've talked with you on your show before it's an
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:53.360]  unlivable situation and it's as bad today as it was even a few years ago at the
[3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:57.040]  height of the bloodletting and you know of course it's getting less attention
[3:26:57.040 --> 3:27:00.960]  now in the corporate press but you know the average life for the average
[3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:06.320]  rocky today is one of a matter of survival on a day-to-day basis
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:13.200]  so it's total siege it's genocide it's post-industrial eugenics world
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:17.840]  exactly was state of par memorandum 200 penned by kissinger in 73 said
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:22.640]  using war using famine to call that population
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:26.000]  well that is certainly the fact on the ground would back that up because you
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:29.600]  know the p it is economic warfare and i think it's really
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:33.040]  you know the most you know poverty would be you know that the stark poverty
[3:27:33.040 --> 3:27:36.720]  there where there was an oxen international report that came out a
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:40.080]  little while back it's it said that 45 percent of
[3:27:40.080 --> 3:27:44.560]  iraqis are living in abject poverty on less than one dollar per day
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:48.560]  meanwhile thanks to the shock doctrine economics of paul brimmer instituted in
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:52.160]  the brimmer orders in the first year of the occupation where they changed a lot
[3:27:52.160 --> 3:27:56.720]  the economic laws of the country uh they basically instituting an immediate
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:01.360]  depression across the entire country and this is all extremely well documented
[3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:04.400]  showing that you know and now we're looking at the after effects of that
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:07.920]  there's been no improvement no change except for things to get worse
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:14.000]  so the average iraqi is actually uh in far far worse economic condition today
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:18.160]  than they were even under the genocidal economic sanctions of 12 and a half
[3:28:18.160 --> 3:28:21.360]  years uh that left over a million dead in that country
[3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:26.640]  and we're now 18 plus years into the genocide into the into the culling
[3:28:26.640 --> 3:28:31.600]  with saddam hussein cia operative told to attack iran told to go ahead and go
[3:28:31.600 --> 3:28:35.360]  into collate by us ambassador april gillespie
[3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:40.320]  and the latest numbers from lansett i i i know that most numbers i see are over
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:43.040]  a million dar you study this intensely
[3:28:43.040 --> 3:28:47.920]  what's the real numbers on the amount of dead from this genocidal war in the
[3:28:47.920 --> 3:28:51.600]  last six and a half years versus the last 18
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:55.520]  well the most current numbers for the the current iteration
[3:28:55.520 --> 3:28:59.840]  of the u.s. doctrine in iraq which would be the bush
[3:28:59.840 --> 3:29:03.200]  invasion and occupation starting in march 2003
[3:29:03.200 --> 3:29:07.200]  so from march 2003 to today uh there's two
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:11.200]  uh studies that have been done that give us the most updated figures one with
[3:29:11.200 --> 3:29:14.560]  the oxford research bureau out of oxford england
[3:29:14.560 --> 3:29:18.960]  shows uh 1.2 million iraqis have been killed
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:22.720]  and then there's another group here in the u.s. called just foreign policy
[3:29:22.720 --> 3:29:27.600]  and they have an ongoing tabulation and they now have it between 1.3 and 1.4
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:32.400]  million and that's just since 2003 and then when we include the sanctions
[3:29:32.400 --> 3:29:35.840]  that's another million and then when we include dead from the iran
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:38.640]  iraq war that's at least another million as well
[3:29:38.640 --> 3:29:43.600]  so this is approaching poll pot level killing
[3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:46.880]  absolutely we're well over three million at this point
[3:29:46.880 --> 3:29:51.600]  and that's a poll pot killed three mil they don't care about us either in
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:55.520]  america we're on the march the empires on the run

[3:33:14.560 --> 3:33:19.360]  hi darja mall is our guest very great investigative journalist
[3:33:19.360 --> 3:33:22.640]  writing for counter punch of any other big publications
[3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:26.960]  you can check out his website we have it up on screen it's darja mall
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:32.960]  dot com and his new book is the will to resist we were just getting into these
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:38.160]  numbers so between 1.2 and 1.4 just three years in the
[3:33:38.160 --> 3:33:42.400]  lansett british journal which is totally nonpartisan nonpolitical
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:47.040]  said over 600 000 and so you double that it's 1.2
[3:33:47.040 --> 3:33:53.440]  plus this is an outrageous crime and i know for good old boys sitting back at
[3:33:53.440 --> 3:33:56.240]  home you know it feels tough to beat up brown people
[3:33:56.240 --> 3:33:59.280]  and they like watching bombs blow up on tv
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:03.200]  this is an incredible travesty what is the middle east and central asia think
[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:07.760]  of obama are they buying all his bull absolutely not you know just
[3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:11.360]  just like people in iraq didn't buy the bush propaganda about freedom and
[3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:14.480]  liberation and all of this nonsense you know when you're there
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:17.920]  and you're gonna have a front row seat watching your people
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:22.000]  defamated in front of you watching your home destroyed watching your country
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:25.920]  burn in flames you know and of course all the neighboring countries the
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:30.320]  countries of iraq that are getting all the iraqi refugees flowing into them
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:34.240]  sharing all of their wonderful stories of what it's like to live under u.s
[3:34:34.240 --> 3:34:36.480]  liberation yeah they don't they don't buy it
[3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:40.560]  any more than they buy you know brock obama talking about change and
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:43.680]  uh... you know i'm going to make peace with the muslim world and all of this
[3:34:43.680 --> 3:34:47.040]  while escalating afghanistan using more drones
[3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:51.200]  bombs continuing to fall in all the countries that u.s is occupying there so
[3:34:51.200 --> 3:34:54.480]  you know those those words of they fell flat there
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:58.640]  even before he took office dar in the five six minutes we have left with you i
[3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:02.720]  want to talk about your books some and then in closing
[3:35:02.720 --> 3:35:06.160]  the most interesting story thing you witness when you were in lebanon during
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:08.960]  that war uh... that you just fell right into the
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:14.240]  middle of but your book i like it because it's
[3:35:14.240 --> 3:35:17.440]  not just the image of our troops that want to go out and shoot some iraqi
[3:35:17.440 --> 3:35:20.160]  kids for fun most of the troops i talked to know the
[3:35:20.160 --> 3:35:23.680]  wars of fraud don't like it but the attitude is well we got at least
[3:35:23.680 --> 3:35:27.360]  stabilize it before we leave a kind of suck them into that liar oh i got to
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:31.120]  take care of my buddies but the vast majority in polls want to come home
[3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:33.760]  that's why ron paul got more political contributions
[3:35:33.760 --> 3:35:38.160]  than even barack obama from the military wanting to get the hell out of there
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:42.080]  uh... so your book break down
[3:35:42.080 --> 3:35:45.840]  the people you talk to the stories you tell in this book because it shows the
[3:35:45.840 --> 3:35:47.680]  other side of the u.s military
[3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:51.840]  well it really underscores the fact that as you just said the majority of troops
[3:35:51.840 --> 3:35:54.640]  in both these occupations are all for coming home
[3:35:54.640 --> 3:35:58.240]  because they're seeing firsthand that uh... you know it's not a helpful
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:02.240]  situation to anyone involved in it in fact it's extremely destructive
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:06.000]  and i basically started on tour for my first book and i started running into
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:09.440]  lots of veterans and active duty troops that were talking to me about
[3:36:09.440 --> 3:36:13.520]  hey our morale is extremely low and we started descending and finding ways to
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:17.440]  disobey orders uh... even if it was indirectly so doing things like
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:20.880]  search and avoid missions instead of search and destroy where they would go
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:24.320]  and and park their humvees in the middle of the field and call on every hour and
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:27.520]  say yeah we're still searching the field for weapons caches
[3:36:27.520 --> 3:36:31.040]  and they were doing this every other day and then i ran into other soldiers same
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:35.200]  story different part of the occupation of iraq at a different time of the
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:38.880]  occupation totally different locations same exact story so
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:42.240]  i started to realize oh actually there's a lot of dissent and then
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:45.600]  well you know dozens and dozens of interviews later with different
[3:36:45.600 --> 3:36:50.800]  veterans and active duty personnel i had more than enough material for a book
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:54.320]  probably enough for two books of you know folks doing you know
[3:36:54.320 --> 3:36:58.240]  refusing publicly refusing orders to deploy uh... here in the state
[3:36:58.240 --> 3:37:01.920]  uh... to go back over uh... folks that are over there what are they doing to get
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:06.480]  out of it and have companies and and platoons i mean that it actually
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:10.160]  had mute needs and refused to follow their orders and bagged that and things
[3:37:10.160 --> 3:37:14.080]  like this so you know these are people this is not just they're doing it out of
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:16.960]  survival mode or a slot or whatever but
[3:37:16.960 --> 3:37:19.760]  these are people really standing up and defending
[3:37:19.760 --> 3:37:23.760]  and the uniform code of military justice that they swore an oath to
[3:37:23.760 --> 3:37:27.520]  and that is that they are refusing to disobey
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:31.440]  illegal orders is it given to anyone with any gray matter between their years
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:36.080]  that the occupation of iraq is illegal it contravenes international law as did
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:40.880]  the invasion but so does the uh... invasion and occupation of afghanistan
[3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:45.120]  well all the studies show that the u.s forces being there only make it worse
[3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:48.080]  the globalist have been caught paying off different sides
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:51.520]  uh... what about even reama govern documenting but now it's mainstream news
[3:37:51.520 --> 3:37:56.320]  that cheney had them blowing up mosque and bombing buildings of shiites to get
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:38:00.320]  them killing sunis and vice versa and using what hobbyist
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:03.920]  uh... to attack the iranians and staging terror attacks
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:07.440]  i mean this is where and and then now they caught british special forces in
[3:38:07.440 --> 3:38:11.360]  basra uh... london guardian reported dressed up with fake
[3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:16.240]  beards running around shooting iraqi police i mean this was a completely
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:19.520]  staged war did you get any intel on stuff like that
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:23.280]  well i've actually written that that case you just mentioned about the two
[3:38:23.280 --> 3:38:27.120]  british sas officers this is extremely well documented
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:30.640]  uh... there's photographs people could probably find them online right now
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:34.560]  of these guys literally you know two soldiers shaved head dressed up
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:38.080]  as iraqi's with fake uh... with wigs with moustaches
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:41.520]  wearing dishtashes in a car full of explosives and they were going to
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:46.080]  they were thrown in iraqi jail going to be charged by iraqi's with
[3:38:46.080 --> 3:38:49.760]  plantings bombs near masta fulmin sectarian violence
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:52.800]  and before they could be tried the brits raised the jail to the ground and got
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:56.720]  there two guys out and then two weeks after that a similar story up near
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:39:00.880]  decree with two quote unquote western contractors same thing so
[3:39:00.880 --> 3:39:04.720]  yeah this is this is well documented and this is this is not news um as you know
[3:39:04.720 --> 3:39:08.560]  alex this is a u.s policy this is how they've conducted uh... their foreign
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:12.720]  affairs whether we talk about central america or vietnam i mean you know just
[3:39:12.720 --> 3:39:15.600]  take a conflict so iraq is no different
[3:39:15.600 --> 3:39:19.600]  yeah there's the army field manual that they got declassified 2004
[3:39:19.600 --> 3:39:23.680]  from 2004 we put it on screen and this is mainstream news
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:26.800]  the army doesn't deny it they say how dare you have it
[3:39:26.800 --> 3:39:31.920]  but it tells army captains just standard issue
[3:39:31.920 --> 3:39:36.800]  how to stage terror attacks i mean with their canteen and m16
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:39.680]  they're going here's how you stage terror attacks i mean
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:43.840]  how do they get farm boys to do stuff like this well obviously a lot of them
[3:39:43.840 --> 3:39:46.800]  get wise and don't want to do it and i've interviewed these marine court
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:50.880]  captains and people who see who see their own smart bombs you know
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:55.600]  blow kids in half and their humanity you know and people lie oh they're just
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:39:58.640]  cowards cowards they don't even know who they're fighting
[3:39:58.640 --> 3:40:02.080]  they're just running around arresting people so jail guards can rape them and
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:07.360]  Abu Ghraib i mean the job is to tear up iraq and suck it dry
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:11.680]  and and and it's just like Serbia bombard any country that's sovereign
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:16.080]  bomb it out and take control of it and and i want the american people and
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:18.640]  british and others to know these same bankers
[3:40:18.640 --> 3:40:22.800]  are bankrupting us now they're cold-blooded they're monopoly men
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:26.320]  they love dominating people dar your comment on that idea
[3:40:26.320 --> 3:40:30.960]  well absolutely it's all about control and that's why i i read that quote uh
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:35.600]  from you know u.s foreign policy defining documents where it's all about
[3:40:35.600 --> 3:40:42.160]  global economic hegemonic control using the u.s military to as the iron fist
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:46.880]  to make this happen and in iraq is the in afghanistan are just the two latest
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:50.800]  iterations of that policy and i think you know it will continue
[3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:54.560]  uh... you know without uh... pierce resistance at home and abroad it's going
[3:40:54.560 --> 3:40:58.560]  to continue but that's exactly what's happening and i you know that the one
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:01.120]  silver lining to the dark cloud that were
[3:41:01.120 --> 3:41:04.800]  were amidst right now is that i think it could not be more clear
[3:41:04.800 --> 3:41:08.880]  uh... this cut across all political lines everyone is seeing it
[3:41:08.880 --> 3:41:13.040]  and you know it if you know i'm not not trying to be overly hopeful but
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:16.320]  that is a good thing that the fact that more people are seeing it today than
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:20.720]  ever before well look at the united states bills to audit the fed with
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:24.320]  two hundred sixty something sponsors everybody talking about the global
[3:41:24.320 --> 3:41:27.280]  corporate crooks the left the right waking up
[3:41:27.280 --> 3:41:30.560]  dar these are very exciting times be alive but
[3:41:30.560 --> 3:41:34.480]  i don't put it past obama and his handlers to stage terror attacks
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:38.400]  the stage of gulf of tonkin like cheney tried to do but got caught fox fail and
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:43.200]  quit uh... so i think the good and bad news is is that at least we're in this
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:47.360]  fight at least the the establishment is starting to run scared
[3:41:47.360 --> 3:41:51.520]  and their aura of invulnerability invincibility
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:56.400]  is starting to waver and fade uh... in closing uh... with with any other info
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:01.360]  about lebanon your book uh... with do the iraqis do the lebanese
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:05.280]  understand that the american people are brainwashed and ignorant and but that
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:09.760]  are starting to wake up or what is their view are they sophisticated enough
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:12.480]  to understand that we're just under mind control or
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:15.840]  uh... what's the view over there and where what's iraq's future and
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:19.840]  where is all this going well it's it's grim especially in the middle east
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:23.760]  because that is you know currently where you know more people in the world
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:27.680]  than than anywhere else are bearing the brunt of u.s policy but
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:30.720]  you know they're they're very clear they're you know unfortunately it's
[3:42:30.720 --> 3:42:34.400]  pretty dark because people have seen like okay obama comes into
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:36.480]  office and what happened the american people
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:39.840]  what you who were were overtly resisting under busher
[3:42:39.840 --> 3:42:43.520]  it's apparently gone to sleep so they're kind of feeling left on their own at
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:48.000]  this point which is a bit dark but you know again i think that
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:51.520]  it's up to us and you know one to one whole hopeful thing that i got from
[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:55.760]  working on this book about soldiers who are resisting you know if u.s soldiers
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:42:59.440]  in in in the u.s military structure you know it
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:03.840]  a very very harsh difficult structure to operate in let alone resist
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:08.000]  uh... if they can stand up and resist and and and many of them come out
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:12.400]  uh... all the more better from it then you know what what does that say to us
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:15.600]  in civilian society who i can still you know
[3:43:15.600 --> 3:43:19.520]  go about and do essentially what we need to do right now
[3:43:19.520 --> 3:43:23.280]  uh... uh... relatively what you know what what does that say to us
[3:43:23.280 --> 3:43:27.040]  as far as you know a call to action and what are we able to do and what are we
[3:43:27.040 --> 3:43:29.680]  willing to do
[3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:34.240]  darjumal and always uh... great to have you on but i think what i get here is
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:37.680]  the world's waking up to this empire this corporate empire
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:42.320]  that is using america's its muscle but at the same time barack obama
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:45.600]  is giving amazing aid and comfort to these global
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:49.120]  uh... plutocrats these uh... kleptocrats
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:53.120]  uh... and that he just kind of took iraq and all the carnage
[3:43:53.120 --> 3:43:59.040]  off the screen out of sight out of mind
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:03.360]  well he's been very effective at that there's you know as as we're talking
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:08.480]  about before he's been a great brand for them to slap on this program
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:13.040]  uh... great kind of spokesperson you know he's charismatic he's articulating
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:13.760]  full
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:17.840]  uh... hundreds of millions of people both in the u s and and and many
[3:44:17.840 --> 3:44:22.720]  particularly western european countries but but again you know action speak
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:26.000]  louder than words and when people literally more people in america than
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:26.960]  ever before
[3:44:26.960 --> 3:44:30.160]  literally don't have food to eat and are getting kicked out of their homes by
[3:44:30.160 --> 3:44:34.560]  the banks and and and uh... things are just getting worse by the day then
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:37.840]  this is adding up and i think it's coming to a head and i think we're going
[3:44:37.840 --> 3:44:39.440]  to see that real soon
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:42.800]  dar thank you for joining us uh... just in closing
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:43.840]  the
[3:44:43.840 --> 3:44:47.120]  why are the banks on the march why are they greedily
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:50.960]  doing this command destruction around i have more back document state
[3:44:50.960 --> 3:44:54.000]  trying to bring the world into depression to set up their world
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:56.240]  government i guess they're just conquerors
[3:44:56.240 --> 3:45:00.000]  and they've got a lot of power and i guess they think we're not going to
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:01.280]  resist them i mean
[3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:05.280]  they really are driving the world towards rebellion
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:08.880]  well it's the bottom line and it's runaway greed and they
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:12.400]  continue to rely on just ongoing
[3:45:12.400 --> 3:45:17.840]  uh... you know an ongoing consistent bottom line increased profits at all
[3:45:17.840 --> 3:45:20.400]  cost even though the cat is out of the bag
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:24.400]  and more people see it and if they were had any wisdom they would back away at
[3:45:24.400 --> 3:45:27.520]  least for a little bit and let things calm down but
[3:45:27.520 --> 3:45:31.120]  you know runaway corporate capitalism we can't let that happen we've got to
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:33.600]  always grow grow grow and increase profits and
[3:45:33.600 --> 3:45:36.880]  so i don't think we should expect that to change

[3:48:01.040 --> 3:48:05.520]  they are forcing that issue with um... the kids who are with cps uh...
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:09.120]  my cousin actually was in their service care
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:12.720]  and they made her get a garter still shot and she actually didn't need one i don't
[3:48:12.720 --> 3:48:14.800]  think any of the kids need one they're all poisonous
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:20.720]  yeah cps lies and forcibly injects kids with hundreds of shots including
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:23.600]  experimental ones it is a criminal eugenics
[3:48:23.600 --> 3:48:25.920]  organization i've given you the white house
[3:48:25.920 --> 3:48:30.320]  own textbook it's real folks it's real
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:34.080]  go ahead um... number two i send out a newsletter
[3:48:34.080 --> 3:48:37.840]  every friday with all your key points and i researched the stuff myself is very
[3:48:37.840 --> 3:48:40.880]  easy for folks to get out there and let people know what's going on in number
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:44.560]  three i just had a daughter and i was going to ask about
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:47.520]  chat minutes earlier the straw man method
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:50.880]  i was trying with my daughter and she was born at a hospital
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:53.840]  i didn't fill out the vital statistics one for the health department and they
[3:48:53.840 --> 3:48:58.320]  sent out her information anyway and gave her a birth certificate i'm really
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:01.360]  upset about that because i think that's the violation of my civil rights my
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:02.720]  right to freedom
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:06.320]  and um... i'm actually contacting lawyers right now and i want to
[3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:09.520]  um... get an email address where i can contact you guys and send you up to date
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:13.120]  information because i think it's really important because that is just
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:17.520]  enslavement of ourselves well i mean obviously government take care of us obviously getting us
[3:49:17.520 --> 3:49:20.480]  on the grid has caused all the identity theft
[3:49:20.480 --> 3:49:24.160]  it's caused the cashless society they admit it's meant to make it even worse
[3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:27.600]  then they're going to go to face scans thumb prints and implantable chips
[3:49:27.600 --> 3:49:31.920]  again they they they put you on a cashless system it causes identity theft
[3:49:31.920 --> 3:49:37.120]  then their answer is even more control and uh... yes getting into the system is
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:40.960]  very very bad uh... but as long as your kids don't have the vaccines
[3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:44.160]  as long as they're not in head start but they make it so hard you got to work and
[3:49:44.160 --> 3:49:47.360]  put them in there so the cps starts visiting everybody
[3:49:47.360 --> 3:49:52.560]  the white house science are says everybody's going to get a cps visit
[3:49:52.560 --> 3:49:56.160]  and eventually they want to take all children from all families
[3:49:56.160 --> 3:50:00.720]  and raise them in dormitories i mean this is the ultimate control freak
[3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:06.160]  bureaucrat society this is slavery and we've got to beat 21st century slavery

[3:54:15.520 --> 3:54:20.720]  Lou in Chicago finish up your point yes sir the point is that these
[3:54:20.720 --> 3:54:24.960]  things aren't as important all these material things and I use my
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:28.880]  charisma that a gift that I have to awaken to talk to people
[3:54:28.880 --> 3:54:34.400]  whether it's a higher level person in a legal field to the person that
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:37.600]  pushes the card at the grocery store and
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:40.960]  now we just got to start talking to each other instead of watching glowing
[3:54:40.960 --> 3:54:45.280]  televisions all night or just going to sports games or chasing skirts
[3:54:45.280 --> 3:54:48.400]  all of that is fine but the number one thing is liberty
[3:54:48.400 --> 3:54:52.640]  because nothing's safe if you don't have the freedom that's correct and and
[3:54:52.640 --> 3:54:56.640]  I'm getting out there kind people a day I'm handing out videos I keep them
[3:54:56.640 --> 3:55:00.720]  everyone wants to ask about my car I bring up that subject and finally
[3:55:00.720 --> 3:55:04.640]  to sum it up real quick the cyber bullying thing is very real
[3:55:04.640 --> 3:55:07.920]  and these police now I had a huge identity theft issue
[3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:12.720]  they don't care that I have enough evidence to put this person away
[3:55:12.720 --> 3:55:16.640]  more evidence and Lincoln was shot yet they don't even pay attention to it
[3:55:16.640 --> 3:55:20.080]  they're more concerned that I call this kid a freak
[3:55:20.080 --> 3:55:23.920]  three years ago on the computer than they are
[3:55:23.920 --> 3:55:27.040]  with so let me get this straight you went and complained and then they said oh

[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:35.040]  appreciate your call this is a whole other subject

[3:55:38.400 --> 3:55:41.840]  out when I was getting a haircut and he was explaining
[3:55:41.840 --> 3:55:46.480]  how they're less prosecutions now they're only out raising money
[3:55:46.480 --> 3:55:51.520]  or squeezing the cattle all the new laws being passed or for us the law abiding
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:55.040]  and it's sick I appreciate your call Lou Jan in Florida you're on the air go

[3:56:09.600 --> 3:56:14.240]  I just spoke to them today and uh they're doing a basically
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:18.880]  printing out all of their personal emails that have been going on the office
[3:56:18.880 --> 3:56:21.920]  and there's some really strange things going on um
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:26.320]  she she said that there's going to be uh opening up vaccination centers
[3:56:26.320 --> 3:56:29.760]  like around the the city and also the state
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:32.560]  and that's what I'm gonna I'm gonna cover this more sunday
[3:56:32.560 --> 3:56:36.400]  and and try to do it coherently here but no I mean
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:39.680]  this flu is nothing it's it's killed less than 20 people here but they're
[3:56:39.680 --> 3:56:42.080]  acting like it's the end of the world and they're gearing up for forced
[3:56:42.080 --> 3:56:45.360]  inoculations I believe they're going to use this as their cover
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:49.520]  for the economic implosion and god knows what's in the shot so
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:54.400]  what else was she saying uh she also said that I mean over the last
[3:56:54.400 --> 3:56:57.680]  uh few months the Department of Agriculture has basically been taking
[3:56:57.680 --> 3:57:01.280]  over everything uh the water the food inspections
[3:57:01.280 --> 3:57:06.800]  uh she does the licensing for um bio any biomedical things that they would
[3:57:06.800 --> 3:57:10.960]  need she would give the licenses for and uh they're like yeah the feds are
[3:57:10.960 --> 3:57:14.080]  federalizing every they're grabbing whole industries
[3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:17.440]  we're going into global receivership just like a third world country goes
[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:20.960]  into receivership at the IMF and world bank we're going into receivership
[3:57:20.960 --> 3:57:25.520]  but it was all fraudulently created by the bankers that run the government
[3:57:25.520 --> 3:57:28.800]  ma'am do you understand they've stolen 23.7 trillion
[3:57:28.800 --> 3:57:33.840]  double the GDP in 10 months I mean I'm very aware of everything I mean this is
[3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:36.880]  this is off there has never been fraud theft
[3:57:36.880 --> 3:57:41.040]  evil like this we are screwed and you better tell your friend in the health
[3:57:41.040 --> 3:57:44.720]  department we all got to say no to this because if we just keep going along
[3:57:44.720 --> 3:57:48.480]  with it these criminals only take this as encouragement
[3:57:48.480 --> 3:57:52.320]  yeah the only reason she knew because I had given her a heads up on what was
[3:57:52.320 --> 3:57:56.720]  going on so she has been watching and her keep co-workers
[3:57:56.720 --> 3:57:59.840]  they're basically they're all in denial they think that yeah there's really
[3:57:59.840 --> 3:58:02.400]  something going on and there's really going to be
[3:58:02.400 --> 3:58:07.040]  a a flu that's you know natural but they don't understand that this is all
[3:58:07.040 --> 3:58:10.560]  generated not how obvious is it it kills nobody they use it as an excuse to
[3:58:10.560 --> 3:58:13.920]  build up the grid because they couldn't build that up out of nowhere people
[3:58:13.920 --> 3:58:16.400]  notice it so that's their cover story for getting
