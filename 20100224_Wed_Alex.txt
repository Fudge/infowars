[00:44.840 --> 00:53.400]  joining us today it is Wednesday the 24th day of February 2010 and we are
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.280]  going to be live for the next four hours now I had some guests lined up today but
[00:59.280 --> 01:05.720]  I've canceled them because I want to have plenty of time to go over all of the
[01:05.720 --> 01:10.640]  incredibly important news that we have before us the federal government is now
[01:10.640 --> 01:15.840]  coming out and saying okay there really isn't a recovery it's going to be a
[01:15.840 --> 01:21.760]  double-dip recession no by every yardstick we are in a depression 22
[01:21.760 --> 01:28.440]  percent unemployment they are bringing in all the phony environmental regulations
[01:28.440 --> 01:32.600]  that the rest of the world are not under that India and China and Mexico and
[01:32.600 --> 01:38.040]  countless other nations are not under the EPA is preparing to take the lead on
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.120]  regulating CO2 and taxing you they don't care if the Senate won't pass it they
[01:44.120 --> 01:48.520]  don't care about climate-gap proving it's all a fraud
[01:48.720 --> 01:55.480]  senator Sanders the independent says that you're a Nazi and basically it
[01:55.480 --> 02:01.240]  should be illegal to criticize global warming what a collectivist he knows he
[02:01.240 --> 02:06.360]  knows it's a fraud but he wants your money that's what he believes in
[02:06.360 --> 02:12.480]  absolutely disgusting but it's not enough you take on average half of what
[02:12.480 --> 02:20.000]  people make and one form of tax or another and of course even working class
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.800]  people who don't pay that high a income tax you get paid a lot less because your
[02:26.800 --> 02:33.480]  bosses are paying all these taxes it all gets passed on and all these cities
[02:33.480 --> 02:42.160]  across the country are passing laws now counties and states to tax food that
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.360]  hits the poorest first I mean this is unprecedented gonna have all this
[02:46.360 --> 02:51.840]  different austerity to pay the bankers the money that they are supposedly owed
[02:51.840 --> 02:57.960]  that they are not owed they are criminals they are a fraud and so we're
[02:57.960 --> 03:02.720]  gonna go over the news today I'm gonna talk about Debra Medina today coming up
[03:02.720 --> 03:09.560]  in about 30 minutes I was blindsided during the show by an article and in the
[03:09.560 --> 03:16.400]  audio of her on Dallas radio throwing 911 truth under the bus and I got a
[03:16.400 --> 03:22.720]  little angry about it see I'm not a lesser of two evils guy because once
[03:22.720 --> 03:28.400]  you go down that road we always compromise the other side doesn't
[03:28.400 --> 03:34.120]  compromise and look where we are and when I commit to somebody and when I put
[03:34.120 --> 03:40.440]  my trust in them and my support behind them and they do something like that I
[03:40.440 --> 03:47.480]  feel betrayed I think it was the relish with what she agreed with the host that
[03:47.480 --> 03:57.520]  we are a dangerous cult and despicable absolutely oh yeah I mean I'm fine with
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.160]  Ron Paul saying he believes government does stage crises you know give examples
[04:02.160 --> 04:05.480]  that are declassified but he'll say you know we weren't over there they wouldn't
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.920]  be over here and you know that's his opinion he can have it that's great when
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.320]  she's been in my studio I never brought up 911 truth to her I'm politically
[04:15.320 --> 04:21.960]  astute I know that would have been used to blow up in her face but to have her
[04:21.960 --> 04:26.080]  come out for a week after the Glenn Beck interview we're gonna play we actually
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.760]  found the unedited TV interview she did where she goes into great detail about
[04:30.760 --> 04:36.800]  the history of government corruption and that's how the towers fell and there
[04:36.800 --> 04:40.240]  needs to be a new investigation well now I mean that's most of 911 truth just
[04:40.240 --> 04:50.040]  calls for that no despicable so look I'm gonna break down the poll numbers all
[04:50.040 --> 04:56.460]  of it and where this is going but overall still our experience in Texas is
[04:56.460 --> 05:02.320]  positive and I'll tell you why coming up hello this is Alex Jones with some
[05:02.320 --> 05:06.360]  important questions if you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle in a

[08:48.440 --> 08:52.160]  said coming up at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna spend about 10 minutes
[08:52.160 --> 09:00.920]  on Deborah Medina I don't think she's a bad person I don't think she's a new
[09:00.920 --> 09:06.080]  world order we know Rick Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchinson are bonafide new
[09:06.080 --> 09:13.920]  world order I was just extremely hurt by Glenn Beck going after her and setting
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.720]  her up and then her doing the right thing and not backing off for two weeks
[09:17.720 --> 09:24.800]  and saying look people have a right to investigate this and then we're gonna
[09:24.800 --> 09:30.760]  play those clips she talks about how the towers fell and everything else in the
[09:30.760 --> 09:35.800]  history of government secretiveness and then a few days ago goes on Dallas
[09:35.800 --> 09:42.080]  radio the guy that fills in for Limbaugh true establishment hack mark Davis the
[09:42.080 --> 09:47.880]  guy that's lied about me incessantly and says we're a dangerous cult 9-11 truth
[09:47.880 --> 09:55.640]  is and that's a wide spectrum of people and that it's despicable and she I
[09:55.640 --> 10:03.680]  agree I agree with relish with with vitriol with enjoyment like it was a
[10:03.680 --> 10:10.520]  pep rally or something Ron Paul got into a lot of trouble with people back
[10:10.520 --> 10:14.760]  during the campaign for president 2008 when he was on a few different TV shows
[10:14.760 --> 10:19.240]  and said you know I'm no I'm not with 9-11 truth but he didn't agree that we
[10:19.240 --> 10:25.920]  were scum and trash and he went on to say that there have been instances of
[10:25.920 --> 10:29.240]  staged terror in the past like the Gulf of Tonkin was a staged event
[10:29.240 --> 10:36.360]  Operation Ajax and Iran and when he's on this show he talks about it but see
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.280]  that's not the issue he's always been the same on that issue what I don't like
[10:40.280 --> 10:47.120]  is flip-flopping but I don't like is doing a 180 reversing in full stream and
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.560]  going back on everything she previously said because if somebody will do that
[10:51.560 --> 10:57.280]  when the heat gets hot in the kitchen they should stay out of the kitchen all
[10:57.280 --> 11:08.840]  I have in my life is my word and that I do what I say I'm gonna do or I die
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.880]  trying and sometimes it takes me longer to deliver on something I've said I'm
[11:14.880 --> 11:24.000]  gonna do but I try and none of us are perfect it's just upsetting and I know
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.480]  you're listening all over the country in the world saying hey we don't hear about
[11:26.480 --> 11:35.360]  Texas the issue here is we have a states rights movement that's constitutional
[11:35.360 --> 11:40.520]  and historically valid moving across the country and just the fact that she got
[11:40.520 --> 11:45.800]  25 points in the polls coming from nowhere in a three-way race has already
[11:45.800 --> 11:53.440]  gotten a lot of other good men and women to sign up to run as constitutionalist
[11:53.440 --> 11:56.320]  and I don't care if you run as a Republican or a Democrat for states
[11:56.320 --> 12:05.280]  rights using the machinery of those parties to do it and so it's a positive
[12:05.280 --> 12:08.720]  experience regardless and everybody that's invested time and money and
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.440]  energy as I told you from the start whether she wins or loses it's a victory
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.960]  because resistance is victory so I'll talk about that coming up in about 20
[12:17.960 --> 12:23.200]  minutes and again we're gonna open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231 you're
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.040]  welcome to give us your take on this if you want Paul Watson's told me that
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.120]  99% but he said he got no emails that disagreed with us and the feedback we've
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.120]  got at the office is everybody basically agrees with us I haven't seen one
[12:37.120 --> 12:46.240]  email or comment to us that disagrees people are hurt by this I mean I'm we
[12:46.240 --> 12:52.280]  were assaulted we were thrown under the bus that's wrong let me write some notes
[12:52.280 --> 12:54.400]  here because I'm already getting into this and I wanted to have a few breaks
[12:54.400 --> 12:57.080]  so I could think about this I got so busy this morning I wanted to write some
[12:57.080 --> 13:03.880]  notes about points I wanted to talk about but and go over some of those
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.800]  points but regardless I don't want to spend too much time on this today you're
[13:08.800 --> 13:12.320]  welcome to call about whatever you want as I said because so much is happening I
[13:12.320 --> 13:16.600]  want to have a discussion with listeners
[13:16.600 --> 13:23.880]  about where you see this country in this world going I mean we're definitely in
[13:23.880 --> 13:28.160]  a depression and there's no doubt it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and
[13:28.160 --> 13:35.960]  we're gonna end up like Nigeria or what happened in Argentina Argentina was a
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.920]  first world nation the only first world nation in Latin America a hundred years
[13:40.920 --> 13:51.000]  ago they had the saying as rich as an Argentine and in successive bank scams
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.680]  down there left-wing right-wing doesn't matter the bankers the
[13:54.680 --> 14:02.440]  internationalist the gunboat diplomacy boys it is an abject hell down there now
[14:02.440 --> 14:08.160]  and the middle class is on the streets and we've had economists on from that
[14:08.160 --> 14:12.000]  nation to talk about for six months people demonstrated and rioted and bang
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.560]  pots and pans and the system didn't care that's the same thing in Latin
[14:16.560 --> 14:21.520]  America and in Africa and Asia sometimes in these countries they'll have five or
[14:21.520 --> 14:28.960]  six or seven presidents in just a matter of a year putting new people in new
[14:28.960 --> 14:35.160]  leaders and it's the same thing continues and that's the problem we're now
[14:35.160 --> 14:39.200]  seeing here where you put a bush in and things get worse you put an Obama in
[14:39.200 --> 14:45.000]  things get worse and people are waking up to the fraud now in a matter of months
[14:45.000 --> 14:54.000]  not years people becoming disillusioned with a two-party system in fact I sent
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.600]  it to you guys but I don't see it here in my stack it's up on info wars calm
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.720]  it's one of the headlines only eight percent of Americans think the
[15:03.720 --> 15:11.160]  government's good a month ago it was seventy five percent in fact I've seen
[15:11.160 --> 15:15.600]  multiple scientific polls the last week ten percent trust the government nine
[15:15.600 --> 15:23.800]  percent eight percent total confidence has been lost because people see the
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.680]  reality of what's happening on the street in their homes and their businesses
[15:27.680 --> 15:32.920]  and their churches they see the economy falling apart and then they hear the
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.840]  politicians telling them everything's getting better while the politicians
[15:37.840 --> 15:46.680]  continue all the policies that brought us to rack and ruin and it's not just the
[15:46.680 --> 15:50.680]  politicians that are losing all credibility the mainstream media is
[15:50.680 --> 15:59.880]  losing any credibility they had left and so you've got this evil alliance of old
[15:59.880 --> 16:07.920]  corporate radio TV newspapers with government openly saying they want
[16:07.920 --> 16:12.520]  censorship of alternative news and basically a shutdown of the web as we
[16:12.520 --> 16:20.240]  know it it's all being announced right now they don't care about your business
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.200]  they don't care about the internet being around all they care about is power
[16:23.200 --> 16:28.200]  that's what history shown us corrupt elites would rather be in their armored
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.960]  hilltop keep their castle while everybody else is starving down below them as
[16:33.960 --> 16:45.360]  long as they run things my guys just found a CNN one no no no this is one
[16:45.360 --> 16:51.000]  from a while back there's a new one out a new poll were eight percent another
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.920]  one nine percent leave the headlines only eight percent think the government's
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.760]  working for them this is seeing an end survey most Americans believe government
[16:59.760 --> 17:04.920]  broken yeah I saw this last week and since Americans overwhelmingly believe
[17:04.920 --> 17:09.200]  the government is broken according to a national poll released Sunday but the
[17:09.200 --> 17:13.080]  CNN opinion research course survey also indicates the public overwhelmingly holds
[17:13.080 --> 17:18.920]  out hope that what is broken can be fixed so this is a whitewash
[17:18.920 --> 17:31.120]  yeah Kurt posted it this morning so we can find it point is the people know
[17:31.120 --> 17:39.400]  what's going on now people know and I've been doing all these radio and TV
[17:39.400 --> 17:42.680]  interviews the last week I was on Houston radio this morning one of their big
[17:42.680 --> 17:50.440]  talk stations and they're like wow mr. Jones I heard you talk about this years
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.200]  ago and thought you were crazy well all you had to do was go look it up what am
[17:54.200 --> 18:00.120]  I talking about DNA of all the newborns in the US sent to the military but that's
[18:00.120 --> 18:04.560]  it that's all been available if I knew about this 14 years ago with the
[18:04.560 --> 18:09.880]  documents it's not even secret but it was never in the news I would get up here
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.520]  with documents on air and tell you where the samples are stored in your state and
[18:14.520 --> 18:18.560]  the fact that they're sent to the UN the Pentagon the Cold Springs Harbor human
[18:18.560 --> 18:22.960]  genome eugenics laboratory and guess what that's all in the newspapers now
[18:22.960 --> 18:28.600]  everything I told you it's a national criminal DNA database and then you can
[18:28.600 --> 18:33.880]  also pull up CBS news and I first saw this almost 10 years ago in the San
[18:33.880 --> 18:41.080]  Francisco Chronicle but last year CBS news had the headline cancer patients

[24:26.360 --> 24:29.920]  the majority of the population so they can take control of us and socially
[24:29.920 --> 24:36.000]  engineer us into the system they choose which is a eugenics population reduction
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.960]  nightmare this is their own words and literally thousands of publications and
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.480]  books and UN documents that we've covered and made films about and that we
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.400]  have posted at whatistheingame.com we know where this train is headed the
[24:50.400 --> 24:56.200]  question is how do we get off of it we take our states back through the
[24:56.200 --> 25:00.840]  Constitution through the Bill of Rights we call for indictments of the bankers
[25:00.840 --> 25:05.760]  we point them out as the real government not the puppets in Washington and we put
[25:05.760 --> 25:11.160]  one foot in front of the other that's how we do it there is no magic silver
[25:11.160 --> 25:16.800]  bullet we expose the criminal illegitimate system when I say we have a
[25:16.800 --> 25:22.080]  rogue government that isn't just a figure of speech that isn't just rhetoric

[25:33.560 --> 25:37.680]  program what does that tell you about the organizational level of these people
[25:37.680 --> 25:48.360]  and their bravada their hoodspot their arrogance their hubris completely
[25:48.360 --> 25:54.600]  illegal on record that the federal government would pay with taxpayer
[25:54.600 --> 25:58.080]  money for millions of laptops and programs be given to school children
[25:58.080 --> 26:01.880]  that have software on it where they encourage the school to watch the
[26:01.880 --> 26:05.520]  children in school and out of school and the school one of the schools is so
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.240]  arrogant they come out and say we're watching you at home thinking the
[26:09.240 --> 26:20.040]  public was ready to submit to that it's a process of breaking us we have a
[26:20.040 --> 26:24.800]  private Federal Reserve holding company that tells house and Senate banking
[26:24.800 --> 26:30.520]  committees that we will not tell you where the tens of trillions of dollars
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.520]  have gone it's a secret then it comes out they're giving it to themselves and
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.600]  they say well I gave myself a waiver Henry Paulson says Geithner says I gave
[26:41.600 --> 26:45.960]  myself a waiver well that's nice it's like giving yourself a waiver to rob a
[26:45.960 --> 26:53.120]  bank up until the last decade they would never hire anyone in the treasury you
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.160]  had any tax problems Geithner just says I don't want to pay these taxes that's
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.200]  the end of it and it's no big deal
[27:02.920 --> 27:07.000]  police all over the country and all over Europe it's simultaneous are
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.240]  arresting people for videotaping parades Christmas parades NASCAR parades
[27:13.240 --> 27:18.480]  st. Patty's Day parades but then they cram cameras in the school rooms and
[27:18.480 --> 27:21.840]  bathrooms and surveil us but don't you dare come out with a camera on the
[27:21.840 --> 27:26.080]  street there's no law but they make one up and say why are tapping when there's
[27:26.080 --> 27:36.480]  no perception and no reasonable belief of privacy or anonymity of privacy on
[27:36.480 --> 27:42.360]  the street they're lawless they've been taught to be lawless they promote
[27:42.360 --> 27:48.400]  through the government system whoever is lawless and oppressive we fight tooth
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.600]  and nail to shoot down the house version now in the Senate of the cap and
[27:52.600 --> 27:58.000]  trade bill taxes on everything 35 agencies can levy any taxes they want
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.880]  unlimited power home inspections it within one week if you don't make the

[28:17.520 --> 28:23.520]  fall the republic guess what the president doesn't care and he announced
[28:23.520 --> 28:27.960]  two weeks ago the new york times ron emmanuel announces we're going to use
[28:27.960 --> 28:31.920]  the bureaucracy executive orders and signing statements to do it and here's
[28:31.920 --> 28:42.520]  time magazine today epa prepares to take the lead on regulating co2 from the
[28:42.520 --> 28:45.880]  moment president barack obama took office he's emphasized the importance of
[28:45.880 --> 28:49.720]  dealing with climate change he said the right way to do it is to pass
[28:49.720 --> 28:52.960]  congressional legislation that would kept greenhouse gases but eight months
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.000]  after the house representatives passed the cap and trade bill similar
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.520]  legislation remains mired in the Senate it's chances of passage dimmed by the
[29:00.520 --> 29:08.720]  day because the climate gate and then they go on to say but it doesn't matter
[29:08.720 --> 29:17.200]  because obama is going to use the epa to do it they're gonna start with coal
[29:17.200 --> 29:23.040]  plants and then move on to everything else and engage at their takeover at the
[29:23.040 --> 29:32.280]  local level a lawless government and every day I see reports of where good
[29:32.280 --> 29:37.360]  cops good city and county and state and federal workers say no to corruption and
[29:37.360 --> 29:46.000]  they get run out how do we help them how do we stand behind them ladies a

[33:45.240 --> 33:50.920]  news audio and video clips are gonna be playing what did you think of the video
[33:50.920 --> 33:54.840]  Aaron posted at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com yesterday we
[33:54.840 --> 34:03.680]  premiered here on air of Geithner and the stage press conference on video he
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.200]  has Geithner's people before he gets there the Treasury Department picking two
[34:08.200 --> 34:13.480]  reporters and saying okay I'll go to both of you imagine they tell hundreds of
[34:13.480 --> 34:19.840]  news agencies to get there there's over 50 reporters that show up they send a
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.240]  press release out and it was all for a backdrop to look like a press conference
[34:24.240 --> 34:28.680]  they all show up and then they have two stage questions and Aaron yells out
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.120]  where's the 23 trillion and then suddenly other reporters start yelling
[34:33.120 --> 34:38.360]  and out so Geithner just leaves he talked less than five minutes Geithner in
[34:38.360 --> 34:44.840]  the IRS commissioner that's important news just to show Americans how staged
[34:44.840 --> 34:48.440]  it is and Aaron caught it on video and then there's the other facet to the
[34:48.440 --> 34:55.720]  story that when they didn't tell anybody that you need credentials was on the
[34:55.720 --> 35:04.840]  side of the road and they come up to Jason Bermas and Rob Jacobson and say
[35:04.840 --> 35:07.160]  you're with info wars no you're not allowed to be here get a couple hundred
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.640]  yards away that's why I sent three separate teams of video cameras Aaron by
[35:12.640 --> 35:20.760]  himself Rob do and Jason Douglas together and Jason and Rob together in
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.840]  three different groups knowing that at least one would make it through I mean
[35:24.840 --> 35:30.280]  I knew they'd try to censor they're men with badges and guns you're just a
[35:30.280 --> 35:35.480]  little stinking American you're a slave our boss doesn't even pay taxes he
[35:35.480 --> 35:38.880]  steals trillions of dollars and won't tell Congress where it is you think we're
[35:38.880 --> 35:42.800]  going to let some little slaves who might ask real questions being a press
[35:42.800 --> 35:49.200]  conference what do you think this is land of the free home of the brave no
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.320]  all right I'm going to cover Debra Medina and people are welcome to call in
[35:55.320 --> 36:02.960]  about it because it's a larger discussion of where this nation is going
[36:02.960 --> 36:09.920]  yesterday early in the show they bring me a news article and play me audio of
[36:09.920 --> 36:15.680]  her on mark Davis who I know well he's lied about me in the past even after it
[36:15.680 --> 36:19.040]  was retracted major newspapers that I did not say kill Michelle Malcolm at the
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.560]  DNC that people that came with a group of bloggers and left with a group of
[36:23.560 --> 36:31.000]  bloggers with her dressed up in costumes covering their faces got up behind me
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.440]  and screamed kill Michelle Malcolm as a setup and they tried to they put it out
[36:39.440 --> 36:43.880]  on national television try to make it a big controversy to try to wound my
[36:43.880 --> 36:50.600]  credibility didn't work blew up in their face so she's on mark Davis and he says
[36:50.600 --> 36:57.360]  these are despicable you know dangerous bad cult and she says I agree oh yes now
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.760]  my concern here is not that she said she's on 9-11 truth or back when Beck
[37:02.760 --> 37:08.920]  did that to her was a sneak attack we backed her up we supported her we did
[37:08.920 --> 37:11.720]  everything we could
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.920]  and I even liked her more when she went on a bunch of TV stations one of them
[37:24.920 --> 37:34.400]  ABC News out of Houston that's coming up here in a moment ABC 13 Houston news and
[37:34.400 --> 37:37.400]  she said basically the same thing and speech after speech and in TV interview
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.000]  after TV interview I've seen five of these we have five of them and we went to
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.640]  the TV station site today not just a YouTube clip we went and got the
[37:43.640 --> 37:47.920]  unedited clip we're about to play it and she said hey look people have a right
[37:47.920 --> 37:53.480]  to question I have questions how the the towers fell how that building fell and
[37:53.480 --> 37:59.720]  I'm like wow this lady really sticks to her guns doesn't flip flop under pressure
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.720]  then I start getting reports that she's doing interviews all over the place
[38:05.720 --> 38:08.920]  saying basically what she said on Davis's program and I was getting emails
[38:08.920 --> 38:12.360]  from listeners saying you got to look at this back over the weekend and I just
[38:12.360 --> 38:18.240]  ignored it I was too busy with other things oh that's not true she wouldn't
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.280]  do that I'm not gonna click on this link and then my staff shows it to me I
[38:23.280 --> 38:29.640]  listen to it and I got angry and I know my listeners got really angry 99% of the
[38:29.640 --> 38:32.640]  feedback we've gotten is people are even more angry than we are saying she's
[38:32.640 --> 38:35.920]  New World Order and all this look I don't agree with that I think she's a good
[38:35.920 --> 38:42.960]  person I think she's gotten some bad advice but it doesn't matter the way
[38:42.960 --> 38:48.640]  she enthusiastically agrees with Mark Davis and flip flops from everything she'd
[38:48.640 --> 38:53.640]  previously said will she do that on the second amendment issue will politics
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.280]  does this to people it's a rare person that's the same 30 years ago that they
[38:57.280 --> 39:03.080]  are today like Ron Paul and I knew people would spin it once open my mouth
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.120]  to say oh I'm mad that she done 9-11 truth or and some people even spun it
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.560]  said Alex is being Machiavellian he's such a genius he's doing this to
[39:11.560 --> 39:15.880]  distance her from 9-11 truthers to help her we don't do Machiavellian things
[39:15.880 --> 39:20.560]  here I don't sit here and make a bunch of calculations unless I'm trying to say
[39:20.560 --> 39:24.600]  get reporters into a press conference then sure but I don't sit here no I got
[39:24.600 --> 39:31.920]  angry and told you what was on my heart now let's talk about the facts before I
[39:31.920 --> 39:37.000]  go to these clips this is a victory what happened in Texas regardless as I've
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.080]  been telling you for a month she was at 15 points than 20 to 25 I knew the Beck
[39:41.080 --> 39:43.760]  thing would hurt her with mainline Republicans because it created the
[39:43.760 --> 39:48.320]  illusion that she was off the list she couldn't win she was discredited and
[39:48.320 --> 39:51.520]  people who are weak-minded go along with that it's like Howard Dean and his roar
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.840]  not that he was a good guy but they use that and it came out the clerk channel
[39:56.840 --> 40:00.200]  did stage it was coordinating with the Perry campaign and that they gave him
[40:00.200 --> 40:02.720]  all this money and that's now been confirmed and that they had fake
[40:02.720 --> 40:07.160]  postings out there from Deborah Medina like she was saying radical bad things
[40:07.160 --> 40:10.840]  with Al's morning news they caught that and reported on it so we knew a dirty
[40:10.840 --> 40:18.160]  tricks campaign was going on we knew that
[40:24.240 --> 40:30.400]  but then she went completely back on all that and regardless it's a victory
[40:30.400 --> 40:35.880]  that the people of Texas stood up and this shows how angry people are and
[40:35.880 --> 40:40.040]  that it's not just Democrats in Massachusetts that are in trouble with
[40:40.040 --> 40:43.080]  Scott Brown notice he's now voting with the Democrats in Congress I told you
[40:43.080 --> 40:47.640]  that was gonna happen the guy authored was well partially an author he
[40:47.640 --> 40:53.680]  co-sponsored the health care bill in Massachusetts that is the model or the
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.680]  Obama health care plan so I was like look this sends a message of a real
[40:58.680 --> 41:03.240]  constitutional in the Fed or libertarian that we're not just gonna go after
[41:03.240 --> 41:10.120]  Democrats we're gonna go after neocon fake conservatives rhinos Republican in
[41:10.120 --> 41:13.440]  name only and that's what's happening all over the country and so that she made
[41:13.440 --> 41:19.280]  such a good showing and has made such a good showing that now people can learn
[41:19.280 --> 41:24.760]  from her mistakes in other states and can run for Congress and the State House
[41:24.760 --> 41:29.200]  and for the governorship and for mayor and for County Commissioner it doesn't
[41:29.200 --> 41:35.560]  matter whether it's the school board this is the way to take our country and
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.560]  our government back a big part of it as G. Eber griffin's talked about the long
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.880]  view of history but we can do this pretty quickly well it will have some
[41:45.880 --> 41:49.800]  victories will have some losses but she was gaining five points a week two weeks
[41:49.800 --> 41:53.680]  ago she was at 25 points about to eclipse Kay Bailey and she would be
[41:53.680 --> 41:59.800]  online then to be able to get right up to par with Perry going into a runoff
[41:59.800 --> 42:03.280]  and then if she continued to gay momentum she would win she would be the
[42:03.280 --> 42:11.760]  governor and then the real dirty tricks would start and a governor can't
[42:11.760 --> 42:18.040]  just wave a magic wand but the point is it'd be a great bully pulpit so she's
[42:18.040 --> 42:21.400]  now in the three polls I saw at 20 points and they said oh she didn't lose
[42:21.400 --> 42:25.360]  as much as we thought she would the problem is it made her lose the momentum
[42:25.360 --> 42:30.520]  she should have gained another 10 points on the growth curve she had in the
[42:30.520 --> 42:34.320]  last two weeks so she really lost about 15 points the 10 she would have gained
[42:34.320 --> 42:42.440]  and five she lost 15 but she may still make it into the runoff but everyone
[42:42.440 --> 42:48.520]  has had a victory in this regardless but at the same time we can't be like the
[42:48.520 --> 42:52.840]  Obama supporters when he said he'd get us out of the wars and wouldn't raise
[42:52.840 --> 42:59.080]  taxes on people making under 125,000 and wasn't gonna be involved in banker
[42:59.080 --> 43:01.800]  bailouts and wasn't gonna hire lobbyist and wasn't gonna have signing
[43:01.800 --> 43:05.320]  statements and wasn't gonna have torture and secret arrest and rendition and
[43:05.320 --> 43:09.760]  he's expanded all that and a lot of Democrats said well I don't care at
[43:09.760 --> 43:13.560]  least he's my guy I've invested in him see that's how the con game works you
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.360]  invest in someone you invest your time and energy it's like George Bush or
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.280]  anybody you invest in them and then you feel like you're part of a tribe or a
[43:21.280 --> 43:28.280]  clan or a group and so you can't go back now and then there's this lesser of two
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.880]  evils thing and you know I said well if you look at it from a lesser of two
[43:33.880 --> 43:37.000]  evils I guess Perry's better than Kay Bailey Hutchinson but I won't even
[43:37.000 --> 43:46.960]  vote if that's the case because it's a joke I won't be involved in that it's
[43:46.960 --> 43:50.720]  that idea of lesser of two evils that allows all this compromising but they
[43:50.720 --> 43:58.120]  never compromise we compromise and so that's what's so disturbing about the
[43:58.120 --> 44:03.680]  Debra Medina massive 180 flip-flop and then her campaign I had their Dallas
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.640]  campaign call me I had the Austin folks that Penny Langford the head of her
[44:08.640 --> 44:14.800]  campaign called and said why is Alex mad at us you know what why am you don't
[44:14.800 --> 44:20.280]  know why I mean I'm here explaining it to you but you can't even respond and
[44:20.280 --> 44:23.440]  then I've gotten literally hundreds of emails for people that called their
[44:23.440 --> 44:26.280]  campaign saying oh there'll be a statement today well we'll see if that
[44:26.280 --> 44:34.360]  happens I mean let's see a statement because I want to know am I gonna be the
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.760]  bad man or anybody else that questions if she was to become governor and then
[44:38.760 --> 44:44.720]  flip-flopped on issues if she'll do a 180 here is that what America's come to
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.240]  is you're not supposed to hold people's feet to the fire on what they've said
[44:48.240 --> 44:53.040]  they're going to do might as well just pack it all up and just give into the
[44:53.040 --> 44:59.120]  New World Order if that's the case now let's play Mark Davis here it is so my
[44:59.120 --> 45:01.840]  assertion is it would have been over by now would have been over in a day if
[45:01.840 --> 45:06.080]  after the back thing you'd have said boy I'm sorry I messed up I should have
[45:06.080 --> 45:10.360]  identified this 9-11 truth or movement as the despicable paranoid cult that they
[45:10.360 --> 45:13.720]  are what a horrible hateful belief to have in your head that 9-11 was an
[45:13.720 --> 45:19.120]  inside job why didn't you do that yeah I am I agree with you mark you know I'd
[45:19.120 --> 45:23.120]  laughed it off whenever he he said I was the truth or cuz I thought it was so
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.560]  absurd and I and I I should have just said no absolutely I'm not a truth or
[45:28.560 --> 45:33.760]  I think it's abundantly clear I'm not a truth or you know those those things
[45:33.760 --> 45:39.280]  happen to us and we pick up say should have done that better move on and that's
[45:39.280 --> 45:42.120]  what we've done then there's just one other thing that's left because not
[45:42.120 --> 45:45.480]  being a true there is great I think and of course you're not of course you're
[45:45.480 --> 45:50.120]  not but sometimes that the wisdom is defined by knowing whom to praise and
[45:50.120 --> 45:55.880]  whom to quite frankly condemn it was someone walking around with see she
[45:55.880 --> 46:01.480]  grovels she rolls over and then he comes at her and says you basically don't have
[46:01.480 --> 46:05.200]  the wisdom to be governor that's what he's saying so he's still attacked because
[46:05.200 --> 46:08.880]  he wants Rick Perry who'll give him all the power plants and it will give him
[46:08.880 --> 46:16.040]  all the roads lady see he's not your friend this isn't like cozying up to
[46:16.040 --> 46:18.840]  somebody you know at the hospital where you work and being friends with him in
[46:18.840 --> 46:23.200]  the coffee room this guy's a slick evil operative listen to a slimy voice here
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.120]  he is going after and here she gets even worse listen the belief that America
[46:27.120 --> 46:29.920]  would do this to its own people the president bush and those around him
[46:29.920 --> 46:35.040]  would slaughter our own citizens in order to justify war is a despicable thing
[46:35.040 --> 46:39.120]  to break and and if that's it you want to be on record is agreeing with that agreed
[46:39.120 --> 46:46.280]  yeah I'm I I was thinking in terms of a commission report not in terms of what
[46:46.280 --> 46:52.000]  you know individuals are out there doing and okay the commission okay so it goes
[46:52.000 --> 46:58.920]  on and on the point here is that Ron Paul has said that the government wanted
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.760]  to stage a gulf of Tonkin and later it was declassified the chain he was
[47:02.760 --> 47:06.800]  planning that three years ago to go to war and they lied about WMDs to go to
[47:06.800 --> 47:10.560]  war I mean is everybody that knows they lied about WMDs that's admitted are we
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.840]  despicable I mean we despicable to talk about the declassified fact the gulf of
[47:14.840 --> 47:20.960]  Tonkin was staged are we despicable to read Operation Northwoods or the new
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.840]  State Department memorandum that came out last week or the government wanted to
[47:24.840 --> 47:29.640]  stage terror attacks against their own embassies to blame it on Honduras
[47:29.640 --> 47:39.720]  this is despicable now this is what she said on Houston channel ABC 13 okay this
[47:39.720 --> 47:47.920]  is unedited footage of her two days after going back here it is I think had
[47:47.920 --> 47:53.000]  the question been do you think Muslim terrorists flew planes into buildings in
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.960]  the United States I would have said absolutely I believe that right do you
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.280]  believe our government had anything to do with those terrorists flying I was
[48:00.280 --> 48:06.080]  said no I don't I don't think that they do I think the question that I heard was
[48:06.080 --> 48:10.480]  in England someone who is really championed people questioning government
[48:10.480 --> 48:14.440]  and asking question government am I going to dissociate myself from people who
[48:14.440 --> 48:20.200]  question government no I think that's healthy I think it's responsible we
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.560]  ought to be holding officials accountable we ought to be asking hard tough
[48:24.560 --> 48:28.560]  questions it's one of the things I've been critical of Governor Perry on in
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.240]  particular in the Willingham case where I said we can't be afraid of the
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.800]  evidence people need to be asking those hard questions and then cue it up it's
[48:36.800 --> 48:40.240]  a long like 12 minute interview cue it up to where she then talks about how the
[48:40.240 --> 48:52.280]  buildings fell the issue here is she said that it's healthy it's good it's our
[48:52.280 --> 49:00.360]  right that she will not disassociate herself from us and I'm like man this
[49:00.360 --> 49:06.680]  lady's really great but then she totally flip-flops and says yes I totally
[49:06.680 --> 49:16.160]  agree it's despicable I mean you may think it's cute to have somebody pledge
[49:16.160 --> 49:20.520]  something to you and then totally flip-flop and I've had a few emails I've
[49:20.520 --> 49:26.360]  gotten of the very few that that agree with Medina on this they say look let's
[49:26.360 --> 49:33.040]  just get her into office you know we've got a win we've got to save Texas how
[49:33.040 --> 49:37.880]  do you save Texas putting somebody in that if the wind blows against them they
[49:37.880 --> 49:45.960]  roll over how do you do that I mean all I've got is my morals all I've got is
[49:45.960 --> 49:52.120]  that I don't compromise you understand that finish the club okay but you're not
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.760]  we're not parsing words here do you believe the government has some other
[49:54.760 --> 49:59.960]  involvement in what happened that day or in the lead-up to it I I don't believe
[49:59.960 --> 50:08.800]  they had anything in the lead-up to it okay I think the questions that I've
[50:08.800 --> 50:15.000]  heard asked her how those buildings fell right and I don't I don't I'm not the
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.360]  engineer to know that and I think those are good relevant questions to ask
[50:18.360 --> 50:22.240]  that's not that's not saying our government was involved I don't know
[50:22.240 --> 50:24.920]  that I think our government was involved I think they're questions that need to
[50:24.920 --> 50:29.520]  be asked how much you've thought about that before today not much okay yeah not
[50:29.520 --> 50:34.560]  okay so there there you go I mean what she just said according to her new
[50:34.560 --> 50:42.120]  definition is despicable it's despicable I'm despicable that Deborah Medina is
[50:42.120 --> 50:49.000]  despicable according to the new Debra Medina so who's the real Debra Medina
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.280]  we'll see now and it looks like her campaign so far just says hey you know
[50:56.280 --> 51:02.600]  11 truthers we got your campaign money shut up for safety you locked doors set
[51:02.600 --> 51:07.000]  alarms by antivirus software maybe even have a watchdog do you care as much

[51:41.360 --> 51:44.600]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[51:44.600 --> 51:47.520]  the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi Ted Anderson I'm
[51:47.520 --> 51:51.080]  placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system call for
[51:51.080 --> 51:55.520]  your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to understand the system call
[51:55.520 --> 52:03.840]  800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237. Hundreds of nations have fallen to
[52:03.840 --> 52:09.080]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[52:09.080 --> 52:13.200]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.240]  Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and
[52:18.240 --> 52:23.040]  they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[52:23.040 --> 52:28.080]  American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[52:28.080 --> 52:33.160]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[52:33.160 --> 52:37.280]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're
[52:37.280 --> 52:41.320]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make

[54:09.880 --> 54:15.120]  Oh it just gets worse by the minute. They just found video of her to glen back 912
[54:15.120 --> 54:21.280]  events, signing the 912 statement to bring us back to that moment of 912. We're
[54:21.280 --> 54:24.240]  ready to nuke everyone and go to war and give up our liberties. That's what it
[54:24.240 --> 54:31.640]  tries to re-invoke. It looks like political chameleon behavior. Oh but
[54:31.640 --> 54:34.960]  that's what you do to win. No, that's not what people want. People want something
[54:34.960 --> 54:40.280]  like Ron Paul, where if he says it, he sticks with it. Your calls are coming up
[54:40.280 --> 54:43.880]  for the next three hours of the radio show. Everybody that's patiently holding
[54:43.880 --> 54:46.720]  and I'm going to give each caller about one minute so we get to the next person.
[54:46.720 --> 54:56.680]  1-800-259-9231. It makes me sick having to do this but it made me sick going on
[54:56.680 --> 54:59.640]  air on the morning of 9-11 and saying it was an inside job and they blow the
[54:59.640 --> 55:07.440]  buildings up because it's painful to go against the grain sometimes. But in the
[55:07.440 --> 55:12.320]  end, it's what's healthy and it's what's good. It was painful. I wasn't stupid. I
[55:12.320 --> 55:15.480]  knew that most of the radio stations I was on were going to turn me off and
[55:15.480 --> 55:19.760]  sure enough they did at the time. But see, I'm not here just to be on radio
[55:19.760 --> 55:23.680]  stations and be a big shot. I'm here to change history. I'm here to fight
[55:23.680 --> 55:27.560]  tyranny. Yeah, that sounded kooky 14 years ago to say they were secretly
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.880]  taking your baby's blood at birth. Yeah, it was unpopular when Obama had an 84
[55:31.880 --> 55:35.360]  percent approval rating to come out and say it was all a fraud and a lie but I
[55:35.360 --> 55:38.360]  knew who his advisors were and what he promised he was really going to do to
[55:38.360 --> 55:44.520]  the think tanks. Yeah, it was tough in 2002 to say that it was a lie about
[55:44.520 --> 55:49.200]  WMDs when polls showed over 80 percent of people believe a lie but now I'm right
[55:49.200 --> 55:55.000]  again. And so that's just the way it is. I don't think people shouldn't vote for
[55:55.000 --> 56:02.680]  Deborah Medina but if you want to do a lesser, lesser weevil as they say in
[56:02.680 --> 56:10.320]  Master and Commander, go ahead. I just get a dirty feeling supporting something
[56:10.320 --> 56:18.520]  that is so duplicitous. So duplicitous. Now, if Deborah came out and said,
[56:18.520 --> 56:21.600]  look, some people advised me to do this because somebody's advised me to make
[56:21.600 --> 56:28.880]  this change. But no, it's just this is the way it is and this is what we're
[56:28.880 --> 56:35.360]  going to do. And I mean, they've got it queued up right now. Deborah Medina and
[56:35.360 --> 56:40.480]  Glenn Beck 912 project and they got it queued up to her right now. It's just
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.720]  I don't even want to play this. I don't even want to. I can't handle it.
[56:44.720 --> 56:51.760]  Groveling up to Glenn Beck when he sabotaged her. But hey, if she thinks
[56:51.760 --> 56:55.200]  that's going to get her in the governor's mansion and then we're going to get
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.600]  all this freedom in Texas, really, this is a political test. You've just seen the
[57:00.600 --> 57:07.880]  first time she runs into any opposition. She turns against us. Oh, and she sure
[57:07.880 --> 57:13.480]  got a comment out that an hour being on back clarifying, but you're not seeing
[57:13.480 --> 57:19.440]  that. Are you though? Listeners say when they call, they pacify. Oh, oh, don't
[57:19.440 --> 57:22.400]  worry. There's going to be a statement. Oh, no, no, we we didn't mean that. We
[57:22.400 --> 57:25.440]  we, we, oh, oh, everything's okay.
[57:29.840 --> 57:35.600]  Glenn Beck is going to save us. Yes, with his value added tax and he believes in
[57:35.600 --> 57:39.640]  global warming. Then I have Glenn Beck listeners send me emails going, I don't
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.360]  believe he said that. Where's your proof? Hey, lazy butt. Go find all the video
[57:43.360 --> 57:49.720]  clips and news articles. USA Today, last weekend edition was on newsstands for
[57:49.720 --> 57:55.880]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Got a spoon. Feed you everything here. I want your
[57:55.880 --> 57:59.360]  proof. They're taking baby's blood. We'll get up off your butt. We've probably
[57:59.360 --> 58:03.760]  written 50 articles over the years posted the actual documents, probably done
[58:03.760 --> 58:08.800]  200, 300 radio shows on it. I want the proof. I'm still getting emails. I want
[58:08.800 --> 58:12.360]  the proof. They're taking the baby's blood and giving it to the Pentagon. Well,
[58:12.360 --> 58:20.160]  you don't know how to read yesterday's newspaper. Okay, the statesman. I want
[58:20.160 --> 58:27.080]  the proof. Medina said that on that show. That's not her. I want the proof.
[58:27.080 --> 58:31.520]  Obama's continuing torture. I want the proof. He's doing signing statements. I
[58:31.520 --> 58:37.200]  want the proof. You just don't like him because he's black. On and on and on.
[58:37.200 --> 58:45.600]  No, I just tell the truth. Get used to it. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure
[58:45.600 --> 58:52.320]  to visit GCNLive.com today. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[58:52.320 --> 58:56.200]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[58:56.200 --> 59:00.200]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new
[59:00.200 --> 59:04.080]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[59:04.080 --> 59:08.320]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of
[59:08.320 --> 59:12.760]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the
[59:12.760 --> 59:17.520]  power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.520 --> 59:21.280]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.280 --> 59:25.000]  local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.360]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.360 --> 59:32.520]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[59:32.520 --> 59:36.080]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You
[59:36.080 --> 59:41.680]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[59:41.680 --> 59:46.400]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[59:51.320 --> 1:00:01.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:12.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:19.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:23.240]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:34.160]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. Hour number two. I have a ton of news,
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:38.080]  including the latest on the kamikaze attack in Austin. More and more evidence
[1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:43.200]  points towards inside job. We're gonna get into the EPA to regulate CO2,
[1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:48.400]  regardless, and now they're gonna implement it. I've got just massive
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:51.960]  stacks of important news, but I want to take nothing but calls this hour, because
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.280]  the calls are news. They take us in different directions, bring up different
[1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:59.480]  news items that I may have seen or not seen, wouldn't even have been planning
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:04.440]  to cover. It's very informative. Let's go to the Genesis phone lines first. Jake
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:08.960]  in Oklahoma, you're first up, sir. Hey Alex, thanks for having me on. First time
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:13.360]  caller, but been listening to you for a long time. Definitely support you
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:18.200]  wholeheartedly. Also a very big supporter of 9-11 Truth and have been for a
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:21.440]  couple years now. I want to tell you, I just recently called the campaign for
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:25.680]  Medina, and I got through to a volunteer, very hard to get through, but I called to
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:29.600]  discuss or express my disgust with her, and then just distrust now that she has
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:35.000]  flip-flopped on the 9-11 Truth or Movement. And basically, you know, their
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.960]  response, it was just a volunteer, but they suggested that the media has
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:42.880]  manipulated her words. They wouldn't say that it was Medina's official
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:46.040]  position, because I tried to pin him down on that, but they asked, you know, have
[1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:51.080]  you considered that, you know, those are, you know, that that's not exactly how,
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:54.880]  you know, it went down live or whatever. Yeah, we've gotten emails like that saying,
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:59.040]  how dare you edit this? We haven't edited anything. Now I may have to write big
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:03.200]  official articles and detail it all. I mean, this is, there's a, what is it,
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:08.840]  12 minute interview or 11 and a half minute interview from KTRKTV Houston and
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:15.160]  a bunch of others unedited with her sitting there saying the towers fell in
[1:02:15.160 --> 1:02:20.400]  a funny way. I think, you know, it's great that people have questions, you know,
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:27.080]  it's good, it's healthy, and now it's despicable and a cult. And oh, so now, now
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:33.320]  we're lying. See, it's all a big Alex Jones hoax. Oh, I see. Or maybe she's
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:36.080]  suggesting Mark Davis has manipulated her tape. I don't know that they wouldn't
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:40.400]  She was live on there. Yeah, I know it. I know it. And but basically, my idea is
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:43.360]  that she needs to come out and have a press release to completely clarify her
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:47.640]  true and a complete position on this 911 truth deal and whether or not, you know,
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:50.600]  she agrees that the individuals have a right to question the government.
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:53.760]  Well, do you know what's going to happen? I mean, I mean, look, let's say she
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:56.280]  started getting up in the polls again. They don't want to give her the
[1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:01.200]  attention now. They've already done their dirty work. Okay. Doesn't look good.
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:08.400]  The point is, is that all they got to do is get all these TV news clips and
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:12.400]  speeches after the Glenn Beck thing, where she defends 911 truth and then cut
[1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:17.360]  it in with with Mark Davis and they'll go look at her. She's too faced. I mean,
[1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:22.760]  these are very politically astute people. Carl Roe is on the job. And you know,
[1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:25.560]  she said on the Mark Davis program that she was thinking in terms of a
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:29.480]  commission report, but not the individuals out there asking questions. So that
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:36.840]  also to me is just she specifically says the individuals are despicable. She
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:40.920]  said, well, you know, I said to Glenn Beck that, you know, there's some questions
[1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:43.640]  that need to be asked. She was thinking in terms of the commission report, but
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:46.120]  not the individuals out there asking questions. But to me, that's just
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:49.800]  completely erroneous and I'll analyze, you know, because before, well, I mean,
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:53.360]  wait a minute, just a week and a half before that, after the Beck thing,
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:57.600]  she's saying, oh, this is very healthy. This is very good. This is, yeah, the
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:01.720]  buildings fell very strange. Oh, so I mean, is she saying that Deborah
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:05.200]  Medina is despicable? But maybe I'm not supposed to point this out. I'm just
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:09.240]  supposed to say, oh, yes, I give you my support no matter what. Like I'm an
[1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:14.800]  Obama supporter. Yes. Oh, whatever you say, a lot of people online saying that
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:17.360]  type of stuff, you know, hey, you know, she can't just come out and say she's not
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:19.240]  on the truth. I don't, you know, it's like you said, we don't care if she's a
[1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:22.680]  9-11 truth or but if she supports an individual's right to question their
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:26.960]  government and petition for a redress of grievances, then that's what we're
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:31.280]  looking for. You know, mainly that's not even the main issue for me. It's that she
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:34.760]  says one thing to one audience, another than other audience. I mean, that's what
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:39.200]  we're trying to get away from here. Exactly. So you have to stay away from the
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:42.640]  politicians like that, because like you said, they just blow with the wind. So
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:47.240]  and we can't trust that at this juncture. Well, it's a good lesson for other
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:51.160]  people running at the state level. Texas is only one battle. And the fact that she
[1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:54.680]  got so much support and is getting so much support is a victory. And I don't
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:58.120]  think she's a bad person. I just think she's turning into a politician. And it's
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:03.720]  my right as a voter and a Texan to talk about it. Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:07.560]  I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure
[1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:11.280]  and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the
[1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:16.160]  bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:20.160]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver
[1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:24.760]  Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:30.040]  silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the
[1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:34.320]  bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:39.040]  products. You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:43.360]  Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow. Step by step instructions are

[1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:05.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:10.240]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:13.840]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:18.680]  I've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress and they really
[1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:23.480]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:27.840]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:33.120]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.400]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists
[1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:40.920]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:46.160]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:51.120]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on

[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:38.760]  big fan I'm a little nervous this is Dan from we are change each base in
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:43.680]  Francisco California well I have one point and one question regarding the
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:47.320]  stage guide in a press conference I don't know why your guys told the guard
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:51.680]  there with info wars I mean they got it you know you guys have a huge target on
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:55.840]  your back what they should have done was just say like WXRK radio or whatever
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:02.200]  your call letters are well it was I mean look we don't lie I mean sometimes to
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:07.240]  infiltrate something we'll associate ourselves with say an affiliate that
[1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:13.480]  we're actually on so it's the truth we did that at the RNC in 2004 used an
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:17.160]  affiliates credentials but we actually got them from the affiliate and look
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:24.360]  it's a free country it's a was advertised as a public press conference and so
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:31.000]  they came up and questioned our guys and said no but I mean maybe in hindsight we
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.520]  should have said we were with it one of our affiliates go ahead okay no I was
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:37.840]  just wondering if they actually did try we heard the recording where he said
[1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:41.280]  info war Jason Burma said info wars I was wondering if the other guys who did
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:46.800]  get in did they just give the call letters or what they do they didn't
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:52.760]  really question the other guys because I had them go in and waves 30 minutes
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:56.400]  behind each other they got there a little bit early but anything else sir oh
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:00.440]  yeah no I just had a quick question your operations seem to have an amazing
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:04.120]  effect you know in this war against tyranny I was wondering um you know you're in
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:07.600]  Texas you don't have a whole lot of live guests they're mostly off telephone
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:10.920]  guests have you ever thought of relocating to Washington or New York
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:15.080]  where the you could be right there at ground zero you know in the fight I'm a
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:20.240]  Texan number one my family's here they've been here since this was Mexico on
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:26.280]  both sides of my family and I mean I'm not bragging but everybody's into their
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:31.280]  you know their Texaness you can't get any more Texan and I'm just a Texan and I
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:36.680]  love my state I love Austin plus I would have to have an operation probably
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:41.360]  half the size of this one because of the cost of a Washington DC and New York or
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:48.360]  even a Los Angeles the cost is just for for electrical power for your rent
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:54.280]  space all the state taxes that are involved instead of having 25 people
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:59.160]  total in our team we end up having probably 10 or 12 so it's a money issue
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:07.240]  too I appreciate your call Dan let's talk to Henry in Canada Henry you're on

[1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:41.640]  Hington baby yeah first off Deborah Mundy on 9-11 truth or non-controversy
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:47.480]  Sarah Palin calls for a new investigation on tape get them if Perry can
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:52.160]  have crack teams of internet first responders so could we well we sent
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:57.040]  that information to Medina and said all I said is what Sarah Palin said and if
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:01.280]  she played the clip that would have all been over but again I know nothing
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:05.800]  politically info wars.com prison planet.com my radio show number one
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:13.080]  alternative media outlet in the world fighting the new world order and it
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:16.480]  looks like they're getting their advice from a homeless person or something I
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:23.600]  don't know I appreciate your call and I don't know what to say that's great let's
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:28.720]  go ahead and take another call here let's talk to Jack in New Mexico Jack
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:32.640]  you're on the air Alex thank you for taking my call you are a true
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:37.680]  inspiration on info wars.com I read an article about the Arizona speed
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:44.280]  cameras and citing a mini-revolt there is an analogous issue which is a huge
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:48.120]  problem here and all across the country which is known as carbooting or tire
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:51.800]  clamping by private companies that's when you park in a private lot if you
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:56.320]  don't do the toolbox some parking lot attendant rather than warning you hey I'm
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:59.720]  gonna you didn't pay they'll wait till you leave and then they'll put the big
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:03.120]  metal thing on your car and they won't release it to you given like $50 to
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:08.600]  $100 in cash no paper trail now the issue here as with your red as with the
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:12.480]  red light tickets is that there's a lack of due process it's an unlawful
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:15.920]  seizure of your property and then of course the law shouldn't allow one
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:20.920]  person to punish another that's right literally hundreds of cases in federal
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:24.680]  and state court ruling the red light cameras are illegal because a private
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:29.280]  defense contractor company I mean take Texas the company doing it in Texas in
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:33.480]  Austin and Dallas and Houston doesn't even have the license they're supposed
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:38.840]  to and it's that was in the Dallas morning news it's just lawlessness and
[1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:43.920]  it's also going to take the police out of business as these private systems are
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:47.800]  put in without due process and you're absolutely right and there is a revolt
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:51.080]  against the speed cameras they're being bashed out they're being spray painted
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:54.200]  they're being stickered they're being having boxes put over them and the
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:58.720]  people are sick of it and that's what happened to me was um I am you know
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:03.120]  Thomas Jefferson said resistance to tyrants is obedience to God I knew what
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:07.200]  this was and I actually cut the boot off my car and I've been fighting it in the
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:11.520]  courts ever since because I know my rights and I'm fighting it back in fact
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:16.840]  that's right they put something on your property exactly and they demand cash and
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:22.080]  they hold your vehicle well these guys here it's a form of free-booting it's a
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:26.600]  form of piracy it's actually it has been criminalized and ruled as
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:31.640]  extortion and theft in Scotland on Seattle it's a big problem there in
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:35.400]  Dallas I know that for sure I've talked to people in Dallas I happen to have the
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:40.560]  largest collection of articles on the subject at fighttheboot.com I want to
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:43.640]  thank you for addressing this and talking about it with me Alex thank you
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:50.200]  Jack good to hear from you Angelica in Tejas you're on the air hi I'm calling
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:56.720]  from one of the border towns down here in Texas and I'm kind of concerned
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:02.320]  because I don't know if there's like a possible fall flag attempt being
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:08.520]  orchestrated here reason I'm saying is because I have an article here that says
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:14.440]  plan of action for border violence and we've been hearing stories from the
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:22.760]  other side of how they're beefing up the the federalists up there the the Mexican
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:28.360]  Army and people are scared and they're telling us you know whatever whatever
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:33.240]  it goes on don't make any attempts to come over here yet it's being whitewashed
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:41.760]  on local news and let me break it down a year ago Rick Perry an internal memo
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:45.600]  came out that martial law has been quietly covertly
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:51.160]  planned Estine declaration of martial law on the Texas border rocket attacks
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:55.280]  houses burning murders police being killed Mexican troops coming across
[1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:59.800]  robbing sheriffs I've had them on we're three miles across the border you know
[1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:03.080]  they grab a truckload of drugs and they and the Mexican military comes across
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.680]  puts guns to the police heads the sheriff's department and nothing's done
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:11.840]  it's hardly even in the local papers versus the national and so they have
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:14.920]  been moving troops down there and I've got an LA Times similar thing in
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:20.800]  California they are searching citizens the BATF's doing door-to-door knock and
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:24.320]  talks asking if they can come in and see your legal guns they're harassing
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:29.760]  citizens but then leaving the illegals alone Mexico in the last year basically
[1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:34.360]  this has even been in mainstream news has collapsed the country is under martial
[1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:42.080]  law it's total battle I mean what is it hundreds of murders a week and absolutely
[1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:46.800]  you are under martial law down there there's a pseudo cops here too and it's
[1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:52.920]  being blamed on the cartels if you go into cities like Alton where it's more
[1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:58.760]  rural you can see like these unmarked vehicles and these people are wearing
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:04.840]  like the black kind of ski mask and you know this is from first not from really
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:10.320]  first-hand accounts but from peers at school that I guess ma'am it is total
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:14.920]  lawlessness as you know and my cousin went down to the border he had been down
[1:17:14.920 --> 1:17:18.880]  there since college you down to the Texas Mexico border and he went into some
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:22.320]  of the towns because my cousin grew up in Guatemala so he speaks great Spanish
[1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:25.160]  he went down there with some of his Hispanic friends from Austin that wanted
[1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:29.680]  to visit family down there and he said almost everything's boarded up on the
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:34.720]  Mexican side there's hardly any tourism now in places like Brownsville and other
[1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:40.600]  places I mean is that what you're saying yeah I mean I saw there's a banner up you
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:45.240]  know in Spanish that says nothing has happened nothing will happen it's
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:51.240]  absolutely safe but yet people that live in Drainosa are actually seeing the
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:57.160]  opposite and you know the the sheriff's department here and customs and border
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:01.080]  are saying oh it's unfortunate but we're ready for anything and we'll do
[1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:05.360]  whatever we have to do if it comes down to this site yeah well they're talking
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:09.680]  about is Mexico completely collapsing and millions running north and I
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:15.600]  appreciate your call what's happened is six years ago the Pentagon began giving
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:22.560]  tens of billions a year it's different every year Obama last year what proposed
[1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:26.640]  a hundred and forty something billion to quote fight the war on drugs you know
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:30.320]  what's happening is you've got a real war down there over the five hundred
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:33.240]  billion dollars of narcotics and other drugs that come across the Mexican
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:39.240]  border into the southwestern United States and so you've got CIA backed Los
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:45.320]  Zetas and others trained and the police trained and they're fighting with other
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:49.640]  drug cartels cowboys that have become so powerful they're actually giving them a
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:54.360]  run for their money so it's lawless warlordville all because of the drug
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:19:00.640]  war I don't like drugs I mean I know they're all basically bad one way or
[1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:05.200]  another because any of them can be abused marijuana alcohol you name it but
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:10.880]  the point is you must decriminalize them or it will empower the criminal element
[1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:14.480]  over the years to where they become so powerful they take over your whole
[1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:19.480]  society China fell to the British the British shipped in drugs over 50 years
[1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:23.200]  paid off all the officials in every city took it over broke it up in 12 pieces
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:28.000]  or 11 pieces drugs are being used to break down Mexico to break down this
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:34.880]  country narco terrorism and the more you do the more you decriminalize the less
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.880]  crime the more you make it illegal the more you enforce to hire the price the
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:44.000]  more money the more crime it's simple economics supply and demand the free
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:48.040]  market and the establishment knows this and that's why they desperately want to
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:52.480]  keep drugs illegal that's what the Mexican government is now so they won't
[1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:56.440]  collapse tried to make small amounts of even cocaine and heroin legal because
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:20:02.160]  their society is completely collapsing because of it we all know that the

[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:02.840]  your real estate connection hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:06.200]  familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:10.040]  spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that
[1:22:10.040 --> 1:22:13.600]  some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:17.240]  remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small
[1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:20.920]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:24.320]  spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:28.560]  deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:32.480]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:36.280]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:40.240]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:44.120]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:48.240]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been
[1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:53.200]  driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:15.480]  info coming up the next hour also open phones Linda in Texas thanks for
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:20.760]  holding her on the air thank you Alex I agree with you about Deborah Medina I
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.640]  think she's being driven by fear and I've supported people like Cynthia McKinney
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:30.400]  and Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul who are not afraid to ask the questions but on a
[1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:37.080]  more important issue in my neighborhood is the whole issue of fluoride and I'm
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:42.920]  calling on behalf of fluoride free Austin and tomorrow at City Council two of
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:48.040]  us are going to be speaking on this issue of fluoride which I know you've been
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:53.880]  fighting for decades and you've been our inspiration to stop adding fluoride
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:25:00.120]  waste to our water so I urge everybody in the Austin listening area to go down
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:05.680]  to City Hall tomorrow parking is free at first in La Baca and just stand with us
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:12.280]  in solidarity as we speak going on over a year against the fluoride in our water
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:17.440]  and while the media has been ignoring us we've made a little bit of headway and
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:25.160]  if we had 200 people show up it would be a fluoride free Austin tea party and
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:31.600]  that's what we need and we've made up tell folks what time it is the City
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:35.840]  Council starts at noon people should be there at about quarter of 12 because they
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:42.640]  start on time and I'm the first one to speak and other people sign up to speak
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:49.400]  well go to our website fluoride free Austin comm and also go to your City
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:53.800]  Council website look in your phone book and by the way I know Linda you're the
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:59.280]  lady we've had in studio before yes and we really appreciate we fluoride free
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:03.320]  Austin wouldn't be here were it not for your inspiration Alex listen I mean my
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:06.680]  friend to show up well thank you for thanking me but I'm just trying to get
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:10.160]  poison out of our water you know I think you want to deliver to the City Council
[1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:14.600]  all the news articles in the US when they feed horses and cows and pigs
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.520]  fluoride water they start dying and Australia the kangaroos are dying when
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:23.240]  they give them fluoride water I mean this is such a joke that we can't even get
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:27.000]  this out of our water and they take our baby's blood illegally at birth and
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.800]  they're watching us with spy cams on our kids computers and they just admit it
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:35.800]  all it's lawless it's a joke it's a toxic waste it doesn't help our teeth get it
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:39.680]  out of the water Linda good to hear from you let's talk to Carolyn in mass
[1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:45.920]  Carolyn you're on the air go ahead yes good afternoon I'm the first time caller
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:51.440]  welcome I'm really excited about being on the show I am I I agree that ever
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:57.840]  Medina I think that it's a situation where she either feels threatened maybe
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:02.080]  someone's blackmailing her because no one does a 180 unless like that unless
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:06.080]  something's up I don't think it's normal especially someone intelligent like
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:11.640]  everybody yeah that's my point it's not normal I'm upset about it and I want a
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:16.920]  response to it you know not that we're editing the tapes or or baloney like
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:21.120]  that I mean I want a response okay she said what she said she did what she did
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:25.160]  and you know we need to be upset about this we don't just sign on to a
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:29.000]  politician and then not get angry when they flip-flop and this is a big flip-flop
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.280]  and I'm upset and everybody I mean literally 99% of the calls and emails
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:38.520]  are upset go ahead I think the another reason why is because she did it with
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:42.760]  such a vengeance that it was like to make sure whoever it was that was
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:48.000]  threatening her could see that she unequivocally flip-flop well I think the
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  threat is she wants to win I don't I mean I mean I don't think she's being
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.560]  threatened I mean Glenn Beck came after set her up and she did the right thing
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:28:01.720]  and stuck to her guns and then flip-flopped and that's bad because if
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:07.080]  she'll do it on that she'll do it again at least we need to hear from her and
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:11.680]  say look you admit she did a flip-flop and explain it or something but no no
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.520]  we're just that little 9-11 truth crew you know 84% of the country in the
[1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:19.600]  Anguson read New York Times poll the lowest polls 36% you know we're just
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:24.680]  36% bare minimum and you know we can just you know we ought to just shut up for
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:27.720]  the betterment and get her elected we ought to just compromise that's what we
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:35.240]  ought to do anything else yes but the when Geithner had that hearing with the
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:40.160]  Senate that the Congress yes they should have arrested him on the spot and I
[1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:44.920]  think that those that didn't arrest him on the spot they had the power to do so
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:47.920]  they should be charged with aiding in a vetting for allowing him to get away with
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:51.840]  it well I appreciate your calling be specific with the law who should be
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:29:00.080]  arrested via congressional warrant is Carl Rove he was given a congressional
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:04.400]  subpoena it's a felony to not go to that and he just ignored it and they set
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:10.160]  the precedent with that what we need is grand juries at the state level to
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:15.840]  indict Geithner and others and Paulson and folks I risk my life saying that you
[1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:18.920]  understand that that's why I'm in the gun sites the New World Order I mean I'm
[1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:23.200]  telling you who the direct enemy is and that they're criminals okay we're not
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:27.600]  playing patty cake here I'm not risking my life with this radio show in my
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:33.800]  films and websites to compromise and patty cake people okay not a game of

[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:07.000]  to start proving my case with medina i could do it i don't think she's a bad
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:11.080]  lady but i think she's been naive and that's going to be one of the problems
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:15.440]  having people that aren't initiated to real politics to understand what's going
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:17.440]  on
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:20.960]  that's why we're talking during the break well how does she fix it i think
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:23.920]  that's up to deborah medina i don't know what she does
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:27.640]  i mean does she come out and clarify herself and with all that vitriol and
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:30.920]  enjoyment relish the way she agreed that we're a bunch of
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:34.240]  you know crazy cult members dangerous uh...
[1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:37.040]  and in previous videos oh well you know
[1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:39.800]  what's the quote we're healthy we're good
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:43.080]  the towers fell in a strange way and then now it's this
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:44.520]  i mean she did it
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:45.800]  she did it
[1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:48.800]  and it's like what we got to get rick perry
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:52.120]  i mean a lot of people fell for this i i i love dr paul craig roberts you know i
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:56.600]  love my river of they got behind obama
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:00.720]  well bush was so bad and i'm going out but the same advisors
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:04.160]  and the same chicago business school in harvard and then he's going to do the
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.360]  same thing and and we got to get past presidents and realize it's the banks
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:11.640]  yeah but we've got to repudiate the republicans i'm not saying vote for
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:12.640]  mccain either
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:13.960]  we have to admit
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:18.080]  that the system controls both candidates at the presidential level and then now
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:22.000]  uh... you're later it's yeah i wish you were right
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.940]  uh...
[1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:27.360]  can you imagine if deborah medina got in his governor and then started flip
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:28.780]  flopping on guns
[1:35:28.780 --> 1:35:29.960]  on the border

[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:35.640]  i mean if they created scandals or some concealed carry person killed her
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:38.760]  wife or something and they said what are you going to do governor they did
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:41.040]  this you're going to go ahead and restrict guns i mean
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:42.240]  uh... you you
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:46.160]  you're going to get impeached if you don't
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.960]  or some minute man shot at illegal alien on the border
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:51.760]  are you going to pull the net the state guard off the border what are you going
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:52.840]  to do but you know
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:59.840]  what are you going to go okay i will
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:02.520]  that's why i like ron paul
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:09.080]  he's the same yesterday today tomorrow
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:12.720]  again if you say what you're for and stick with it you're good i mean i don't
[1:36:12.720 --> 1:36:15.620]  really particularly like it that ran paul
[1:36:15.620 --> 1:36:17.800]  running for senate has a good chance of winning
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:20.960]  says well he might be for you know new wars with iran or something if they
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:23.800]  threaten us threaten us it's all staged
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:27.000]  but at least he says he wants to slash taxes control the border
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  defend the second amendment and i believe him
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.320]  he's been the same from the start
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:35.560]  doesn't somebody doesn't have to be absolutely perfect as long as they're a
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:37.600]  lot better than the other candidates
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:40.400]  as long as you know they're gonna stick with what they're going to do
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:45.500]  now i i mean that's a big difference from his dad though
[1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:48.680]  peter shifts come out and said similar things about war
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:51.440]  and you know i've been forced to criticize that
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:54.400]  um... and he noticed that some of the big republican party now are behind him
[1:36:54.400 --> 1:36:58.240]  in rand and
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:00.900]  i wish they were chips off the old block
[1:37:00.900 --> 1:37:04.720]  so this isn't about her not being a full board nine eleven truth or
[1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:07.840]  it's about her changing what she said completely
[1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:10.080]  and then not responding
[1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:13.380]  and then her campaign calling up people in the austin campaign
[1:37:13.380 --> 1:37:15.600]  hitting langford
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:18.200]  and sand
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:21.160]  uh... will always out looks mad at us and then
[1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:25.040]  making up reasons they think i'm mad i'm mad for what she said got it
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:28.160]  but no you won't address that you won't
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:33.240]  well maybe they will but they haven't so far
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:34.560]  we are about
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:36.960]  instead fast here
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:38.640]  okay let's start going well you
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:40.780]  before i do that here is deborah medina
[1:37:40.780 --> 1:37:45.440]  at glenbeck's nine twelve projects for an allegiance to glenbeck's twelve things
[1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:49.320]  uh... to launch all these new wars and to reinvoke the feeling of the day after
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:52.120]  nine eleven when people roll in her mind control
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:55.080]  oh yes that's just wonderful
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.560]  and notice she did this
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:37:59.600]  in november fourth of last year
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:02.040]  it's just surfaced a week ago on the internet
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:04.000]  february eighteenth
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.040]  so i got five hundred fifty five
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:07.280]  views
[1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:10.280]  videos called ever madina glenbeck's nine twelve project
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:13.000]  contract and she swore allegiance to glenbeck
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.080]  and then he slid her throat on the air
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:21.000]  let's go ahead and play that
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.080]  i don't really know that's my sacred honor
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:28.800]  to representing my constituents by upholding these principles and values
[1:38:28.800 --> 1:38:31.480]  nine principles are america's good
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:34.760]  i believe in god he is the center of my life
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:38.720]  i must always try to be a more honest person than i was yesterday
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:40.320]  the family is sacred
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:44.440]  my spouse and i are the ultimate authority not the government
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:47.000]  if you break the law you pay the penalty
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  justice is blind and no one is above it
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:51.280]  i have a right to life
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:56.080]  liberty and the pursuit of happiness but there's no guarantee of equal results
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:38:57.720]  i work hard for what i have
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:38:59.840]  and i will share it with who i want to
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:03.960]  government cannot force me to be charitable
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:09.520]  it is not an american for me to disagree with authority or to share my personal opinion
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:11.280]  the government works for the people
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:13.720]  the people do not answer to the government
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:15.960]  the government answers to the people
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:18.080]  and the twelve values are honesty
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:22.280]  reverence, hope, thrift, humility, charity, sincerity
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:26.360]  moderation, hard work, courage, personal responsibility
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:51.240]  and gratitude
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:52.440]  now again
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:56.200]  all of that sounded reasonable
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:59.280]  glenn beck oh that sounds wonderful everything kind of like the u.n.
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:02.640]  declaration on human rights thirty one articles until you get to the thirtieth
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:06.200]  article and it says you have none of these rights of the u.n. says so
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:09.800]  see beck puts out all this great sounding stuff
[1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:11.720]  and then
[1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:15.880]  he adds what the patriot acts good and tortures good and wars are good
[1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:19.200]  and value added taxes good and global warming is real
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:21.400]  that's what beck does it's a bait and switch
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:24.000]  different things for different audiences for his tv audience global warming is a
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:24.720]  fraud
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:28.120]  for u.s.a. today it's real we've got to do something now
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:30.480]  in the same week he says this
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:33.240]  but it matters you went and pledged to that
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:34.240]  doesn't matter
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:36.040]  look what glenn beck did
[1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:39.960]  uh... let's go to chris in florida cresher on the air
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:43.360]  yes alexa you mentioned a couple days ago you noted that you're on the uh...
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:47.800]  fifty thousand watt k l r g and in arkansas i want to know that uh... that's
[1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:50.560]  part of the same network that's also carrying your here in florida
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:53.040]  thirteen forty a m in clearwater
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:56.040]  w-t-a-n and thirteen fifty-day
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:40:59.400]  uh... carrying you from about one to two p.m. central so i want to encourage
[1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:01.720]  people to ask them if they could um... that
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:05.960]  i asked the w-t-a-n network to carry all of all your hours
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:08.880]  um... i want to ask you have you heard about i know you've heard about air
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:12.400]  ionizers have you heard about water ionizers
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:14.560]  yes
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:18.960]  and uh... i wanted to ask you have you heard of our scene of the kangen
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:22.760]  water ionizer have you tried any water from that because uh... i i just i'm just
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:24.040]  astounded by it i
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:28.160]  i think it's great for deactivating all the uh... industrial slag that's being
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:31.440]  added under the name of florida well and uh...
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:34.600]  well listen chris i appreciate your call uh...
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:37.380]  i don't have time to research all these different products
[1:41:37.380 --> 1:41:39.520]  i know that
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:43.620]  they have osinators and other systems oxygenators
[1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:46.320]  that do
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:50.400]  kill a lot of pathogens and do detoxify some things but
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:52.040]  something like fluoride
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:53.240]  nothing gets rid of it
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:55.920]  unless you filter it is very hard to filter that
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:58.400]  this is one of the smallest particles out there
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:01.640]  uh... let's talk to chris and louisiana chrisher on the air
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:03.440]  and i don't know if you show
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:06.760]  uh... but it's about four months now that uh... first of your video on the
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:08.480]  youtube for republican billy

[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:22.480]  also that uh...
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:24.640]  the uh... the bank hold on to your money and we
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:25.600]  well the uh...
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:29.720]  there's been bank closures every day for two years young
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:33.560]  and then also that uh... his last dvd brought out he said that uh...
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:37.600]  inflation uh... with what was the inflation about thirty percent this
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:39.840]  year is also the health care bill
[1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:43.080]  the health care bill can be a possible gun confiscation and there is going to
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:46.160]  get your take on that and i think that if you have a lindsay i'm back on the
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:47.360]  show anytime soon
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.520]  sure we'll get him back on i appreciate your call uh... there's been a lot of
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:53.440]  rumors about
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:59.040]  in different legislation and irs tax on guns that was introduced by bob dole
[1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:02.800]  uh... what was it almost twenty years ago it is not been reintroduced
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:06.520]  in the health care bill it just reaffirms what's already being done to the
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:10.040]  american medical association under federal pressure
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:13.080]  the pediatrician gets your kid behind closed doors and ask are there guns
[1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:13.960]  out in the house
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:15.480]  then they call cps on you
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:18.320]  even though you're three-year-old may go yeah they're guns
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:20.440]  you know their brothers toy gun
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:24.640]  uh... so that's going on and yet that that that is in the health care bill
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:27.600]  lots of demonization of the second amendment come on and jaren you got
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:28.840]  something of thanks
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:33.080]  okay let's go ahead and talk to karen in oregon karen you're on the air
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:39.840]  hi alex at taxfree15.com we think that the very best solution for all of this
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:42.880]  is a national strike in an economic boycott
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:44.800]  have I heard you call into a lot of
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:48.160]  have I heard you call into a lot of other shows because i'm getting a lot of uh...
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:50.640]  emails and i think i've heard your voice or other ladies
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:53.560]  on the last few months and i want to say great job
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:55.080]  really pushing that
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:43:58.400]  we have a national strike every fifteenth day of the month
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:01.920]  uh... to send a message to the bankers we don't want to pay all this tax money to them
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:06.800]  it is, it is me and actually the strike that we're talking about now
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:13.000]  has been endorsed by Mike Rivera, by Big John Lipscomb, by Pastor Butch, Joyce Riley,
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.400]  Joe Bannister, Tom Crier,
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:20.280]  Rick Adams, what we're trying to do alex and thank you very much for the time
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:22.480]  because your audience is huge
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:27.200]  and this is about unity it's about reaching out to every single individual in
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:30.560]  this country and even internationally because we've all been
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:33.720]  raped and pillaged by this huge
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:36.600]  government gunwild push for globalization
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:40.760]  and so instead of trying in individual groups around the country this is
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:42.800]  something to unite us all
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:47.000]  to come together in april fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenths
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:50.920]  don't buy, don't comply, ask why
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:56.560]  it's at taxfree15.com and we think that it will send a very powerful message
[1:44:56.560 --> 1:44:59.680]  economically to those at the top and there are ways that everyone can
[1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:01.840]  participate and then on monday
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:06.200]  something that hasn't gotten very much publicity is continental congress and the
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:10.600]  articles of freedom which are totally about restoring our individual
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:12.960]  sovereignty and our state sovereignty
[1:45:12.960 --> 1:45:14.480]  those are being signed
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:17.880]  and they will be presented on the nineteenth at the state capitals all
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:19.320]  across the country.
[1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:22.640]  Well let's do this, I think last friday they were showing me your name and an
[1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:23.440]  email
[1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:26.640]  to get you on and I told the guys working on getting you on
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:29.800]  for a couple segments later in the week I appreciate your call Karen
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:33.400]  and glad you're out there taking action and you know none of this is a silver
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:35.320]  bullet but
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:39.000]  resistance is victory and everybody getting involved overall will defeat
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:40.320]  these people so great job
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:43.560]  with what you're doing Karen. Now let's talk to michael in texas michael you're
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:46.080]  on the air
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:48.320]  Hey Alex thanks for taking my call
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:50.400]  I uh...
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:54.840]  I wanted to begin by saying that I've been a supporter of yours for well over a
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:45:56.000]  decade both
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.400]  financially and physically
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:00.720]  uh... in the field of battle
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:01.920]  uh...
[1:46:01.920 --> 1:46:06.440]  even to the point of being an advertiser on your show I feel like I've
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:08.000]  earned the right to

[1:46:11.760 --> 1:46:14.520]  hydroponic store

[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:32.680]  biggest gun and weapon
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:36.760]  that we have in this war we both agree that it's a war
[1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:38.000]  uh...
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:41.800]  and we both agree that it's about morals and principles
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:43.920]  um...
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:45.120]  my point is
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:50.800]  is this is that that uh... as I was loading signs into my truck yesterday
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:52.800]  and heard this broadcast
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:57.640]  yesterday I was I was floored to hear this gun turned on Debra Medina
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:46:59.800]  no she turned a gun on us
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:01.880]  she turned a gun were despicable
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:03.640]  we're dangerous cult
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:04.800]  we're bad
[1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:08.320]  that's what happened and somebody slaps me upside the head
[1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:11.160]  I stand up against it get that straight
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:15.640]  I share your frustration and I understand where you're coming from on that
[1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:20.040]  you live in a few hundred thousand dollar very nice glass house
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:23.440]  that that we the listeners and your amazing staff
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:25.120]  have helped you to live in
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:27.640]  and you were certainly in no position
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:30.760]  to be throwing stones especially
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:32.440]  at this point in the game
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:34.120]  at Debra Medina
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:35.520]  when you yourself
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:38.160]  have compromised your own principles
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:40.160]  uh... I appreciate your call
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:44.000]  yeah the people make up a lot of stuff about me and I'm not even gonna sit there
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:47.080]  and hear whatever the made up baloney is okay
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:50.640]  so enjoy yourself sir enjoy yourself
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:53.320]  Debra Medina has chosen to
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:55.480]  roll over to the neocons
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:48:00.600]  and you're not focusing in on what's happening there I never said I was perfect
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:01.960]  okay
[1:48:01.960 --> 1:48:03.360]  I never said that
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:05.720]  what I'm saying is
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:07.720]  you you don't even get it
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:09.840]  michael you don't even understand
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:12.160]  you don't even hear what I'm saying
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:16.840]  okay you make a commitment to something you go out and spend time and energy in it
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:17.760]  and then
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:20.640]  you don't want to get upset when it starts getting betrayed
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:21.280]  so
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:23.640]  no I didn't get con michael says
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:28.240]  Alex you're not in a position I'm not in a position I'm a Texan I'm a voter
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:31.000]  I can say something upsets me
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:31.680]  okay
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:33.080]  you don't understand that
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:37.640]  let's talk to Douglas in Louisiana Douglas you're on the air
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:41.160]  go ahead Doug
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:42.160]  we may have lost that
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:43.400]  Debra
[1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:45.440]  Debra Medina
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:50.080]  as well as spit in our eye our face with that last comment she made with the last uh...
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:51.720]  host on that program
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:57.360]  I believe she committed political suicide intentionally she threw the towel in because
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:00.840]  I believe like the other ladies said that she was made an offer she couldn't refuse
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:02.320]  I think she was told
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:04.600]  Rick Perry is going to be the governor
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:08.600]  are in your will be alive or Rick Perry will be the governor or you'll be dead and she
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:12.360]  had to make the choice and I think she got in the ring with the big guys
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:15.560]  and she didn't have what it took to get to follow it through
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:17.160]  so that's my thing on it
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:18.920]  well I don't like to speculate
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:22.120]  but I'll tell you this people get under a lot of pressure when we can
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:24.640]  you know give them a partial pass on that
[1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:27.160]  and I've said we need to see a response on this
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:29.840]  uh... but
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:31.280]  I don't want to speculate
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:33.440]  along those lines I know this
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:35.320]  we know that Ross Perot
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:38.000]  was threatened in his family was threatened
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:43.400]  in the presidency remember that
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:44.680]  you remember that Doug
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:46.520]  that's right that's right
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:49.000]  anything else you'd like to add
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.600]  well I just know that she was very well spoken
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:55.200]  I believed when I listened to her she was able to speak on the state's rights
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:56.360]  issue
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:50:01.760]  is better than anyone she she made me uh... inspired as much as Ron Paul did
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:04.240]  and when she stood up to uh...
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:05.640]  to uh... uh...
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:09.080]  uh... who's the first one she stood up to back when she stood up to back
[1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:10.560]  she said the right thing
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:12.160]  this time with this guy
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:15.720]  she could have said the very same thing everybody has a right to their opinion
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:19.800]  and that would have asserted herself she was very well able to assert herself
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:21.160]  she didn't do it this time
[1:50:21.160 --> 1:50:22.720]  which is shows me
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:26.080]  she did that on purpose she knew when she went into the interview what he was
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:26.920]  going to do
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:30.200]  and he led her down that path she agreed to his opinion
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:33.160]  she didn't even have an opinion she he had her agreeing
[1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:34.840]  to his opinion of the other
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:36.760]  truth truthers opinion
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:38.080]  so what is that
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:41.160]  well all I know is I'm despicable now
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:44.400]  and I don't know why she'd come into a studio and accept the support of a
[1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:45.840]  despicable person
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:49.600]  but again I guess I should just say yes I'm despicable I grovel to you
[1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:52.960]  I'll slit my wrist for you anything you want you are god I
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:57.240]  I'm not allowed to have my morals or my stance I'm evil I'm bad oh my god I'm
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:00.960]  despicable
[1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:04.640]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non

[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:42.040]  and cussed at me in the hallway and screamed at me and said you were wrong
[1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:45.160]  and then a year later they were doing 9-11 truth shows but never

[2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:05.520]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:07:05.520 --> 2:07:09.880]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:07:09.880 --> 2:07:14.040]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:07:14.040 --> 2:07:18.080]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:07:18.080 --> 2:07:21.960]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:26.120]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:30.400]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:34.720]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:38.440]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:42.640]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:46.040]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[2:07:46.040 --> 2:07:49.640]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[2:07:49.640 --> 2:07:55.520]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:08:03.680]  own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[2:08:03.680 --> 2:08:08.680]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:16.200]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the
[2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:22.960]  entire police state control grid being set up across the world by multinational
[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:28.600]  corporations that control the United Nations the US England Europe is being
[2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:33.240]  set up for patriots for libertarians conservatives gun owners returning
[2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:36.320]  veterans that's in the Homeland Security reports that we got from law
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:40.760]  enforcement sources and broke last year but I want to go over some articles
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:45.320]  coming up in this news blitz where even the border patrol is being used on
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:50.400]  citizens not the illegals and tie that in with the 800 plus sanctuary cities to
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.880]  illustrate this for people and how even the supposed smart fence was never built
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:09:01.000]  by Bush they built 50 something miles of it on the 2300 mile border and it was
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.400]  all for show and ABC News reported illegal aliens were hired by Homeland
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:09.640]  Security to build the fence the Associated Press reported that when they
[2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:13.800]  do bust illegals ice takes them from Homeland Security and gives them green
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:17.040]  cards and gives them jobs in the government I mean that look the
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:21.640]  government wants the illegals here and what this illustrates among a lot of
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:28.320]  things is that the government could care less about real security and that they
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:31.360]  only tell us they're setting up this police state to keep us safe from men
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:35.800]  in caves and Central Asia in the Middle East and from illegals and that it's
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:40.160]  all selectively enforced and completely rogue and criminal so that's coming up
[2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:48.160]  amongst other important news today now look I spontaneously yesterday got
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:51.400]  really mad at Deborah Medina who we've supported I'm tired of being betrayed by
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:57.560]  politicians I don't think she's an evil or bad person but for those that don't
[2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:00.280]  know she's running for governor in Texas why is this important nationwide
[2:10:00.280 --> 2:10:04.880]  because her strong showing is getting other people to file to run for governor
[2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:08.840]  and state house and mayor and county commissioner all over the country you
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:13.600]  got 30 almost 40 states now is a 37 38 moving to declare ninth and tenth
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:18.320]  amendment very exciting things happening all over the country to block the
[2:10:18.320 --> 2:10:22.120]  unconstitutional activities of the federal government so that's the very
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:28.000]  good news on that front but to have her go on Glenn Beck and say well I'm not
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:32.280]  911 truth or but I people have a right to speak out and then she gave a bunch
[2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:36.520]  of TV interviews on Houston and Dallas TV we played clips of that here where
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:45.640]  she said that I think it's what's the quote very healthy and and good that
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:49.360]  people are questioning and that the towers did fall strangely how the
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:54.280]  buildings fell and I was like man this lady really does stick to her gun she's
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:59.720]  great then I hear the audio of her on a radio show a few days ago Mark Davis
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:03.680]  and Dallas very big show a lot of listeners fills in for rush limbaugh I
[2:11:03.680 --> 2:11:08.720]  know he says we're despicable we're a cult we're bad we're evil we're horrible
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:14.200]  and she says I agree absolutely they're terrible and I get mad about it and say
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:19.880]  she better explain herself and you notice that hasn't happened okay instead
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:22.720]  we've gotten hundreds of calls and emails it's the same thing from listeners
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:27.000]  that their people tell them oh well we're you know we're gonna clarify and
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:31.920]  and she didn't say exactly that it's taken out of context no it's not and so
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:35.960]  it's getting worse by the minute now this is a national international show
[2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:45.440]  people listening in Canada Germany you know Russia Brazil and so it's wide
[2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:48.680]  open phones they can call about whatever you want and I think we've probably had
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:54.720]  ten callers or so on Medina one of them disagreed with me the other people
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:11:59.320]  agreed and as soon as we put the guy on hold because they weren't sure I was
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:03.880]  going back to him you got real mad off air I was saying shill shill shill yeah
[2:12:03.880 --> 2:12:09.360]  yeah yeah I'm a shill sure I'm an Easter Bunny to a Chinese jet pilot from
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:17.560]  Pluto I'm the king of planet Pop-Tart no Deborah Medina did what she did
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:21.640]  throwing us under the bus and I'm not gonna play politics and roll over to
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:25.560]  that I want to hear is she gonna roll over on every other issue that's what
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:30.920]  we want to hear okay we were her biggest support that is 9-11 truthers I mean
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:35.120]  again the lowest national polls 36% the highest scientific poll 84%
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:41.880]  Angus and read New York Times I mean we're not despicable people okay I was
[2:12:41.880 --> 2:12:47.600]  called despicable you were called despicable I want that clarified and
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:51.840]  if there's a cult following a few people out there that you don't like that so
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:56.200]  what go go listen to Glenn Beck go listen to Rush Limbaugh go support Barack
[2:12:56.200 --> 2:13:00.240]  Obama we're not trying to win popularity contest if I was doing that I would have
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:04.680]  done like a lot of Republican another talk show host and supported Obama early
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:09.080]  on Pat Robertson said he's of God socialism is good he is unstoppable
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:14.080]  pull up Pat Robertson for later Pat Robertson says Obama invincible or
[2:13:14.080 --> 2:13:17.920]  Obama's agenda of God Watson wrote an article about it I mean it's a really
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:24.960]  disgusting video I mean I remember when Pat Robertson in 2000 and I was on a
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:29.560]  lot of Christian stations Christian stations like the show Christian news
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:33.000]  stations and a bunch of them got mad he was on CNN and so we've got to have
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:38.280]  stronger Planned Parenthood and more abortion in China and I said my god
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:41.800]  that's horrible from the supposed pro-life you know kingpin except for
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:45.080]  maybe Dr. Dobson maybe bigger when it comes to pro-life I said that's horrible
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:50.400]  bunch of them got mad I said good get mad I mean he said it he's the one that
[2:13:50.400 --> 2:13:58.360]  said it he's the one that did it not out of context on Wolf Blitzer okay
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:03.000]  Glenn Beck's running around saying global warming's real all of a sudden so
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:08.520]  is Sarah Palin right as it's crashing and burning I'm not the one saying that I
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:14.160]  have to call these people out okay that's what I do I call myself out when
[2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:19.840]  I've made mistakes but this isn't them saying we made a mistake this is hey I'm
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:22.600]  we got a bunch of emails and you heard a call earlier on air gone well they're
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:26.960]  saying this is edited video or edited audio yeah well that I'd like to see
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:33.720]  that officially said that is outrageous if that is the case in fact we need to
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:38.880]  just go ahead and make a data page on Medina I mean I mean here's the here's
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:44.520]  the ABC give me a document cam shot on this for prison planet dot TV viewers
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:52.080]  abc13.com in fact pull up the actual video page on screen for prison
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:56.520]  planet dot TV viewers pull it up I mean I know you guys already captured the
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:15:01.080]  video but have a jaren that found the original clip this morning from their
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:05.560]  site get that I am over and pull it up on screen we'll play this for you when
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:08.120]  I've time to go to calls to cover news but I could play the whole 11 minute
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:15.200]  clip we can just play the whole thing for you it's it's unedited you know it's
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:20.320]  healthy it's good the towers fell suspiciously we can have later we're
[2:15:20.320 --> 2:15:24.000]  despicable and I'm like well what is this what is this double talk don't you
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:34.080]  ask questions no all right going back to who was I talking to last Frank in
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:39.160]  North Carolina Frank finish up your point yeah you know a lot of your critics
[2:15:39.160 --> 2:15:43.080]  they criticize us as being these mind-numbed robots like you know Rush
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:47.400]  Limbaugh listeners or whatnot but yet when we think for ourselves you didn't
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:51.800]  tell me what to think on this as soon as I heard that clip I smelled a red flag I
[2:15:51.800 --> 2:15:55.800]  mean something didn't seem right about that's a colonel pro talking point we've
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:16:00.520]  actually seen cent com operators from cent com IP say that oh you're just an
[2:16:00.520 --> 2:16:04.520]  Alex Jones drone because because they're really worried about what we do here go
[2:16:04.520 --> 2:16:08.960]  ahead I understand that politicians have to compromise an environment like we're
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:12.320]  in right now I mean you know speaking the truth is a revolutionary act I
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:16.600]  understand that but she handled that wrongly she should she she certainly
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:21.240]  could have handled that better she I don't trust her I cannot trust her after
[2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:26.760]  that I disavow any sport I had for I'm a Liberty loving American who believes you
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:31.360]  know I had an ideals of this country I'm a veteran I'm a conservative always
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:36.040]  happen I'm a 9-11 truth or I'm proud of voted for Ron Paul and the primary he's
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:40.240]  not my favorite guy in the world to be honest with you I don't agree with you
[2:16:40.240 --> 2:16:44.280]  on everything but you know what something's not right about that and
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:48.360]  also I just don't know Frank Frank Frank I mean it's not that we'd even
[2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:53.440]  disagree with her it's that it's a it's a it's a total 180 and that's the big
[2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:57.760]  concern here and what if she does other 180s we're not supposed to criticize it
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:03.600]  or be concerned exactly do you remember the pilot
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:09.240]  chesley b sully sullenberger who heroically crashed the plane into the
[2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:15.360]  water I think it was the Hudson River wasn't it I'm saying again the pilot
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:19.840]  supposedly a row at pilot and he may well be his name was sullenberger he's
[2:17:19.840 --> 2:17:25.200]  yeah yeah well I wanted to bring this up on your radar I know you don't have time
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:29.880]  to look into it but maybe someone else can he is going around the neocon talk
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:34.800]  show circuit now promoting full-body scanners and he says everything that
[2:17:34.800 --> 2:17:39.240]  can be done should be done and all this and they're making a big hero out of
[2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:43.120]  apparently he's quit his pilot career and he's going around making these
[2:17:43.120 --> 2:17:46.600]  speeches and everything and I don't know if he was necessarily a bad person to
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:49.720]  begin with the neocon but they've gotten a hold of them and they're using them
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:54.040]  to promote all this stuff and it's it's very diabolical to listen to the
[2:17:54.040 --> 2:17:59.720]  questions and he he answers just the way they wanted to oh yeah the naked body
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:05.280]  scanners taking our babies blood at birth without warrants secretly video
[2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:10.320]  cams in the computers watching everybody this is the issue this is the
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:14.560]  threat this is the new world order I appreciate your call let's go ahead and
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:19.240]  talk to Bob in Texas Bob you're on the air go ahead mr. Jones is a pleasure this
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.600]  is Bob with the funk master 5 channel on YouTube I was able to get through to a
[2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:27.400]  Glenn Beck show this morning and confront him about supporting Sarah
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:32.440]  Palin even though she supported a new investigation 2008 I was able to get the
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:36.360]  question out on his show and it's probably one of my best calls yet he
[2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:40.880]  acts like a complete idiot is it up on YouTube yet I'm working on the video
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:45.120]  right now I should have it later today tomorrow that is sensational so what did
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:48.880]  he say when you pointed out that Palin was more of a 9-11 truther than Medina
[2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:54.000]  well he interrupted me like he usually does and then he went on to say that he
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.200]  supports people asking more questions and then he started making some sound
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:01.920]  effects because I kept talking he tried to voice me over I was trying to tell
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:07.680]  people to YouTube search not Palin 9-11 but he cut me off there I did I was
[2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:11.840]  able to squeeze a little bit out but uh him and his guys just went on for about
[2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:17.080]  five more minutes after they hung up on me about it so it's a little bit of
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:20.280]  stuff to work on but I should be able to have it to the video up by tomorrow
[2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:23.680]  morning at the latest well we'll play clips of it tomorrow then I appreciate
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:27.880]  your call funk master 5 is a great YouTube channel and he calls into big
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:31.640]  syndicated shows talks to millions of people and then points out how
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:36.920]  ridiculously deceptive they are and again I tried my best you know when she
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:41.720]  was sticking to her guns to put that video out we first reported it a year
[2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:48.000]  and a half ago or that Sarah Palin had called for more 9-11 truth the Debra
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:52.720]  Medina had the point at the hypocrisy of it just working tirelessly to the bone
[2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:56.280]  telling my listeners send her money but now I am not allowed to have an opinion
[2:19:56.280 --> 2:20:01.040]  I am to sit down and shut up because I'm despicable I'm a despicable 9-11

[2:24:25.360 --> 2:24:30.020]  you know we get calls every day about that Kramer had that runs Genesis
[2:24:30.020 --> 2:24:36.640]  has its radio ads I have a few ads an hour you hear my ads and I'm gonna have
[2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:39.080]  to talk to Ted because I never get involved in what advertising they run
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:42.520]  I know they have ad agencies that come to them and what's Ted supposed to do
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:46.240]  they want to run an ad for Kramer's newsletter you know that's that's Ted's
[2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:52.880]  issue but no I don't work with Kramer that's the new conspiracy theory going
[2:24:52.880 --> 2:24:58.200]  on out there I wouldn't take an ad from Kramer I don't think we've been because
[2:24:58.200 --> 2:25:03.640]  I don't I don't think what he does is is moral I don't like him he's a globalist
[2:25:03.640 --> 2:25:06.480]  I mean I was criticizing him two weeks ago talking about how the new world
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:11.520]  order is good the issue is this radio network has a lot of listeners millions
[2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:17.920]  and so you know Ted Anderson has salesmen up there that take ads and you
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:25.520]  know that they say no to ads for bongs and adult bookstores and sexual
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:30.000]  aids I know they turn down Viagra ads everybody else takes them I mean we
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:35.200]  have a super high standard here at my office and I think Ted's got a pretty
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:38.760]  high standard but I can't I've already addressed the Kramer thing repeatedly and
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:42.080]  I can't just continue to address it I'm not putting body scanners in the
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:46.360]  airports to naked body scan your family I'm not sitting the IRS after you with
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:50.520]  leans to take your property I'm not secretly taking your baby's blood at
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:54.240]  birth I'm not putting spy cams in the laptops and giving them to your kids I'm
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:25:58.040]  fighting all of that I can be responsible for me not other Genesis
[2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:01.320]  talk show host to that's another thing they do because he's got mainly
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:04.080]  libertarian and conservative hosts got a few liberal hosts say what are you doing
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:10.360]  with us I I can barely run my own life okay I can barely sit here and and that's
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:14.400]  what the whole systems about in this country is turning it around about
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:18.840]  anybody that's criticizing the system okay Geithner doesn't even pay us taxes
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:23.120]  ladies and gentlemen that's the enemy that's the problem that's what has to be
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:28.960]  dealt with okay and that's what we're focusing on but it is driving me up the
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:32.560]  wall this is voices enough to drive me up the wall but it's kind of cool in a
[2:26:32.560 --> 2:26:35.880]  way that if you look at it from that perspective though that we're that you
[2:26:35.880 --> 2:26:39.920]  know that Ted is using their new world order money against him I also get these
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:43.720]  emails going why did Ted Anderson run ads for your fall the republic on rush
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:47.560]  limbaugh what we're not supposed to I mean if rush limbaugh wanted to have me
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:52.600]  on his show should I go on his show I didn't have the money to run those ads
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:55.880]  Ted tried it out really didn't make his money back you don't hear those ads
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:26:59.200]  anymore he runs among some smaller networks and on xM he is getting a
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:03.760]  good response there of all places I mean I would go on nightline I would go on
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:10.360]  CNN what matters is what I say at the end of the day it's what I say that's
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:15.160]  what I should be judged by what I say what I do okay it's that simple and I
[2:27:15.160 --> 2:27:21.720]  salute Ted for taking the gamble to run those expensive ads and didn't really
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:26.280]  break even came close so he's not doing him right now as I'm sure a lot of people
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:30.920]  noticed I wish it would have been successful to Ted his margin of profit
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:35.600]  was so small I sold him the DVDs and almost nothing because the advertising
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:41.040]  was so much I wanted to get him out you know I make the films I make the DVDs
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:47.080]  fall the republic costs close to 200 grand Obama deception 100 grand in game
[2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:51.760]  over a hundred grand terror storm about a hundred grand truth rising about a
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:59.000]  hundred grand and then I say buy the DVDs if you want to support us and the
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:04.240]  trolls say no you're not allowed to sell your own films that's bad and I'm the
[2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:07.880]  only person I know of I pioneered this a few people I think have imitated it
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:13.600]  saying make copies of my film get it give it to everybody because my mission is
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:16.840]  to get the word out obviously I also want to be comfortable be able to take
[2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:20.120]  care of myself and be strong enough to defend myself if God forbid we ever have
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:25.400]  a lawsuit or anything like that again but I can't spend all day because my crew
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:30.640]  was there's the Kramer thing again oh we hate it and I'm like I know but you know
[2:28:30.640 --> 2:28:33.840]  most other talk shows would even say anything about it I would think
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:38.320]  criticizing it would be enough to get it off my show but I've been so busy I
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:42.640]  haven't called Ted in the last month has been running I need to call him I'll
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:47.520]  just do it live right now here on air I call Ted right now
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:52.840]  hopefully I dialed that right sitting here calling Ted I'm gonna ask him about

[2:34:20.920 --> 2:34:27.440]  that's coming up but we're gonna cover that in a moment I did get a hold of Ted
[2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:31.960]  he's he'd been out of town he's actually back in the office so he's gonna be in
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:34.480]  studio with us in just a minute he's getting in there right now at the
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:39.480]  Genesis studio is up in Minneapolis St. Paul area yes they're in Burnsville to
[2:34:39.480 --> 2:34:43.880]  be precise but since I said I would play this Pat Robertson clip where he was
[2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:49.720]  saying Obama is unstoppable he is of the Lord I'm starting to like him now and
[2:34:49.720 --> 2:34:54.760]  all these other things all the neo-cons everybody was saying he was
[2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:58.760]  unstoppable his agenda will go through they wanted it to go through the people
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:02.480]  stood up and said no so now he's using executive orders to go around the
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:07.560]  Congress okay but let's go ahead and play this Pat Robertson video slash audio
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:13.440]  clip here he is right after Obama got elected the Lord said the economy of
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:19.600]  your nation will recover the steps taken will lead to a dramatic increase
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:26.280]  in the power of government the people will welcome socialism in order to
[2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:35.160]  relieve their pain nothing will stand in the way of a plan by Obama to restructure
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:40.000]  the economy in the same fashion as the New Deal in the 30s America will never
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:44.960]  again have the power in the world that it has enjoyed since World War two with
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:49.240]  no strong leadership dangerous dictators will arise in various parts of the
[2:35:49.240 --> 2:35:56.240]  world and then he goes on to say Obama's of the Lord and he's good in fact
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:01.840]  here are some of the some of the quotes Obama's middle of the road cabinet
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:05.280]  consists of people hailing from the council and farm relations her all
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:09.040]  commission the secret of Bilderberg group me find the quote I am remarkably
[2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:12.840]  pleased with Obama I had grave misgivings about him but so help me he's
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:18.040]  come in forcefully intelligently he's picked a middle of the road cabinet and
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:21.240]  so far if he continues down this course he has the makings of a great
[2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:25.280]  president pat robertson he's saying socialism will save you it's a good
[2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:28.120]  thing the economy is going to get better really nothing's gonna stand on the
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:31.840]  way of Obama and that was back when they were all supporting the banker bail
[2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:39.560]  out glenbeck Sean Hannity below Riley pat robertson the left because it was
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:44.680]  an establishment move at the top of the food chain the establishment supported
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:50.480]  it and now glenbeck and others hope you don't remember that that's my point so
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:53.240]  it's pretty disgusting all right I want to get into all this news but I thought
[2:36:53.240 --> 2:36:56.040]  I'd bring Ted Anderson up because I had never talked to Ted in the last month
[2:36:56.040 --> 2:37:00.200]  with this Kramer ad running and Ted was telling me off area I kind of wish he
[2:37:00.200 --> 2:37:04.920]  to drop but they just re-upped again you know the issue and Ted said it
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:07.240]  eloquently during the break I said why don't you come on here and say that he
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:15.680]  said look they didn't refuse the ad for your videos on Michael Savage and
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:26.280]  George Norrie and George is a good guy and Limbaugh and why are we gonna refuse
[2:37:26.280 --> 2:37:32.800]  their ads this is a I mean that would be I guess a form of censorship to them but
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:36.040]  again anything we do is gonna be criticized I I'm not getting any money
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:40.480]  from this it's a stupid newsletter the point is I mean I guess we I guess
[2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:44.920]  censor Kramer he's obviously getting a big response what does that say for
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:52.600]  advertising that the Kramer's coming to us for advertising I mean I guess Ted who
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:56.640]  turns down most of the ads that come into him and I guess you just can't do
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:38:01.400]  anything right Ted Canyon no it's it's always a crap shoot as to how the
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:06.240]  audience will respond but this one is really kind of has me baffled because
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:10.520]  here you have I mean first of all I did see video footage of him supporting Ron
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:17.680]  Paul which has me puzzled I know he's on mainstream television and the the why
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:22.520]  does mainstream television need to come to us for for our audience to buy
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:26.480]  newsletters from Kramer I mean it doesn't make sense to me but the whole
[2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:30.280]  thing the whole point is is that you know where do you draw the line where does
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:35.640]  censorship start and when does it stop well how far down that slippery slope do
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:42.160]  I want to go and you know quite honestly Alex when we have you know media buyers
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:47.440]  that are you know wanting to support the movement that we're doing I mean they
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:51.520]  they used to avoid us like the plague I still have it I mean you should see the
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:58.600]  email response I have back from KSTP AM 1500 here in Minneapolis a 50,000 watt
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:04.600]  clear channel station blowtorch I mean they simply flat out refused to pick up
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:09.160]  your show and you know and the reason why they did it is because they don't
[2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:14.080]  like your content and you know I just I get so sick and tired of the censorship
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:19.760]  but it drives me crazy I mean if I if I canceled all the shows that I've had
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:24.080]  requests to cancel on my network I wouldn't have even one single show running
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:28.120]  on this network I mean people want me to stop your show they want me to start
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:32.840]  other shows I mean the whole thing's crazy and you know this Kramer thing they
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:36.560]  came in it was a media buyer they bought they're getting great results that just
[2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:42.080]  tells me that the Alex Jones show is smoking out there and by the way by the
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:46.840]  way these ad agencies they want to get a response for their buyer so they get the
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:52.280]  ad money again that's exactly what that's about and so obviously there's a lot
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:56.520]  of a lot of people calling them up and wanting to see what this newsletters
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:05.440]  about and it also tells it's a it's a it's a great it's a great you know it
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.840]  just it just tells you how big your audience has grown I mean you take a
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:15.040]  look if you go to alexa.com and you type in the info wars and then you
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:19.320]  compare it to what would be the the next largest site that you'd think of or
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:23.680]  maybe even bigger how about rush limba.com and do a comparison and see who's
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:28.720]  doing better Alex your audience on the internet is bigger than anything else
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:34.880]  out there on radio bar none and and the world is seeing that now and as far as
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:39.800]  I'm concerned this is carrying the message into a camp that normally wouldn't
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:44.040]  take this message I mean it's kind of like you can take the example of Jesus
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:48.040]  Christ he didn't sit there and hang out with all of his followers you never
[2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:53.080]  talked to the crowd you know he wasn't preaching to the choir he went out and
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:57.920]  found the wicked you know and isn't that what this is about don't we want to
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:02.560]  carry the alex jones show you know and and make a bigger impression I and I
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:07.560]  keep on getting accused of trying to support these people but how would we
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:12.880]  how we ever going to be able to you know to mold this nation back to its
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:17.680]  founding fathers with the roots of you know the Constitution and and what this
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:22.560]  great nation stands for if we're not going to be welcoming you know people
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:26.280]  to listen to this type of a message you know it well let's expand on that then
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:29.480]  I want to get into news Ted speaking of a newsletter that I do endorse and think

[2:43:54.160 --> 2:44:00.320]  thing we also have the US Eagle at a real good price you know I call us at
[2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:06.320]  1-800-686-2237 when gold was down there at a thousand fifty dollars an ounce I
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:10.360]  was able to accumulate some things and I'm passing on the savings to you but
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:13.960]  that Frank hands down I mean that's like turning the clock back up into the
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:18.240]  middle of the 90s where you could buy gold between $400 and $500 an ounce
[2:44:18.240 --> 2:44:24.280]  absolutely 800 686 2237 Ted thanks for the great job you're doing you bet
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:29.120]  thanks Alex you bet okay let me get into a bunch of news here and then your phone
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:33.120]  calls because there is so much to cover look at this article give me a document
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:37.840]  cam shot on this guy's for prison planet TV viewers the Washington Times
[2:44:37.840 --> 2:44:43.440]  February 22nd so this came out two days ago I saw it this morning and I couldn't
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:50.920]  believe it this is the neocon Washington Times but they do throw some curveballs
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:56.000]  occasionally this is the popular inside the Beltway column explosive news is the
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:45:01.200]  headline we have this linked up on our websites if you want to find it and it
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:08.360]  is a positive fair article about the towers being blown up I mean I cannot
[2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:14.480]  believe this and that's why you see the attack on 9-11 truth everywhere because
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:22.760]  it's so mainstream the polls on average are over 50% some are even higher you
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:26.640]  can't ignore these numbers people are finding out people are looking at the
[2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:32.640]  collapse of building seven and that's what this article talks about the
[2:45:32.640 --> 2:45:36.360]  mainstream media can ignore this only so long and then they are not even
[2:45:36.360 --> 2:45:39.760]  relevant if they don't start focusing on it and their debunking exercises
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:44.440]  haven't worked a lingering technical question about September 11 terror
[2:45:44.440 --> 2:45:48.600]  attacks still haunts some and it has political implications how did 200,000
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:55.360]  tons of steel disintegrate and drop in 11 seconds a thousand architects and
[2:45:55.360 --> 2:45:58.200]  engineers want to know talk about solutions they're doing such a great
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:01.920]  job architects engineers found love and truth and are calling on Congress to
[2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:07.360]  order a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Tower building
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:13.960]  seven at the World Trade Center I mean that is incredible in order to bring
[2:46:13.960 --> 2:46:18.080]  down this kind of mass in such a short period of time the material must have
[2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:21.600]  been artificially exploded outwards as Richard Gage a San Francisco architect
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:25.040]  and founder of the nonprofit architects engineers found love and truth Mr.
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:29.680]  Gage who is a member of the American Institute of Architects managed to
[2:46:29.680 --> 2:46:35.480]  persuade more than 1000 of his peers to sign a new petition requesting a formal
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:39.520]  inquiry the official federal emergency management agency and national
[2:46:39.520 --> 2:46:43.680]  Institute of Standards and Technology report provide insufficient contradictory
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:47.520]  and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the tower's destruction
[2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:51.680]  we are therefore calling for a grand jury investigation of NIST officials
[2:46:51.680 --> 2:46:56.600]  Mr. Gage adds this is powerful they're actually reporting like journalists a
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:03.400]  serious issue in what serious people are saying and it continues and it's even
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:08.160]  better the technical issues surrounding the collapse of the towers has prompted
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:11.920]  years of debate rebuttal and ridicule is particularly disturbed by building seven
[2:47:11.920 --> 2:47:16.680]  a 47-story skyscraper which was not hit by an aircraft yet came down in pure
[2:47:16.680 --> 2:47:21.440]  free-fall acceleration he also says more than 100 first responders reported
[2:47:21.440 --> 2:47:26.560]  explosives and flashes as the town explosions and flashes the towers were
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:31.840]  falling inside evidence of a multi-ton steel sections ejected literally 600
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:40.640]  feet at 60 miles an hour and the mid-air pulverization of 900,000 or is it
[2:47:40.640 --> 2:47:45.080]  90,000 tons of concrete and metal decking there is also evidence of
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:49.960]  advanced explosive nano-thermetic composite material found in the world
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:55.800]  trade center dust mr. Gage says the group's petition at AE911truth.org is
[2:47:55.800 --> 2:47:58.880]  already on its way to members of Congress government officials will be
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:07.120]  notified that the misprision of treason US code 18 section 2382 is a serious
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:11.200]  federal offense which requires those with evidence of treason to act mr. Gage
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:15.560]  says implications are enormous and may have profound impact on the forthcoming
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:21.800]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial stay tuned for more in this space and they cover
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:30.760]  some other issues other stories I mean come on that I commend Jennifer Harper
[2:48:30.760 --> 2:48:35.520]  I wonder what's gonna happen to her now I mean this is powerful stuff here this
[2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:41.300]  is exciting this is positive and people ridiculed Gage and others when he had
[2:48:41.300 --> 2:48:45.560]  20 members than 100 than 500 than peer review journals now a thousand and growing
[2:48:45.560 --> 2:48:49.760]  and they're not gonna stop and we've already won in the court of public
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:53.600]  opinion that's why they're saying we're despicable evil horrible unamerican
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:57.520]  people look Bill Clinton his handlers carried out Oklahoma City that's been
[2:48:57.520 --> 2:49:01.960]  proven covered all my film road to tyranny Michael Savage comes out and
[2:49:01.960 --> 2:49:05.720]  says he's sure Obama is gonna stage terror attacks a Reichstag event is he bad
[2:49:05.720 --> 2:49:10.240]  this is something governments do now do we know in every case this is what
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:14.200]  they've done no but if they've done it over and over again and it's declassified
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:17.280]  that they've admitted they've engaged in many stage terror attacks over the
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:24.600]  year over the years we must cover it oh and it was unpopular day one before 9
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:28.000]  11 and on day one when I came out and said it was an inside job with the
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:32.520]  evidence sure but I'm not here to win in the popularity contest and today it's
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:37.320]  very popular I'm here to tell the truth but the chips fall where they may take
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:40.680]  the risk because liberty is worth it my children's future your children's
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:45.760]  future is worth it and that's why we're trailblazing and doing what we're doing
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:49.440]  and that's why we've had so much success and that's why those that want to prop
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:53.200]  up the system and those that are just jealous of somebody who's number one
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:58.000]  are coming after us and I love it because they you know no weapon formed
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:03.080]  against us so prosper Christ said and everything they do against us backfires

[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:54.680]  here about 15 minutes for everybody that's patiently holding total lawlessness
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:58.920]  from the government just complete and total lawlessness and what do you do
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:03.440]  when you have a lawless government Obama can't get his greenhouse gas taxes
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:08.960]  passed and so he just comes out and says hmm we'll use the EPA to do that now
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:12.480]  he's always said he was gonna do this but the states are getting ready to sue
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:17.640]  attorney generals are suing companies are already suing but Time magazine says
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:20.960]  it's a great thing and that's what he should do give me your take on that
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:25.640]  also an interesting story here out of business insider America just declared
[2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:31.880]  the recovery over so you better get ready for the double dip and this story
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:38.200]  continues here saying today's bleak consumer confidence also housing prices
[2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:43.160]  are down new home starts are down today's bleak consumer confidence number
[2:56:43.160 --> 2:56:48.160]  is undoubtedly bad news for the economy the bigger than expected drop suggests
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:52.360]  that consumers have lost confidence in the recovery which will drive down home
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:57.400]  prices and consumer spending consumer confidence is typically our first look
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:01.880]  at the state of the economy while most government aggregated data comes out of
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:07.520]  the two month lag or more consumer confidence has been hit with just a one
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:11.240]  month lag studies have shown the consumer confidence is a good predictor of
[2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:16.600]  consumer spending numbers basically people surveyed seem to be good at
[2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:25.320]  accurately regarding their own economic situation and those surveyed reflected
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:29.680]  the broader economy accurately when consumer confidence drops to such deep
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:35.560]  unexpected levels today were the worst in 27 years then it is a red flashing
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:40.240]  light about the economy and then it goes through all those numbers and the
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:44.280]  government more and more saying oh we may need another stimulus now remember a
[2:57:44.280 --> 2:57:49.600]  year and a three months ago with the banker bailout or I guess more that was
[2:57:49.600 --> 2:57:55.080]  in October October November December and then 12 and then two more months that's
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:58:00.280]  that's 15 16 months ago that oh no we're this is the only stimulus we need it
[2:58:00.280 --> 2:58:04.760]  wasn't a stimulus it wasn't a banker bailout it was just a mass robbery and
[2:58:04.760 --> 2:58:13.400]  now we had all these economists on the last year and a half saying that by 2010
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:16.960]  they would want another stimulus or another looting and we have all these
[2:58:16.960 --> 2:58:21.200]  top bankers on the news saying austerity you'll never get your way of life back
[2:58:21.200 --> 2:58:25.760]  most of your taxes have to be raised so you can pay the banks more money on
[2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:31.640]  interest that's just all made up it says it's as if Thomas Jefferson's
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:35.000]  predictions are coming true that if we ever let private central banks take over
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:38.640]  the issuance of currency and credit our children are would have wake up
[2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:43.960]  homeless on the continent their forefathers conquer the right back

[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:35.360]  to begin with but then I have an LA Times article this is out of Information
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:40.600]  Week I have an LA Times article what American border agents search and sees
[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:48.720]  and its citizens they're harassing they were using border patrol up in Pittsburgh
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:54.160]  for the G20 they're doing anything but stopping illegal aliens which again
[3:00:54.160 --> 3:01:00.200]  illustrates how they build up these grids to fight al-Qaeda or illegal aliens
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:04.920]  and it's always for the American people I'm gonna break that down also over in
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:10.080]  England it came out six years ago that Tony Blair was secretly legalizing all
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:14.720]  the illegals and had a deal with the EU to bring in unlimited numbers mainly so
[3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:20.000]  they have a domestic client group that can you know be politically active for
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:23.440]  the globalist and that will take welfare to further bankrupt the country to the
[3:01:23.440 --> 3:01:28.800]  bankers secret labor plan to increase immigration for social reasons dismisses
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:32.800]  public opposition as racist you don't want to pay for all the taxes for these
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:38.080]  people because they bring the foreigners in and just cram a welfare
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:42.920]  bottle in their mouth that's coming up meanwhile they're throwing the book of
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:47.480]  the American people Queens girl Alexa Gonzalez hauled out of school in handcuffs

[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:12.840]  different places they want me to fly I'm so busy doing radio TV films and
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:18.200]  and building my TV studio and trying to spend some time on my family that if I
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:21.800]  choose to go with the model of traveling around I couldn't do what I'm
[3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:27.720]  doing here and digitally and through media I can reach hundreds of times the
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:31.480]  people I mean I've already done several radio interviews today I'm doing more
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:38.920]  tomorrow or I can fly somewhere and talk to 500 people a thousand even 20,000 it
[3:03:38.920 --> 3:03:44.160]  it just doesn't work you know I've only come out recently you know to
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:48.440]  demonstration to try to defend the Second Amendment and I went to the gun
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:54.480]  show to try to support it but so I feel bad every day having to turn people down
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:57.760]  who invite me to come speak but I appreciate to offer and I appreciate
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:01.280]  what you're doing I mean this is about you being a leader in your area Jonathan
[3:04:01.280 --> 3:04:06.280]  Oh definitely and I was also wondering if you had any advice of how to make it
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:11.720]  you know how to get out people in a bigger I guess audience because I mean I
[3:04:11.720 --> 3:04:15.680]  have a website that I'm getting up but you know that doesn't even reach you know
[3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:20.480]  enough people I don't think so oh yeah if you launch a website and then say
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:24.960]  hand out a thousand flyers in the town like key info and then the name of your
[3:04:24.960 --> 3:04:29.000]  website and put it on telephone polls and things you'll get a massive response
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:33.080]  and then if you update it'll take time a lot of people expect instant results
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:38.040]  no it takes time okay put one foot in front of the other you can start an
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:45.480]  organization go on the local meetup groups start organizing and pick local
[3:04:45.480 --> 3:04:50.920]  goals but also educate people about the international and national scope as well

[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:22.720]  back live ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday the 24th day of February 2010
[3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:29.120]  big news blitz coming up into the hypocrisy of law enforcement state and
[3:08:29.120 --> 3:08:33.240]  federal government not enforcing against criminals but throwing the book at
[3:08:33.240 --> 3:08:37.000]  the American people and harassing us and violating all of our rights to
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:41.800]  basically break us like a pimple break a whore into total submission but the
[3:08:41.800 --> 3:08:47.960]  people are saying no okay so many calls I don't know where I left off who is up
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:55.720]  next here Dylan in New York thanks for holding her on the air hi Alex first
[3:08:55.720 --> 3:09:01.360]  off I enjoyed yesterday's piece on the drug war very interesting but what I
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:05.240]  wanted to speak with you today was something you mentioned earlier on the
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:14.160]  show talking about them killing 80% or 90% of the population is what I
[3:09:14.160 --> 3:09:19.520]  believe and basically the New World Order's agenda now I saw a video of you
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:22.320]  on YouTube where you were walking around in Georgia
[3:09:22.320 --> 3:09:27.320]  filming the coffins that FEMA purchased for its American citizens with that set
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:32.920]  I can personally acknowledge that they do have a very large controlled grid in
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:39.800]  Georgia I used to work for a very large corporation and they're literally the
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:45.320]  phones computers air conditioning everything lights everything was
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:52.880]  controlled by a grid in Georgia basically my main question is with all of
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:59.080]  this and what FEMA is doing will be able to tell when martial law will be
[3:09:59.080 --> 3:10:04.120]  will be instated all right Dylan Dylan let me let me clarify and answer your
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:07.560]  question number one I never went to Georgia and walked around in the
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:12.320]  coffins that's somebody else with a southern sounding accent I guess they
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:18.040]  sound a little bit like me but yes those are coffin liners and we did confirm
[3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:24.000]  last year with the Bureau of Cemetery's from New York and other states that they
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:29.360]  are preparing for mass death during a bio attack or a natural plague of some
[3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:35.720]  type and clearly one big rail of tyranny and bringing in possible martial law or
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:44.760]  full-born martial law would be a staged bio attack now that said when you are
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:49.200]  put through naked body scanners when they're having TSA checkpoints in Miami
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:54.320]  and Dallas Texas in New York and Boston Massachusetts randomly searching people
[3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:58.760]  or you go downtown Austin and they randomly one people now or you try to go
[3:10:58.760 --> 3:11:02.040]  to a fireworks display and they're searching you in your bags or having
[3:11:02.040 --> 3:11:07.520]  regular army out or Marines this is martial law or when the governor last
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:10.640]  year in Tennessee says you can't have military checkpoints in all these towns
[3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:14.240]  the military just went ahead and did it that is martial law it's just not
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:19.680]  declared they are training us that a martial law type atmosphere is normal
[3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:24.960]  and acceptable okay without ever even declaring it I mean when the government
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:28.040]  saying they'll kill you as citizens without a trial and they'll arrest you
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:33.040]  under terrorism charges in non-terror related cases and waive your rights that
[3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:39.840]  is martial law so where it's a it's a gradual incremental march into tyranny
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:44.960]  that we're facing let's go ahead now and let's talk to Ron in Texas Ron you're
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:51.320]  on the air how you doing Alex pretty good hey I've been great talk to you I
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:54.280]  haven't been able to talk to you since Friday at before the gun show but I
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:59.000]  mentioned to you about a change in tactic relating to this Mr. Stax bombing
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:06.880]  thing yesterday with the article that you have with Mr. Drew do about his
[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:13.840]  interrelations with those L3 in his letter that he wrote I'm not gonna call
[3:12:13.840 --> 3:12:17.600]  the manifesto because Karl Marx wrote a manifesto that's a manifesto this I
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:21.720]  understand but in his in his letter go ahead yeah in his letter he makes a
[3:12:21.720 --> 3:12:26.280]  reference to when he was working in Southern California and at that time
[3:12:26.280 --> 3:12:32.320]  frame that he's mentioning in it L3 was doing a lot of work in involvement with
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:41.360]  the global hawk and everything else I like this you were going to know where
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:46.160]  we see the state of the country going I see it heading slowly as a probing
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:54.440]  tactic into what we will and will not accept the incident with Mr. Stax is
[3:12:54.440 --> 3:12:59.400]  still to me solely just like probably with anybody else still looking like it's
[3:12:59.400 --> 3:13:03.800]  being staged but I think he was on to something and they silenced him and they
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:10.200]  tried to set it up to where he was doing something and made it focus on him
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:15.040]  rather than the main issue well you get one of the most secretive one of the
[3:13:15.040 --> 3:13:20.840]  most secretive companies involved in all sorts of remote control aircraft
[3:13:20.840 --> 3:13:26.360]  activity and you've got one of their top homeland security people that's tied in
[3:13:26.360 --> 3:13:31.240]  with L3 owning the hangar his plane was in and by the way I'm gonna get to that
[3:13:31.240 --> 3:13:35.560]  towards the end of the show we now have the statesman reporting he got to the
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:39.400]  hangar two hours before so how did he set the fire at his house I guess he
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:43.960]  could have time delayed it but they said the house was on fire about 845 two
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:51.000]  hours before that he's already at the hangar 25 miles away so the whole thing
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:54.480]  it's more and more suspicious you have all these witnesses saying they saw no
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:13:58.240]  one in the cockpit they could see into it that the emergency workers from all
[3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:01.920]  over Travis County and the city of Austin were there across the street for a
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:07.480]  drill that the FBI was on the ground before and other reports seconds after
[3:14:07.480 --> 3:14:12.880]  the plane hit and the explosion was heard you add the fact that they did send
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:16.240]  Geithner down here to grandstand and try to look like a victim for himself and the
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:20.320]  IRS the fact that it did happen in Austin you add all this together it's
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:22.520]  getting very suspicious and I'll go over that towards the end of the show
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:27.640]  because the file on Joe Stack is getting thicker just on the whole L3 situation
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:32.920]  we're investigating let's go back to the Genesis phone lines Wade in Canada
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:38.880]  you're on the air how's it going Alex good you know thanks for everything that
[3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:42.120]  you're doing it's awesome you know I've been listening to you for about six
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:45.920]  months now it's just amazing I just want to speak about the Debra Medina thing
[3:14:45.920 --> 3:14:49.480]  some people are saying that she's getting blackmailed but even if she is like
[3:14:49.480 --> 3:14:53.040]  she should stand up herself you know like if she did something at college or
[3:14:53.040 --> 3:14:56.160]  whatever people make mistakes stand up tell the truth you know get it out there
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:14:59.680]  well I want to be clear there's no evidence that she's being blackmailed a
[3:14:59.680 --> 3:15:04.760]  couple callers have said that and I've said there's no evidence of that and
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:08.360]  again new listeners are tuning in every millisecond that's lady running for
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:12.000]  governor here in Texas that we've been supporting and the whole Glenn Beck thing
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:15.880]  happened where he said she was a 9-11 truth or she said no I support people's
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:19.840]  right she said it's quote healthy those towers did fall in a strange way and
[3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:27.280]  then she said days later it's despicable and horrible and agreed that we're this
[3:15:27.280 --> 3:15:31.600]  dangerous cult and I'm saying man that's quite a flip-flop that hurts my
[3:15:31.600 --> 3:15:37.360]  feelings I didn't know I was despicable and so I'm saying what are they gonna
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:41.200]  say about this I'm angry about this and most people agree and are angry a few
[3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:46.040]  say no she is God you don't question Obama you don't question her you don't
[3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:49.440]  question Glenn Beck you know just everybody has their own little camp
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:54.240]  followers where it's just worship worship worship and that's not who I am
[3:15:54.240 --> 3:15:58.120]  good you guys stand up you know lots of people died for you guys though the
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:02.400]  freedom of speech and you know you got a fight for that you know and it's another
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:05.640]  thing about going back you know you could tell he's phony because he goes
[3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:10.120]  there he calls 9-11 truth there's morons and idiots and stuff like that but if
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:13.360]  well he's actually a real American he'd actually be like good question your
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:17.560]  government no he says a lot more he says we're gonna stage terror attacks and
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:22.920]  murder Obama yeah but it's him pushing everybody towards violence alright but
[3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:29.760]  absolutely I appreciate your call days before the attack last Thursday in
[3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:34.640]  Austin he was saying that these tea party people who are birthers are only
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:38.400]  five percent when the poll show it's more than half of Republicans question the
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:43.200]  most certificate and he was saying 9-11 truths 5% of the population and another
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:48.280]  lie and that we're all dangerous anti-Americans and violent and then he
[3:16:48.280 --> 3:16:54.000]  put Debra Medina's picture up on the blackboard and next to Van Jones and
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:58.440]  said these people hate America and I came to her defense and this is horrible
[3:16:58.440 --> 3:17:03.800]  and instead her response is just a grovel frustrate herself before Glenn
[3:17:03.800 --> 3:17:09.640]  back I mean it's just incredible and throw us under the bus but I guess I'm
[3:17:09.640 --> 3:17:16.440]  supposed to say that's all right that's good but again it only seems to be from
[3:17:16.440 --> 3:17:18.960]  what I've seen a few people that are even in her campaign that they're gonna
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:22.360]  get a job or something it's like we're big city politics or something they're
[3:17:22.360 --> 3:17:26.040]  like no it doesn't matter what she does we've got to do this to win you know
[3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:30.720]  we've got to be deceptive of what and some people are like Alex is very
[3:17:30.720 --> 3:17:34.100]  Machiavellian he's trying to make it look like she's not allowed a 9-11
[3:17:34.100 --> 3:17:39.680]  truth or to save her what save her what Beck did to her really hurt her said
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:43.720]  again in five points a week two weeks after she's lost five points that's
[3:17:43.720 --> 3:17:48.520]  15 she's lost 10 she should have gotten on track and the five she's got a 20
[3:17:48.520 --> 3:17:55.680]  point now and by her going into a tailspin and retracting like she's bad
[3:17:55.680 --> 3:18:02.240]  or something people don't like that no one likes that but whatever it's too bad
[3:18:02.240 --> 3:18:11.280]  let's go ahead and talk to Neil in Jersey Neil you're on the air Neil yeah
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:15.200]  let's move on to Harold in Florida Harold you're on the air go ahead
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:26.400]  Alex yes sir this is Harold I haven't called you in a number of years I listen to a short wave I'm a senior citizen that's
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:37.160]  getting a little non-articulate I'll say but I do have a all about 99% agreement
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:44.040]  on everything you say Medina the stacked thing the 9-11 truth Oklahoma City
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:54.040]  Glenbeck Ruby Ridge Waco the whole thing when you go off the air on short wave I
[3:18:54.040 --> 3:19:01.240]  guess the switch will get cut off on my receiver like it has on my television
[3:19:01.240 --> 3:19:08.080]  you always say you choose your battles and I agree with that you make tactical
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:17.160]  decisions some I can't quite comprehend perhaps but there is a question I like
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:22.880]  I'd like to ask and I'm sure your friends out here and me included would
[3:19:22.880 --> 3:19:31.640]  like to hear what's the difference and I'm gonna use the buzzwords of not being
[3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:39.800]  a truther or in your case not being the birth okay I'd like to hear a
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:49.640]  comprehensive explanation from both both you and Deborah Medina and well I tell
[3:19:49.640 --> 3:19:53.280]  you what I don't even know her position on the birther thing but the guys when
[3:19:53.280 --> 3:19:57.080]  they're watching a video her on national TV and slapped around by CNN I don't know
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:20:00.760]  why people keep putting her on there stay there I want to understand your
[3:20:00.760 --> 3:20:06.920]  question when we come back for safety you locked doors set alarms by antivirus

[3:24:18.360 --> 3:24:25.200]  okay Harold from Florida specifically you're saying what's the difference
[3:24:25.200 --> 3:24:30.000]  between a birther and a truther explain that question for me that was not the
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:41.040]  question the question was I understand what Deborah Medina said on her on the
[3:24:41.040 --> 3:24:48.840]  limbo show about her stand there and I considered that her stand was despicable
[3:24:48.840 --> 3:24:56.680]  okay but as far as being whether she was a truther or not and to use those
[3:24:56.680 --> 3:25:02.880]  words I don't understand however and this is your program you can throw me
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:10.640]  off you pay the bill but I don't understand your position on your stand
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:17.040]  where you said I am not a birther I believe the Barack Obama presence is a
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:27.120]  total fraud and I see a comparison here between her not being a truther and you
[3:25:27.120 --> 3:25:36.080]  not being a birther article two of our Republic Constitution section one says
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:41.560]  that the president has to be a natural born citizen let me stop you I
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:47.800]  understand the question now and it's a good question number one we've had
[3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:51.480]  Phil Berg on here repeatedly we had him on back when this wasn't even on the
[3:25:51.480 --> 3:25:57.000]  radar screen during the campaign okay and I do think there's a cover-up going
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:03.120]  on I've said I don't know and I've said I think it's legitimate but I can't call
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:08.960]  myself a complete birther because I don't know something like 9-11 I have so
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:14.120]  much evidence and it does appear that he's not we know his real name was Barry
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:18.800]  sitaro we know he did go to these Muslim schools in foreign countries and the
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:24.400]  media would poo poo that a year ago right after he got an office and so one of
[3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:29.720]  the first places people heard about the birth certificate issue was here okay and
[3:26:29.720 --> 3:26:36.160]  I also had oh who's the guy that wrote the late great USA on over and over again
[3:26:36.160 --> 3:26:43.600]  about it I'm having one of those moments Dr. Jerome Corsi I have had
[3:26:43.600 --> 3:26:50.520]  constant I just don't hammer it because I can prove he's lying about torture that
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:54.800]  he wouldn't do it or hiring lobbyists or new wars or the Patriot Act that he would
[3:26:54.800 --> 3:27:00.360]  get rid of and so in fall of the Republic and in Obama deception we don't get into
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:06.520]  that because I wanted it to be things that were a hundred percent now you're
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:13.520]  missing the boat here I am not criticizing Deborah Medina for saying that
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:19.160]  9-11 truthers are despicable that's pretty bad the issue is she said that we
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:23.360]  are good healthy people asking serious questions she has questions about the
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:28.240]  towers we have a right over and over and over and over again during back after
[3:27:28.240 --> 3:27:32.920]  back and then flip flopped it's flip flopping I've always said I don't know
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:35.720]  about the birth certificate there's a lot of evidence but they're covering it up
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:42.920]  that he isn't a citizen so if I wasn't clear on that I'm sorry but it's a
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:47.160]  totally different issue now what do you say to that Harold okay you had Rick
[3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:56.480]  Perry for 14 years and you know where he stands Deborah Medina I agree I was very
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:28:01.560]  disappointed to hear her say what she said I was very disappointed to hear you
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:05.960]  say you were not a birther she said she's not a truth or no I don't know you know
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:12.200]  what I'm saying here is I would like to hear a real comprehensive airing of
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:17.360]  both of these stands first let me ask you a question what when did you hear me
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:22.880]  say I I I've said I wouldn't call myself I remember saying that a complete
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:27.600]  birther saying a birther believes he wasn't born here I'm saying there's a
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:31.640]  cover-up and it may be true and we've investigated I've only said I'm
[3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:37.760]  investigating and I just don't think you even heard what I just said to you
[3:28:37.760 --> 3:28:43.280]  it's the saying 9-11 truth is a legitimate research position and then
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:48.400]  saying it's despicable a week and a half later that's my issue sir and I've
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:52.760]  been saying that since yesterday that's why I'm concerned but you know what I've
[3:28:52.760 --> 3:28:55.920]  already meant to do this I want to get Phil Berg back on we have a video
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:28:59.200]  interview we've done that I want to put up for prison planet TV members just
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:03.600]  we're bogged down trying to finish up Vermis's film it's excellent film we're
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:10.080]  just on that and I have actually been doing research see I I'm not sure about
[3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:14.880]  Joseph Stack but a lot of evidence points towards it being an inside job with
[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:19.280]  the kamikaze attack so we're looking at that we I wasn't sure for a week or so
[3:29:19.280 --> 3:29:22.840]  about the underwear bomber that doesn't mean I'm not saying it couldn't be an
[3:29:22.840 --> 3:29:26.640]  inside job we're here co-leading the information but I appreciate your
[3:29:26.640 --> 3:29:29.840]  question Harold and you're specifically saying you'd like to hear Deborah
[3:29:29.840 --> 3:29:35.000]  Medina on her website or on this show or some other show give a complex you know
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:38.600]  detailed answer like I just gave on the birther issue I think that's totally
[3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:43.560]  legitimate but you're missing the forest for the trees though on why I'm
[3:29:43.560 --> 3:29:47.360]  concerned and nothing to do with whether she's a 9-11 truth or not I've been
[3:29:47.360 --> 3:29:51.200]  saying that since yesterday when I broach this subject more calls tons of news
[3:29:51.200 --> 3:29:58.880]  straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[3:29:58.880 --> 3:30:05.480]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[3:30:05.480 --> 3:30:09.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[3:30:09.920 --> 3:30:14.320]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy SAR wants
[3:30:14.320 --> 3:30:18.240]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[3:30:18.240 --> 3:30:21.880]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:30:21.880 --> 3:30:26.440]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:31.040]  dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding
[3:30:31.040 --> 3:30:34.800]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[3:30:34.800 --> 3:30:38.280]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[3:30:38.280 --> 3:30:42.200]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[3:30:42.200 --> 3:30:45.400]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[3:30:45.400 --> 3:30:49.040]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:26.920]  Rasmussen over the last three days before this latest gaffe came out and no
[3:33:26.920 --> 3:33:31.880]  one likes indecision or flip-flopping they conducted a poll on Monday and
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:37.320]  Tuesday over a two-day period it came out this morning Dallas Morning News that
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:44.280]  Medina is now at 16 points she was at 24 slid to 20 the last two weeks slid to
[3:33:44.280 --> 3:33:51.160]  16 and other polls are showing similar Hutchinson is slipping and Perry is I
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:56.520]  mean Republican voters mainline want to feel like their winners and see when
[3:33:56.520 --> 3:34:00.200]  Beck said you're not a winner you can't win they said well we don't want to vote
[3:34:00.200 --> 3:34:03.480]  for somebody who isn't a winner and then I guess the Medina people just panicked
[3:34:03.480 --> 3:34:08.240]  and said we hate the bird the the truthers in fact the guys are in there
[3:34:08.240 --> 3:34:11.520]  watching her on seeing it in did you guys ever find out in that transcript
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:18.640]  whether she went after birthers because that'll be another example I believe I
[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:21.080]  brought birthers have up to her before and she said people have a right to
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:25.440]  investigate I mean will they be despicable like Glenn Beck says Glenn Beck says
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:29.080]  you're despicable and bad if you're a birther I say more power to you it's her
[3:34:29.080 --> 3:34:34.200]  right to research it looks like there's something there but here it is latest
[3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:46.360]  Rasmussen poem Perry 48 Hutchinson 27 Medina 16 if he gains another two points
[3:34:46.360 --> 3:34:52.680]  ladies and gentlemen in fact go to the Dallas Morning News and click on the
[3:34:52.680 --> 3:34:59.880]  Rasmussen itself I want to put the actual Rasmussen up on that's right here it
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:07.560]  says latest Rasmussen poll Perry 48 Hutchinson 27 Medina 16 by Mike Hashimoto
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:11.640]  and it says the Rasmussen poll in the Texas gubernatorial primary is out and
[3:35:11.640 --> 3:35:18.400]  the news appears pretty good for Governor Rick Perry who has picked up four
[3:35:18.400 --> 3:35:23.280]  points to 48 percent since the start of the month compared the last two Rasmussen
[3:35:23.280 --> 3:35:28.800]  polls okay Bailey Hutchinson is down two points from 2927 but interestingly
[3:35:28.800 --> 3:35:33.240]  Deborah Medina is polling at the same 16% as she was before she briefly lost
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:38.000]  her mind on glimbex 911 truth or inquisition well that's not right she
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:43.200]  was above 20 then with early voting underway Rasmussen asked those who
[3:35:43.200 --> 3:35:48.360]  voted already which way they went the answer Perry 49 Hutchinson 24 Medina
[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:55.040]  20 see she was at 20 or above before it's too bad Perry is a very close to
[3:35:55.040 --> 3:35:59.040]  avoiding a runoff which could save his campaign a fair bit of money that could
[3:35:59.040 --> 3:36:04.840]  also to apply to the general election against Bill White that said it will be
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:10.320]  interesting to see if any Democrats take Paul Bucca's suggestion and cross over
[3:36:10.320 --> 3:36:16.000]  to vote for Hutchinson thereby increasing chances of a Perry weakening
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:21.960]  runoff for Mark Davis take on the primaries and a couple of out-of-state
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:27.560]  representatives visit and it's got the link to that isn't Mark Davis the the
[3:36:27.560 --> 3:36:30.720]  radio talk show host yeah he writes for them he's the one that threw Medina
[3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:37.000]  onto the bus again in the last few days even after she denied anything decent
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:40.200]  with 9-11 truth he then attacked her again and so well that just shows you
[3:36:40.200 --> 3:36:44.760]  don't have good judgment and again this is a great example for people in other
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:50.080]  states when you run for governor or run for state legislature don't end up this
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:54.760]  way don't flip-flop don't do this look if she would have said look the
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:36:59.640]  Commission says investigate I'm only questioning the majority of Americans in
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:04.440]  this poll do Glenn what are you afraid of questions she wouldn't then have lost
[3:37:04.440 --> 3:37:11.480]  all the 9-11 truth or votes people got mad at her press release she put out that
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:15.080]  day two weeks ago and the rest of it and I defended her and said that's okay
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:21.080]  that's alright you know we still need to support her you know she can still win
[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:30.600]  if you get out there and do it and no one likes flip-flopping and we can now
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:35.960]  know and other races around the country they're going to try this again in the
[3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:41.080]  future okay I want to get into this DHS news I've been talking about all day but
[3:37:41.080 --> 3:37:45.800]  first let's jam in some more calls really fast now I am giving people one
[3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:50.880]  minute Tyler in Canada go ahead you're on the air hey Alex I'm 17 listening
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:55.000]  like a year and a half listen every day got two quick questions what are the
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:58.680]  chances that her could be used to fake overwhelming effects and what about the
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:38:02.680]  possibility of the flipping of the earth magnetic polarity that's freezing the
[3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:08.480]  people in the lower hemisphere well those an excellent group of questions the
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:12.600]  Pentagon admits they have weather weapons since the 60s the Secretary of
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:18.080]  Defense in 97 gave a speech Cohen did admitting they have it tectonic weapons
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:23.600]  weather weapons and yes they could engage in weather weapon operations to
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:28.680]  scare people into submission or scare you with regular weather and say it's
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:33.000]  abnormal and Bill Gates the Pentagon they're all in the news the White House
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:37.880]  science are saying we're already been practicing terraforming spraying chemicals
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:42.280]  in the air that's the chem trailing and now we want to go even more massive and
[3:38:42.280 --> 3:38:47.320]  do this publicly to save the earth from global warming so it's also a cover for
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:50.840]  all their weather modification manipulation that's going on just like
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:55.200]  laptops are spying on you with the cameras and microphones and people didn't
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:38:58.880]  believe it now it's mainstream news just like they're taking babies blood at
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:01.520]  birth people didn't believe me even when I have the documents now it's mainstream
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:05.240]  news they do believe it it's all documented they're manipulating the
[3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:09.080]  weather that they could create control steer hurricanes Stanford research
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:13.400]  institute naval weapons lab been Livingston 1967 certified they've been
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:17.200]  doing it since the early 60s but certified at the 60s it isn't real
[3:39:17.200 --> 3:39:21.680]  because people don't see it all over the news but it's been declassified and so
[3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:24.960]  excellent question the other one was about pole shifts the pole has been
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:30.840]  moving an unusual amount in the north and the south and it does flip around and
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:36.960]  the planet does move around and do things and it I mean all the continents
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:43.320]  were worth were once together in Pangea I mean who knows what can happen giant
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:48.760]  meteors hit us the point is the only thing that's constant is change okay
[3:39:48.760 --> 3:39:58.120]  let's go to let's go to Jerry in Florida Jerry are on the air Mr. Jones
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:06.000]  pleasure to get through I just a real quick one to compliment you on your your
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:10.840]  impeccable Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonation I listen to you all the time
[3:40:10.840 --> 3:40:14.680]  and when you when you kick into one of your rants and you get going on that
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:21.880]  dude I just die people are nothing they're weak we will ignore them roll
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:31.440]  over them stop it stop it you know yeah well what I wanted to comment on was
[3:40:31.440 --> 3:40:37.240]  the the clip that you were playing with the Medina being interviewed by that guy
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:43.080]  who was basically in a nutshell I think we've all pretty much heard it saying
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:47.920]  that truthers oh well that's good you're not a truth or well my question to him
[3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:56.480]  would have been well if I'm not a truth sir and what am I supposed to be a liar
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:41:01.880]  I hear no thanks I think I'll stick with truth because regardless of what the
[3:41:01.880 --> 3:41:06.080]  truth is it's the truth that doesn't make you a bad person if we all turn out
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:11.120]  to be lunatics and the buildings really did fall under the circumstances that
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:15.680]  we've all been led to believe then okay we're wrong but all we were seeking was
[3:41:15.680 --> 3:41:19.720]  the truth that doesn't make us bad people no no I mean everything today and I
[3:41:19.720 --> 3:41:24.520]  appreciate your call it's great points gotta move on those everybody gets on is
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:29.240]  that the government has declassified that they've staged many terror attacks and
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:34.600]  proposed stage terror attacks in the past so questioning that questioning an
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:41.240]  event when government stands to gain like we did on the flu or WMDs or
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:45.280]  anything that's the only position to have I mean if you've got a neighbor
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:48.520]  that's robbed you two or three times and you come home and your house is robbed
[3:41:48.520 --> 3:41:53.960]  again you're gonna look at the neighbor who's done it before and then the
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:59.680]  neighbor comes out and says it's despicable of you to question me it's
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:03.640]  incredible so they're trying to create this illusion that it's not proper to
[3:42:03.640 --> 3:42:07.480]  ask questions and it's evil and it's violent and it's horrible and it's a
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:10.880]  cult and it's oh because they're mad we won't shut up and go away we have
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:15.880]  internal White House documents from Casson steen that that we're their big
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:18.360]  enemy and look it back and look at the White House they're together on this
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:24.480]  attacking us what are they so afraid of if it's so ridiculous all right let's go
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:28.040]  back to our phone system John in Michigan you're on the air go ahead John
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:33.760]  hey Alex how you doing pretty good hey I got two quick questions but I wanted to
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:39.240]  make a comment about people attacking you yes I love it I just want to say
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:45.240]  your actions speak for themselves and that's the only thing they can do to
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:50.400]  slow you down is to distract you and try and get you off your game and for every
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:55.320]  attack they're just introducing people who have never would have heard of you
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:42:59.880]  anyhow they're they're introducing you to people who would have never heard of
[3:42:59.880 --> 3:43:04.760]  you and unintentionally planning seeds for us no that's the big that's the big
[3:43:04.760 --> 3:43:09.160]  dirty secret and no matter how nasty the lies how elaborately ridiculous
[3:43:09.160 --> 3:43:15.360]  in the end it only helps us reach new people I mean people attacking us as a
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:20.240]  small stream of new listeners but it's still substantive every person we're
[3:43:20.240 --> 3:43:28.960]  able to really reach out to and really wake up is is invaluable the the the
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:33.720]  attacks from mainstream media don't even send us that many people because
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:37.640]  mainstream media doesn't have that many viewers anymore I mean that's the big
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:42.000]  illusion people will spend all this money on big mainstream TV radio print
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:46.360]  and it doesn't get you a good response because people aren't listening and
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:52.160]  mainstream media is so discredited now that when they attack me it only makes
[3:43:52.160 --> 3:43:57.080]  people go I better check this guy out I mean take Texas Monthly cover story on
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:01.640]  me this month's issue I wouldn't call it a hit piece it's gotten website names
[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:07.480]  wrong dates of key things wrong even though I told them it's got distortions
[3:44:07.480 --> 3:44:10.400]  like oh there's really no plan to exterminate the majority of the
[3:44:10.400 --> 3:44:14.680]  population Alex sent me one document and it said a little bit of that no I
[3:44:14.680 --> 3:44:20.720]  sent him a whole bunch okay and so almost every comment on the article agrees
[3:44:20.720 --> 3:44:25.120]  with me and is giving them sources of where I said things so I appreciate your
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:32.480]  calling else question go ahead okay well I just want to say you know before I
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:35.880]  get them it may seem like you get it from all sides but there is love out

[3:44:59.280 --> 3:45:05.080]  bill better relations with the US Sudan offer bin Laden to Bill Clinton what was
[3:45:05.080 --> 3:45:14.880]  Bill Clinton's response to Sudan that was in 1996 and he said we don't want him
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:20.800]  did he blow up the city attack over he's like a bomb they're a pharmaceutical
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:26.680]  player yes he did I appreciate your call let's go ahead yeah they cruise
[3:45:26.680 --> 3:45:30.920]  missled it let's go ahead and talk to Isaac in Texas Isaac you're on the
[3:45:30.920 --> 3:45:41.200]  air yes how you doing Alex I had a personal question what do you think we
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:44.280]  ought to go ahead and vote for it and is there any hope for Texas to do the stage
[3:45:44.280 --> 3:45:50.720]  chair the body scanners and Debra Medina foot flopping well I mean look I think
[3:45:50.720 --> 3:45:53.960]  you should still vote for Debra Medina I don't think people who voted for wasted
[3:45:53.960 --> 3:45:58.600]  a vote I just being called despicable and watching her flip-flop is very
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:46:03.040]  painful and hurt me and so that's why I'm upset about it and now some of the
[3:46:03.040 --> 3:46:07.000]  responses I'm seeing from the campaign I mean for now I'm saying go ahead and
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:17.280]  vote for but I just I mean go to her website have have have we got any
[3:46:17.280 --> 3:46:21.520]  response yet from these people I appreciate your call let's go ahead and
[3:46:21.520 --> 3:46:25.920]  talk to Kevin in California Kevin you're on the air go ahead hey Alex are you
[3:46:25.920 --> 3:46:30.840]  going good but here's I got a couple comments on Debra Medina rule one real
[3:46:30.840 --> 3:46:33.800]  quick one here you know one of the things that bothered me the most about it
[3:46:33.800 --> 3:46:38.640]  was calling people despicable she's basically stomping on on free speech at
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:43.680]  that point time and so yeah but don't criticize her you're evil I mean you're
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:48.360]  not you don't have your free speech now oh I understand I understand that and
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:52.600]  here's the here's a couple other points for you real quick 26 years ago Frank
[3:46:52.600 --> 3:46:57.920]  Zappa you see the video on musicians for freedom was talking about in 1984 race
[3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:05.560]  specific bio weapons yeah I've had his wife on I've had his wife on and the
[3:47:05.560 --> 3:47:09.480]  last point is I thought you might find this an interesting link between the
[3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:15.800]  Rothschild and Al Gore Jacob Schiff his grandson Andrew Schiff is married to
[3:47:15.800 --> 3:47:22.040]  Al Gore's daughter Katrina yes I've seen that and I find that they're no small
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:25.720]  bit irony in particular regarding David the Rothschild the mouthpiece for Europe
[3:47:25.720 --> 3:47:29.360]  regarding global warming and then you got Al Gore over here and then we see some
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:32.360]  type of you know loose blood relationship that they've they've formed
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:37.000]  that looks like Terry and Bush being cousins and club on every side of their
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:40.640]  family it's like a breed of dog they're all related like French Bulldogs or
[3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:45.360]  Beagles it's all you know basically one you know one family tree it's
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:51.400]  Obama's related closely to Cheney it's just amazing oh you know people start
[3:47:51.400 --> 3:47:55.840]  to really look at that aspect of it it's no surprise well why we're at rat
[3:47:55.840 --> 3:48:02.960]  today I hear you I hear you and I appreciate your call okay there's so
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:10.160]  many phone calls here who's been holding the longest on our phone system Paul in
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:13.680]  Indiana you're on the air go ahead
[3:48:14.760 --> 3:48:20.040]  yes he's been holding so long he's gone Chris in California you're on the air
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:27.660]  go ahead yeah Alex Jack McClam Dr. Sam on Tief Keith Paul Craig Roberts Dr.
[3:48:27.660 --> 3:48:32.520]  Jerome Corsi Larry Pratt I heard you these are all members of the Council
[3:48:32.520 --> 3:48:38.080]  for National Policy that we never here talked about on the show and there's
[3:48:38.080 --> 3:48:43.040]  constantly guests who are involved in rub shoulders with people like you know
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:50.440]  George Bush and Alan Keyes and you know I'll butcher Gonzales kind of Robert
[3:48:50.440 --> 3:48:57.200]  saying I heard you just attacking him earlier Dr. Dr. Dobson and that the group
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:00.200]  for Council for National Policy is an ultra ultra secret right group and I
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:05.840]  heard you talking with Peter Dale Scott about this and you actually said this
[3:49:05.840 --> 3:49:14.900]  a quote from you the CFR or the CNP is a junior CFR well let me be clear and I
[3:49:14.900 --> 3:49:21.720]  appreciate your call look what people do is they invent new special conspiracies
[3:49:21.720 --> 3:49:26.520]  that are theirs okay and by the way I had Peter Dale Scott on ten years ago
[3:49:26.520 --> 3:49:32.400]  talking about the CNP and for you to say I never talk about it isn't true I
[3:49:32.400 --> 3:49:35.480]  brought it up with him when he was on I think the show last time Burma's
[3:49:35.480 --> 3:49:40.040]  asking about it for the film he's making he's in there so I don't work for the
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:45.800]  Republican Party I have different guests on I mean I had Rothschild on people
[3:49:45.800 --> 3:49:49.520]  say I most like him no I had him on in security in fact we're gonna skip this
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:51.800]  last break because I want to have time at these other two articles that's where
[3:49:51.800 --> 3:50:01.520]  I get to but on this subject that was the Hunt brothers and they wanted to take
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:06.040]  over politics and they were big anti Kennedy people and and and that is a
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:12.520]  right-wing thing but I mean people send emails saying there's proof your CNP in
[3:50:12.520 --> 3:50:21.640]  all this I'm not I don't even go to Republican meetings I mean I don't go
[3:50:21.640 --> 3:50:25.880]  to anything it's like an inquisition I'm talking about naked body scanners
[3:50:25.880 --> 3:50:30.480]  cameras in your computer watching you the IRS out of control banks feeling
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:34.720]  trillions bring them to justice I'm interviewing Peter Dell Scott over and
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:38.480]  over again he could talk about whatever he wants on this show and it's like oh
[3:50:38.480 --> 3:50:43.400]  Alex Jones won't talk about CNP Council on National Policy is that right
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:48.600]  Council on National Policy I mean it's a it's a group but I think back in the
[3:50:48.600 --> 3:50:55.120]  80s where whether it was co-opting the anti-New World Order movement or was
[3:50:55.120 --> 3:50:58.960]  good and then got bad I haven't really studied it that much I just know there's
[3:50:58.960 --> 3:51:02.600]  all sorts of groups and interchanging organizations I mean I'm criticizing Pat
[3:51:02.600 --> 3:51:06.200]  Robertson you're you're discrediting yourself with what you're saying I was
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:10.360]  just talking about about Robertson Dr. Paul Craig Roberts admits he used to be
[3:51:10.360 --> 3:51:14.360]  a big Republican now he comes out against him I mean you judge a tree by
[3:51:14.360 --> 3:51:20.760]  its fruits I'll bring CNP up remind me guys next time Roberts is on with us
[3:51:20.760 --> 3:51:24.880]  he'll talk about it I mean they just I think they get together and have meetings
[3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:27.800]  and talk about how they won't take over the Republican Party I mean that stuff
[3:51:27.800 --> 3:51:32.920]  goes on everywhere it's it's it's like a there's a camp that says I work for the
[3:51:32.920 --> 3:51:36.000]  Jews which I don't there's a camp says I work for the Catholics which I don't
[3:51:36.000 --> 3:51:39.560]  there's a camp that says I'm a Scientologist which I'm not never been
[3:51:39.560 --> 3:51:43.000]  to their meeting no nothing about it other than it pretty goofy stuff from
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:47.880]  Elron Hubbard and it looks like they've done some bad things in the past
[3:51:47.880 --> 3:51:58.520]  CMP I mean I'm here doing what I do I'm here covering issues and this is why as
[3:51:58.520 --> 3:52:03.240]  a society we are so screwed up I mean I've got people saying I work for oil
[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:07.320]  companies that's what David Rothschild said on this show you know you work for
[3:52:07.320 --> 3:52:12.840]  oil companies I get zero money from oil companies I actually have family in
[3:52:12.840 --> 3:52:17.120]  East Texas you know those areas and oil well might bring in like 500 bucks a
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:20.720]  month or something they're little teeny things I think my grandma said she gets
[3:52:20.720 --> 3:52:24.360]  about a hundred bucks a month from some because the way oil wells work is so
[3:52:24.360 --> 3:52:27.240]  many oil on their property but it's like a pool and the people with the
[3:52:27.240 --> 3:52:31.280]  joining property got some family land in West Texas I think decades ago the
[3:52:31.280 --> 3:52:34.240]  well wasn't played out he's got a couple hundred bucks a month off that so I
[3:52:34.240 --> 3:52:38.480]  mean I guess in a way it it's actually true I I mean I'm in Texas I got but I
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:45.720]  mean I'm not here saying global warming isn't real because I work for oil
[3:52:45.720 --> 3:52:56.920]  companies oil companies most of the big ones including Dutch Royal Shell BP Exxon
[3:52:56.920 --> 3:53:02.760]  mobile and in Google right now Exxon mobile in favor of carbon tax and
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:11.440]  endorses global warming I mean climategate is real I'm covering this
[3:53:11.440 --> 3:53:15.200]  because I don't want a two point six billion dollar tax on my electricity in
[3:53:15.200 --> 3:53:20.840]  the next three years in Austin but no no I work for the oil companies no I I
[3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:27.040]  work for me I don't own any stocks any bonds I work for Alex Jones and freedom
[3:53:27.040 --> 3:53:31.920]  and notice that we open the phones up and it's just got to be about Alex Jones
[3:53:31.920 --> 3:53:37.800]  and that's why we can't go anywhere because here's the deal people are
[3:53:37.800 --> 3:53:42.760]  waking up we're making giant strides but people who are caught in this infighting
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:50.320]  paradigm they can't make any strides because I was a form of illness or
[3:53:50.320 --> 3:53:57.720]  something I've always noticed we'll have FEMA camp documents and we post them and
[3:53:57.720 --> 3:54:02.880]  nobody wants to read them they're not popular but if I post a photo of something
[3:54:02.880 --> 3:54:06.040]  people might think as a camp there'll be a thousand comments and it'll go viral on
[3:54:06.040 --> 3:54:11.120]  the internet it's like speculation is always king is this guy a reptoid or
[3:54:11.120 --> 3:54:17.640]  are Chewbacobra's real or you know things like this and I'm here covering real
[3:54:17.640 --> 3:54:24.920]  news I'm here breaking news I'm here documenting I'm here just I'm here
[3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:28.520]  making award-winning films and giving them to you for free I hope you'll buy
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:35.520]  them on DVD at info wars.com and support us and it's just crazy you never talk
[3:54:35.520 --> 3:54:40.760]  about this organization but on this show you said this about it I mean it looks
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:45.200]  like a lot of its activities are bad and I said looks like it's a junior CFR I
[3:54:45.200 --> 3:54:50.520]  mean hell the CFR actually writes many of the laws like homeland security and
[3:54:50.520 --> 3:54:54.920]  others and immigration policy that are implemented word for word in law and I'm
[3:54:54.920 --> 3:54:58.920]  not saying the CFR runs everything it's this mental illness about well you know
[3:54:58.920 --> 3:55:01.840]  mainstream media every day attacks me every day there's an article saying
[3:55:01.840 --> 3:55:06.120]  Jones says it's the trial lateral commission Bilderberg group CFR club of
[3:55:06.120 --> 3:55:13.640]  Rome you in which is it Alex I didn't say that if you look at who heads up all
[3:55:13.640 --> 3:55:19.160]  those groups including the CMP and all these scores of groups it's literally
[3:55:19.160 --> 3:55:23.880]  like a hundred people that head up all the groups and that's how they control
[3:55:23.880 --> 3:55:29.360]  money and power and other politically active groups diverse groups everybody
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:35.080]  in the CFR isn't bad most of them are like porch mason's who are who were on
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:39.760]  the outside of the thing and and and this is the management I mean recurl
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:47.240]  quickly's book an insider he explains how all of this operates and so I'm here
[3:55:47.240 --> 3:55:53.320]  saying no the major Protestant groups the major Jewish groups the major Catholic
[3:55:53.320 --> 3:55:57.480]  groups most the major Arab countries are all part of this power alliance the
[3:55:57.480 --> 3:56:01.120]  globalists have got deals with the Chinese rulers it's the ruling class
[3:56:01.120 --> 3:56:08.240]  using systems of control to dominate the population and the ruling class uses
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:11.920]  big government and the threat of terror and other hoaxes like phony
[3:56:11.920 --> 3:56:15.640]  environmentalism as an excuse to get you to give up your life give up your
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:18.440]  freedom I mean I meant to get to this more today but here it is at the end
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:25.120]  here's an example information week DHS may scrap border patrol project the
[3:56:25.120 --> 3:56:29.000]  Department of Homeland Security is reevaluating a plan to add security
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:36.480]  cameras radar and sensors to patrol efforts along the US Mexican border well
[3:56:36.480 --> 3:56:40.160]  they only built 50 something miles of the 2000 plus mile fence they use the
[3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:44.200]  legals to do that but meanwhile all over the country they've got checkpoints 10
[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:49.480]  miles 20 miles 100 miles deep the border patrol searching citizens and here's an
[3:56:49.480 --> 3:56:55.440]  LA Times article about that today what American border agents search and seize
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:56:58.560]  it's the same thing as the TSA they take your cell phone they take your
[3:56:58.560 --> 3:57:03.200]  computer sometimes keep it two three months take their sweet time downloading
[3:57:03.200 --> 3:57:07.920]  everything off of without a warrant and giving it to law enforcement if they
[3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:11.880]  find anything they think is criminal they just grab your electronics and just
[3:57:11.880 --> 3:57:16.480]  do this and it says here they're going after citizens the border patrol was
[3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:23.600]  used up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania for the G20 in the last half in the last
[3:57:23.600 --> 3:57:26.720]  year and a half civil liberties groups and businesses travel leaders have
[3:57:26.720 --> 3:57:30.280]  complained about US border patrol agents broad authority to search and seize
[3:57:30.280 --> 3:57:34.680]  laptops other electronic gadgets carried by international travelers the new
[3:57:34.680 --> 3:57:39.320]  information details the extent to which this has happened and it's just a hellish
[3:57:39.320 --> 3:57:48.080]  article about how they're just grabbing thousands and thousands and thousands in
[3:57:48.080 --> 3:57:58.720]  one county on the borders the San Diego and in Mexico 1,644 devices from
[3:57:58.720 --> 3:58:01.720]  travelers entering and leaving the country according to data the American
[3:58:01.720 --> 3:58:07.920]  Civil Liberties Union and they took cell phones laptops digital cameras MP3
[3:58:07.920 --> 3:58:11.840]  players flash drives hard drives DVDs I mean they just sees whatever they want
[3:58:11.840 --> 3:58:15.080]  like their drugs and now they want to do this to vitamins I didn't get to John
[3:58:15.080 --> 3:58:18.720]  McCain he's got a bill to make us like Canada to start restricting vitamins
[3:58:18.720 --> 3:58:23.720]  see you're being attacked by the power elite you've got to get them back under
[3:58:23.720 --> 3:58:27.320]  the Constitution get that hedge of protection back around us and start
[3:58:27.320 --> 3:58:31.960]  slashing government instead they're raising taxes growing government the
[3:58:31.960 --> 3:58:36.560]  whole economy is falling apart the enemy is the new world order that's what
[3:58:36.560 --> 3:58:40.400]  we've got to get focused on and remove these systems instead of arguing all
