[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:45.000]  The spoken word is an extremely powerful mode of communication between humans. One of the oldest forms of communications, obviously.
[00:45.000 --> 01:03.000]  Other than a hormonal pheromone sense or primitive grunts and body language, it is probably the most essential form of communication and one of the big things that makes us human.
[01:03.000 --> 01:26.000]  But at the same time, speech cannot move at the speed of thought and connections and understandings. That's why when you attempt to instruct your children, many times they won't listen to you until they experience the bad thing that you've been warning them about.
[01:26.000 --> 01:34.000]  And it's the same thing with adults, it's the same thing with countries, with civilizations, with different races of men.
[01:34.000 --> 01:47.000]  And the more you learn about history, the more you learn about humanity, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the great heights, the incredible lows, the more the universe opens up to you.
[01:47.000 --> 01:56.000]  And that's really what's frustrating is that I don't see myself as particularly intelligent. I'm not on a power trip. I'm not arrogant.
[01:56.000 --> 02:08.000]  And then I see people who have very little knowledge and who almost attack knowledge and think that it's a feat or something.
[02:08.000 --> 02:25.000]  They believe they've got it all figured out and they don't even understand the basics of life on this planet, the basics of history, the basics of human activity, liberty, and the eternal struggle against tyranny.
[02:25.000 --> 02:42.000]  But it really hit me this weekend and I experienced something akin to the 100th Monkey Syndrome. That, of course, was studies done where they found that monkey populations that they could be trained on one island, an island 10 miles away,
[02:42.000 --> 02:55.000]  that as soon as a certain percentage of the monkeys were taught a new trick, it was almost like there was some spiritual broadcasting system in the sixth sense realm that studies do show is there.
[02:55.000 --> 03:11.000]  And the monkeys at the nearby island would suddenly have a critical mass and start manifesting the activity that had to be taught to the other group of monkeys but of the same species.
[03:11.000 --> 03:35.000]  And I think it's more simplified in modern technological terms just that things have a buzz. Certain issues become hot, certain issues ebb in their popularity and that the system has said many times there's no guessing the public's taste.
[03:35.000 --> 03:56.000]  There's no understanding it and that's really what the NSA is all about and Infopole 9 in Europe for decades has been calling your conversations, your phone calls, your purchases to really decide what you're into and really get your psychological number, your profile,
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  so they can then manipulate that profile and change that profile with the propaganda and programming they pump in.
[04:03.000 --> 04:20.000]  But also to see trends as they're developing in their embryonic phase in a viral stage growing so that trends the system doesn't like can be blocked or manipulated or mutated or co-opted.
[04:20.000 --> 04:35.000]  And there was a dinner party at my next door neighbors and I was invited to it and there were microbiologists there and marine biologists and people and it was very interesting.
[04:35.000 --> 04:51.000]  They didn't know who I was and they were all telling me about the, some of them were medical people doctors, they were telling me about basically the global extermination plan and I was like really, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  Big show today in a power pack with key information, the human revolution of liberty continues.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[05:33.000 --> 05:43.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  It's here.
[05:50.000 --> 05:58.000]  Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:20.000 --> 06:31.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today my friends.
[06:31.000 --> 06:46.000]  It is the 26th day of June 2011 on this live Sunday edition and we're here every Sunday broadcasting on AM FM, Global Sour Wave Satellite, internet at infowars.com.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  4 to 6pm back Monday through Friday 11am to 2pm central.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  Okay, let me do this.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  Let me just run over some of the headlines that we're going to be breaking down and giving you the news, behind the news, the story behind the story.
[07:00.000 --> 07:09.000]  The rest of the story is Paul Harvey famously said and then I'm going to get into our two top stories today.
[07:09.000 --> 07:16.000]  And one of those, of course, well, there's really three top stories. In fact, all these stories are pretty darn important.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  The more I think about it.
[07:18.000 --> 07:27.000]  What really happened Friday with the house saying, we're not going to authorize the Libyan War, but we're going to give you the funding for the Libyan War.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  It's another political stunt.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  And Ron Paul has broken that down.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  We're going to be breaking it down.
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  What is this signifying? Where is this constitutional crisis going?
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  In the words of Congressman Nadler and others, the president, for all intents and purposes, is now an emperor.
[07:46.000 --> 07:56.000]  And the bureaucracy around him and future presidents of Democrats were horrified by Bush's imperial activities.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  But now that it's their guy in, they love it.
[07:58.000 --> 08:05.000]  Republicans are horrified now by Obama's imperialist activity, emperor-like activity.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  And then once Republicans get back in, they'll suddenly love it.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  What is it about people that as long as they think their political team is winning, they don't care if the Bill of Rights and Constitution is butchered?
[08:16.000 --> 08:23.000]  Even though all of us are losing in the end, as long as they feel like they're winning, then it's okay.
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  There are emails all the time saying, you dirty Republicans, you need to shut up about the TSA groping people.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  And I'm like, dirty Republicans?
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  This is a nonpartisan, across-the-board issue, outraging everyone.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  It's a federal power grab.
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  It sets a precedent for goons to stick their hands down your pants.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  We got Miss USA crying.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  We've got old ladies having their diapers taken off.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  We've got people's colostomy bags being ripped off of their body.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  And you're sending me little sniveling emails about how I'm a dirty Republican.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  Why don't you live in reality?
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.000]  I'm a liberty lover.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  And I go after Republicans or Democrats when they attack that.
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  And when they're for it and they do the right thing, I will talk about it.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  I'm about issues.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  I'm about reality.
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  I'm about actual substance here, substance.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  So we're going to get into the whole U.S. House keeps Libya funding, fails to authorize mission.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  They now admit that the Patriot Act is being openly interpreted by the FBI.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  I mean, they don't need warrants for any activities against the American people.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  That's Time Magazine telling us how great it is.
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.000]  We've got also the big TSA developments.
[09:41.000 --> 09:57.000]  And I'll be honest with you, a month ago when I got angry that the House had unanimously done the right thing and said that it would be a felony if the TSA touched your genitals on the outside or on the inside of your pants.
[09:57.000 --> 10:06.000]  Because so many members of the House that had actually been groped or small children, they witnessed this concentration camp inductee training, this prisoner induction training.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  That's what it is, this federal power grab, Tenth Amendment killing induction.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  And so they got angry unanimously, 138 to zip.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  Then they had almost unanimous in the Senate, one vote against it, but they wouldn't let the vote come up.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  Dewhurst killed it.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  That was confirmed by Senator Patrick and others.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  Dewhurst got under heat.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  Perry got under heat.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  And so Perry waited till right to the end of the special session under huge national pressure, not just Texas pressure to put it back on.
[10:33.000 --> 10:43.000]  And then the Speaker of the House, Friday, called it a political stunt, said the legislation was a joke, even though he voted for it a month ago, and never gave any evidence of it.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.000]  I have the legislation.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  It says official oppression.
[10:46.000 --> 10:58.000]  The Attorney General said, why don't you change it from molestation, though it could be, to official oppression because of a police officer grabs your genitals unless it's an emergency situation or they have a warrant.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  They would be charged with a felony.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  So the TSA can't do it.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  And they said, OK, so they changed the bill.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  And they said, oh, wait till Friday.
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  It's OK.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  We'll vote on it.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  And then suddenly the Senate didn't show up.
[11:11.000 --> 11:19.000]  The leader of the House came out and said, I'm not going to let you vote on it, which violates state's House rules.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  And we've had David Simpson on who authored the bill many times.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  And last night he put out a press release breaking down the fact that it does violate state ethics rules and House rules.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  So, and Simpson also said, why even have a state legislature?
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  Why even have a state legislature?
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  Why even have House members or Senate members?
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  I mean, if it's only the governor, the lieutenant governor that runs the Senate and the speaker of the House, how about we just generally elect them?
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  Or how about just make them royal families?
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Not like North Korea.
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  They're now three generations of communist dictator now calling themselves royalty.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  That's how royalty started, standing with Queen Elizabeth's family hundreds of years ago.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  They're just dictators that wear gold crowns and you bow down to them.
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  I mean, why not?
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  Why not?
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  Why not?
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  In fact, the feds are saying they were going to blockade Texas again and threatening people and that they were going to sue the state of Texas.
[12:11.000 --> 12:21.000]  And so the speaker of the House, Joe Strauss, headline, House Speaker calls Pat down Bill a stunt.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  And then never says why it's a stunt.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  OK, so now it's a stunt, I guess.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  If members of the House of Representatives federally tell Obama, you've got to get congressional authorizations for a new war.
[12:34.000 --> 12:43.000]  And that's just the Constitution Bill writes the law because a week ago when the members of the House sued, it was called a stunt.
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  They have these political experts that these spin doctors say stunt or hoax sounds good for the public.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  You don't have to give any facts.
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  It's just a hoax at the House in the Federal Congress saying Obama, you've got to have authorization.
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  It's a hoax.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  It's a stunt.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  That's the same thing they're now saying in Texas.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  It's a hoax.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  It's a playbook, folks.
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.000]  It's totally sick.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  It's a hoax.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  It's a stunt.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  We're not going to give any reasons why we're saying that.
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  We just hope you won't read the bill that the Texas Attorney General helped write.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  Nothing hoaxy about it.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  You can't go up and grab a woman's genitals or a man's genitals in a park.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  You get felony time for that.
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  An FBI agent can't do it.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  A cop can't do it.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  A state trooper can't do it.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  A janitor, an auto mechanic.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  No one can do it.
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  In fact, doctors go to jail if they improperly touch women and they haven't gotten authorization first.
[13:40.000 --> 13:48.000]  But now in America, just the feds do what they want and they come out and call it a hoax.
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  So that's one of the other big stories.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  And this is up on DrudgeReport.
[13:53.000 --> 13:54.000]  DrudgeReport.com.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  It's also at infowars.com.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  And under this article, Drudge is linked to our report from Friday.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  Wow.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  Let me tell you, we've got about 2 million visitors from that one article on Drudge.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  There's nothing like it, folks.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  I can be on Nightline with my website plugged 10 times and no visitors compared to Drudge.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  Just amazing.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  But there's a big report up at Drudge.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  Texas lawmakers AWOL for vote on TSA groping.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  So that's coming up later in the broadcast and we're working on getting Simpson on him.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  He's not on today.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  State Rep.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  He'll be on tomorrow because the whole nation is watching this.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  But also up at Drudge, a news herald reporting out of Panama City, Florida.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  An early woman asked to remove adult diaper during TSA search.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  They held her for 45 minutes, forced her to get out of the wheelchair.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  Even though she was flying home to die with terminal leukemia.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  She begged them and of course said she couldn't get up.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  You can go read the whole article.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  I witness this in the airport all the time.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  It's like wolves always attack older weak sheep.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  It's like if it's an old person in a wheelchair who looks like they're about to die and they'll make them get up
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  and they won't let family help them.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  They'll start yelling, get up, get up.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  Some of them can't even talk because they're usually going home to die.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  And it just flips the steroid heads out.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  They start going, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  And they just, you know, pull the pants down, rip the diaper off, feces everywhere.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  You know, that's how they roll.
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  There's been many cases where they just rip the colostomy bags off them or the urology bags.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  Also, you've had to have your bladder removed.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  And then they say, what is this?
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  And they say it's my colostomy bag.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  And TSA just goes right in front of everybody and a spray of feces goes off across the floor.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  And they're like, why'd you do that?
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  And they're like, you just ripped my colostomy bag off.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  Get over there and sit down.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  We got to do this so Alcada don't get you.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  But the border wide open.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  But here's the story.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  Elderly woman asked her to remove adult diaper during TSA search.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  And then, of course, the stress of her having to get up out of her wheelchair.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  And she says here she's going home to die.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  She's going home to family in Michigan from Florida to die and to be buried at the family cemetery.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  You're going to pay Alcada.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.

[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,

[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.

[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  making production fast and simple.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[19:53.000 --> 20:17.000]  This is www.silverlungs.com.
[20:23.000 --> 20:43.000]  You know, I do have one correction to make, and as soon as I said it, I knew it wasn't reality-based.
[20:43.000 --> 20:49.000]  The TSA people look like, on average, the stereotype,
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  the bespeckled potbellied pedophile type.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  You know, the pedophile is always the same on the news.
[20:57.000 --> 21:05.000]  The little scraggly mustache, the potbelly, the weird feet eyes.
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  And that, you got to say, is the TSA typecast person.
[21:09.000 --> 21:15.000]  You know, some people look like they're tough guys in a uniform or whatever, like soldiers, that idea.
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  And sure, they can look roided out and crazed and crazy,
[21:19.000 --> 21:25.000]  but it's different than the pedophile or control freak brigade.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  But regardless of that, the feds know they're creating an army,
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  and this is being done in every other industrialized nation,
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  of people who enjoy A, having no common sense,
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  and standing beside radiation scanners all day,
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  that on record are going to kill them dead or in a hammer.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  Well, Matt, it'll be 20 years from now.
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  The feds will just, you know, block funding for their healthcare
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  like they've done for 9-11 emergency people.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  They'll tell them it's fine, you know, that brain tumor is healthier,
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  that just take your cancer, that's good for you.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  You know, there's too many people anyways, it's for the earth.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  But also that enjoy freaking people out, yelling at folks, getting in their face.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  Everybody I talk to that flies, even people that were pro-establishment,
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  you know, are freaked out by how they get yelled at.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Put your feet there, move here, go over there.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  I didn't say you could leave the scanner.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  And it's all about breaking your will and training it to be a slave.
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  But I wasn't joking about the stories, you can pull them up,
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  of the urine bags, the colostomy bags.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  I hate to talk about this, but this is happening.
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  The diapers, and I see it.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  And you've seen the other reports where people come there,
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  it's on record, they even have medical cards,
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  that in some cases they can't walk,
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  and they will deny quadriplegics in people from getting on a plane.
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  They say, sorry, you can't get up away from the wheelchair
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  to make sure you don't have a bomb.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  And they say, that's the end of it.
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  And a lot of times then they won't even let family help them get up.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  So you'll see an old person struggling, battling to get up.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  And that's what happened here with this 95-year-old woman
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  who has terminal leukemia and is going home to be with her family to die,
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  the report says. And they made her get up out of the wheelchair,
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  and so she soiled herself, and that made them angry.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  So they took her back in, strip-searched her,
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  and they got more upset that they had a diaper full of, you know,
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  a cancer patients.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  I mean, what do you expect, ladies and gentlemen?
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  And this just went on and on.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  And you can read her daughter who was with her,
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  who wasn't allowed to go in for the strip-search.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  See, if people started shoving me around
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  and taking my mother behind closed doors,
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  you're going to be dealing with the Incredible Hulk.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  And see, that's the problem, folks.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  They're setting up a system where they know you're going to resist
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  and they're going to be called a terrorist.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  You understand, you were called terrorists in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  If you didn't like Hitler, you were arrested as a subversive terrorist.
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  And that's just, that's what's been set up here.
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  Now, if you're a Walcovi and Wells Fargo laundering $376 billion in narcotics money,
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  you don't get in trouble.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  But if you are dying of cancer and going home to die
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  and you poop your pants, they're going to get angry.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  Even though they made you do it.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  But continuing here.
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  But don't worry, they're keeping it a safe from old ladies going home to die.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  So I feel a lot safer right now.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  And it's the political correctness.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  We don't do profiling.
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  No, all of you are scum.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  All of you are treated as terrorists.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  It doesn't matter if you have no criminal record like the 95-year-old woman does.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  That means you're worse.
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  But if your criminal record, you get hired to be working for the TSA.
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  And it says her mother, who was in a wheelchair, was asked to remove an adult diaper.
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  In order to complete the pat-down, when they found that it was soiled,
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  they took her behind closed doors for the full deal.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  And she goes, I understand why they have to put them through this kind of procedure, her daughter said.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  She said procedures are the same for everyone to ensure national security.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  And now they're rolling out on the streets of America.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  I've got the big news coming up in the next segment.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  I'm not even telling you what the subject is. Just stay with us.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  TSA cannot exempt any group from screening because we know from intelligence.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  Oh, you know Al-Qaeda was created by the big banks and works for the globalists to take our liberties away.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  Oh, you know it's a hit Larry and Reichstag event.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  Oh, you know from intelligence that all the major Al-Qaeda people are trained and protected by the Pentagon on record.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  Oh, you know from intelligence your boss has carried out 9-11.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  Oh, no, you're not.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  TSA cannot accept any group from screening because we know intelligence that there are terrorists out there that would exploit that vulnerability.
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  Yes.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  Now they're saying they may want to start chest x-rays because they may put bombs inside of you.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  Weber filed a complaint through the Northwest Florida's regional website.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  I'm not one that makes waves, but Daggummit, what is wrong?
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  This is wrong.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  People need to know next time it could be you.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  She went on to say, I can't believe this is happening in America.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  How is this happening?
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  So it's all about training you to be dehumanized, to be humiliated.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  And all the fake environmentalism is how humanity's ugly, humanity's stupid, humanity's a cancer.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  You've got to be bossed around everywhere.
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  Don't get a plastic bag.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  Don't get a paper one.
[26:14.000 --> 26:23.000]  You've got to buy one of our Barnes and Nobles plastic bags and have some nittying woman lean over you and try to make you guilty because you don't.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  Meanwhile, major corporations are doing things that are devastating the environment.
[26:28.000 --> 26:40.000]  And these very globalists are pushing more nuclear power plants and simply raising the level of what they say safe radiation is and covering it up and cross species, genetic engineering, and truly dangerous things.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  But then they want to lecture you how your activities bad so they can create this guilt complex to control you.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  You've got the war on males.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  I've got reports here.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  No him or her preschool fights gender bias.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  They say being male is inherently bad.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  This is associated press and that you're not allowed to call yourself a boy.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  And this is to quote help girls that matter.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  Girls are 60% of college graduates.
[27:03.000 --> 27:14.000]  I got the Atlantic monthly, the end of men celebrating that women are quote taking over when they try to divide men and women from each other.
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.000]  They're dividing the human species and they're selling women that globalism and tyranny is like mother's milk.
[27:21.000 --> 27:32.000]  See women now on average the way they're targeted in the psychology are the wives of the state and the bureaucracy and the eugenics cult.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  And all the rest of us are their children.
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  And this is not new.
[27:36.000 --> 27:48.000]  If you go back to Rome and I've talked about this a lot in the handbooks written by the Romans that have been republished or you go back to sugarcane plantations in Hispaniola, what's Dominican Republic today in Haiti.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  They have these manuals.
[27:50.000 --> 28:00.000]  You can go to library and get them on how to control black slaves and they reprinted themselves the Roman manuals on German slaves and other slaves are bringing into Rome.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  So understand the present.
[28:02.000 --> 28:12.000]  You've got to know the past and they said you bring in the men, you beat them, you kill the leaders, you beat the children and you tell the women, you keep them in line, you spy on them.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  And that's how you protect them and they bring the women into the house.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  And that's where you get the term of the house slave.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  And that's what women are today.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  They're the house slaves of the system and men by and large.
[28:23.000 --> 28:32.000]  And that's what the system is slated for you, whether you are sophisticated enough to understand that and defeat it and love your men, love your young boys, love your young girls, men love your women.
[28:32.000 --> 28:42.000]  Now men then are trained to act like little children to fit into that paradigm and the sports and the sitcoms and most men act like arrested development 12-year-olds.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  That is also part of it.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  So it's not women are bad or men are bad.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  It's that we're all the species.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  We are humanity.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  It's the male and female that make the species.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  We're completely symbiotic.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  There's no separation between us.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  So women, you might want to actually join humanity.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Realize the programming.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.000]  I have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[29:48.000 --> 29:53.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[29:53.000 --> 29:59.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[30:14.000 --> 30:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.

[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[31:14.000 --> 31:20.000]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[31:20.000 --> 31:28.000]  As of July 1st, eFoodsDirect is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storeable food on the planet.

[32:00.000 --> 32:04.000]  You may be arrested and or subjected to other police action.
[32:04.000 --> 32:09.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:12.000 --> 32:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[32:17.000 --> 32:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[32:24.000 --> 32:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[33:19.000 --> 33:41.000]  This is the most important subject I could cover, the most important subject I have ever covered.
[33:41.000 --> 33:52.000]  Then, getting into the next hour, I'm going to get back into the economic news, but also the TSA and the dirty tricks in Texas by the Republican Party to kill their own bills.
[33:52.000 --> 34:03.000]  And Ron Paul is exposing that at the federal level right now, how Republicans come out and deny the Libyan war authorization, but then authorize the funding.
[34:03.000 --> 34:14.000]  And it's all part of smoking mirrors, so they want to appear to be doing what you want while doing what the social engineers, the owners of the system, indeed are pushing.
[34:14.000 --> 34:23.000]  So we're going to look at Perry, Dewhurst, and others, and Joe Strauss, the Speaker of the House, and the Treasury they're involved in.
[34:23.000 --> 34:28.000]  Should I, quote, storm the Capitol again? As the media called it, we didn't really storm it.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  We marched in there and let them know who the boss was, because the Houston Chronicle lost an American statesman.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  A bunch of others have pointed out that was very effective.
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  With a two-hours notice, we got about 200 people there.
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.000]  What have we said we were going to all be there tomorrow at 3 o'clock?
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  They're set to try to vote in the Senate again, but look, I'll break down the dirty tricks next hour and get into all the other really big news.
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.000]  New York Times admits there never was a recovery and that we're basically in a serious recession.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  Forecasts for growth drop, some sharply.
[35:02.000 --> 35:14.000]  And we've also got some other news that I'm going to be going over, dealing with, as usual, the World Cup.
[35:14.000 --> 35:24.000]  I guess semifinals, what you can call them, the Gold Cup final there in California, the illegal alien population there,
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.000]  booed the Star Spangled Banner, and the awards ceremony was done in Spanish.
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.000]  And here in America, the American team was basically booed the entire time.
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.000]  And they interviewed folks, and they said we're not Americans, we're Mexicans.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  And we don't like America.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  And I guess in political correctness, I'm supposed to say, well, that's great, let's open the borders up even more.
[35:50.000 --> 36:00.000]  How wonderful that you're booing the American team during the Star Spangled Banner and booing throughout and then during the awards ceremony.
[36:00.000 --> 36:09.000]  And that's even gotten up the ire of ESPN and the LA Times.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  And again, it just illustrates, quite frankly, I'm way past all this, where you're from, what color you are,
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  and how they use fake nationalism to play ball off against each other.
[36:19.000 --> 36:27.000]  My point is, can you imagine if Americans behave like this?
[36:27.000 --> 36:35.000]  The issue is, the people in Southern California, A, don't consider themselves to be Americans, a large percentage,
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  but also do not like America.
[36:39.000 --> 36:46.000]  And they're very proud of the way Mexico runs and has operated and schoolchildren in Texas, in Massachusetts,
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  and in California cannot wear American flags at public schools.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  They're told to take them off, that is offensive to the illegal aliens.
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  And that's MSNBC, you remember all those headlines.
[36:57.000 --> 37:05.000]  See, I'm already digressing. You know what? I can't even do justice to the information I'm about to cover.
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.000]  I can't even do justice to it. I could barely sleep last night.
[37:11.000 --> 37:23.000]  I was quiet all day and couldn't even really sit there on the floor and paint and draw and do things with my children like I normally do.
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.000]  Totally focused, absolute clarity and understanding of the entire agenda, how it all ties together.
[37:31.000 --> 37:39.000]  Five, six pages of notes I wrote could hardly eat my lunch, and I like to eat because I'm so freaked out by this,
[37:39.000 --> 37:49.000]  by how absolutely right I am and how proven right we have been all along on this subject.
[37:49.000 --> 38:01.000]  And I don't even know how to try to address this to you because I don't want to just sit here and tell you that this is my view
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  without then literally giving you the mountains of evidence.
[38:06.000 --> 38:13.000]  I don't want to say the ruling class is guilty of a global plan to set up world government and carry out total extermination
[38:13.000 --> 38:20.000]  because if you really get into their internal documents, some of which are public, they publicly say they want to kill 80%
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  in a lot of their internal writings, but they're still public and they say 90%, but more and more they say everyone is going to be killed
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  and there will be no humans left on earth, including the global elite, and you're like, what are you talking about?
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  Well, I'm not the one that wrote this. I'm not the one that said this.
[38:38.000 --> 38:48.000]  I'm not the one that NASA's official policy is this, Google's official policy, Microsoft's official policy,
[38:48.000 --> 38:56.000]  and whether it's real or not, I mean, whether they're going to be able to do this or not, these lunatics say that
[38:56.000 --> 39:09.000]  within the next 15 years, they are going to merge with machines and become gods and blast off to Alpha Centuries
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  and that all of us are going to be killed.
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  And if you're a new listener, I mean, I made the film Endgame about this from their writings
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  and I'm not talking about obscurest writings here.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  And so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to cover other news for the rest of the hour. I'm just going to do TSA and other things now.
[39:34.000 --> 39:42.000]  I'm going to reset and like seven after next hour when we come in into the second hour, I'm going to try to really focus
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  and try to get that crystalline point in my mind again where I can go through all of this brainstorm.
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  I mean, I've had like a 24-hour brainstorm here and I don't even know how to describe it to you.
[39:54.000 --> 40:02.000]  I was already thinking about how this is the biggest issue. It's the only issue. Everything else is just pieces of that overall
[40:02.000 --> 40:13.000]  compartmentalized superstructure and how much evidence we've got and what we got out of Bilderberg this year and the whole transhumanist agenda.
[40:13.000 --> 40:22.000]  And then if I don't put on all the evidence or at least a large portion of it for you, new listeners won't understand how grave this is.
[40:22.000 --> 40:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't enjoy being out with friends on a jet boat. I can't enjoy a beautiful vista anymore.
[40:29.000 --> 40:39.000]  I can't think about petty or stupid things. I only have overall shame that I know this level of information
[40:39.000 --> 40:52.000]  and I have not like a monk or something done nothing but dedicate myself 24 hours a day in a completely pious, focused way to reveal this information to you.
[40:52.000 --> 41:00.000]  I mean, it's that big. I'm like, why me? Why am I the person that analyzed this? Why am I the person that accurately broke it down?
[41:00.000 --> 41:08.000]  Why am I one of the only prominent people speaking out against it when it's all there, like the back of a cereal box?
[41:08.000 --> 41:17.000]  And they tell us in horrific, clear-cut statements what they're going to do.
[41:17.000 --> 41:33.000]  And when you go to the different publications that push this transhumanist agenda, that's just the modern public packaging of Neo-Malthusian eugenics.
[41:33.000 --> 41:42.000]  They're all, every time you track them, these head eugenics people are married to their wife who's a top scientist working on airborne Ebola.
[41:42.000 --> 41:48.000]  And then you go to another group and they're obsessed with airborne weapons to kill us and they talk about it.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  And they get funding from the government to quote, create defenses for it, which they will.
[41:53.000 --> 42:01.000]  It's defenses for them when they release it. And God help us, folks, because they're going to start releasing this stuff very, very soon.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  They've already released some other soft kills that were just beta tests, like HIV and things.
[42:06.000 --> 42:13.000]  And the UN constantly gets caught injecting kids with live syphilis and live smallpox and live polio.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  And it's in the news. Oh, another UN accident. Thousands of kids injected and died with weaponized polio.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  Oopsie. Oh, yeah, the UN got caught injecting kids with a sterilant with their vaccine.
[42:25.000 --> 42:36.000]  Oh, well, there's too many of them anyways. And to know that this big study came out earlier this week, now last week,
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  where the US has the highest infant mortality because of vaccines.
[42:41.000 --> 42:51.000]  And then to have to see this new Ray Kurzweil movie coming out where they put out kind of the candy coated version of it.
[42:51.000 --> 43:00.000]  Well, the transcendent man is a hoax. It's a bear trap for humanity. This whole wirehead system's a kill switch.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[43:12.000 --> 43:21.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[43:21.000 --> 43:29.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[43:34.000 --> 43:42.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[43:46.000 --> 43:52.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[43:52.000 --> 44:07.000]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[44:29.000 --> 44:36.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[45:56.000 --> 46:08.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[46:13.000 --> 46:19.000]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[46:27.000 --> 46:34.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[46:40.000 --> 46:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[47:30.000 --> 47:36.000]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[47:42.000 --> 47:52.000]  Look at your young men fighting. Look at your women crying. Look at your young men dying.
[47:52.000 --> 48:13.000]  Now, there's the prisonplanet.com article on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers. If not, you're a radio listener. Just go to prisonplanet.com and you can read the report. We'll put it back on screen.
[48:13.000 --> 48:23.000]  The United States, which administers the highest number of vaccines in the developed world, also has the highest numbers of infant deaths in the developed world.
[48:23.000 --> 48:33.000]  A shocking new study published in a prestigious medical journal has found a direct statistical link between higher vaccine dose and infant mortality rates in the developed world,
[48:33.000 --> 48:44.000]  suggesting that the increased number of inoculations being forced upon children by medical authorities, particularly the United States, which administers the highest number of vaccines and also has the highest number of infant deaths,
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  is in fact having a detrimental impact on health, also the IQ.
[48:50.000 --> 49:03.000]  Look at people now. They look most of them like they're mildly retarded and they act like it too. The study entitled infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given.
[49:03.000 --> 49:20.000]  Is there a biochemical and synergistic toxicity was conducted by Neil Z. Miller and Gary S. Goldman. It was published in the reputable human and experimental toxicology journal, which is indexed by the National Library of Medicine.
[49:20.000 --> 49:33.000]  According to the biography, Goldman has received a review for the Journal of the American Medical Association vaccine goes through all his degrees and reviews and British Medical Journal.
[49:33.000 --> 49:45.000]  He is included in the editorial board of research and reviews and bioscience Miller, a medical research journalist and the director of the think twice global vaccine initiative has been studying the dangers of vaccines for 25 years.
[49:45.000 --> 49:59.000]  And it goes through government numbers on infant mortality. The United States just a few decades ago was the safest in the world. Now we're the worst in the industrialized world behind a whole bunch of third world nations.
[49:59.000 --> 50:11.000]  Well, it just so happens. Why are these guys even doing studies? I have the Rockefeller Foundation documents 1966 about how they developed the vaccines to lower IQ and reduce fertility.
[50:11.000 --> 50:19.000]  And how they're doing it. But I mean, I've got Bertrand Russell, a Nobel Prize winner, writing reports on how they were going to do this.
[50:19.000 --> 50:36.000]  I mean, that's what my film in game blueprint for global enslavement covers. It's not hard to research this. That's what's so frustrating is that is that is that we've gone over this and we understand what's happening.
[50:36.000 --> 50:47.000]  And this country has the sudden death infant sudden death syndrome, where they end up trying to charge the parents saying they shook their kid because they have bleeding on the brain.
[50:47.000 --> 50:58.000]  And or then they claim that it's the mattress killing. I mean, now the major studies have been out for many years that they've kept it quiet, though, that they give the child rounds of shots.
[50:58.000 --> 51:07.000]  They have an autoimmune response and have hemorrhaging in the brain and they die. But it turns out the vaccine inserts say it can do that to you.
[51:07.000 --> 51:17.000]  I mean, I know several radio host in Austin who ended up calling me and basically apologizing and saying one of them did it on air.
[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  He said, I thought you were a cook, but I took the flu shot in my hands and feet went numb for a couple months.
[51:22.000 --> 51:28.000]  And I went to the doctor and he said, yeah, you had a mild form of Guillain beret. Lucky, it didn't kill you from that.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  I mean, they had it. That was Dale Dudley. The other one didn't want me to talk about it on air.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  I mean, listen, in the trials of Gardasil, it killed a lot of people that took it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  And then Rick Perry comes out and says, it's the law you got to take it, which was a hoax.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  Wasn't the law. Then Rick Perry, of course, the former campaign manager for Al Gore.
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  Oh, you didn't know that? The guy that got a law passed to pay in state tuition for illegal aliens.
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.000]  Vicente Fox came here in what? 2005? No, 2004? No, 2005.
[51:59.000 --> 52:07.000]  I have video of it to give him an award. And secretly, he'll introduce abortion legislation and kill it.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  It's all part of acting like he's this big patriot.
[52:11.000 --> 52:19.000]  He'll introduce legislation to do all sorts of things that sound great and quietly kill it.
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.000]  And I'll be covering that later on the whole TSA issue. But I'll be honest with you, I start thinking to myself,
[52:24.000 --> 52:31.000]  why don't we even want to go down and confront the TSA minions, the state of Texas, their servants,
[52:31.000 --> 52:39.000]  and demand they do the right thing when I know there's a systematic global program to soft kill people in the west.
[52:39.000 --> 52:48.000]  That means kill you over a long period of time, give you a binary weapon injection, a lot of different things they do.
[52:48.000 --> 52:54.000]  And then I'm worried about the federal power grab and TSA's taking their hands down your pants.
[52:54.000 --> 53:02.000]  But then I realize, no, I've got to fight on all fronts because if the feds ever get backed off on any other power grabs,
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.000]  the world will learn that they're not invincible, that they're not God.
[53:07.000 --> 53:13.000]  And that's why they've sent federal lobbyists down here in the last month to twist arms and threaten people
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  so that Texas doesn't lead the nation in states saying no to the feds.
[53:18.000 --> 53:25.000]  Because if the states ever get back into their proper role, there goes the foreign banks that have captured D.C.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  and hence the rest of the nation through fraud.
[53:28.000 --> 53:34.000]  So they can never let states have any victory. They've always got to press more and more insane garbage on people.
[53:34.000 --> 53:41.000]  And that's why Perry would do something so brazen, so naked to try to hand over 8,000 miles of Texas roads to toll roads
[53:41.000 --> 53:48.000]  for foreign companies that had bought off the legislature, even though it was incredibly unpopular in Texas,
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  was because it's an agenda and it's not his job to serve the people or to care about Texas.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  It's not Obama's job. It's not Newt Gennrich's job. It wasn't Bill Clinton's job.
[53:57.000 --> 54:03.000]  It's their job to make you think they represent you while they stab you in the back.
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.000]  And they're into dimes worth of divorce between Al Gore and his former campaign manager.
[54:07.000 --> 54:13.000]  Oh, you didn't know that? That's Texas Monthly Wall Street Journal. Just type in Rick Perry, former Al Gore campaign manager.
[54:13.000 --> 54:19.000]  Oh, you didn't know he supported sanctuary cities. See, he's the one to help get it in in Texas.
[54:19.000 --> 54:27.000]  Under the guise of a banking act letting them not have IDs to get bank accounts and the in-state tuition.
[54:27.000 --> 54:34.000]  But see, now he has bills that, oh, magically, you know, are on the verge of getting defeated or won't get implemented.
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.000]  And, oh, it's a number one priority, he said a month ago, to have that TSA bill.
[54:39.000 --> 54:45.000]  And then they pass it unanimously in the House, so he has the Senate kill it through Dewhurst.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  Dewhurst tells senators, don't let folks know I'm doing this with a governor. Keep this secret.
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.000]  That comes out. I have state reps on and I go, you know Perry's going to kill it this week.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  You know he's going to pull it in there. Oh, I want to believe in the governor.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  David Simpson and others said, the author of the bill. I said, you watch.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  Simpson had to come out in the Austin American statesman and other papers yesterday and today and say,
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  unfortunately, the governor has, is behind this and I'm really shocked by it.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  Well, don't be shocked by Al Gore's former chief of staff.
[55:12.000 --> 55:20.000]  I mean, he's here to bring down this country. He's here to fool conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalists.
[55:20.000 --> 55:27.000]  If they can't beat us, they join us. But they, I mean, you know, there were Germans that infiltrated this country in World War Two
[55:27.000 --> 55:34.000]  that spoke perfect English and wore U.S. Army uniforms. It didn't mean that, you know, they didn't need to be caught on base
[55:34.000 --> 55:41.000]  trying to blow up ammo depots in New York. You're like, but they speak good English and they're wearing American uniforms.
[55:41.000 --> 55:47.000]  Well, Rick Perry talks good talk about shooting coyotes and the Second Amendment and Texas's secession.
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.000]  It's all theater. It's all theater. And so then he got caught lying a week and a half ago.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  There's not time on the session and we don't have the votes.
[55:57.000 --> 56:03.000]  And so he got open letters sent to him going, we have super majorities. We're ready to pass it.
[56:03.000 --> 56:09.000]  And so he said, okay, I'll put it on, but I'll put it on Friday when they only have a couple days left this week.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  They have to suspend the third reading to even get it passed now.
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.000]  So he's running out the clock on us. It's like having a coach that's been paid off by the mafia to make your team lose.
[56:18.000 --> 56:25.000]  And he's got to act like he's making good plays, but people keep catching him, you know, dropping the ball intentionally.
[56:25.000 --> 56:34.000]  And Ron Poles on record saying it's the same thing. U.S. House keeps Libya funding fails to authorize mission.
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  So they actually give them the money, but then say they don't authorize it because they weren't asked to authorize it.
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  Ron Paul slams absurd Libya war powers debate.
[56:44.000 --> 56:51.000]  And it goes on to say that today Paul told his colleagues that the limited funding bill was not what it appeared to be.
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  Paul argued that the Libya bill masquerades as a limitation on funds for the president's war on Libya.
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  But in fact, there's an authorization for what? For the very war.
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  It's the same thing in Texas. You got Al Gore's little darling in there.
[57:06.000 --> 57:13.000]  Mr. Sanctuary City, who's fighting the Sanctuary Cities, but getting awards from the Mexican president for them.
[57:13.000 --> 57:21.000]  You got a guy who tries to force little girls to take deadly vaccines, all part of this agenda of power grabs.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  You got a guy who got all these new taxes passed, double the size of Texas government in the budget in his 10 years.
[57:27.000 --> 57:35.000]  And he tells us Texas has green grass and that cows are healthy and there's prosperity because of him.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  Okay? Again, that's how they do it.
[57:38.000 --> 57:45.000]  And that's why until people grow up and get smart and actually research the deep facts, you'll continue to be bamboozled.
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[57:52.000 --> 58:01.000]  The folks at eFoods Direct have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.000]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[58:05.000 --> 58:11.000]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[58:11.000 --> 58:19.000]  As of July 1st, eFoods Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storeable food on the planet.
[58:19.000 --> 58:28.000]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.
[58:28.000 --> 58:35.000]  Your time is running out to build your supply with the best food on the planet at last year's prices with eFoods Direct.
[58:35.000 --> 58:40.000]  Call 800-409-5633. Prices go up at the end of June.

[58:43.000 --> 58:50.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  Saving means to make money.
[59:00.000 --> 59:09.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[59:09.000 --> 59:17.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes deodorants, or antibacterials.
[59:17.000 --> 59:25.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[59:25.000 --> 59:30.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[59:30.000 --> 59:38.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[59:38.000 --> 59:48.000]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  Okay, I'm getting into the transhumanist cult and that's who runs the planet.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  That's the modern name of the eugenicist.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  Julian Huxley changed the name when he was the head of the United Nations UNESCO program and wrote a big white paper that we linked to in in-game.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  What is the in-game dot com?
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  The online bibliography.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  That's what's so crazy about this is I've got, all I do is read their internal handbooks and stuff that's public.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  They think they've beaten us so bad that they don't even care.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  They just prance around publicly and I was at a dinner party last night and it was biologists, little molecular biologists, doctors, you name it.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  They were telling me about all this and it just reminded me of just how widespread this is and how it's being rolled out in the public.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  It was marine biologists as well.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  I forgot that one.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  But that's all these people talk about and that's all anybody with a PhD talks about.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  And most of them, I've noticed in the past, thought they were going to be part of it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  These folks knew they weren't.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  They all acted like folks that knew they were getting ready to be lined up in front of a firing squad.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Wantum was a consultant to big corporations and government and he knew all about it and was pretty freaked out.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  But they didn't even know who I was.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  They knew because they worked in and around these people.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  And that's why you'll notice none of these people have children.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  They told me about going dark and how most of the intelligence is just preparing to die.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Meanwhile, you've got the general public running around telling you about basketball and football
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  and the average male driving around acting tough in their truck.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Meanwhile, they're poisoning your food, your water, you're under full attack.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  I can't handle it anymore.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  I'm sorry, it's coming up.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  This makes me rethink everything.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  I mean, I'm a guy who's been a trailblazer exposing it all, but it's just how real it is.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  They're really doing it.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  They're really...
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  I want to go to this two-minute video.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Rochester police ticket supporters of women arrested for recording cop.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  In Rochester, New York, if you dare protest against the thuggish behavior of the local cops,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  you might get a big fat ticket.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  For radio listeners, they've got like five or six squad cars pulled up at a community event
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  for support of the woman arrested for filming police from her own yard, Emily Good.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  And Kurt goes on to say, this is what you would expect in a communist country
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  or some ten-horm dictatorship, not in America.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And the cops are out with rulers, and if they're 12 and a half inches out from the curb,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  it's big, wide streets.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  They give them tickets, and it's big, tough cops with tattoos getting off on it.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  If they're going to show you for putting that viral video out,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  they're going to show you trying to stand up, they're going to show you little people,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  they're going to videotape you and listen to your phone calls,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  but you're not going to videotape them.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  So here they are trying to politically persecute the folks that were meeting to defend this woman.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  I mean, this is beyond evil. Here it is.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  Imagine, they got better things to do.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Crimes going on all over Rochester, high crime.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  W80, W94, W74.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  And all these cop cars, they're giving them tickets.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Again, riding them parking tickets for being more than a foot out from the curb.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  12 inches from the curb.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  You have a ruler, because I don't think this is 12. Can I see it? Can I see the ruler?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Okay, that's 12 inches from the curb.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Oh, about a half inch. Yeah, I guess it's about a...
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Oh, really? You had civilian complaints?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Civilian. You're scum.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  The parking being further than 12 inches from the curb.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Could you make sure you get that one please?
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Look how they swagger like goons.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  A law that's suddenly being enforced.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  I've been in third world countries and seen that look.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Those cops are our brothers, though.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  They don't know they're being poisoned.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  They don't know they're being killed. They don't know whose team they're on.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  They're like little boys.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  I'm sorry you guys are this upset about what one of your officers did that you have to behave this way.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  That's a Rochester into media.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Alright, we'll be right back and get into the big enchilada.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  And I'm gonna tell you...
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  I'm not...
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  As bad as this is gonna sound, I can't describe to you how much worse it is, okay?
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  There's no way to really give you the full story. Stay with us.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  I want to beg you to get a pen and paper
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  because without your help and without my help, without us working together and facing the facts
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  and knowing the facts and then realizing how full-spectrum this scientific attack on humanity is
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  and what the in-game is of the globalist and what there beyond the in-game program is,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  as I say on the back cover of in-game, for the New World Order, world government is only the beginning.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  Once their planetary regime is in place, they will exterminate the majority of the planet,
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  the elite will then merge with machines and become a new species.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Now, that sounds completely insane. I'm not the one saying it.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  Ted Turner, the heads of Google, Bill Gates, Ray Kurzweil, William Shatner, all of them.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  They have big giant closed-door conferences with thousands of these people at them
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  and they all write books, world government is coming, we're going to get insane.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  And you're not going to have a choice and this is the way it is
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  and we're going to save the earth through this no matter how much GMO we put out, even if it hurts the earth,
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  it's all natural because whatever humans do is part of evolutions.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  But then, meanwhile, they sell us fake environmentalism to give up our rights,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  to let them shut down our industry, to only control us.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  So it's a very sophisticated issue, but you can see it mirrored in primitive times
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  when the Romans didn't like a group of people, they conquered, they would just kill everyone.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  The Israelites were told, go in, kill everybody, take over the land.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  Every culture, different Native American tribes would just kill the entire tribe.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  The Aztecs would do that.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  So this is something that oligarchies and corrupt elites do.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  I mean, they're like, we're going to win this war 100%, we're going to kill the entire opposition.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  But this comes out of Malthusian and then Darwinistic ideas of social Darwinism,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  that it's their right to do this to us because if they can fool us and get this done,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  then they're doing evolution of favor by wiping us out and that they're going to merge and become this new species.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Now, what kicked off this brainstorm is I've known this has been the central issue for 16 years
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  I've been on air from reading their own publications.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  And that first head of the UN UNESCO program, Julian Huxley and others, who said,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Hitler made us look bad as eugenicists, we're going to call it transhumanism,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  and sell the public on us controlling them with chemicals, biologicals and also electronic systems,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  as it being a new level of humanity.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  But really the systems we're going to engineer, so they theoretically developed it,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  will surveil them, control them and track them and predict what they're going to do as an electronic straightjacket to help phase them out.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  And diet, injections and injunctions, what we put in their GMO food, what we inject them with,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  and how we train them, will have them believe that humanity is bad as a group collective
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  and accept that it's good that humanity is soon going to be annihilated.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  And they have all these TV shows for kids and adults, the world without humans,
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  how great it's going to be, humans are a parasite, a disease,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  you're being given a collective dose of psychological death to believe this is all good
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  and also hate your fellow man, not have the idea of humans reaching for something greater,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  seeing the beauty of art and music and mathematics and honoring inventors in science.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  They're talking about dishonoring all of that, the scientific dictatorship,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  having a breakaway civilization under global national security, corporate security,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  that we are not allowed to be transcendent and inner.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Now, whether any of this is actually going to happen or not, this is what the entire modern infrastructure,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  pre-computer, biometrics, 150 year old science, four genetics and racial hygiene,
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics Lab, the human genome project, four global extermination,
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  four race-specific bioweapons. All of this, the founder of IBM, the first computers,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  the Hollerith machines, were to decide how to round up blacks and kill them.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Then Hitler said, I love it, and IBM, Mr. Watson sent technicians to Germany
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  and throughout the war, and that was what the Jews and others had on their arm,
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  was a number to be entered in the IBM machine to decide how long to work them for you to kill them.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  Now, we just have an NSA Google model that's tracking everybody,
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  figuring out exactly who you really are, what's going to be done to you,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  how it's all standardized, babies' blood for now 39 years, taken secretly, globally,
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  global government set up more than 50 years ago, total standardization,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  they're mopping up the few final countries they don't control.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  Now, that said, I'm going to go to this video clip.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  I met this dinner party with next-door neighbors, I get invited over there,
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  and they had marine biologists and binocular biologists and doctors and corporate integration team leader,
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  fusion PhDs, and none of them knew who I was, which is a rarity, except for folks who invited me,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  and they were there working with some filmmakers is why I was invited,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  and they said, Alex, what we're worried about if you're a talk show host is the thing that
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  the hospitals have really been set up to kill people now,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  but it's compartmentalized, the doctors don't even know,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  and that it's more dangerous to go to the hospital than to not,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  and this is all being engineered in, and as Ray Kurzweil saying,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  they're about to merge with machines, and the technology is doubling now every year,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  and computers will be a trillion times faster than humans within 20 years,
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  and the future doesn't need us, and the global elite plan to do all of this,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  and I said, no, I know about all that, and I told the guy a few things,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  he was, wow, you know about that, and I said, yes, and he says,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  well, how do you fight going dark, like so many other people are doing,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  and I said, what do you mean?
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  He goes, well, so many people that are learning about this, there's the decision to join it,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  or there's the decision to go dark and just spend the time you've got with your family,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  and just prepare for all of this,
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  and he said, well, the way we're going to be able to beat the machines, as Kurzweil says,
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  is because they're going to be so much faster as we much merge ahead of time,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  so there's a race of who will merge first, so it's like an arms race, but it's a tech race.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  Now, again, whether all of this is really going to happen or not, and much of it has,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Kurzweil, and we'll play when we come back from break,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  Kurzweil has a new movie coming out that everybody's sending me and hyping,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  and have you ever heard of this? Yeah, I made a film about it four years ago,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  and not just with Kurzweil's quotes, and it's this happy-go-lucky thing about,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  he's optimistic about humanity, and we're going to merge with machines,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  and the t-shirt they sell is get ready for evolution, and it's the next level.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  What they don't tell you is Kurzweil and all these people,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  and his main benefactor is Google and Bill Gates,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  Bill Gates's daddy, government and army intelligence, and then the head of Planned Parenthood,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  and Gates is openly trying to produce vaccines that are delivered through mosquitoes,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  so you can't get away from it and saying, we need zero human growth,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  and I mean, this is a really nasty guy, but it's always packaged in how sweet and loving it is.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  For the general public, the unwashed masses, the football fans,
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  for the intelligentsia mid-level, it's, well, we got to get rid of the general public
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  because they're hurting the earth, but then, for the higher level crust,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Hollywood, you know, the heads of Google, others, they're openly told,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  that's why Hollywood's so into my show, because they were told this stuff years ago in secret
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  at these meetings, and now they hear me talking about it, making films about it,
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  because I reverse engineered the whole thing, and they're like,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  wow, how do you know about this? By the way, I've had as big as it gets in media contact me
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  in the last few weeks, we're going to see if we get them on the show,
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  but they're really waking up, but not because of me, because they're at the highest levels,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  they're hearing all this, they're being invited in, okay?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  And they're getting very close to this, folks. Now, they think you're stupid
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  and won't be smart enough to look into all this and find out I'm telling you the truth.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  They think they got you, okay? Well, I say we can't give human development over to these people
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  without at least a debate, and these people have shown themselves to be so sadistic
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  and wicked and hateful and reckless that they should not be directing human development.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Let me just give you a few headlines before we go to break through what I'm talking about.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  Ray Kurzweil, the head futurology school backed by NASA and Google.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  Well, Google is an NSA slash DARPA NASA program.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  What is the official NASA policy now?
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Post-industrial world shutting off your family, killing you. Go look it up.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  Here's CNN, the smartest futurist on Earth.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Legendary inventor Ray Kurzweil is right.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  The future will be a lot brighter and weirder than you think.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  So they're going to shell these nightmare things they're about to do to us
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  with this public thing about, oh, it's this little genius, Ray Kurzweil.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Kurzweil didn't come up with hardly any of this. He just put a modern spin.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  There were theorists 150 years ago in England who envisioned all of it.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  The folks at eFoods Direct have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  As of July 1st, eFoods Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storeable food on the planet.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  Your time is running out to build your supply with the best food on the planet at last year's prices with eFoods Direct.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  Prices go up at the end of June.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  At least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  Okay, so almost four years ago in my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  It's the blueprint from their own stated plans.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  The film has WhatIsTheInGame.com or in-game-the-movie.com that has an online bibliography for the whole documentary.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  And unfortunately, the documentary has only been seen around 10 million times for free on the internet.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  And people are like, unfortunately, that isn't a lot. No, it's not.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  Films like The Obama Deception over 30 million times, Fall of the Republic over 20 million times,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  some of my other films more than 15 million times.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  In-game is the most important film I've ever made. Period. Period. And it's evergreen.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  It's more powerful today than when I made it four years ago. And it's all their words.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  The most powerful people in the world, all they talk about is not dying.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Of course, use common sense. I mean, 20 years ago, they sent the size genetically perfect, cloned human growth hormone.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  Can you imagine what they've got now? Well, under this global government system, you're not going to get access to that.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  And they already have life extension systems if you follow these regimens.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  And if you don't get, you know, your head chopped off in a car accident where you'll be able to live several hundred years.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  And if you're able to do that, and they practice all this medicine on us, then it gets compartmentalized.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  What works is given to them, we get all the garbage.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  Then the other going after our health food, minerals, things that would help us to block the public from getting it.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  What would you do if you were a billionaire? What would you do? What would you do?
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  Well, you would see the rest of the public as scum. You would go to these big meetings.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  You would be told, join the world government. Join the collectivist elite program.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  And we'll transfer the general public's wealth to you. We'll wipe them out and orderly compartmentalize function while we pose as the saviors.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  And they're going to have, instead of drug enforcement, they're going to have brain augmentation enforcement.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  People are going to be getting arrested for augmentation that's illegal.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  And you'll be happy to not have kids ever again if you're given a nice apartment left alone and are allowed to hook into a system that gives you unlimited pleasure.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  You're not going to want to even go on and live. And they have forecast all of this.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  And so all the tech they're selling us has back doors and spying systems built into it.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  And all the tech that Kurzweil and others are going to turn loose.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  NASA, Google, Microsoft funding all of this on you is going to be almost impossible to turn down.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  And this is just one level of the technology while they get the real stuff.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  And they write about that like you're an idiot.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  Here is the new trailer for the new Kurzweil movie.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  Remember, this is coming out in August.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  And I got laughed at for saying once they have their world government, they believe they'll be able to live forever.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  That's all from Google, from Schmidt, and Gates, and Turner, and all of them.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  Prince Philip, Prince Charles, it's all they do. 24-7.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  They don't take vaccines. They don't eat GMO food.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  They have their own farms. They admit it. They have emergency underground seed vaults for after they've wrecked everything to redesign it.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  These people are crazy. The point is, I'm not the crazy one reporting this to you.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  All right, all right, here's the trailer. Here it is.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  The reason I'm calling today is to express my disappointment that you have invited this highly sophisticated crackpot
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  and given him a national forum to express his pseudo-religious predictions that have no basis in objective reality.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  Now a lot happens in six months. Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  It's going to continue. In about 40 years, it's going to be moving so fast.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  The pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  unless you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we created.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  This guy is freaky. He says computers will have consciousness in just 25 years.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  As we get to the 2030s, you're not going to be able to tell a clear difference between human and machine intelligence.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  The big question of life is who are we? What are we going to become? What's the future like?
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  One of the most incredible track records in history for us to predict pretty darn good accuracy.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  He's an award-winning scientist and engineer, a millionaire several times over because of his inventions.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  These inventions may end up causing the worst war that humanity's ever had.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  Corporations and governments and societies will be created and destroyed on the back of the technology that this world describes.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Inventor Ray Kurzweil thinks that one day humans may be able to live forever.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  I want to live as long as I can. I don't want to die.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  If funneling Ray's regimen would put that day off, I'm very willing to do that.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  I knew there was a reason I was keeping all this stuff and he kept all this stuff.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  I do plan to bring back my father.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  God is who is and our challenge should be to know him, not try to create him.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  I'm afraid of you.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  It's going to scare a lot of people.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  The world is changing far too fast. Nothing like this has ever happened to almost sapiens before.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  These ideas are going to ultimately change the world.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  We didn't stay on the ground. We didn't stay on the planet.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  We didn't stay with the limitations of our biology.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  I think Ray is performing the service of a prophet.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  That's wrong.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  He has used the gift that he was given.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  And they go on to say he's revealing our destiny. He did all of this.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, over 150 years ago, British scientists wrote out this entire plan.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  Galton and others, you can go follow it.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  It's an in-game, right through the founding of the UN, a global mop-up system to set up a global tyranny,
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  cut off the resources.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  They wrote about carbon taxes 100 years ago.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  They've had this whole thing planned and you've got to give it to them.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  They have been planned. They have been focused.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  They've got their guru, their little front man out there.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  Notice he says 40 years in this film, in his books.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  And what he really says is that this has basically already happened to some degree.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  And he talks about there will be a total world government and how great it's going to be by 2020.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  He says the computers will see us as a mosquito and will swat us and that once they merge with the computers,
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  that they're going to swat us and it won't even matter because they're going to be gods compared to us.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  I mean, you want to hear what they really are saying, but you watch this and it's how cute it is.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  It's how funny it is. It's how sweet it is.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  And I'm going to cover this more tomorrow and throughout the week.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  And I'm going to come back from break and play a few more of these clips.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  But in my film, in-game blueprint for global enslavement,
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  I have all their countless quotes about once the world government's in place,
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  they got to get rid of most of us because we can't have access to this.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  What's the best way to do it? Is it airborne Ebola or is it airborne human mousepox with a 99% kill rate?
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  How do they get the bunkers built?
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  How do they get the underground bases with the seeds built?
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  I mean, I cover all this before they built the underground bunkers with the seeds.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  They've now done that. Who funded it? Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Who funds Ray Kurzweil?
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  And I got Aaron coming here in the last segment today with just a snapshot
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  because he went to Bilderberg and covered it in Switzerland and that was on the agenda.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  That's what these people are into. That's what they're doing.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  That's all they talk about. Well, of course, they're people that control trillions of dollars,
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  worth hundreds of billions of piece in some cases, most of their wealth hidden.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  What would you be into?
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  If you were worth hundreds of billions of dollars, you'd be into life extension.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  But then they sit around arguing saying, we can't give this to the public.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  And so in Endgame, I cover that that's what they're after because that's what they say in all their literature.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Not the popular books they sell to the sheep to say, oh, you'll be part of this.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  It's 40 years away. You've got time. Don't worry.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  How everything's going to be automated, remote controlled, your car, your house.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  They're already legalized in Nevada. Google cars without drivers.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  Next, it'll be you won't be allowed to drive your own car.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  and a terrorizing clothing called lint.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091,
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  or see Calvin on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091,
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  or see Calvin on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000]  The folks at eFoods Direct have saved you from the huge price increases on food
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  As of July 1st, eFoods Direct is forced to increase their prices
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  so they can still ship you the best storeable food on the planet.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  by calling 800-409-5633.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  Your time is running out to build your supply with the best food on the planet
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  at last year's prices with eFoods Direct.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000]  Prices go up at the end of June.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  You can now produce pure and endless-cloyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  making production fast and simple.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  The Global Social Engineers know that humans are toolmakers.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  They've studied the species.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  They see themselves as a predator class with the right to rule over us to kill us at will.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  Their program has always been to deploy a low-grade version of technologies
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  that have been developed and that they've bought and financed to be Trojan horses.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  Any tool they give us has a built-in control system into it.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  I told you about this a decade ago.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  Folks laugh, self-driving robot cars about to hit Nevada highways.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  They've passed the law.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Soon there won't be any truck drivers anymore.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  There won't be any checkout lanes anymore.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Why the future doesn't need us?
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  Then, as they shut the economy off, you go on to welfare.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Because they'll have huge robotic food production systems.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  This is what they say they're going to do.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  You'll be beholden.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  Well, now you're beholden to the computerized technocracy.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  The Air Force will go entirely drone.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  The Army will go almost entirely robot.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  It'll be humans that serve as some of the robots, but they will be replaced with robots.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  This is the plan and it's coming and we're building it.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  It's a more futuristic example of folks I know here in town at IBM seven, eight years ago
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  who trained all their replacements from India and knew they were going to be let go
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  in six months when they trained them.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  They pay for the college, they're in debt, they train their replacements.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  You're training your replacements.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  And then the technocrats, they're designing the infrastructure.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  They're designing the system.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  They're designing all of it not to empower humanity and build up humanity.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  The vaccines, the GMO, reduced fertility, dumb you down, the fluoride.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  I saw a study on fluoride.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  There's only three places that have it almost everywhere.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  The U.S. Ireland and the Basque area of Spain, all rebel areas to a nearby empire.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  Then you look at who financed it, big eugenics foundations, destroys fertility, increases bone cancer,
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  increases birth defects, 100% deadly.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  And it's all in areas where people rebel.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  And then I have the government documents where they admit all of this.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  Remember that.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  This is not my opinion.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  These are cold-blooded killers, but they have a nice little, cute little front man
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  who they're building up like Einstein.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  Oh, he's there.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  He's Ray Kurzweil.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  He wants to take care of you.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  And I got Aaron coming in here with a special report.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  But remember four years ago when I put out Endgame.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  And I put it out because a decade before that, I would cover their plan to live forever,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  that they want to kill all of us after their global police state set up.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  And they use quotes like that, the White House Sciences are, all of them do,
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  a global police state, and then we'll be exterminated.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  And then they'll live forever.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  Whether that's true or not, these people are nuts.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  And I don't like that.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  I want to be involved in my destiny.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  And so the entire infrastructure of technology is good.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  It's like a gun.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  It's double-edged.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  It's how it's used.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  And they're just saying it's a foregone conclusion.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  This is the way it is.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  This is your destiny.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  Ray Kurzweil says so.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  Not telling you that it's all been financed for over 150 years.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  And I cover that in Endgame, folks.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  Endgame, Endgame.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  It's free on YouTube.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  It's free, free.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  It's only had 10 million views between Google, YouTube and other channels.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  It needs 35 mil like Obama deception.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  I don't even have ads on the stinking thing.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  It's just there for free.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  Get the DVD.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  Make copies.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  Show it to everybody you know.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  Support us.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  Infowars.com.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  It's a million times more important because it's not deceptive like the Kurzweil movie
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  that's coming out, hyping this to everyone.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  Let me tell you, the PhDs and people that are inside, they know it's not cute.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  They're being told what it really is.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  Bill Joy had a son microsystems 10 years ago, wrote an article,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  He said, I go to top conferences with 200 computer company owners,
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  billionaires.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  All they talk about is, do we kill everybody?
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  Do we give the public what we got?
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  He had a pain of guilt.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  And so people would laugh at me about this.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  So I made the film.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  Here's London Guardian, an American inventor who plans to live forever,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  has been appointed the head of the new school of futurologists back by Google
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  and the US space agency, NASA.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  Google was created by DARPA.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  DARPA was created by designs from the 1950s.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  They've got shells, 50s and 60s.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  The technology is way more advanced than we're even told.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  They've already got life extension.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  They're already having to stage their deaths.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  The MO is the queen mother is not sitting in a crypt, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  I'm telling you, I'm telling you, this is what it's all about.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  Now, let me go ahead for you.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Let me go ahead now for you.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  They don't want to stage their deaths.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  They want to be out in the open with this stuff.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  I can't be here for that to happen because you think folks ride over food?
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  They're going to ride it and say, you keep my mother alive.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  You got technologies.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  Instead, they kill your mother with chemotherapy.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  Here is the trailer from four years ago for Endgame,
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  breaking down what they're now admitting to you.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  Here it is.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world economy.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  Only an educated public can stop them in their tracks.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  The dots have been connected and the picture is crystal clear.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain of you.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  The new world order is the old world order.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  I mean it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  That's their affidavit.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  We'll have a plane in Munich, they interrogate in four hours, some shots worth five.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  I need you to move off the process.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Only 10 million people have seen the film.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  I'm going to take you out to break with only part of this.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  British government funded, this is shown to school children and to people in England and Europe.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  Before movie theaters, it's called planopolis.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  And you think it's a joke about total plan society can't move, only get meat once a year, one-child policies.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  They're throwing it in your face like it's normal, like TSA sticking their hands down your pants,
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  to just condition you that outrageous things are normal.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  Okay, we're going to go out to break without music with as much of planopolis as we can play.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  If not, just put into the NSA search engine, Google, planopolis, and you'll get it. Here it is.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Welcome to a little fairy tale about the joys of living in an eco-tyranine.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  How will people travel in the cities of the future?
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  Mega cities on the move. Your guide to the future of sustainable urban mobility.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Planopolis, one of our four possible scenarios.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  In a world of fossil fuels and expensive energy, the only solution is tightly planned urban transport.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  Under the global government energy planning system, global climate change, deal imminent, joint venture to redesign city.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  Plans for new floating cities approved. Where have we heard of this before?
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  Oh, there's the global food council. Oh, welcome to the planopolis.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Let's cut to one of their minions.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  Oh, hi. I'm so glad you're on time.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  I'm looking forward to showing you around planopolis today.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  My husband works from home. He's a virtual engineer working in one of the city's desalination plants.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  He controls the robots who do all the important maintenance.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  I think he basically plays computer games for a living.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  Are you ready to go? She bashed her husband, he noticed.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  Switch off brain and go to work. With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega computer in charge.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  We are so lucky. Our kids were allocated to school quite near my practice, so I can drop them off on the way.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  The folks at eFoods Direct have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year. With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  As of July 1st, eFoods Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storeable food on the planet.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.

[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  Alright, it's the final segment. We'll be back during the week. Obviously with other guest news and calls, but today was very important.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  Substate focused on news. I'm probably going to have another demonstration at the Capitol.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  We're going to go inside and talk to our representatives tomorrow at 3pm.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  In fact, let's just say we're going to be there. I'll cover it more tomorrow.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  We'll have to move that TV interview. Then we've already agreed to that.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  We'll give folks more time to get down there. Let's say four o'clock tomorrow at the Texas Capitol.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  They're not going to do the TV interview. We're going to go down there where they're trying to kill the bell again.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  Republican dirty tricks with the Democrats to stop the groping.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  We're going to do that tomorrow. Four o'clock. I want to see everybody down there at the Texas State Capitol. Go in and talk to our state reps.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  You can meet me out front at the South Inference. Or you can just go on in, but I'll see you there at four.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Spread the word, folks. Silicon Valley, Tycoon, and Brace's sci-fi future.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  The man who made billions on Facebook and PayPal since it's time to invest, looking forward.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  AP, he was at Bilderberg. FCC chief, and it goes on from there.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  Self-driving robot cars about to hit Nevada Highway. See, it's all happening.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  Google wants to control and run your house.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  It goes on and on. Terrorist pre-crime detector, field tested in the United States.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  They're going to have mobile trucks where they claim you're a terrorist because the computer said so.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  It's all made up. You discredit the lot of techers that come out with fancier, blinking light garbage.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  It's all quackery.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  Now, Aaron, you've been here almost six years.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  You've got a degree in international relations or whatever from UT. You've studied all this stuff.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  When you first got here, you've learned more and more. Am I exaggerating in any way?
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  Or is it the opposite that these people are a cult that think they're going to become God
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  and that they want to exterminate the majority of us?
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  No, they're absolutely obsessed with controlling the population from a statistical point of view,
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  from an authoritarian centralized government point of view,
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  and they want to centralize all the mechanisms of our society, even those that are outside of government.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  We've only got eight minutes now, and we'll do bigger reports this week.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  More and more, I'm going to focus on this because they're rolling it out now publicly.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  Breakdown just from the Bilderberg angle, the latest, and this is what they're obsessed with.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  Yeah, well, we're talking about Peter Thiel, who's known as one of the PayPal mafia entrepreneurs.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  He's a derivatives trader, former derivatives trader and hedge fund manager,
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  and he was the co-founding CEO of PayPal. He then sold that to eBay for billions.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  He was one of the earliest and biggest outside investors of Facebook.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  In fact, he was the first outside investor of Facebook. He's made billions there
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  and on dozens and dozens of other high tech...
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  And they're not engaged in just a takeover of stock markets. This is a takeover of the human species.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  Right. I mean, you could see on the Bilderberg list where they're directing just the things that are happening
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  online in the social and retail avenues, but he's also highly funded in futures technology
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  and life extension technology in space commercialization.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  As they all are, though. This is all they do.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  Yeah, I mean, just a few things about him. He's heavily into surveillance technology.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  In 2004, Peter Thiel co-founded Palantir Technologies, which offers platforms for finance companies
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  and intelligence, defense, and law enforcement communities to integrate, visualize, and analyze
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  the world's information. And that's one of the biggest Facebook founders.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Total spying.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  He's funded LinkedIn. He's funded PayPal. They have all the online data between those companies.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  And just check out all the high tech people who attended Bilderberg just this year in 2011.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  First of all, there's Keith Alexander, the head of US Cybercom.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  The head of NSA.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  Yeah, he called for bigger war. It was like that damn Kucinich keeps getting things held up.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  You also had Bill Gates of the Bill and Melinda Gates and, of course, Mike...
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  Total eugenics, forced inoculations.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  His father, who's deeply in eugenics, was there last year in 2010.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  As you know, he was one of the earliest...
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  Yeah, Gates was set up, Microsoft's another government front, admittedly.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  Yeah, he was part of the...
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  It's a Planned Parenthood front.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  Planned Parenthood, yeah. Which means Rockefeller.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  Really, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a direct continuation of one arm of the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  You also had Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com there.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  The LinkedIn chairman and co-founder, Reid Hoffman.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  Chris R. Hughes, the co-founder of Facebook.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  Remember the Financial Times of London two years ago?
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  World's rich meets secretly to discuss reducing population.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  Financial Times of London. Let's put that up.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  No, it's all tied in to a point of real scariness.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  As you pointed out earlier, they used the Hollerith experiment and the Nazi Germany stuff.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  And what was the name of the Jamaican experiment?
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  The point is...
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  A race mixing study.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  But the issue is, is that they always have the little public statement of why they're doing this.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  But then Gates gets up at these public TED conference meetings and says,
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  we're going to wipe out most of the population and the audience giggles and gets little demonic looks on their faces.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  So they've got a whole cult of their people that have been promised a life extension if they carry this out.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  I mean, Hitler just promised folks power.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  They're promising their minions eternal life.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  And whether it's real or not, these people are dangerous.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  Yeah, the movie's obscure, but you've talked about it here on air before.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  Zardos is all about how to make the note of centralized controllers live forever
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  and exterminate the population on Earth, the normal people.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  It's a whole Wizard of Oz system, you know, the man behind the curtain.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  That's who these people are.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  They control everything through insider trading and the rest of it.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  But specifically, this Peter Thiel of Bilderberg guy directly funds the Singularity Institute.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  He's on the board.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  He's one of the advisors.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  That's Ray Kurzweil.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  And he also heavily funds Aubrey de Grey's Methusel Amos S.E.N.S. Foundation.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  Well, they make the mice live three times as long as we've got him on.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Yeah, and that all ties in directly with the things Bill Gates funds.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  And so they all work together.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  They're part of the steering wheel.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  So life for them, death for us.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  They're teaching us to the fake environmental movement that we're all scum and need to die.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  While they, the enlightened ones get to go forward.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  Yeah, and there you are.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  What would ultra rich do?
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  This is no brainer.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  I mean, end game that you made five, six years ago in 2006.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  Well, we're making it in six, but it's actually four, yeah.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  Okay, yeah, off on the ears.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  But the point is you draw in all the life extension stuff and the Kurzweil connections then.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  And now it's more directly connected to Bilderberg.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  You got Eric Schmidt, Bill Gates and Peter Thiel becoming the most centralized steering committee members of the Bilderberg group for all the high tech stuff.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  And those are young guys, the other guys are fading out.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  Yeah, the Queen of England, the Queen of the Netherlands and others, they've taken a backseat and it is the technocratic NSA people that run it all.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  Yeah.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  And the other thing is obviously David Rockefeller isn't going to live forever unless they achieve these bizarre goals.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Jay Rockefeller, the senator, he's Tucker identified it just as we did along, you know,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  six months ago, at least if not several years ago, that he's basically the next head of the Rockefeller family.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  And here he says we should have never invented the Internet.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  We have to control it.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  There's going to be the cyber attacks and that has been on the Bilderberg agenda.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  And then right as they try to pass on the cyber attacks get launched.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  But you've read, how many other books have you read?
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  I mean, it's just, it's constant.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  And what about my statement that the ideas that have charted our entire modern scientific lexicon all came out of eugenics?
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  It absolutely did, Alex.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  I mean, look at the industrialists who founded those organizations.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  It's Rockefeller.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  The folks that discovered the genome were doing it for, for, for trying to achieve eternal life and to wipe out the subhumans.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  This book right here is a great example.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  The Molecular Vision of Life, Caltech and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  Yeah, show folks on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  Tell them about that.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  That was a book recommended by Dr. Russell Blalock, who knows so much about eugenics and isn't afraid to talk about it.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  And it really shows how the Rockefeller Foundation and a few other important people, the point is they steered and controlled the research and development.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  They steered and controlled the genome.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  Well, they found out that most cancers viral in the 20s and then by the 30s we're putting it in the vaccines, then they own most the major cancer research facilities.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  They get first dibs on it and they learn how to control the.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  They inject you with the cancer and we even have their research papers where they talk about it.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  And they also yield from the good science that does allow them to extend their lives to a certain extent.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  But what do you have in the night?
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  They've killed most of the people that have died in America.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  These are, these, I mean, they created Hitler.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  It's on record.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  The Rockefellers funded Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm race facility.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  We're talking about the bastards who took control of the Industrial Revolution and created total monopolies for the first time in America.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  And they aren't going to give it up. They decided instead to liquidate their competition and decrease the population.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  They decided that 120 years ago or something and they've since steered all the science and you've got eugenics.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  They hit a little too hard in the early 10s and 20s.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  They went too hard.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  People realized it was radical even by the mid 20s.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  And Julian Huxley, the head of the UN program, brother of Aldous Huxley, who in 32 wrote Brave New World, people read and go,
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  it's all coming true, for he died, he gave a speech at Berkeley and said it's all real, we've already got chips in people's brains.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  His brother, Shed, Hitler made this look bad.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  We're going to call ourselves transhumanist.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  Yeah, but they identified that exact same reaction to the eugenics thing in the early 20s before Hitler got out of control.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  It started steering the molecular science as a way to biochemically control people, specifically to control the population.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  This book is incredible.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  I don't have time to pull out the quotes.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  And as Dr. Begich points out, for every chemical attack they're running on us through food and water, they've got at least 20 times the electromagnetic manipulation.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  And now through the smart meters, the new light bulbs, which they admit that they're going to send pulses through.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  You think the TV flicker gets you, folks, this is nothing.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  And it'll quote even overtake and control your computers.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  The new computers coming out have an infrared sensor that's then controlled by the new light bulbs and they have data over the power couplers.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  I mean, it's incredible what we're seeing, the revolutions in science and technology.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  The scary thing is that these guys are literally on the Bilderberg steering committee deciding who controls that data, sharing it with all the law enforcement and integrated systems.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  They decide which direction this future technology is going to go.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  No, they're charting human destiny.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  We should have a real debate about human destiny.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  We'll be having it at infowars.com.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  This is the most important information in the world that could be covered.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  Great job, Aaron. Great job, Cruz.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  We'll see you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
