[01:19.520 --> 01:23.720]  spin and lies and disinformation there must be a talking point out I mean they
[01:23.720 --> 01:27.080]  been saying this for months but I flipped around on talk radio early this
[01:27.080 --> 01:33.720]  morning and then on my drive into work to the broadcast studio and I heard local
[01:33.720 --> 01:37.280]  talk radio I heard San Antonio radio syndicated radio all saying the same
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.080]  thing it's the culture of entitlement it's all the people that lied on their
[01:43.080 --> 01:49.920]  mortgage applications they're the ones that caused it and this is got to stop
[01:49.920 --> 01:54.720]  and no talk of the entitlement by the international bankers who've designed
[01:54.720 --> 02:01.840]  this or who said 15 years ago oh the poor people they deserve a home and they
[02:01.840 --> 02:05.560]  deserve the equity and the dream and so we're going to give them a loan

[02:39.320 --> 02:43.520]  lied to by the real estate agents and by the brokers and the banks and the whole
[02:43.520 --> 02:47.840]  media system you can look at them caught in the bear trap blood oozing out of
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.760]  their sides their eyes going dim but do you blame them for stepping into the
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.680]  bear trap no it who laid the bear trap who put the scent of honey out on the
[02:58.680 --> 03:06.560]  morning wind and brought us in to step in that thing who raised us from birth

[04:06.760 --> 04:13.760]  implode the housing market when that was not on any of the news and then they're
[04:13.760 --> 04:17.200]  going to blame that on the financial implosion which they'll then bring in

[09:18.760 --> 09:24.280]  government's good let me give you a newsflash the crimes by the sicko freaks
[09:24.280 --> 09:30.120]  and thieves and scum and societies of evil that are committed that we know
[09:30.120 --> 09:37.360]  about on a daily basis are so legion it makes the head spin I'm thinking about
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.680]  modern military culture in the United States which they wrap in the flag they
[09:41.680 --> 09:45.520]  take our best well-meaning people our farm boys our inner-city people who
[09:45.520 --> 09:48.640]  believe they're fighting for America and they use them to destroy America and
[09:48.640 --> 09:53.160]  set up world empire and how the military has a culture of corruption to rat each
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.360]  other out and spy on everybody and to investigate everyone and write everyone
[09:58.360 --> 10:03.520]  up and then get dirt on people and those that play the game or the sickos go to
[10:03.520 --> 10:07.960]  the top it's disgusting and the military lines the troops up and gives them
[10:07.960 --> 10:12.120]  shots that kill them and the military says we won't tell the press or their
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.920]  families what it was killed them and how they use you and how you love it and
[10:16.920 --> 10:21.320]  how the military is being used by the foreign banks to fully suck the country
[10:21.320 --> 10:28.040]  dry 4 trillion stolen from the Pentagon the last decade trillion stolen out of
[10:28.040 --> 10:31.600]  the pension funds already in the other sectors of the federal government the
[10:31.600 --> 10:35.720]  state governments the water district set up as criminal enterprises they are
[10:35.720 --> 10:41.040]  just running wild and what does John McCain say and I want to get the
[10:41.040 --> 10:43.760]  story every time I talk about John McCain he's a puppet he runs nothing
[10:43.760 --> 10:47.000]  he's a nobody he's in league with Barack Obama they work for the same
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.800]  military industrial complex let's get that straight first off when I bash him
[10:52.800 --> 10:56.600]  I'm not saying go for Barack Obama I'm illustrating the absurdity I heard a
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.240]  clip this morning on the radio and they were agreeing saying yeah that's right
[11:00.240 --> 11:04.080]  where he was criticizing the Democratic Congress for saying we don't know what
[11:04.080 --> 11:08.960]  to do and it's not our fault and we're just gonna reset recess and let the
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.520]  Treasury Department and the private Federal Reserve run things and McCain
[11:13.520 --> 11:17.560]  said how dare you you better do something this is your fault and all this
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.080]  other bull and the hosts were on their agreeing ladies and gentlemen on Monday
[11:22.080 --> 11:27.160]  Sunday night was on Bloomberg Secretary of the Treasury Paulson who was
[11:27.160 --> 11:30.920]  involved in Wall Street setting up this Ponzi scheme there were members of the
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.080]  Republican Congress and the Democratic Congress saying we need to have an
[11:34.080 --> 11:39.080]  investigation of the of these quote bailouts and what you're doing and
[11:39.080 --> 11:43.640]  whether this will bankrupt the Treasury and Paulson went on TV and put out a
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.400]  release and said you have no authority here the executive is in control and we
[11:48.400 --> 11:52.240]  have contracts with these private institutions now Congress is in is in
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.200]  control the purse strings they apportion they fund they pass the
[11:56.200 --> 12:00.720]  laws that's in the Constitution it's 101 but in this modern age folks they're
[12:00.720 --> 12:03.800]  getting rid of the Bill of Rights the Constitution all of it why not get rid
[12:03.800 --> 12:08.280]  of that too you see I mean they North com announced yesterday they're gonna put
[12:08.280 --> 12:12.800]  brigades of troops on the streets of America and for PR purposes they're

[12:56.960 --> 13:02.560]  times it was all there folks with its cloaking device on they flip the switch

[13:11.200 --> 13:16.800]  that they didn't set all this up for no reason they didn't pay off mayors and
[13:16.800 --> 13:21.360]  city council people and county commissioners and councilmen and select
[13:21.360 --> 13:25.920]  men and women coast-to-coast and covert operations over 20 plus years 25 years

[13:41.480 --> 13:45.360]  hiring gang members and criminals and felons for the military now and I will
[13:45.360 --> 13:48.560]  not bow down while the military you know they said well they just confiscated
[13:48.560 --> 13:52.120]  guns in New Orleans that's I that's okay now they're in Illinois with the
[13:52.120 --> 13:55.960]  military confiscating weapons the mayor comes out and announces it the governor
[13:55.960 --> 13:59.960]  announces it and it doesn't even hardly make national news the NRA doesn't say a
[13:59.960 --> 14:04.360]  word about it because they're there to pacify you like we're a baby and they
[14:04.360 --> 14:10.840]  stick a poison pacifier of cyanide in our mouth well I'm not taking it and I'm
[14:10.840 --> 14:16.000]  not a baby and I'm not backing down to this folks they're powerful people that
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.480]  want to rob banks that want to take over societies that want to rule and they've
[14:19.480 --> 14:25.720]  done it systematically and their war planners said look we just can't go in
[14:25.720 --> 14:28.640]  here and take over and butcher everything and suck everything out of the
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.040]  pension funds and and and train the masses of people to go in and get these
[14:32.040 --> 14:35.400]  bad loans the people are going to get mad they'll bring us to justice we've
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.080]  studied history and they said you know what we're going to do we'll bring in
[14:39.080 --> 14:43.560]  military dictatorship and control under the threat of an outside enemy like
[14:43.560 --> 14:49.800]  terrorism so that they will allow us to crush dissent ban free speech and so we
[14:49.800 --> 14:54.160]  can control the court systems and not get in trouble and keep cutting the cream
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.760]  off the top of the slaves we're just going to make them full bore peons it's
[14:57.760 --> 15:03.600]  too dangerous having an armed American population and that's what they've done
[15:03.600 --> 15:06.720]  I was telling a friend about this last night and she said you know what this
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.440]  is this is just like what the military does after they've you know pulled out
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.080]  of an area and looted it they burn the city down they burn the bridges so that
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.600]  no one can come after them later so that their enemies can't rebuild they
[15:20.600 --> 15:24.480]  destroy the infrastructure this has been you know tax incentives for 20
[15:24.480 --> 15:28.960]  something years to move offshore tax incentives for the elites to move their
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.360]  money offshore but notice in the last two years they change the bankruptcy laws
[15:32.360 --> 15:36.960]  for the little people where it's hard to declare bankruptcy notice the last two
[15:36.960 --> 15:39.600]  years they changed the law or you can't get your money out of the country very
[15:39.600 --> 15:46.200]  easily or they can get it anywhere in the world but a handful of nations you
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.560]  understand what's happening you understand this is scientifically done
[15:51.560 --> 15:57.720]  now 99% of the time when a nation falls it falls from covert financial interest

[17:23.560 --> 17:27.320]  was reading news articles and ready for the broadcast and there's a talking
[17:27.320 --> 17:32.720]  point out that the lazy American people the entitlement crowd they caused this
[17:32.720 --> 17:41.240]  and and certainly they got suckered into it but we told you not one not two
[17:41.240 --> 17:51.000]  years ago but in early 2006 two and a half years ago almost three we told you
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.120]  they are going to implode the housing market they are going to artificially
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.200]  pull the plug on it and then blame the collapse on that because we went to

[25:04.760 --> 25:07.560]  up for meeting Thursday evening with Secretary Henry Paulson and fellow
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.200]  reserve chairman that as much as one trillion could be needed to avoid an
[25:11.200 --> 25:14.480]  imminent meltdown crank it up let's let him hear this part
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.080]  made as an homie we need to avoid an imminent meltdown of the US financial
[25:19.080 --> 25:26.000]  system and they're putting that out to cause even bigger panic
[25:33.760 --> 25:39.840]  that's why they want you off your farms and ranches and they're coming for your
[25:39.840 --> 25:46.680]  land don't worry these bastards are criminals of old we gain from the West
[25:46.680 --> 25:51.480]  you know the government your enemy and totally criminal so upset in here all
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.560]  these talk shows parroting the line the American people's fault the government's
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.000]  good let's bail out all the banks let's be sensible they engineered all this and
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.120]  again they only started advertising a credit crisis to create these problems
[26:06.120 --> 26:11.280]  the real crisis is that they bundled the bad mortgages and sold them over and
[26:11.280 --> 26:17.080]  over again and leverage them you never call me by my name and all these other
[26:17.080 --> 26:24.600]  big financial scams that are going on my grandpa taught me how to live off the
[26:24.600 --> 26:30.120]  land and here's taught him to be a business man and it's a big joke to them
[26:30.120 --> 26:34.040]  so see the hundreds of billions they've stolen is nothing they now are gonna
[26:34.040 --> 26:37.920]  gobble the entire economy the comprehensive annual financial report
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.200]  money the trillions that states like Texas and New York have the trillion
[26:42.200 --> 26:46.680]  plus that Manhattan has but he was killed by what they've changed the law to take
[26:46.680 --> 26:53.600]  the pension funds they've changed the law to take the annuities and then oh
[26:53.600 --> 26:57.240]  we'll save the economy it'll totally collapse if you don't just let us do
[26:57.240 --> 27:02.480]  anything we want and then George Bush and John McCain come out and say it's
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.680]  Congress's fault they're not acting when the private Federal Reserve and the
[27:07.680 --> 27:10.800]  Treasury head Paulson have told them they are not involved in this under
[27:10.800 --> 27:17.960]  contract and cannot be involved and can say nothing about funding I mean we're
[27:17.960 --> 27:21.440]  seeing the government as Ron Paul said yesterday in a speech I'm gonna play
[27:21.440 --> 27:26.200]  later Ron Paul blast secret government running economy
[27:26.200 --> 27:30.400]  congressman warns middle class in danger of being wiped out says Congress is
[27:30.400 --> 27:37.400]  oblivious as Fed has no clue Fed has no clue what why do even we buy into that
[27:37.400 --> 27:41.520]  I mean that's what Ron Paul says they don't have a clue they engineered the
[27:41.520 --> 27:46.680]  whole thing Ron Paul I'm gonna get him on love him to death but you know the way
[27:46.680 --> 27:51.200]  he puts it he knows they engineered it we have to stop even talking to the
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.680]  dumb-down masses they don't even want to count we got to talk serious turkey
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.920]  here folks I got a stack of economic news it'll curl your hair look at this that
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.840]  as much as one trillion could be needed to avoid an imminent meltdown of the US
[28:05.840 --> 28:10.240]  financial system ladies and gentlemen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.320]  conservatively leveraged over 100 times they're talking about the exposure being
[28:14.320 --> 28:23.160]  between 1.5 or 5.4 trillion now leverage that a hundred times they're
[28:23.160 --> 28:30.320]  both worth together over 54 trillion leverage it and it's all secret you
[28:30.320 --> 28:35.600]  understand these bastards bought real things with this fiat currency and
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.120]  and and and assets they created and now they're telling us we've got to bail it
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.920]  out but see all that earlier thieving is nothing compared to this this is the
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.880]  trap now this is something we'll never get out of unless we monetize it and
[28:48.880 --> 28:52.480]  say we don't owe it and they point out it's a fraud but we're not see this is
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.400]  the point to be doing that as we've been saying we said when the economic crisis
[28:55.400 --> 28:59.400]  comes for year after year it's in matrix of evil I made four years ago every
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.880]  financial guess we have on covers it to blame the bankers and not bail them out
[29:03.880 --> 29:09.920]  when it happens and to expose that they engineered it year after year we warn you
[29:09.920 --> 29:14.560]  for when this came don't bail them out don't do it when the time comes but
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.960]  what's happening exactly what we warned against ladies and gentlemen this is it
[29:20.960 --> 29:25.760]  SEC banned short selling for financials California home sales surges prices
[29:25.760 --> 29:30.480]  plummet treasury to guarantee money market funds London's records biggest
[29:30.480 --> 29:34.680]  surge in history after Bush and others announced that it's total commitment to
[29:34.680 --> 29:38.320]  the bankers but of course it'll only surge for a few weeks maybe a month and
[29:38.320 --> 29:43.600]  it's gonna plunge even worse after the bailout it's not a bailout after they
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.760]  suck us dry then they're bringing us down stay with me vital info straight

[33:16.960 --> 33:25.600]  liberals to sit in the game these people forged Hitler they forged Lenin they
[33:25.600 --> 33:30.040]  created these monsters it's all declassified Carol Quigley's book

[33:34.640 --> 33:40.400]  pages he'll tell you he will teach you he will tell you you're a slave he will
[33:40.400 --> 33:46.280]  laugh at you from the grave there's nothing more frustrating than knowing we
[33:46.280 --> 33:53.160]  have absolute murderous criminals running everything raping everybody and to
[33:53.160 --> 33:57.240]  watch all these people on talk radio and TV thinking they know what's going on
[33:57.240 --> 34:04.560]  and most of them are just useful idiots parroting repeating what they heard over
[34:04.560 --> 34:11.240]  and over again who told you exactly what was gonna happen laid out exactly what
[34:11.240 --> 34:17.880]  would unfold our enemy is failing though in many respects remember two years ago
[34:17.880 --> 34:25.160]  and then again a year ago when they pulled out every stop the social
[34:25.160 --> 34:28.680]  engineers and even made bills secret for the first time in US history they said
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.880]  you can't see the immigration reform bill but we promise it's not amnesty and
[34:33.880 --> 34:38.400]  then senator sessions leaked it and got in trouble got called in the carpet by
[34:38.400 --> 34:41.280]  the leader of the Senate but senator sessions god bless him went out of
[34:41.280 --> 34:47.480]  Alabama released it and in the bill he gave the 20 smoking guns and it said
[34:47.480 --> 34:57.400]  clearly this is not an amnesty this is a complete and total pardon clemency it's
[34:57.400 --> 35:03.080]  stated that illegal aliens with aggravated felonies if they just signed
[35:03.080 --> 35:07.720]  a pledge and promised to not commit felonies here they would be legal it
[35:07.720 --> 35:13.680]  legalized felons people in prisons people getting out of prisons to not be
[35:13.680 --> 35:19.920]  deported aggravated felons go read it it made all the illegal aliens
[35:19.920 --> 35:27.360]  conservatively 25 million more like 35 million the census said 14 million eight
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.880]  years ago you think illegal aliens go and tell the census when they're here the
[35:32.880 --> 35:38.360]  state census to show it's double that number and that was years ago now
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.120]  nothing against these poor people living under total neural or control being
[35:42.120 --> 35:45.280]  humanized but they have been brainwashed with their own propaganda
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.400]  nationalism against the u.s. being used as a third world device to bring down
[35:50.400 --> 35:55.040]  wages and further implode things this is a war against independent capital this
[35:55.040 --> 36:00.840]  is a monopoly operation now they tried to get that through and I said you watch
[36:00.840 --> 36:04.840]  they need to get this through they need to get amnesty first before the economy
[36:04.840 --> 36:08.040]  implodes or then they're going to have a lot of trouble doing it because it's
[36:08.040 --> 36:11.440]  going to put more pressure on the illegal aliens and then the associated
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.880]  press came out with a headline bankers help immigrants and it said we know
[36:15.880 --> 36:18.920]  people are putting pressure on them last year it that said we know the
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.440]  economy is getting having a little trouble and and and so we're going to
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.840]  give them home loans and we're going to do all this to help them stay in the
[36:28.840 --> 36:33.240]  country and all these big banks gave them ID cards that cities and the feds
[36:33.240 --> 36:39.400]  accept as a national ID card and since a fox came to Austin and gave Wells Fargo
[36:39.400 --> 36:46.560]  an award for the national ID card the private corporate ID card and the
[36:46.560 --> 36:53.000]  police chiefs are paid overtly and covertly by intelligence by foreign
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.960]  governments fox gave cash awards to APD officers totally criminal like McCain
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.560]  going to England and openly having fundraisers at the Rothschild palace
[37:03.560 --> 37:07.240]  barren Rothschild's palace by way neocons on websites say the Rothschilds
[37:07.240 --> 37:11.000]  don't exist they say that's a made-up name it's real folks the Rothschilds are
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.760]  real the incredible thing is Fox out of Michigan admitted and interviewed
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.720]  Vicente Fox and Vicente Fox are the same things that we are changed by the
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.480]  ways and the extras of truth rising and he said yeah we're setting up a North
[37:25.480 --> 37:32.600]  American Union yeah Fox News reported that now that guy's career is over the
[37:32.600 --> 37:39.960]  black reporter from Fox 2 in Detroit I'm guessing your career is over but hey
[37:39.960 --> 37:45.480]  come join us you obviously have I mean Fox is the one saying it Fox also says
[37:45.480 --> 37:53.840]  American workers get used to it that's right get used to it but then what are
[37:53.840 --> 37:57.440]  your neocon handlers do on talk radio they tell you doesn't exist it's crazies
[37:57.440 --> 38:02.440]  doesn't exist it's crazies doesn't exist it's crazy doesn't exist it's crazy or
[38:02.440 --> 38:05.960]  they're more slick like Lynn Beck okay it exists but we still need to arrest all
[38:05.960 --> 38:10.120]  the 9-11 truthers and Ron Paul's kind of kooky and oh but I like him and oh we
[38:10.120 --> 38:15.640]  need to go ahead and support wars and all this or Michael wiener the beatnik
[38:15.640 --> 38:18.840]  of the 60s top beatnik leader boy read his books I don't even say what's in
[38:18.840 --> 38:24.720]  them on air but you know he comes out so we got to fight the New World Order we
[38:24.720 --> 38:28.200]  got to attack Arab countries they're the New World Order oh yeah sure and I'm a
[38:28.200 --> 38:33.480]  Chinese jet pilot from Pluto call Mars in five minutes I'm backing Jim Mars
[38:33.480 --> 38:36.360]  off because I'm in a rant here about the economy the point is they thought
[38:36.360 --> 38:40.920]  they'd get their borders lowered completely and we blocked them there see
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.920]  we're having victories they are moving forward with their operation but they
[38:44.920 --> 38:48.680]  are badly coordinated and heavily damaged attack attack attack defend the
[38:48.680 --> 38:53.360]  Republic like you've never defended it before and I just wish that God would
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.280]  move all of you neocons and it's the 30% in the military that still support all
[38:57.280 --> 39:00.640]  this under the majority we do support Ron Paul which shows you're awake and the
[39:00.640 --> 39:07.880]  cops out there who are delusional man everything I've told just true remember
[39:07.880 --> 39:10.960]  we told you almost three years ago they were going to start the implosion of
[39:10.960 --> 39:19.560]  the economy blaming it on subprime mortgages it was by design that's why
[39:19.560 --> 39:22.360]  they're pulling out all the stops now they're going for broke they're in
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.240]  trouble they can be defeated and again as Ron Paul told you everybody else's
[39:27.240 --> 39:34.520]  told you the key is during the financial crisis will they be able to do the
[39:34.520 --> 39:39.160]  quote bailout in quotes the bailout they've already moved their assets into
[39:39.160 --> 39:43.440]  commodities and infrastructure that's stated in I'm at World Bank plans in
[39:43.440 --> 39:46.960]  2002 they were ready to go the Financial Times of London's reported the big
[39:46.960 --> 39:53.320]  institutions the mega institutions the above banking the shareholders of the
[39:53.320 --> 39:58.040]  global Federal Reserve system they are the ones that stand again and now if
[39:58.040 --> 40:03.360]  they can quote sucker you into hey we're consolidating all these banks and we
[40:03.360 --> 40:10.640]  need you to bail us out trillions of dollars then they will fully take all
[40:10.640 --> 40:13.400]  of us I mean usually they talked about a billion bucks being big now it's
[40:13.400 --> 40:19.000]  trillions every week this is the big Ponzi scheme this is the final layer of
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.880]  the multi-level marketing scam Mayday Mayday Mayday folks we told you I told
[40:25.880 --> 40:29.800]  you in 97 98 when I figured out the paradigm enough of their documents
[40:29.800 --> 40:32.920]  which you didn't even have to read between the lines it stated it they're
[40:32.920 --> 40:36.160]  gonna build up a secret police state grid use the war on drugs as their cover
[40:36.160 --> 40:40.280]  for the first layer then they stage terror attacks a string of them to bring
[40:40.280 --> 40:45.600]  in total tyranny then they would have a full collapse of the economy and the
[40:45.600 --> 40:50.000]  consolidation so that's what we're dealing with now only got five minutes
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.440]  with him and then Jim Mars is on effect call Jim in about three minutes he's
[40:55.440 --> 41:01.400]  Ted Anderson Ted's been in this for 25 years 26 what is it Ted as a broker you
[41:01.400 --> 41:05.760]  know in the golden silver business he he is freaked out he offered gold two days
[41:05.760 --> 41:12.320]  ago at 80 something dollars below it was gold is back up today
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.680]  gyrating up and down it's up a hundred and something bucks on the week and
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.160]  Ted can't offer these deals much longer this deal will be offered through the
[41:20.160 --> 41:25.760]  weekend and then that's it ladies and gentlemen and Ted give me though before
[41:25.760 --> 41:30.160]  we offer the golden silver deal give me your breakdown on watching all this
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.320]  unfold well it's right now I'm looking at the news Morgan Stanley's the next one
[41:34.320 --> 41:38.720]  on the chopping block you'll see that one file bankruptcy here soon AIG when
[41:38.720 --> 41:42.080]  that went down it was a one billion dollar bailout if they're gonna do what
[41:42.080 --> 41:46.760]  they decided not to let it go I mean a trillion I'm you know one billion one
[41:46.760 --> 41:54.200]  trillion I trillion trillion anyways with with this you know what watching this
[41:54.200 --> 41:59.880]  unfold AIG is like one of the largest insurance companies out there and that
[41:59.880 --> 42:03.360]  means everybody that has their money invested in annuities and are looking
[42:03.360 --> 42:08.280]  for their annuity to retire on is gonna lose it I just have to say one thing
[42:08.280 --> 42:12.240]  about annuity is right now they're not insured if that company that sold you
[42:12.240 --> 42:17.000]  that annuity that that takes care that annuity goes bail goes bankruptcy you're
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.240]  you're done you don't have that money anymore and that's how bad that is it's
[42:20.240 --> 42:25.000]  not backed by folks they have now totally committed to all our capital our name
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.360]  our future trillions of dollars there's no coming back from this this will
[42:29.360 --> 42:33.040]  bankrupt there will be a depression the question is one year three years we
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.680]  don't know next week who knows and then what Ted's telling you is this they're
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.840]  gonna pump it back up again and maybe even one more time but that is only to
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.880]  sucker us fully in to I mean look now the Treasury and the private Fed has told
[42:46.880 --> 42:50.520]  Congress you're not involved and then they blame Congress saying Congress isn't
[42:50.520 --> 42:55.040]  doing anything this is incredible yeah and and the bailouts I mean you're the
[42:55.040 --> 42:58.680]  way you put it on the bailouts it's a if the United States government steps in
[42:58.680 --> 43:02.480]  the bailout these these institutions if it spells out more trouble for the
[43:02.480 --> 43:07.400]  taxpayer and it's absolutely the wrong direction to turn I realized that if
[43:07.400 --> 43:10.720]  these companies fail there's gonna be a lot of unemployment we can still run
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.240]  into a complete depression but if you get the damn government out of trying to
[43:14.240 --> 43:17.840]  manipulate this stuff we can have a stabilized economy on the other side
[43:17.840 --> 43:21.240]  well they claim the savings and loan deal was only gonna cost 10 billion ended
[43:21.240 --> 43:26.120]  up costing over a trillion yep it okay now now now now they're saying this is
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.840]  gonna cost in the financials five trillion in for the slave public it
[43:30.840 --> 43:36.560]  they're saying a trillion or more now if it normally cost 10 15 20 30 times what
[43:36.560 --> 43:42.000]  they say Ted we are this is these numbers that are being dealt but Ted you
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.600]  heard us say three years ago that Bilderberg was gonna engineer this you
[43:46.600 --> 43:50.400]  heard us but Ron Paul break down that that the real scam would be the quote
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.960]  bailout this is not a bailout this is the full transfer of thousands of times
[43:54.960 --> 44:00.440]  more digital currency than even exist into the bankers hands this is the biggest
[44:00.440 --> 44:05.400]  robbery ever the government only reports nine trillion dollars right now in it's
[44:05.400 --> 44:09.440]  just coming up on ten trillion dollars national debt and and you're talking
[44:09.440 --> 44:13.320]  about something that's ten times the size I mean it's it's way bigger than
[44:13.320 --> 44:16.800]  that you think the United States government can do and it's gonna
[44:16.800 --> 44:19.880]  definitely destroy the value of the currency there's just no way that it
[44:19.880 --> 44:23.240]  can make it through it I know you got to get Jim Mars up so we probably but Jim
[44:23.240 --> 44:27.040]  Jim's cool we've got some time next hour I just wanted to have him on the plug
[44:27.040 --> 44:31.040]  his event he's having a brave new books great guys down there here in Austin
[44:31.040 --> 44:35.280]  Texas and he's in being studio with me Sunday on this Sunday show for an hour
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.480]  and a half so just but so Jim's fine cover any more financial info you want
[44:39.480 --> 44:42.880]  to put out there Ted oh well I can just tell you right now Alex it's just it
[44:42.880 --> 44:46.600]  there are there are 10,000 banks right now 1,000 of them are on the chopping
[44:46.600 --> 44:50.480]  block right now their institutions that are failing all over the place and the
[44:50.480 --> 44:53.880]  bankruptcies keep on you know mounting and they're mounting and it just gets
[44:53.880 --> 44:58.880]  getting bigger and bigger gold right now sitting at the 870 dollars an ounce
[44:58.880 --> 45:05.320]  that it's at is is sitting at about well what a what did Bob Chapman say
[45:05.320 --> 45:10.240]  $6,000 an ounce adjusted for inflation real numbers not CPI numbers I mean it
[45:10.240 --> 45:14.440]  is suppressed right now silver the same thing like you said yesterday trying to
[45:14.440 --> 45:18.920]  hold a beach ball underwater is what's going on then meanwhile the financial
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.400]  institutions are failing in the Federal Reserve system is trying to step in and
[45:22.400 --> 45:26.120]  bail all this stuff out and at the same time destroying the economy for the
[45:26.120 --> 45:30.960]  people it's just crazy that we have this I mean even now I'm getting emails from
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.240]  from people that were completely against me on this Federal Reserve system idea
[45:35.240 --> 45:37.880]  now they're like on yeah this is right and they're pulling up quotes from Ron
[45:37.880 --> 45:41.320]  Paul and this and that it's like the people are finally waking up Alex and
[45:41.320 --> 45:44.480]  they're starting to realize that there are problems out here and that they just
[45:44.480 --> 45:48.880]  can't live well let's be clear about something if you write in the newsletter
[45:48.880 --> 45:52.920]  that you think a bank stock is going to go up or down or gold stock will go up
[45:52.920 --> 45:57.440]  or down and then it ends up you own a couple of shares in it the FBI comes
[45:57.440 --> 46:01.920]  and arrest you but if you openly engage in naked shorting felonies every case
[46:01.920 --> 46:06.520]  if you openly go the head of the New York shock exchange grasso in 99 in front
[46:06.520 --> 46:10.200]  of Reuters cameras and beg the fart to invest their cocaine money in New York
[46:10.200 --> 46:14.400]  which is legal through a loophole I mean my point is is that they can do any
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.120]  insider trading any scams anything they want and the media keeps saying on all
[46:19.120 --> 46:22.880]  the financial shows there will not be prosecutions no one did anything wrong it
[46:22.880 --> 46:26.400]  was just a mistake and then later they're going to burn a few little low-level
[46:26.400 --> 46:31.040]  brokers and blame it on them or Martha Stewart who did absolutely nothing you
[46:31.040 --> 46:34.040]  know literally oh she knew her stock was going down and sold a few million dollars
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.280]  worth of shares we're talking about trillions here we're talking about
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.280]  folks now they've changed the bankruptcy laws the media is blaming the
[46:42.280 --> 46:46.520]  American people they're shutting off every avenue of escape for us and and
[46:46.520 --> 46:49.600]  then they suckered us into all this debased our currency to based our
[46:49.600 --> 46:55.000]  economy moved our industry overseas paid them tax incentives to do it and then
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.680]  people yeah I got suckered into okay I'll mortgage my house again okay it's
[46:58.680 --> 47:01.800]  going up in value the media tells me this is the thing to do and then they
[47:01.800 --> 47:06.640]  blame those people now we told you don't do it and we told you two and a half
[47:06.640 --> 47:10.200]  years ago we came back and said sell your house now sell your house now I mean
[47:10.200 --> 47:14.080]  it's on record I need my listeners to go back into our archives and you know just
[47:14.080 --> 47:18.640]  find any financial show I did right after Bilderberg go get clips in the end
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.240]  game well what about this one I mean my hold on a second Aaron Aaron come on
[47:23.240 --> 47:28.120]  in here buddy I just can't believe it I mean folks the point is we told you
[47:28.120 --> 47:32.400]  exactly what they do Ted how many times do we have to be right how many times
[47:32.400 --> 47:35.840]  we have to be dead on they are bringing in economic collapse to bring in
[47:35.840 --> 47:39.040]  fascism hey you know the part in the extras there's more of it and an end game
[47:39.040 --> 47:43.880]  1.5 there's more there's also more there's a clip in the film itself get me
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.680]  and I've got a lot of work in there but I want you to write a little blurb about
[47:47.680 --> 47:51.640]  look how we broke down how the bankers were engineering this and then maybe
[47:51.640 --> 47:55.400]  grab the last chapter of my book it's online to where I break down the IMF

[54:46.640 --> 54:49.160]  web and for everybody and also integrated into the film where we're
[54:49.160 --> 54:55.480]  doing with Jim Mars black sunshine is the name of it getting into continuity
[54:55.480 --> 54:59.240]  government JFK you know it's my films are always multi-faceted it's not just
[54:59.240 --> 55:03.080]  about JFK and I was gonna put some of that in there but we're really going a
[55:03.080 --> 55:06.680]  lot more in the Nazi direction as well because it's not just the Nazis the
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.240]  Nazis came from here so you can really call it Nazis this fascism planted a
[55:11.240 --> 55:15.960]  seed that grew into Mussolini and the Nazis so he'll be with us but but Jim
[55:15.960 --> 55:19.800]  Mars you've talked a lot about economic collapse let's talk about what we're
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.240]  dealing with right now what we're facing right now well it's the same
[55:24.240 --> 55:29.840]  manipulation by a self-styled globalist financiers and bankers you can go all the
[55:29.840 --> 55:34.120]  way back to the 1800s when we had to deal with the trust which were nothing
[55:34.120 --> 55:38.200]  but just the early-day term for corporations there was a series of
[55:38.200 --> 55:43.280]  booms and bust that they engineered which then prompted the public to cry
[55:43.280 --> 55:48.920]  out for some relief and what we got was the Federal Reserve System private
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.520]  banks owned by private bankers answerable to no one and the whole
[55:53.520 --> 55:57.600]  history of the Federal Reserve System no one in Congress no one in the federal
[55:57.600 --> 56:01.680]  government has been able to audit them and even find out what's going on then
[56:01.680 --> 56:06.720]  and then we get planned that the Bank of International Settlements was set up to
[56:06.720 --> 56:12.680]  drain Germany of its assets after World War one which then drove the Germans
[56:12.680 --> 56:17.840]  right into the hands of Hitler and his Nazis and and then pretty soon the Bank
[56:17.840 --> 56:23.240]  of International Settlements was then became a Nazi organ and has remained a
[56:23.240 --> 56:29.560]  national socialist and fascist argued ever since and then of course we had
[56:29.560 --> 56:35.920]  World War two to try to stop this the world takeover by national socialism by
[56:35.920 --> 56:40.240]  Hitler and which of course Hitler and the Germans got defeated but even
[56:40.240 --> 56:46.160]  Churchill said he wasn't that opposed to national socialism he just didn't want
[56:46.160 --> 56:50.120]  the Germans in charge and that was the whole thing the bankers they want to
[56:50.120 --> 56:56.160]  remain control so after the war John T. McCoy who'd been chairman of the
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.240]  National City Bank which is now City Corp had been one of the chief funders of
[57:01.240 --> 57:06.560]  Hitler and the Nazis set in Hitler's box during the 1936 Olympics he becomes
[57:06.560 --> 57:12.680]  High Commissioner of Germany and pardons thousands of Nazis and sends them
[57:12.680 --> 57:17.640]  over to the United States where his protege Allen Dulles who had been he and
[57:17.640 --> 57:23.880]  his brother John Foster Dulles had been attorneys for the Fritz Tyson accounts
[57:23.880 --> 57:28.760]  for the Schroder Bank which was the primary funder of Hitler and the Nazis
[57:28.760 --> 57:34.400]  he's become CIA director and under Dulles they whitewash all these Nazis
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.400]  past records bring them in roll them into our military industrial complex and
[57:39.400 --> 57:46.440]  began creating a fourth Reich in the United States absolutely tell folks

[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:08.640]  Jim, we're seeing it. I mean, all the stuff foretold by the old timers.
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:14.640]  All the old army intelligence guys in the 50s came out and said, our government's financing the communists the fascists.
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:17.640]  They quickly wrote a book about it and all these documents they admitted.
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:24.640]  The old timers, when I first heard about this, when I read books written in the 40s and 50s and 60s, they said they're going to stage terror.
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:27.640]  They're going to set up a police state. They're going to collapse the economy.
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:33.640]  This was planned way back then. And what happens today happened in the past.
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:37.640]  That's why knowing history lets you know the future. Jim, start breaking it down.
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:41.640]  You're absolutely correct. You're absolutely correct.
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:54.640]  I'm holding in my hand a book that starts off in its introduction saying that the Netherlands ambassador to Washington in August of 1943 predicted that with defeat
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:03:01.640]  the German general staff, the Nazi leaders in particular, the Gestapo would go underground to prepare for the next war.
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:09.640]  As for this war, he said, the Nazis knew they had already lost it. This is in August of 1943 and we're willing and eager to get it over with.
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:17.640]  Title of this book is The Nazis Go Underground is written by a very credible news journalist and correspondent named Kurt Rees.
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:27.640]  Here's the clincher, Alex. This book was written and published in March of 1944, months before we even invaded it the day.
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:32.640]  This is a long-standing plan. They've been working this plan for a long time.
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:39.640]  As you know, and I want to come back and talk about this in 40 and 41, the Germans tried to do peace treaties secretly with the British.
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:49.640]  They sent Hesse to do it and they basically imprisoned him and shut that down because they had a deal to basically let Hitler do what he did, but then the British basically double-crossed him.
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:04:03.640]  Exactly because the British financiers and their American counterparts are the self-styled globalists who are trying to corral the world population into their own little serfdom.
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:16.640]  We can see the end results of it beginning to take shape right now with the disintegration of our economy and the fact that if there's widespread civil unrest, where's our National Guard?
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:19.640]  They're all fighting over in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:27.640]  That's the incredible thing. I'm going to come back. Did you see the Army Times yesterday where they announced combat brigades to patrol America, regular Army?
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:36.640]  Hey, and nobody's ever rescinded the Posse Comitatus Act, which makes it against the law for them to do that. They just do it.
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:42.640]  Hey, it's against the law for the Federal Reserve to tell Congress to sit down and shut up over the weekend.
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:43.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:51.640]  I mean, we're under martial law, folks. It's what degree of it. We're in the pot on the stove. It's on medium. Our butt's starting to burn. This isn't a game.
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:58.640]  That hurt real bad unless you scream body murder. Stay with us, Jim Maher, straight ahead.

[1:05:57.640 --> 1:06:07.640]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:07.640 --> 1:06:11.640]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:13.640]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:16.640]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:23.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:23.640 --> 1:06:30.640]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:34.640]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:41.640]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:45.640]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:31.640]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:34.640]  That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple Creek.
[1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:40.640]  PuraClear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid,
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:44.640]  among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:49.640]  PuraClear also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity,
[1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:53.640]  but heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:08:20.640]  PuraClear now by calling Ripple Creek at 203-331-0363 or go to RippleCreek.com.
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:39.640]  It's got to be the most powerful station. It's only 15,000 watts,
[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:44.640]  but the way the antenna was cut by President Johnson, he controlled the FCC when they built it,
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:48.640]  that it's the most powerful 15,000 water.
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:56.640]  I forget how many watts. The point is that I've been told by folks and engineers people to know it's the most powerful for its wattage in the country.
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:02.640]  It's more powerful than W.O.A.I. that's 50,000 watts, or I mean it's just incredible.
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:07.640]  Okay, I'm digressing on that subject.
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:13.640]  We're talking to Jim Mars. This isn't a joke. There's so much evidence.
[1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:18.640]  There's so much information concerning this.
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:21.640]  And people say, oh, you're saying the Nazis run everything.
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:23.640]  Well, what about this group or that group?
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:29.640]  The idea of fascism, the system of black uniforms and secret police and arrest.
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:34.640]  I mean, Stalin said he admired Hitler. The U.S. intelligence admired him.
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:40.640]  They hired the Hitlerian intelligence to set up every major agency that came out of the National Security Act of 47.
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:44.640]  Go through all that, Jim. Break down what we're dealing with here.
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:53.640]  And we're not even saying it's a Nazi situation because what the Nazis were, they were created by what sat in London and New York, weren't they?
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:58.640]  Absolutely true. And let's get everything real clear and straight right here.
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:04.640]  When I say the Nazis are trying to take over America, I'm not talking about two-stepping Germans, okay?
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:15.640]  I'm talking about worldwide financial individuals who adhere to the philosophy of national socialism, okay?
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:19.640]  And national socialism, the acronym of which is Nazi.
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:27.640]  All right, so when you hear Nazi think national socialism, and that's what we've got going in this country right now, tied with fascism.
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:35.640]  Now, fascism by the dictionary is defined as the blending of government or state power with corporate power.
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:39.640]  Now, there's no question that the corporations are now running this country.
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:51.640]  The only difference between us and Nazi Germany is that in Germany prior to World War II, the Nazi party and the German government gained control over the corporations.
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:54.640]  And it was that combination that produced fascism.
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:11:01.640]  In modern America, the corporations have gained control over the state, but the end result is exactly the same.
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:11.640]  Now, Jim, Jim, I've got the radio on here in the studio, but I'm going to go over and get myself a glass of water so you've got the floor to the break.
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:19.640]  I'm listening. Jim Mars, whatever's most important about your book, The Rise of the Fourth Rack, people you know, break it down, give us a preview of what we'll be covering Sunday.
[1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:29.640]  Okay. Well, there's so much to go into, and I've tried to cram it into just about an hour's talk, and it's hardly time to even get into it.
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:38.640]  But what you'll find in The Rise of the Fourth Rack is the evidence and the conclusion that it's entirely possible that Hitler even escaped.
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:45.640]  You know, the idea that he killed himself, the bunker, basically came from a handful of his closest followers.
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:52.640]  And of course, they're going to tell whatever he tells them to tell. There's no hard evidence that any of that ever happened.
[1:11:52.640 --> 1:12:09.640]  That's an eye-opener. Then we find out that when he attacked Russia in June of 1941, that was simply a preemptive strike to prevent Stalin and the Communists from invading Europe in July of 1941.
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:15.640]  And Hitler himself said if he hadn't stopped this, all of Europe would have been lost. We don't get taught that in school.
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:23.640]  And then, of course, as I mentioned before, Winston Churchill even said that he didn't care who was running National Socialism.
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:27.640]  He just didn't want the Germans to be in charge of the worldwide economy.
[1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:35.640]  So that's when they turned on Hitler and joined all these nations together to stop him, which was probably a good thing.
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:41.640]  But we do. So we stopped the Germans. We stopped Hitler. But we didn't stop the National Socialists.
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:53.640]  They simply moved over to the United States and they have been slowly buying up using the loot of Europe from World War II, all these corporate companies and corporations.
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:13:04.640]  And they have been consolidating to the point now, for example, everything that you see in here is controlled by one of about five multinational corporations.
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:11.640]  And let's get into that in a minute, but I just wanted to go back. My grandfather growing up in Dallas pre-World War II, Hitler was like a rock star there.
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:21.640]  On the radio, they played his clips on WBAP and, you know, the radio stations. All the big tycoons loved him. He was like a rock star.
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:28.640]  That's right, because he was a friend of the corporations until they began to realize that he was gaining too much control.
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:35.640]  Another thing you're going to learn in the rise of the Fourth Reich is that Hitler was a New Ager's dream come true.
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:43.640]  He was against smoking, drinking. He was a vegetarian. He was against hunting. He wanted to go back to the land movement.
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:49.640]  He wanted natural homeopathic medicines. All of this stuff that you hear about in the New Age today.
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:52.640]  And he wanted to exterminate 80% of the population.
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:57.640]  That's right. Call the population exactly what their plan is today. I have their own...
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:00.640]  So again, he was one of their protégés, not the other way around.
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:01.640]  That's right.
[1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:09.640]  People always misrepresent this, because every time I study the New World Order, I run into this, exterminate the population, the master race, do this and that,
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:15.640]  and they'll centralize the banking, bankrupt countries, start wars, and then I say it's a Nazi system.
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:22.640]  People go, oh, oh, Hitler, there's Nazis under my bed, you know. No, no, no, Hitler was only fruit of the tree.
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:32.640]  He was a tool. He was a tool. In fact, he started off, we know he was an out-of-work, destitute street person, trying to make a living, drawing sketches,
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:34.640]  and then all of a sudden...
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:35.640]  He got brought into army intelligence.
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:43.640]  Yeah, earned extra money. He started working as an army intelligence agent, and that's when they picked him up and created him.
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:47.640]  Just like they have created John McCain and Barack Obama.
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:53.640]  Two years ago, most people have never heard of either one of those people, and all of a sudden now there are leading candidates.
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:55.640]  Which one are you going to vote for?
[1:14:55.640 --> 1:15:01.640]  And yet, in all that who-ra about this coming election, they rarely ever discuss the real issues.
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:07.640]  Only one person has tried to address the true issues, and that, of course, is Ron Paul.
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:12.640]  And boy, has he been right. He's on record saying, secret corporate government is taking over.
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:15.640]  We are going into fascism. He gave a speech yesterday. It is happening.
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:23.640]  That's true, and people better wake up, because at this point, as you said, we're just practically under de facto martial law now,
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:31.640]  but at least they're still paying lip service to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the balance of power in government.
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:37.640]  So let's hold our feet to the fire and make them go back and adhere to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:40.640]  and to the checks and balances built into our governmental system.
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:48.640]  Yeah, let me explain, folks, if this is a football game, and we go into full, hot, martial law, mass arrests, shootouts, FEMA camps,
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:51.640]  you know, locking down cities, people starving to death, and that's what they will do.
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:57.640]  That's their plan. They've stated it. They are lined up. We're on one side. They're on the other,
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:02.640]  and their quarterback is saying, hut, hut, hut. He's calling the plays right now.
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:05.640]  And understandly, this is life and death. Do not cower.
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:11.640]  If you cower, they win. If you speak up, get the word out, calling to talk, radio, blogs, march,
[1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:15.640]  that's why they're trying to shut down free speech. If you let them know you're not going along with it
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:21.640]  and blame them for what's happening financially, they can't pose as the saviors in the final phase of the Ponzi scheme.
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:27.640]  That's exactly right, and all you have to do is take an objective look at the Republican National Convention.
[1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:35.640]  People who were there trying to peacefully gather, peacefully voice their criticisms and their problems to the government
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:41.640]  were shut off into a, quote, free speech zone with wire all around it, blocks away from the convention.
[1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:44.640]  And then provocateur cops came around with mall-off cocktails.
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:45.640]  Exactly.
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:50.640]  And the police arrested the leaders of the demonstrations on record who were peaceful and have now charged them with terrorism.
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:57.640]  Which, again, is typical Nazi methodology in the 30s when people tried to oppose the Nazis.
[1:16:57.640 --> 1:16:59.640]  They turned SA loose on them to beat them up.
[1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:03.640]  Exactly. They'd break up their meetings, they'd break in their homes, they'd beat them up.
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:09.640]  That's exactly what's going on, and we can allow this if we're going to continue to call ourselves free Americans.
[1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:14.640]  Yeah, and, you know, they have beat me up, but I fought back, and they have made threats.
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:21.640]  And just on record, any thoughts come around my house, you just better come up behind me because I'm going to shoot you first and ask questions later.
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:22.640]  Go ahead, Jim.
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:23.640]  What about you?
[1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:31.640]  Well, I, you know, I think it's pretty funny that they put people who are trying to exercise their first amendment rights into free speech zones.
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:39.640]  Because think about it, Alex, that means all the rest of us who are not in the free speech zone, we're not. We don't have free speech.
[1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:47.640]  No, no, that's it. Well, McCain just spoke two nights ago, and for miles around it, no one was allowed in to even pens.
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  Now they just say nothing allowed. You know, it's just not allowed.
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:18:02.640]  That's right. You can't raise a question. When that student in Florida tried to ask Kerry about why he didn't contest the 2004 election, they tasered him.
[1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:06.640]  Well, I want to be clear. They are planning to use mercenaries and thugs and gangs.
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:10.640]  Obama has his youth brigade million man. McCain's called for it.
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:14.640]  And I'm serious. Any thugs come in my house with clubs or guns?
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:18.640]  And it's, I mean, what are you going to do? They try to turn thugs loose on you, Jim?
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:32.640]  Well, I'll tell you what we all need to do. According to the Constitution and the laws of this land, the sheriff, your local sheriff, is the highest ranking law enforcement officer in your county or in your state.
[1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:38.640]  Well, it's the highest elected representative. And so they're above the mayor and the county commissioners.
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:44.640]  That's right. And so we need to go to the sheriff's and we need to make them aware of what's really going on.
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:50.640]  And we need to find which ones will still adhere to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and which ones are on the payroll of the New World Order.
[1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:57.640]  Listen, I went to sheriffs and SWAT team people before the CIA showed up with money to pay them off to join the New World Order.
[1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:03.640]  They laughed at me, but then six months later called me up freaking out and I went to SWAT team commander's office.
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:07.640]  Then he got fired with some trumped up stuff a few months later and he said, how did you know this?
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:09.640]  They came and did what you said they did.
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:10.640]  That's exactly right.
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:13.640]  That's the Nazi tactic of the payoff.
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:18.640]  Exactly. Well, they'll pay you off. And if that doesn't work, then they'll see that you get defeated.
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:23.640]  And if that doesn't work, then they'll arrange an accident.
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:30.640]  Just like Paul Wellstone, JFK Jr., you try to stand up and do something to counter them.
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:33.640]  They'll do whatever it takes to get you out of the way.
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:35.640]  The good news is they're failing.
[1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:42.640]  That's right. They're desperate. That's why they're pulling out all the plugs and moving quickly into just naked martial law.
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:48.640]  Jim, I'll tell you what else is incredible. They do continue to repeat the same thing over and over again.
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:54.640]  The same fascist crowd tried at World War I and then World War II against the United States.
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:20:19.640]  They used Mexico to attack us and they're doing it again. Stay there.

[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:33.640]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:33.640 --> 1:22:36.640]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:40.640]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:43.640]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:45.640]  the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:49.640]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:22:57.640 --> 1:22:59.640]  The message of His Kingdom.
[1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:56.640]  This is Robert E. Miniforcaster.com
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:58.640]  and I approve this message.
[1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:43.640]  My whole point is the plan of San Diego.
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:45.640]  Mexico was run by Maximilian.
[1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:48.640]  It was set up by the Spanish when it fell.
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:51.640]  The Austrian-Hungarian Empire took it over.
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:55.640]  The crown prince took it over.
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:58.640]  There was always deep inroads by the Germanic Empire there.
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:03.640]  Then they attacked during World War I, killed 23 Americans in one night.
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:06.640]  The plan of San Diego was to kill all the Anglos.
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:09.640]  Then Germany was going to people Texas to California.
[1:25:09.640 --> 1:25:13.640]  They made up the word Oslon, the mythical race kingdom of the Hispanics.
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:15.640]  I always wanted to grow up.
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:19.640]  Why in San Antonio, I'd go over to friends who had friends who would go to their houses
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:22.640]  and he'd be at a Mexican's house.
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:25.640]  They'd be like a Nazi flag and he'd be like, what is that?
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:27.640]  You don't like it? I didn't understand that.
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:29.640]  That's why there's so much of that in Latin America.
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:31.640]  That's why the Germans went there after World War II.
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:34.640]  Then again in World War II, we had a Mexican's attack for Germany.
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:36.640]  That's all kept very quiet.
[1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:38.640]  We see the same thing over and over again, don't we, Jim?
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:40.640]  That's exactly right.
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:43.640]  If you want to destroy a nation, you destroy the cohesiveness of the population
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:46.640]  by unrestricted illegal immigration.
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:48.640]  I'm sure you agree with me, Alex.
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:51.640]  We're not talking about people who want to come and become an American citizen.
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:53.640]  I welcome all of them.
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:59.640]  No, we're just saying how infiltrated this whole fascist system is.
[1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:01.640]  Exactly. Here's the thing.
[1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:05.640]  Who's supposed to defend us against any kind of foreign incursions?
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:08.640]  Our national guard, our state guards.
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:10.640]  They're not here. They're fighting in Iraq.
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:12.640]  They're fighting in Afghanistan soon to be Iran.
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:16.640]  Now 20% of the army was illegal aliens. They legalized.
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:21.640]  I mean, that's the point is... What if they turn their weapons on us?
[1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:24.640]  These are things we need to start dealing with
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:28.640]  instead of being distracted by the corporate mass media
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:32.640]  that just tell us about everything under the sun except things that are important.
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:35.640]  Alex, I hate to run, but I've got to hit the road.
[1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:37.640]  I look forward to seeing your crew there on Saturday
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:39.640]  and then seeing you on Sunday.
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:41.640]  I think the brunch idea would be great.
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:46.640]  I hope everybody shows up at Brave New Books at 6 o'clock Saturday evening.
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:48.640]  Absolutely. The Rise of the Fourth Reich.
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:51.640]  Available at infowars.com or jimmars.com.
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:52.640]  Jim, see you on Sunday.
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:53.640]  Bye.
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:54.640]  Take care. There he goes.
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.640]  All right. I've got Richard Cook, amazing economist,
[1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:02.640]  White House historian on and on and on joining us about the economy.
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:06.640]  A Washington Post writer about what's happening coming up in the next segment.
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:09.640]  But I want to bring Ted back because I don't know if listeners,
[1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:14.640]  Ted Anderson, realize that this parent company might as,
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:17.640]  it's where I get my medals, gold and silver.
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:20.640]  I never got into platinum or anything like that because I was having the money at the time.
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:22.640]  But the point is, and he's got some of that too,
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:27.640]  that Ted has silver dollars, silver half dollars at below spot right now
[1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:29.640]  and gold is surging today.
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:32.640]  They have made the decision to fully devalue the dollar.
[1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:33.640]  That's 100% now.
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:37.640]  You know, you've heard Joseph Sticklet's on saying we will have a depression.
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:40.640]  You've heard Dr. Paul Craig Roberts saying it's going to happen now.
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:46.640]  You've heard who was the top guy we had on Bob Chapman yesterday.
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:47.640]  I wish this wasn't the case.
[1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:48.640]  They have guaranteed it.
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:50.640]  I don't know if it's this month or five years from now,
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:51.640]  but sooner rather than later.
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:56.640]  And folks, don't wait until when gold goes up above a thousand.
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:27:57.640]  Get involved now.
[1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:00.640]  Ted, I wanted to bring you back for two minutes because I rushed you earlier.
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:01.640]  You're just covering news.
[1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:03.640]  We spent like 30 seconds on the phone number and the offers.
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:04.640]  Explain to people.
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:09.640]  You're selling gold at below what it's currently selling for.
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:10.640]  Here's what it is.
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:12.640]  That's exactly right because here's what happened.
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:16.640]  I have to lock into a position and I have to secure it for you guys
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:19.640]  if you want to actually get delivery of this stuff in a timely fashion.
[1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:23.640]  And so, lately what's been happening is I've been locking in
[1:28:23.640 --> 1:28:26.640]  and the darn market's been just shooting up like a rocket ship.
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:30.640]  And then all of a sudden what I have is way below what would normally sell for.
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:34.640]  As a matter of fact, just the other day it was like $100 below an ounce,
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:36.640]  which is unheard of obviously.
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:39.640]  I mean, it just doesn't normally happen in the marketplace.
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:41.640]  We had one of the largest runs we've ever had in gold.
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:45.640]  And there's reasons why that's happening because the economy is melting apart.
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:48.640]  And right now I've got the silver dollars that it was offering
[1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.640]  when gold ran up $100 an ounce.
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:52.640]  I was able to sell gold for less than a spot.
[1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:54.640]  I've got the same walking liberty halves.
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:56.640]  And I can't mention it enough.
[1:28:56.640 --> 1:28:59.640]  Right now at this time, it's a steal.
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:00.640]  It really is.
[1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:03.640]  It's a great time to be getting into the gold and silver obviously
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:06.640]  for obvious reasons even a moron can tell that.
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:12.640]  And people that are sitting on these investments like IRAs and mutual funds
[1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:15.640]  and now the annuities are melting apart because of AIG
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:17.640]  and these different insurance companies that are falling apart.
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:20.640]  Folks, you need to give Midas Resources a call.
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:23.640]  800-686-2237.
[1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:28.640]  I feel good being able to offer something like this for Ted and this network
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:31.640]  because he stood behind this network and it's such a great deal.
[1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:37.640]  I mean, he's got gold and silver at below spot 800-686-2237
[1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.640]  with the gold shooting up.
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:42.640]  Give him a call 800-686-2237.
[1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:43.640]  Thanks, Ted.
[1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:44.640]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:45.640]  You bet. We'll be right back.
[1:29:50.640 --> 1:29:52.640]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:54.640]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:58.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:04.640]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:07.640]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:10.640]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:30:10.640 --> 1:30:11.640]  But who is the enemy?
[1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:12.640]  Bin Laden.
[1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:13.640]  This is his MO.
[1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:15.640]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:17.640]  We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden.
[1:30:17.640 --> 1:30:20.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:23.640]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:26.640]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:30.640]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:34.640]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:36.640]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:38.640]  The hijackers ties to the FBI.
[1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:39.640]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:41.640]  The Israeli intelligence network.
[1:30:41.640 --> 1:30:42.640]  Warnings and war games.
[1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:43.640]  The shadow government.
[1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:44.640]  And much, much more.

[1:31:27.640 --> 1:31:31.640]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:06.640]  And so we appreciate him coming on with us.
[1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:10.640]  We see the international banking cartel by design imploding the economy.
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:12.640]  Ron Paul has said this for more than a decade was the plan.
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:20.640]  We got this out of Bilderberg three years ago, they plan to start the collapse through the quote, bad mortgages.
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:24.640]  The media is blaming it on the American people when that's a very small part of it.
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:29.640]  They've been packaging those and other securities lying about their value, leveraging it out.
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:35.640]  But the real theft is now as they trick the public onto signing on to the Federal Reserve,
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:42.640]  basically bankrupting the entire system and feeding the final value of the dollar.
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:46.640]  And then our name and credit, the American people that back it up into their system.
[1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:50.640]  And now they're talking about an international bank of settlements taking over in a world banking system,
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:55.640]  quote, fixing it in a global carbon tax as the next bubble to leverage into that.
[1:34:55.640 --> 1:35:01.640]  I mean, we're talking about hundreds of new taxes regulating every facet of your life to pay for this.
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:07.640]  And right now, Sunday, the people in Congress, Republicans and Democrats were saying,
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:09.640]  well, we've got to look at these quote bailouts.
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:15.640]  And Paulson said, sit down and shut up, former Goldman Sachs head.
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:18.640]  He said, sit down and shut up.
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:22.640]  And then today, Bush and McCain and last night are blaming Congress.
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.640]  Now, I agree, they're whores, they're sold out, they're bought and paid for, they're sitting out.
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:31.640]  But to say, because Congress said, okay, we're not involved, you run it.
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:36.640]  And knowing the public's dumbed down, Bush and McCain said, you did this.
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:38.640]  You need to do something right now.
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:40.640]  Ever being told, they're not involved.
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:43.640]  Congress is supposed to control the purse strings and apportionment.
[1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:45.640]  That's the separation of powers.
[1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:46.640]  That's what they do.
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:50.640]  They raise the money, they pass the laws, the president executes.
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:54.640]  And then, of course, as the executive, that's what executive means, he executes.
[1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:58.640]  The quarterback is the executive, he executes the place.
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:00.640]  He puts it into motion.
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:07.640]  And then you've got the judiciary that are the referees that call, according to the rules of the game, the Constitution.
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:08.640]  That is all out.
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:16.640]  And two days ago, we reported it yesterday, Army Times reported armored combat brigades to quote, engage the American people.
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:19.640]  They said in there, we hope we don't have to shoot anybody.
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:25.640]  And they said, four riots, insurrection, and they're going to be out helping with the jaws of life for PR.
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:26.640]  Why is the Army here?
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:27.640]  Oh, we help now.
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:29.640]  It gets you out of crash cars.
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:30.640]  That's the PR.
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:32.640]  So that's setting the table.
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:34.640]  Things are moving even faster than I thought.
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:35.640]  Please break down.
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:38.640]  He's a great economic historian and economist.
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:45.640]  Give us a basic boil down of the history of who we're dealing with and then the current phase we're now moving into right now.
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:48.640]  Well, good talking with you, Alex.
[1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.640]  Good to have you on, my friend.
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:52.640]  Appreciate what you just ran through.
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:37:03.640]  I'd like to take a step back and maybe approach from a little bit of a broader viewpoint than what we're getting in most of the media accounts on this.
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:11.640]  Because, you know, the media is portraying this as, oh, gee, some kind of a great disaster that's happening within the financial system.
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:19.640]  The worst right off of assets, I think, Pearlstein and the Washington Post has called it, that we've ever seen.
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:31.640]  But what we are really seeing, in my opinion, is the financial economy is crashing back into the direction of the producing economy.
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:39.640]  You know, I've spoken of the producing economy before as what we working men and women produce.
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:46.640]  The real economy, that's what Stiglitz, two-time Nobel Prize winner said on the show Tuesday.
[1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:54.640]  But the elite are bragging and saying that this is going to create their world financial system, but you see opportunity in this.
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:59.640]  Well, the real economy is what carries the weight of all of this.
[1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:20.640]  Nothing that the Federal Reserve can do to lend money into the system, produce liquidity, you know, all of those fancy words they use, can change the fact that everything of value that is put into the system ultimately rests on one of us going to work every day doing our job and producing something of value.
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:34.640]  But that's what they're doing, Richard, as you know, is that they are absorbing the real economy. They are tricking the real economy into signing on to, quote, bail out or be fully bankrupted via fraud.
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:38.640]  It's not a real contract to, quote, bail out. I mean, do you agree with that?
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:50.640]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. But the root cause of it is our debt-based monetary system that overloads the producing economy with debt.
[1:38:50.640 --> 1:39:02.640]  And I pointed out, I just came out with an article yesterday which is entitled, well, it's in global research impacts of the financial crisis.
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:22.640]  The U.S. is becoming an impoverished nation. And I try to point out there that all of the bad loans, all of the rotten toxic assets and so on and so forth that all of these financial institutions are now faced with were all leveraged by bank money.
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:34.640]  You know, if you go into the commodities futures market and buy a commodities futures contract, you're not putting down your own money. Maybe 3% of what you're paying is your own capital.
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:46.640]  But 97% of that is leveraged money that you borrow from a bank through a brokerage. And it's the same case with every other type of financial asset.
[1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:59.640]  So the whole system is built upon leverage borrowing from the banks through a debt-based monetary system where the only way money is ever created is by a loan from a bank.
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:12.640]  And what this means is that you not only have a mountain of debt that you've piled on every asset, including people's houses, as we know, but then you've got the interest payments to go with it.
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:19.640]  And the name for interest payments on debts of this type is usury.
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:21.640]  Now I would call it a...
[1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:32.640]  I would call it a scientifically designed economic black hole vortex designed generationally to cause us to wake up homeless on the continent.
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:37.640]  Our forefathers conquered in the words of Thomas Jefferson to paraphrase.
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:48.640]  Now what the usury is, it's a mathematical formula causing debt to increase exponentially over time regardless of the productivity of the asset.
[1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:57.640]  And let's be clear, they created all this out of fiat. They did absolutely nothing but buy a few politicians off in 1913 and then they've sucked everything out of us.
[1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:01.640]  They bought up most of the economy and now they're butchering the hog.
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:14.640]  In 1913, of course, that's when the Federal Reserve System was put into place and that's when the usury-based financial system kind of got everything in a stranglehold and that became the system that we work under.
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:17.640]  Of course, usury has been around for a long, long time.
[1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:22.640]  There's one writer that I really have appreciated.
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:31.640]  He's been in touch with him. His name is Matthew Raphael Johnson, who writes a lot about the situation between the U.S. and Russia.
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:46.640]  But he identifies the system we're under as the Babylonian system because it was really thousands of years ago when the system of usury was invented and it's been a plague on Western civilization ever since.
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:47.640]  It's predatory.
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:59.640]  It's a predatory system and we're living under that today and that is the system that has us in a stranglehold and that system is overlaid on everything that we see coming out of the financial news.
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:06.640]  Behind it is leveraging from the banks its money being created by the banks out of thin air.
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:17.640]  Speculative lending piled on top of any contract that's written, any product that's produced, anything that moves from one place to another.
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:25.640]  It all has built into it predatory, speculative, usury-based lending coming out of leveraging by the banks.
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:28.640]  The banks are the ones who are getting off scot-free.
[1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:32.640]  They're taking down everybody else. They're taking down the investment houses.
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:35.640]  They're going in there and taking over the assets of AIG.
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:38.640]  But they're the ones who are really behind this.
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:45.640]  They're the ones that Bernanke works for, that Paulson works for because they're the ones who own the federal resource system.
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:50.640]  Richard C. Cook, economic historian, economist. Let's be in layman's terms.
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:51.640]  Let's explain that.
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:55.640]  Even the Financial Times of London admitted this in multiple articles.
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:58.640]  It's the true paper of financial record.
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:04.640]  There's still some deception there, but they're quite blunt about a lot of things that you have the mega elite banks and the mega rich.
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:12.640]  Are engineering this and then really causing the panic out of Ponzi schemes they created.
[1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:23.640]  Now they aren't just consolidating the rest of the financial order that was under them, but also then tricking us into being sucked completely into the vortices.
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:29.640]  And then at least on the surface, signing our name onto the bailout.
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:38.640]  And they're the ones who in the long run will end up owning the assets because what people need to understand, and some people have already pointed this out.
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:42.640]  The bailouts are not for the homeowners.
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:49.640]  I've got people who write to me who say, well, this bankruptcy of the system won't have to pay my mortgage or I won't have to pay my loan.
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:51.640]  The answer to that is absolutely not.
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:58.640]  Your loan and your mortgage binds you to that no matter who owns the loan or who owns the mortgage.
[1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:07.640]  And if these loans and mortgages and other paper assets go up the food chain into the hands of the bigger and bigger players, the bigger and bigger banks,
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:10.640]  they're the ones who will come knocking on your door to pay that.
[1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:16.640]  Even if your local institution has gone under or your brokerage has gone under, you're going to have to pay somebody.
[1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:21.640]  And those assets are increasingly passing into the hands of the bigger and bigger players.
[1:44:21.640 --> 1:44:27.640]  They're the ones you're going to owe and you're not only going to have to owe the money to those bigger and bigger players.
[1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:35.640]  But you're going to have to bail those international banks out because they've taken over the assets for anybody that does walk away from the house.
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:37.640]  And then later, they're going to sell the house again.
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:40.640]  So it's just, this is the great feeding frenzy.
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:53.640]  Yeah, and with this AIG bailout, the other morning it was announced that the Federal Reserve was going to put out $85 billion to bail out AIG.
[1:44:53.640 --> 1:45:03.640]  And then you read later that day that the Treasury Department has been asked by the Federal Reserve, asked means told, of course.
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:14.640]  The Treasury is going to have to come up with $45 billion in new Treasury bills in order to compensate the Federal Reserve for what it's putting out.
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:19.640]  And when you're talking about Treasury debt, you're talking about adding to the national debt.
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:29.640]  You're talking about interest payments that are going to be made by the taxpayer because with the 2009 federal budget, people don't understand this.
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:42.640]  The federal budget that we're paying for through taxes for 2009 contains approximately $500 billion in interest payments on the national debt.
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:53.640]  So even if they can continue to roll over these debts year by year by year, buying more and more debt to cover up the previous debt, the interest always goes into the federal budget.
[1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:57.640]  And it's the interest payments that now are getting completely out of control.
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:46:02.640]  Well, and of course, that's the banker's plan is to get it out of control.
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:05.640]  That's where banks always, quote, make their money.
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:09.640]  They issue the false liquidity, the fiat currency.
[1:46:09.640 --> 1:46:13.640]  They're allowed to fractionally inflate it.
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:24.640]  But the true boon is creating these controlled implosions, then their assets are protected, then they come in and scoop it all up for pennies on the dollar.
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:33.640]  And I listen to financial news, I listen to talk radio, and I hear them saying, well, the Federal Government, the Federal Reserve is going to save us.
[1:46:33.640 --> 1:46:35.640]  And no, it's our money.
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:37.640]  It's saving nobody but them.
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:39.640]  Well, that's correct.
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:46.640]  Now, let's talk for a minute about the housing situation, because that's where this hits people the hardest.
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:52.640]  In the United States, our homes are our number one asset.
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:47:00.640]  Now, the housing bubble inflated the cost of homes over the last 10 years way beyond their real value.
[1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:06.640]  You know, when Greenspan lowered the long-term interest rates and the feeding frenzy began.
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:10.640]  In Austin, it was $200,000 10 years ago is a million now.
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:16.640]  So people are paying for this inflation through their home mortgages.
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:18.640]  They are having to work it off.
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:34.640]  And the bailouts, the real purpose of the bailouts are to keep the housing prices up, to stem the collapse of housing prices and the deflation of housing prices, because people need to keep working to pay off those inflated mortgages.
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:46.640]  And it's also an inflation sink or a place to hide it, because if housing drops, most economists would think that that would actually somehow stem inflation, but no, it will actually trigger it.
[1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:48.640]  A lot of economists say, do you agree with that?
[1:47:48.640 --> 1:48:03.640]  Well, if housing dropped, what it would do would be reduce the amount of purchasing power throughout the economy, because that's what the housing bubble was created to do in the first place.
[1:48:03.640 --> 1:48:09.640]  We gave away our manufacturing industry since the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s.
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:23.640]  We exported millions of well-paying manufacturing jobs, and so people no longer had the purchasing power to maintain the economy, which means to keep the stock market up.
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:27.640]  So they had to live off new mortgages on the increase in their homes or roll them over.
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:28.640]  But here's the problem.
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:34.640]  The international bankers did that knowing they'd pop the bubble later to fully implode the economy.
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:36.640]  That's why they paid incentives to move offshore.
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:40.640]  The globalists stated in IMF and World Bank plans that they were engineering it.
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:53.640]  So I'm saying, do you agree from the evidence that we are now coming to a controlled implosion, or as some economists are saying, they planned that, but not this early, and this caught them with their pants down?
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:55.640]  Well, it is a planned implosion.
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:01.640]  It is a controlled implosion, and I've been talking for months really about the so-called soft landing.
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:06.640]  This is what they mean by the soft landing, and we're seeing it's not very soft.
[1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:19.640]  I have said also that they're trying to keep the economy afloat until after the November election, and they seem to have gotten a little bit ahead of themselves here simply because it's been moving so fast.
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:21.640]  Yeah, Katie, bar the door after the election.
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:22.640]  Right.
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:28.640]  And again, as I said, we don't see any relief for the working people to help them pay off these inflated mortgages.
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:34.640]  And even if the economy goes into a recession, well, I've been arguing it's been in a recession since 2003 anyway.
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:43.640]  But as purchasing power from jobs go down, the cost of the mortgages stay up because we can't get out of those mortgages.
[1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:53.640]  And so people become poorer and poorer and poorer, and that's why the whole economy is slipping into this state of endemic system-wide poverty.
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:55.640]  And that's why they're moving armored brigades into the U.S.
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:49:57.640]  Well, sure, they're anticipating the riots.
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:50:10.640]  We had food riots in other countries around the world because of the inflation and food prices, and of course they've got plans to maintain civil order, as they call it, through the military.
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:16.640]  Yeah, that's something, I think, that is there and is going to continue to be there.
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:17.640]  Well, so here's the deal.
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:19.640]  It would get worse.
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:21.640]  And they foresaw that and set that up decades ago.
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:29.640]  So basically, the people are going to have to basically hand all their money over to the bankers, and then we get nothing, even though it's our money.
[1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:33.640]  And so to me, it's all a fraudulent business deal.
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:38.640]  When we come back, Richard, I want to get into the real economy, which you're also someone of an expert on.
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:40.640]  Where do you see that going?
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:50.640]  You know, not just the bankers, not just the dollar, but how is this going to affect somebody who owns a pet store, somebody who owns a video store, somebody who owns a gas station, somebody who sells office printers?
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:55.640]  How is it going to affect radio, TV? How is it going to affect the private sector?
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:59.640]  And can the government just keep sitting and sucking off of us forever?
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:01.640]  I mean, what happens when we all go bankrupt?
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:10.640]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:17.640]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:26.640]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:51:26.640 --> 1:51:33.640]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:36.640]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:42.640]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:45.640]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:02.640]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:04.640]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:06.640]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:07.640]  Sound familiar?
[1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:10.640]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:09.640]  Music
[1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:16.640]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:24.640]  Yard straight was singing seashores of old Mexico.
[1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:26.640]  It sounded so good.
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:31.640]  Got an idea, I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:35.640]  The long star state should be renamed Texaco.
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:38.640]  After all, it's all the plan of San Diego.
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:42.640]  Long Texas, hello Mexico.
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:47.640]  All right, Richard Cook, I'm all over the map here, but we know what the bankers are doing.
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:48.640]  They're sucking us dry.
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:49.640]  It's all engineered.
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:51.640]  How do you see this unfolding?
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:56.640]  The big picture, your prognosis has been correct so far.
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:54:57.640]  Where do you see it going now?
[1:54:57.640 --> 1:54:59.640]  It seems to be deepening faster than we even thought.
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:01.640]  And then how is this going to affect the real economy?
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:03.640]  I mean, they're hiring more cops.
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:04.640]  They got more checkpoints.
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:05.640]  They're writing more tickets.
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:08.640]  They're more taxes, fines, fees.
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:12.640]  I mean, it looks like they're just going to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.
[1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:17.640]  Let me put in a quick plug for my website if I could, Alex.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:18.640]  Yeah, put the website out.
[1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:19.640]  I want to be sure I get that.
[1:55:19.640 --> 1:55:26.640]  I have a new special report out called Election 08, Crime Family Food Fight or Threat to Mankind.
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:33.640]  It's available if people will write to our email on economicsanityatgmail.com.
[1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:36.640]  It's economicsanityatgmail.com.
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:38.640]  Why don't you give your website out too?
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:41.640]  www.richardscook.com.
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:46.640]  And my articles are available on global research and other websites.
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:56.640]  Okay, having said that, we have been in a recession really on the producing level of producing economy since late in 2003.
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:02.640]  You can tell that by seeing how M1, the amount of money available in cash and checking accounts, has been flat
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:08.640]  and has even declined a little bit, even though inflation has been moving along pretty quickly.
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:10.640]  We're now seeing stores closing.
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:12.640]  We're seeing chains stores shutting down.
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:20.640]  A lot of their local stores, cutting back on local stores, we're seeing whole retail businesses threatened.
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:25.640]  Sears is going to be shutting down more places, best buy places like that.
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:32.640]  We've got the food and fuel prices rising that everyone has been seeing, even though there's been a little bit of slippage in the commodities markets.
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:34.640]  It never goes back to where it was before.
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:37.640]  Yeah, it's still 325, 350 a gallon.
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:38.640]  That's right.
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:41.640]  And it's probably going to go up again pretty soon.
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:43.640]  And people think that's great.
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:44.640]  Oh, it's only 350.
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:46.640]  Oh, I got my gas for 350.
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:47.640]  Wow.
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:49.640]  We're seeing tent cities throughout the United States.
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:53.640]  There was an article about big tent cities in Reno, Nevada the other day.
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:55.640]  People move there because they think there's jobs.
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:58.640]  There's no jobs, so they live in a tent in a parking lot.
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:00.640]  Poverty is growing.
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:06.640]  The number of people who are not able to get decent food to eat is growing.
[1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:12.640]  We're going to have a situation with the foreclosures where we're going to have a lot of empty houses that can't be bought,
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:20.640]  and then people living in houses together because the only way a lot of people can afford to live anymore is by doubling up or tripling up in houses.
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:31.640]  Last month, we lost 60,000 jobs, and this has come on the heels of thousands of jobs lost per month during the previous six months,
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:37.640]  but it is 60,000 in August. We're waiting to see what it's going to be for September.
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:39.640]  But this is happening around the world.
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:49.640]  I mean, if you look at the statistics for all the other developed and underdeveloped nations, the whole world is sliding into a global recession.
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:56.640]  If you want to really see something interesting, people should go to the homepage of the International Monetary Fund
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:03.640]  because they have a whole series of articles in there about the global recession this beginning,
[1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:10.640]  and they're rolling out these new loan programs for developing nations as long as they do things like cut consumption of food,
[1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.640]  and you know what that means.
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:14.640]  So this is happening everywhere.
[1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:21.640]  The producing economy around the world is going into a very deep and very steep slide
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:34.640]  that the financial economy really can't do anything about because all the financial economy does is suck the excess availability of cash out of the producing economy,
[1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:37.640]  at least people in an even worse situation than they were in before.
[1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:51.640]  Stay there. Stay there. Back in one minute.
[1:58:51.640 --> 1:59:07.640]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:25.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:37.640]  It broadens connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:44.640]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:44.640 --> 1:59:54.640]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:54.640 --> 2:00:05.640]  More on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:13.640]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.640 --> 2:00:27.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:44.640]  We have a criminal government completely rogue doing whatever it wants, whenever it wants, totally beholden to financial interest, strip-mining the societal treasures of the United States and leaving behind a rearguard of scorched earth paramilitary police
[2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:57.640]  to virtually just control us as they burned out third world cesspit, as they burned the bridges behind them. It's a military operation or a military precision. Richard C. Cook is our guest.
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:04.640]  We've now reached the point where the IMF World Bank crime syndicates operation is like a hundred pound tick attached to a fifty pound dog.
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:17.640]  And I see articles like this every day. Agency French Press or French news agency rising prices to another seventy-five million towards starvation. And when you read it, it's what Mr. Cook just said before the break.
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:25.640]  Economist, economic historian, advisor to the White House, Washington Post writer, NASA advisor.
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:37.640]  The IMF has a hundred point plan. They come in and they say you will sterilize your people. You will not feed them. You will give us everything. You will sign everything over to us at twenty percent compounded interest.
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:45.640]  And the dictator signs the check, flies in, moves to Switzerland, and that's the end of it. The people die. This is blasphemous.
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:02:00.640]  So we're getting into the real economy. What this looks like is the pressure cooker heats up. Global numbers affected by acute hunger rose from eight hundred and fifty million to nine hundred twenty-five million by the start of this year because of rising prices.
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:08.640]  The head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said Wednesday. And I always hear these redneck idiots and liberal trendies. They all do it.
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:15.640]  They go, well, you ever see those starving blacks on TV and people in Asia? They're pathetic. Why don't they just move where there's food?
[2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:20.640]  Because there's another tribe in the region over that wants to chop their arms and legs off with machetes.
[2:02:20.640 --> 2:02:35.640]  Then because the United States and NATO and Europe and the rest of them put in dictators there over and over again and throughout good governments and paid groups to go in and kill the good government and to go in and destroy all the farm equipment and it's all in official documents.
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:43.640]  So when you see those little starving kids with flies all over them, it's all on our heads because we let these murderers take control.
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:50.640]  Let's go back to Mr. Cook in the three minutes we've got left in this segment and we're going to come back and really give him the floor to go with where he sees all this going in the future.
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:52.640]  Continue with the real economy.
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:03:05.640]  Well, one thing people really do not understand is that the problem we're facing today is not with the real economy. It's not with the producing economy.
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:17.640]  Despite all that we hear about scarcity, shortages, and so on, I think there's a consensus among people who really understand these things, like Stiglitz, for example, who worked for the World Bank,
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:27.640]  that the world's economy is capable of producing what people need to live, not only in the developed nations, but also in the underdeveloped nations or the developing nations,
[2:03:27.640 --> 2:03:31.640]  if they had a free hand, for example, to grow their own food.
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:33.640]  Well, that do not have any more.
[2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:41.640]  I can interrupt again, but you just bring up too many good points. The British Population Commission from 44 to 49 said the third world's going to do too good.
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:45.640]  Unless we do this, we can produce five times what we need. Go ahead.
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:53.640]  Yes, that's correct. And what the developing world has been doing in the last 10 years has been remarkable.
[2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:57.640]  I mean, China has had tremendous growth rate. India has a tremendous growth rate.
[2:03:57.640 --> 2:04:05.640]  And even the nations of Africa have had a fairly decent growth rate over the last five years.
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:16.640]  Now, according to the IMF, all that is about to end. And it's about to end because of the rise in prices of fuel and of food.
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:23.640]  They're projecting significant declines in the growth rate of the developing world because of this.
[2:04:23.640 --> 2:04:31.640]  And of course, we know that the rise of prices is not because of supply and demand factors, which the propaganda tries to get us to believe,
[2:04:31.640 --> 2:04:36.640]  but it's because of controlled markets. It's because of the controlled futures markets.
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:41.640]  It's because of the controlled worldwide oil markets.
[2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:47.640]  Richard, stop. Let's come back to that after the break. By the way, it's been announced. The red light cameras, you thought were for red lights?
[2:04:47.640 --> 2:05:01.640]  U.S. governments involved was part of a larger grid. Mainstream news. They're tracking us everywhere we go in a second probe.
[2:05:01.640 --> 2:05:09.640]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut,
[2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:18.640]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:25.640]  in which family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:05:25.640 --> 2:05:32.640]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[2:05:32.640 --> 2:05:41.640]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see. Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.

[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:22.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:30.640]  The lone-sharking New World Order crime syndicate controllers, the architects of enslavement, that's the only way to describe them,
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:38.640]  have engineered a system to buy up our counties, our cities, our states, our infrastructure to use our credit and our name to buy up the world's infrastructure.
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:43.640]  Now they've moved into the final phase of the Ponzi scheme, but instead of running out of town with all their goods,
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:48.640]  they've decided to fully basically accelerate debt to the power of infinity,
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:55.640]  and then use a militarized police state to enforce our payment to them for their right to own the world.
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:09:05.640]  It's like paying to be a slave is what I call it. It is just amazing. Richard C. Cook, economist, historian, is our guest.
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:15.640]  He's predicted a lot of this, and we even have a link to one of the global research stories, the one he just put out today, up on infowars.com right now.
[2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:18.640]  We'll give you his website before he leaves us in about 20 minutes.
[2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:31.640]  But continue where you left off about what's really causing what's happening in the economy and how you see this unfolding in lieu of multi-hundred-billion-dollar bailouts on a daily basis.
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:38.640]  Well, one point I want to make, you know, this is a central point, and it's in the article that's coming up today.
[2:09:38.640 --> 2:09:47.640]  The root cause of all of this is the debt-based monetary system that overloads the producing economy with debt.
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:53.640]  And this is the system that, of course, the Federal Reserve has managed since 1913. They didn't originate it.
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:10:00.640]  It had been around a long time. We had the First Bank of the United States, Second Bank of the United States, the National Banking System.
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:07.640]  We have been basing our economy on debt and debt produced money almost since the United States began.
[2:10:07.640 --> 2:10:15.640]  And the reason that it worked in the past was that we had a very rapidly growing economy that was able to keep one step ahead.
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:16.640]  Western expansion.
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:20.640]  Yeah, and we don't have that anymore. We have a slow growth economy now.
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:28.640]  And even though the Federal Reserve has talked about lowering interest rates and interest rates coming down to allow people to buy their homes,
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:35.640]  historically, these interest rates are much higher than they were, say, for example, in the 1930s during the New Deal,
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:45.640]  when we had the basis of the savings and loan industry put into place where very low interest was used for people to buy homes.
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:52.640]  And we also had the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that gave very low interest loans in the range of one to two percent
[2:10:52.640 --> 2:10:58.640]  to industry, to farmers, to state and local governments for building infrastructure and that type of thing.
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:07.640]  And the physical economy of the United States really was created by the New Deal using very low cost credit.
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:18.640]  And the Federal Reserve at that time during the 1930s actually worked with Roosevelt and the federal government in order to allow very low interest to come into being.
[2:11:18.640 --> 2:11:29.640]  We lost all of that starting in the 1950s. In the 50s, the financial industry, the big banks, big financiers began to take over the economy again,
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:35.640]  raise interest rates, and we've had a steadily rising regime of interest rates ever since then.
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:44.640]  It really took off in the 1970s. And then we had the Volcker recession of 1979 to 1983 where interest went over 20 percent.
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:47.640]  And that's what really brought down our producing economy.
[2:11:47.640 --> 2:11:51.640]  Now, Richard, there are millions of people out there listening.
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:57.640]  Thousands who believe whatever the programming is and they're saying, high interest rates, interest rates are at four percent.
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:12:03.640]  No, real interest rates are at about nine, ten percent. Some people are paying twenty-some percent on credit cards.
[2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:09.640]  Do you want to explain real interest rates and real economic numbers versus the pablum that's put out?
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:16.640]  Well, interest grows exponentially because it's compounded and people can see that in their credit cards,
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:24.640]  particularly if they're paying like 20 percent, my daughter has been religiously making her credit card payments
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:31.640]  and she can never pay any more than the interest because the interest just keeps going up with a mortgage.
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:36.640]  All of the interest is paid up front in the mortgage so you can go years and all your paying is interest,
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:43.640]  or you can have interest-only loans where you're never doing anything but paying more and more interest to the banks,
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:46.640]  which just compounds mechanically.
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:54.640]  And so in the course of U.S. history, when we've been under the system for now 200 years,
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:13:03.640]  interest has taken us to the point where the total debt that is sitting on top of our economy is almost at the $70 trillion range.
[2:13:03.640 --> 2:13:09.640]  And that doesn't even count what they call federal unfunded liabilities, you know, for the out years for Social Security and Medicare, that sort of thing.
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:15.640]  Well, that's what I wanted to say is that I've looked at the numbers, especially the new ones with all these bailouts.
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:19.640]  There's more fiat debt than there is even real assets in the world.
[2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:24.640]  Yes, that's correct when you get into the total derivatives load and the derivative debt.
[2:13:24.640 --> 2:13:28.640]  But if you take something just like the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout,
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:36.640]  the Federal Reserve now is going to add to our debt load and the Treasury Department,
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:44.640]  possibly up to $5.3 trillion, because that's what Fannie Mae and the Freddie Mac asset load amounts to.
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:50.640]  Our federal deficit right now has taken us to a $9 trillion national debt.
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:59.640]  We could be increasing that by half again as much over the next several years, simply by one bailout of the big mortgage insurers.
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:00.640]  That's another question.
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:07.640]  The debt load is just astronomical. They're saying these bailouts are $2 trillion, but if they admit the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:10.640]  even if it's on the low side, it is $5 trillion.
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:17.640]  That's what they insure. $5.3 trillion is their asset base of what they insure.
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:21.640]  So when we hear Paulson saying it's a trillion, that's a huge lie.
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:27.640]  Well, the low ball estimate, you know, that's what we hope we can get away with.
[2:14:27.640 --> 2:14:30.640]  The downside potential is much greater than that.
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:38.640]  And again, it all depends on whether the producing economy is going to allow working people to make enough money to pay off of these loans
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:41.640]  or whether they just continue to go into foreclosure.
[2:14:41.640 --> 2:14:43.640]  And it doesn't look like that's going to happen.
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:46.640]  Well, we have our factories are gone. We're at the base.
[2:14:46.640 --> 2:14:51.640]  Tax incentives to leave, more and more bureaucracy in taxes.
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:53.640]  I mean, that's what I'm saying. Where do you see things going?
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:58.640]  Well, the one good sign that we have is that exports are increasing.
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:03.640]  We've seen a little bit of growth because of the, you know, the dollar is not sliding as much as it did,
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:07.640]  because the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates anymore.
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:14.640]  But I think we're looking at a long-term recession or even depression where working people are just going to have to work harder
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:22.640]  and more jobs, longer hours, just to pay down the debts, because the only way out of it is bankruptcy.
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:24.640]  And they've made it harder and harder.
[2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:29.640]  As you know, the 2005 bankruptcy reform law made it harder than ever before.
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:30.640]  Because they knew this was coming.
[2:15:30.640 --> 2:15:31.640]  To go bankrupt. Yeah.
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:34.640]  And it was to protect the credit card companies.
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.640]  And student loans, for example, were taken off the table.
[2:15:38.640 --> 2:15:42.640]  You can no longer declare bankruptcy and get out of paying a student loan.
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:44.640]  That rides all the way through bankruptcy.
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:45.640]  Now, let's think about this.
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:47.640]  Your tax bill and the tax bills are going up.
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:49.640]  I was about to say, let's think about this.
[2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:53.640]  The tax bills don't go away. You can't really declare bankruptcy like you could.
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:56.640]  But they wrote the law so they can move their money offshore.
[2:15:56.640 --> 2:16:00.640]  A few years ago, they changed that to block us, the slaves.
[2:16:00.640 --> 2:16:03.640]  They passed a law so it's hard to declare bankruptcy.
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:06.640]  I mean, they preemptively have headed off the pass.
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:07.640]  Yes, that is correct.
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:09.640]  And then we get to bail them out.
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:11.640]  Yeah, that is correct. That's absolutely correct.
[2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:17.640]  That's why I'm saying that the United States is becoming an impoverished nation.
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:20.640]  Now, let me make another point here.
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:24.640]  What is driving the bailouts?
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:30.640]  One factor that is driving the bailouts is competition with Russia.
[2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:37.640]  We are now facing the possibility, in fact, the reality of a resurgent Russia
[2:16:37.640 --> 2:16:43.640]  that is not buying into the New World Order financial system
[2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:50.640]  that is creating its own ability to finance its internal economy
[2:16:50.640 --> 2:16:55.640]  that is supplying huge amounts of natural gas to Europe
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:17:03.640]  that is beginning to regain its position of power with respect to the Central Asian republics
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:09.640]  that used to be part of the USSR, that are moving toward an alliance with China
[2:17:09.640 --> 2:17:13.640]  and possibly with India.
[2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:18.640]  We're moving toward what the Russian leaders are calling a multi-polar world.
[2:17:18.640 --> 2:17:23.640]  They put us on notice that they're not buying in any longer to the unipolar world
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:26.640]  where the United States simply controls everything.
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:29.640]  So we've met our match on the world stage
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:35.640]  and what they're trying to do is to keep some semblance of an economy afloat
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:40.640]  because as time goes on and we're in increasing competition with Russia
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:47.640]  for world prestige, for world power, for leverage and dealing with other nations
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:51.640]  such as the Latin American nations, we're in serious trouble
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:57.640]  in terms of being able to present to the world a functioning society, a functioning economy.
[2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:01.640]  And by the way, everybody knows they write White House memos saying,
[2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:07.640]  torture children, everybody knows we have demons, untrustworthy culls, running things.
[2:18:07.640 --> 2:18:12.640]  And I'm sure you know this, Richard, but NATO announced massive military spending increase
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:16.640]  and massive reaction buildup forces for war with Russia.
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:17.640]  Did you see that today?
[2:18:17.640 --> 2:18:22.640]  No, I did not see that today, but of course that's what the trend is.
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:26.640]  We have been trying and of course NATO becomes part of this.
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:31.640]  NATO oftentimes even acts independently of the U.S.
[2:18:31.640 --> 2:18:34.640]  it did in the Balkan Wars.
[2:18:34.640 --> 2:18:38.640]  They've been trying to surround Russia and that's why the Ukraine
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:43.640]  and the Georgian Republic have become such a battleground between Russia and the West.
[2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:47.640]  And now we see the Ukraine beginning to move back toward Russia.
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:51.640]  That's right, in fact, the puppet that the globalists put in
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:55.640]  is basically losing control of the parliament right now as pro-Russian forces take over
[2:18:55.640 --> 2:18:59.640]  who had been anti-Russian, but they see this, they don't want to be used as a
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:01.640]  suicidal pawn against Russia.
[2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:05.640]  Well, that's right, and the Ukraine traditionally is a Russian ally
[2:19:05.640 --> 2:19:08.640]  and has of course been part of Russia at one time.
[2:19:08.640 --> 2:19:11.640]  And now they're moving back toward Russia.
[2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:22.640]  So the sides are being drawn in the world for what could become a very, very devastating war.
[2:19:22.640 --> 2:19:27.640]  And it doesn't have to happen that way, but it's going to happen that way
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:29.640]  unless something can be done.
[2:19:29.640 --> 2:19:34.640]  And I've always said that the easiest way for a nation that is bankrupt
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:39.640]  to get out of harm's way or so they think is to start a war
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:41.640]  because then they can cancel their debts.
[2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:45.640]  And to me that's the biggest concern that I have right now.
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:47.640]  Final segment with Richard C. Cook.
[2:19:47.640 --> 2:19:53.640]  We'll talk about the geopolitical formations and the different ways this could unfold
[2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:54.640]  on the other side.
[2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:56.640]  We'll also give you his website.
[2:19:56.640 --> 2:19:59.640]  I'm Alex Jones, oursisinfowars.com.
[2:20:01.640 --> 2:20:05.640]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard,
[2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:07.640]  the US dollar has been evaluating.
[2:20:07.640 --> 2:20:10.640]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:13.640]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[2:20:13.640 --> 2:20:15.640]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[2:20:15.640 --> 2:20:19.640]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[2:20:19.640 --> 2:20:25.640]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913
[2:20:25.640 --> 2:20:27.640]  and kept them both until now,
[2:20:27.640 --> 2:20:31.640]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[2:20:31.640 --> 2:20:35.640]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:37.640]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:07.640]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:10.640]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:11.640]  But who is the enemy?
[2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:12.640]  Bin Laden.
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:13.640]  This is his MO.
[2:21:13.640 --> 2:21:14.640]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:16.640]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:21:16.640 --> 2:21:19.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[2:21:19.640 --> 2:21:23.640]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:26.640]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[2:21:26.640 --> 2:21:30.640]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:34.640]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:34.640 --> 2:21:38.640]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[2:21:38.640 --> 2:21:41.640]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:21:41.640 --> 2:21:44.640]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:45.640]  Fabled enemies.

[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:04.640]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights on toll booths
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:08.640]  and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate
[2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:10.640]  only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[2:22:10.640 --> 2:22:14.640]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:18.640]  Spray Your Plate is a spray on photo blocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[2:22:18.640 --> 2:22:23.640]  Spray Your Plate photo blocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images
[2:22:23.640 --> 2:22:25.640]  making your plate unreadable.
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:29.640]  One can of photo blocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever,
[2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:31.640]  and is completely undetectable.
[2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:35.640]  You cannot afford to not be protected with Spray Your Plate photo blocker.

[2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:00.640]  Spray Your Plate.
[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:06.640]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world
[2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:09.640]  suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:14.640]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:17.640]  from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[2:23:17.640 --> 2:23:22.640]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:25.640]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:29.640]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol.
[2:23:29.640 --> 2:23:33.640]  Naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder,

[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:12.640]  I beg the listeners of this radio show to go to the archives of it that are all over the web
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:17.640]  and listen to shows from two years ago, five years ago, ten years ago.
[2:24:17.640 --> 2:24:25.640]  I spend five, six, seven hours a day, I mean, I've got books on the shelf, you know, European economics,
[2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:31.640]  and some family cousin will be over who's a, you know, banker,
[2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:34.640]  and they'll freak out that, you know, I wouldn't even read that in college.
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:38.640]  It's interesting, you have to understand it, and not that I'm some mastermind of this.
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:44.640]  I generally, I'm a generalist, I read lots of different things, study things, but I bring on the experts.
[2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:49.640]  And the real experts, not the talking heads you see on TV, but people who've had track records
[2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:54.640]  where you can go read their writings from 10, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
[2:24:54.640 --> 2:24:58.640]  and see that they were right, that's who we bring you, people like Richard C. Cook.
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:05.640]  And so it's an acceleration of knowledge, all of us together going over different facets, different angles, different perspectives.
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:13.640]  Everyone agrees, we have a very decadent, megalomaniacal elite in control of the United States.
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:17.640]  This happens more often than not. They are moving towards martial law.
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:23.640]  They are moving towards some of the most hellish tyranny scientifically organized and directed ever seen.
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:27.640]  But the good news is they're losing credibility and being exposed everywhere.
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:30.640]  So I've got a lot of optimism.
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:36.640]  Now that doesn't mean that we're even winning the fight. It means we've got a chance to win the fight.
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:39.640]  We've got about four minutes left, Richard C. Cook.
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:43.640]  I really appreciate you honoring us with so much time. I know you're a busy man.
[2:25:43.640 --> 2:25:50.640]  In the last four minutes, anything else you want to add about the geopolitical outlook and how one of these wars could start?
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:57.640]  Well, it's already started because what we've seen in the Georgia situation was one of those border skirmishes
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:01.640]  between the West and Russia.
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:09.640]  And it's only going to get worse unless something is done to resolve the economic situation in the United States
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:12.640]  because it's what some people have called a flight forward.
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:19.640]  We can't solve our own problems, so in order to escape from them, we blame someone else and go try to start a war with somebody.
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:25.640]  That isn't going to work anymore. That is the end game that now has to be avoided.
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:33.640]  But what people need to understand, I think, Alex, is there are ways to fix this situation if we really put our minds to it.
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:37.640]  We've got a monetary reform movement in this country that has been growing in strength.
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:43.640]  A lot more people have been understanding the things that can be done economically and that can be done to get away from this
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:48.640]  debt-based monetary system that we have and to make some real changes.
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:53.640]  I would suggest people take a look at the website for the American Monetary Institute.
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:27:01.640]  I've got a new report coming out. It's called Election 08 of Crime Family Food Fight or Threat to Mankind,
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:06.640]  where I go into a lot of these possible ways of approaching the situation.
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:13.640]  People can get that if they'll send us an email to economicsanityatgmail.com,
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:21.640]  and we'll give them information about that or check out my articles, particularly the monetary reform articles on global research,
[2:27:21.640 --> 2:27:29.640]  because the only way an industrial economy can work, in my opinion, is through what I call dividend-based consumption.
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:37.640]  People should study the Alaska Permanent Fund. If you do look at the Alaska Permanent Fund, don't think Sarah Palin made it up.
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:40.640]  She found it there when she became governor.
[2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:44.640]  You're talking about the comprehensive annual financial reports. That's what the bankers are doing now.
[2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:51.640]  They're robbing all that giant slush fund government investment largesse that was our money. They tricked governments into thinking this,
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:58.640]  and now they've basically stolen it. I need to have you up for an hour or sometimes just to go over that dividend plan,
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:04.640]  because there is so much wealth. We are so productive, ladies and gentlemen, that we should all be living like kings.
[2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:10.640]  The one thing they did that worked was the tax rebate stimulus payment.
[2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:17.640]  Now, it wasn't a lot of money. A lot of people had to use it to pay off their credit cards.
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:26.640]  The IRS took a lot of it because they said people owed them money, but nevertheless, that's the only thing that gave a positive number to the GDP
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:30.640]  during the second quarter of this year was that tax rebate stimulus.
[2:28:30.640 --> 2:28:37.640]  That was the thing that worked, because what you're doing with that is you're putting purchasing power in the hands of the consumer.
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:46.640]  That's the only way, building up the purchasing power of the consumer base at the grassroots level that can salvage this economy,
[2:28:46.640 --> 2:28:48.640]  not loading more debt on it.
[2:28:48.640 --> 2:28:54.640]  But that creates independent, dynamic people who aren't wars of the state, and then they might take the government over,
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:59.640]  and then we can't run our monopoly, and then we can't, again, and so that's why they won't allow that.
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:05.640]  But I actually agree with the model that you and others have come up with. I think it's a beautiful model.
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:09.640]  The problem is there's so many crooks in there, they would probably take it over or use it against people,
[2:29:09.640 --> 2:29:12.640]  but it's certainly better than what we have going on now.
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:18.640]  My big thing is we don't really owe this debt, it's a fraud, kick them out, arrest the people involved,
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:27.640]  and basically retire the debt, and then, as you said, incentivize construction, building, industry, ideas, local government,
[2:29:27.640 --> 2:29:32.640]  local industry, decentralization, and we can literally go to the stars.
[2:29:32.640 --> 2:29:35.640]  Cook, thank you so much for spending time with us. Give us your website.
[2:29:35.640 --> 2:29:44.640]  Okay, thanks, Alex. It's www.richardsseacook.com or economicsanity.chemail.com.
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:46.640]  Thanks for spending time with us, sir.
[2:29:46.640 --> 2:29:47.640]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:51.640]  You bet. Take care. We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley in about 10 minutes. Stay with us.
[2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:58.640]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:58.640 --> 2:30:08.640]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[2:30:08.640 --> 2:30:11.640]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:30:11.640 --> 2:30:16.640]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:18.640]  the Trilateral Commission, the CIFR?
[2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:20.640]  We sit down and shout.
[2:30:20.640 --> 2:30:27.640]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:30:27.640 --> 2:30:33.640]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:30:33.640 --> 2:30:37.640]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:30:40.640 --> 2:30:43.640]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:43.640 --> 2:30:46.640]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:30:46.640 --> 2:30:52.640]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[2:30:52.640 --> 2:30:58.640]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:30:58.640 --> 2:31:01.640]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:31:01.640 --> 2:31:04.640]  Do you ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:10.640]  First, I get the best parking space at work. Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:17.640]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[2:31:17.640 --> 2:31:20.640]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:23.640]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:31:23.640 --> 2:31:28.640]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop,
[2:31:28.640 --> 2:31:41.640]  travel the world, and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:06.640]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:11.640]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:16.640]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:20.640]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[2:32:20.640 --> 2:32:29.640]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[2:32:29.640 --> 2:32:35.640]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:41.640]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:32:41.640 --> 2:32:46.640]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[2:32:46.640 --> 2:32:52.640]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[2:32:52.640 --> 2:33:21.640]  That's AlkaVision.com or call 269-344-3420 today.
[2:33:21.640 --> 2:33:25.640]  We got Webster Carpley joining us in about 10 minutes.
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:30.640]  It is taking what's happening to the financial system.
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:39.640]  That's somebody who, for 30 years, has been talking about how the British banking system is going to engineer this.
[2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:45.640]  He'll want to talk about how evil Barack Obama is over and over again when they're both complete puppets and it doesn't matter.
[2:33:45.640 --> 2:33:49.640]  But that's fine and dandy. He can run on about that.
[2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:51.640]  I really like Webster.
[2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:56.640]  I just really want to have him on about the issue that he really knows what he's talking about on.
[2:33:56.640 --> 2:34:04.640]  Because he's certainly been on this economic situation for a very long time.
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:10.640]  And to say that some presidential candidate, one way or the other, is going to mean a hell of beans.
[2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:13.640]  Well, we're going to argue about it.
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:15.640]  Or maybe we won't.
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:21.640]  I think it just makes my head spin to watch this thieving going on.
[2:34:21.640 --> 2:34:23.640]  Ron Paul, many others said it.
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:29.640]  If they bail out the bankers, which isn't a bailout, we have to use the semantical term that they've now identified it as.
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:34.640]  If we bail them out, that is just them taking over anything and everything that's left.
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:39.640]  And if the average American's got 80-something thousand dollars in debt a few years ago,
[2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:46.640]  and they're talking about doubling the debt in just the next two, conservatively up to $20 trillion from $10 trillion.
[2:34:46.640 --> 2:34:48.640]  And that's their cook numbers.
[2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:57.640]  Then we're talking about $170,000 a person.
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:34:59.640]  And that's with all of the inflation going on.
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:01.640]  You're having to pay more for everything.
[2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:12.640]  I mean, the money comes into this office from DVD sales and books and videos, and then I pay people and try to give them little bonuses so they can live comfortably, and there's not a lot of money left.
[2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:19.640]  And I mean, the money pours in here, folks, with advertisers and video sales, and I just goes right back into the fight.
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:27.640]  I can't imagine in this economy how I would have survived, say, 12, 13 years ago,
[2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:32.640]  when I was living in a tiny one-room apartment and working two jobs then,
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:37.640]  so I could drive a nice car and be comfortable and eat where I wanted and take girls out on dates.
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:47.640]  I mean, now, in this economy, with what things cost, with what the jobs I had then, knowing what I was paid then,
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:53.640]  I mean, I would be, it'd be hard to even have a car working the two jobs much less.
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:55.640]  I mean, it's just, it's bad, folks.
[2:35:55.640 --> 2:36:02.640]  And I know, I don't have to tell you about that.
[2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:06.640]  I know you're feeling it.
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:10.640]  And for wealthy people, they're like, yeah, I'm having to pay a lot more, but so what?
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:17.640]  Hey, your money's in danger in your investments, your annuities, the bank, everywhere.
[2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:24.640]  And, you know, I'm not piling on the government here or the corrupt people that run it trying to make them look bad,
[2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:27.640]  trying to, you know, paint a bad picture.
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:28.640]  I don't cover one-one-hundredth.
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:30.640]  I mean, I read hundreds of articles.
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:31.640]  I print them off.
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:32.640]  I've got them in front of me on the web.
[2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:37.640]  Just every form of corruption, tyranny, evil, and I don't even want to cover it.
[2:36:37.640 --> 2:36:39.640]  I don't even want to go over it.
[2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:40.640]  I'm sick of it.
[2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:42.640]  There's no end to these people.
[2:36:42.640 --> 2:36:45.640]  They're so bankrupt intellectually, morally.
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:47.640]  They're so untrustworthy.
[2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:50.640]  They've been caught lying to us millions of times.
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:56.640]  And to know that the establishment knows the general public still isn't that tuned into reality,
[2:36:56.640 --> 2:37:02.640]  and so to see the lies they put out every day, they're so elementary.
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:04.640]  And you just want to warn people.
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:06.640]  So you call in on W-O-O-A-I.
[2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:08.640]  I did that this morning.
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:10.640]  Hi, my name's Bill.
[2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:13.640]  I'd like to come on and comment on what they're saying about the economy.
[2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:19.640]  They're saying it was the entitlement society and people lying on their forms,
[2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:21.640]  and the culture is, uh-huh.
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:23.640]  And what else do you want to say?
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:29.640]  Well, and I want to say that that's part of it,
[2:37:29.640 --> 2:37:33.640]  but the larger issue is that the brokerage houses and big banks that own them and control them
[2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:39.640]  would certify these bad debts and sell them and leverage them.
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:41.640]  Well, thanks, but we don't need that opinion right now.
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:42.640]  Thank you.
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:43.640]  I'm like, hey, man.
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:44.640]  And the person's like, ah-ha-ha.
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:48.640]  And if I try to call into other talkstations in Austin, yes, I did it.
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:53.640]  And, uh, if I say my name, they won't have me on.
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:54.640]  So I've got a...
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:57.640]  And the sick thing is I have to be deceptive.
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:01.640]  A few months ago, I heard them on the air talking about gas prices being way up,
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:06.640]  and no one knew that it was 30% of speculation, 70% was dollar devaluation.
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:08.640]  So I wanted to call in, and I called in.
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:09.640]  They wouldn't let me answer.
[2:38:09.640 --> 2:38:15.640]  I called back later and said, yeah, I want to talk about how I got a motorcycle to be able to save,
[2:38:15.640 --> 2:38:16.640]  and how I'm saving.
[2:38:16.640 --> 2:38:17.640]  And that's what they like, you know.
[2:38:17.640 --> 2:38:21.640]  And so they put me on, and then I shifted out of it and hit them and hit them hard.
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:25.640]  I mean, you've got to lie to get on these shows.
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:27.640]  They tell them, we want idiots calling in.
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:29.640]  We want stupid people.
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:31.640]  We want it to dumb down.
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:38.640]  And I have to watch all these people, the host, the idiot callers, not having any idea.
[2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:40.640]  And then we know what's going on.
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:41.640]  It's all stated open.
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:46.640]  We tell you decades before what's going to happen, years before.
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:51.640]  I mean, it's literally like walking up to somebody's house, knocking on the door and saying,
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:53.640]  don't you know your house is on fire?
[2:38:53.640 --> 2:38:55.640]  And there's smoke and flames burning them.
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:57.640]  And they go, no, it's a conspiracy.
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:39:01.640]  And they slam the door in your face and walk off and get, I mean, I just can't even.
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:07.640]  Sometimes it's almost like it's an insult to everybody that knows the truth to even argue or even tell people about this.
[2:39:07.640 --> 2:39:09.640]  You shouldn't have to be told about what's going on.
[2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:15.640]  I shouldn't have to argue with you and tell you the CIA ships in the majority of the narcotics.
[2:39:15.640 --> 2:39:18.640]  I shouldn't have to sit here and explain all this to you.
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:20.640]  I mean, it's so simple.
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:27.640]  How can it be so clear to me and so clear to all these other analysts and historians and sociologists?
[2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:31.640]  But then you talk to the public and it's like they are cowards deep down.
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:36.640]  And so they rationalize and decide to say what you're saying is not true because it's scary.
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:41.640]  Like children, like three-year-olds, they think if they deny that something will hurt them,
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:46.640]  that somehow that changes reality, you need to stop living in La La Land.
[2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:51.640]  You need to understand we're in a world of hurt, folks.
[2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:54.640]  Oh, God, the people running things have killed hundreds of millions last century.
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:39:57.640]  They are so hardcore.
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:01.640]  They are so evil.
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:06.640]  Go ahead and call Webster Tarpley.
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:08.640]  Thank you.
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:12.640]  I'll tell you about a few sponsors that make this show possible.
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:14.640]  Sponsors, I believe.
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:17.640]  One of them is a color blue, a great system that takes water out of the air.
[2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:23.640]  It does 7.5 gallons in regular humidity, even higher in humid areas like Austin, Texas,
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:26.640]  even in a high desert, very dry.
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:30.640]  It gets, let me see the actual number here.
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:32.640]  Half of that.
[2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:36.640]  Or it gets about four gallons.
[2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:39.640]  A atmospheric water generator for home.
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:42.640]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:44.640]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:49.640]  But why believe me in thousands of studies that they put it in there to chemically attack you and it does?
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:51.640]  Just ignore it. Just keep drinking it.
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:55.640]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air, medicine, I mean, machine.
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:58.640]  Produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:01.640]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:04.640]  It grabs it right out of the air, folks, and then puts it through five filters.
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:06.640]  Chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:08.640]  Neutral pH.
[2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:11.640]  How the filtering process works is important to look at.
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:17.640]  Go to their website, acoloblu, e-c-o-l-o blue, e-c-o-l-o blue dot com.
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:22.640]  They ought to just call themselves free water, or clean water, or water from air.
[2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:25.640]  Acoloblu is a nice name, but then it's just super.
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:28.640]  Totally pure water would be a good name.
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:36.640]  Acoloblu dot com, 1-866-585-4044, 1-866-585-4044.
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:41.640]  The water passes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver and pregnant carbon filter,
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:45.640]  then a reverse osmosis system, then a tasting odor removal filter,
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:49.640]  and it's stored in a tank eliminated by antibacterial fungal UV light.
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:54.640]  Also, the machine comes in the colors red, black, white, green, silver, and blue.
[2:41:54.640 --> 2:42:01.640]  They're numbered at a free brochure, 866-585-4044, 866-585-4044.
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:05.640]  Every few months, you just pull the filters out, wipe them off, stick them back in.
[2:42:05.640 --> 2:42:08.640]  It's water out of the air, so it's already really clean, but then it goes through five filters.
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:13.640]  866-585-4044, or acoloblu dot com.
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:17.640]  Also, I want you to know about new vitality, one of the longest continually operating,
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:19.640]  big mainline vitamin companies.
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:20.640]  We're proud to have them.
[2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:23.640]  High quality nutrients, vitamins, minerals.
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:26.640]  No magic claims, no miracle claims.
[2:42:26.640 --> 2:42:34.640]  Just that it's high quality, and it's stuff that's well known for, I mean, take their prostate,
[2:42:34.640 --> 2:42:36.640]  super-mated prostate pills.
[2:42:36.640 --> 2:42:39.640]  It's just a whole bunch of different herbs, well known, that even doctors subscribe
[2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:41.640]  to shrink the prostate after the age of 40, 45.
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:43.640]  Really a healthy thing to do.
[2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:49.640]  800-569-4056, 1-800-569-4056, supermated prostate.
[2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:55.640]  They have products like aloe, ease, body cleanse, totally flushes your lower and upper intestine,
[2:42:55.640 --> 2:42:58.640]  large and small intestine out.
[2:42:58.640 --> 2:43:03.640]  Just super power-packed, concentrate aloe vera with some other herbs.
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:04.640]  Really great stuff.
[2:43:04.640 --> 2:43:09.640]  800-569-4056, or link through on their banner on infowars.com.
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:16.640]  It's newvitality.com, or 1-800-569-4056.
[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:25.640]  Okay, some of the other news I have in front of me that we're going to go to Webster Tarbley.
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:29.640]  Black Monday could have been financial terrorism.
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:39.640]  CNBC host compares crash to pre-911 short-selling of airline stocks as SEC enforces ban to fight market manipulation.
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:40.640]  Isn't that funny?
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:50.640]  One of Buzzy Crongaard, the head of the brokerage firm, head of the CIA as well, executive director number two,
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:56.640]  engaged in the put options against America and United.
[2:43:56.640 --> 2:44:01.640]  One of them was six times any previous record in the week before.
[2:44:01.640 --> 2:44:04.640]  And then you had some other FBI guys doing it themselves.
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:06.640]  But Kramer never mentions that.
[2:44:06.640 --> 2:44:09.640]  It's all, oh, Al Qaeda is doing it again.
[2:44:09.640 --> 2:44:10.640]  He's sick.
[2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:15.640]  It came out in European, German, and British papers, even in a few U.S. papers.
[2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:22.640]  Reuters, AP, that they started the investigation of insider trading, and it led to the government.
[2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:23.640]  So they shut it down.
[2:44:23.640 --> 2:44:28.640]  But then they recycle it to say, Al Qaeda!
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:33.640]  I mean, if you slip and fall on a banana peel, or your wife starts cheating on you and divorces you, Al Qaeda.
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:36.640]  If you get cancer, Al Qaeda.
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:40.640]  If your candidate doesn't win, Al Qaeda.
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:46.640]  CNBC host Jim Kramer says the financial terrorism could have been behind Monday's stock market crash
[2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:49.640]  as part of a conspiracy to bring down capitalism.
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:52.640]  Listen to the crap they come up with and they call us conspiracy theorists.
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:58.640]  As the SEC this morning announced a ban on short selling in an effort to fight market manipulation.
[2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:01.640]  Boy, that's really going to do some crazy stuff.
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:06.640]  Traditional people who are already shorting or not, it could be financial terrorism.
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:08.640]  What a great way to take down America.
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:12.640]  Maybe they want to find out who is doing the shorting like in 9-11.
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:16.640]  Remember, the airlines went down first and people thought it was bin Laden.
[2:45:16.640 --> 2:45:18.640]  Kramer, you're making me sick.
[2:45:18.640 --> 2:45:19.640]  And it goes on.
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:21.640]  I've got some other news I'm going to blitz through later.
[2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:22.640]  There is a lot of it.
[2:45:22.640 --> 2:45:29.640]  But for the next hour, we are joined by Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:38.640]  And he has the new bombshell book selling quite nicely that goes into Barack Obama.
[2:45:38.640 --> 2:45:40.640]  Obama the Postmodern Coup.
[2:45:40.640 --> 2:45:43.640]  It's available at infowars.com in the shopping cart.
[2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:47.640]  I hope you go and get a copy there or from Webster's publisher.
[2:45:47.640 --> 2:45:49.640]  I've got a lot of great books.
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:53.640]  And I know Webster probably wants to tell us about how evil Barack Obama is.
[2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:54.640]  And I totally agree.
[2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:59.640]  I want to get Birg on, Phil Birg on, he's been going around exposing, he's not even really
[2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:04.640]  fully eligible to be president because his mother had him out of country and hadn't been
[2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:05.640]  a U.S. citizen long enough.
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:06.640]  You have to be here continually.
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:07.640]  What is it?
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:08.640]  18 years and she wasn't.
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:10.640]  So all that's interesting.
[2:46:10.640 --> 2:46:14.640]  But really where Webster Tarpley has been dead on is government sponsored terrorist analysis
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:15.640]  has been really great.
[2:46:15.640 --> 2:46:16.640]  Top notch.
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:21.640]  And for decades, I don't know, 30 years, Webster has been talking about the British oligarch
[2:46:21.640 --> 2:46:24.640]  thinking cartel, how they engineer implosions.
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:29.640]  The real scam is tricking the public to quote, bail them out when that's not what's happening.
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:31.640]  I mean, I want his expertise on that.
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:38.640]  And then we can get into the devilish bin Laden and his quest to defeat him and save us with
[2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:39.640]  Lord McCain.
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:41.640]  But Webster, it is good to have you here.
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:42.640]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:49.640]  Before we get into the devilish, the vicious devil, who I agree, but I want to argue with
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:50.640]  you a bit about that.
[2:46:50.640 --> 2:46:54.640]  Let's talk about where you've been a spot on, absolutely on target.
[2:46:54.640 --> 2:46:58.640]  I mean, how many decades have you been writing and speaking about the financial global crime
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:46:59.640]  syndicate?
[2:46:59.640 --> 2:47:04.240]  Well, my first book is about terrorism in 1978.
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:06.280]  Let me just preface everything.
[2:47:06.280 --> 2:47:07.840]  I have a second book.
[2:47:07.840 --> 2:47:10.440]  I'm so immobilized about Obama.
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:11.440]  I have a second book.
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:16.160]  It's called Barak H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography.
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:20.800]  And that's all about Obama personally, from soup to nuts.
[2:47:20.800 --> 2:47:23.080]  That's at amazon.com, lulu.com.
[2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:24.680]  I hope you'll get it, too.
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:26.560]  But right now it's at Amazon and Lulu.
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:28.000]  So let me just say that.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.720]  I guess we ought to talk about the financial situation.
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:32.880]  Yeah, well, let's go back to Webster Tarple.
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:35.200]  We never talk about who Webster Tarple is.
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:36.360]  Tell us all about yourself.
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:37.360]  You're quite a scholar.
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:39.240]  You're top of your class in college.
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:44.280]  I mean, let's get into your awakening, your political roots as a perspective into what's
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:45.280]  happening.
[2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:46.280]  You've been on credit where credit's due.
[2:47:46.280 --> 2:47:49.280]  You've really been on target about all this for how many decades.
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:52.160]  So tell us, spend a few minutes on Webster Tarple.
[2:47:52.160 --> 2:48:00.560]  Well, I guess the thing about me is I've lived in Europe for about 10 years.
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:06.480]  And I have pretty good familiarity with European economic history and other kinds.
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:10.920]  And really, my specialty, if you want to know what it is, is the Venetian oligarchy, in
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:11.920]  other words.
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:12.920]  But let's go back before that.
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:14.880]  Let's talk about where Webster Tarple was born.
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:15.880]  Let's talk about...
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:16.880]  Well, aren't you a Fulbright scholar?
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:18.880]  I mean, let's go through who Webster Tarple is.
[2:48:18.880 --> 2:48:20.880]  Yeah, but I don't know how interested people are in the Venetian oligarchy.
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:21.880]  But people want to know about you.
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:25.400]  Webster, now listen, I've had a lot of requests because you've been such a frequent guest over
[2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:26.400]  the last decade.
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:31.880]  We've got to get to the financial crash, though, but anyway, I'm born in Western Massachusetts.
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:38.200]  Actually, the first town in North America to drive out to British was Great Barrington,
[2:48:38.200 --> 2:48:39.200]  Massachusetts.
[2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:47.320]  And this is already in August of, what, August 1775, I guess it is, there's a British garrison
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:53.520]  of two soldiers and one judge, and they're driven out by the citizens of Great Barrington.
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:57.120]  So that's my little town there in Western Massachusetts.
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:02.520]  That was one of the pre-revolt before Lexington and Concord when they called in heavier reinforcements
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:05.720]  to then exchange ballots back and forth with musket balls.
[2:49:05.720 --> 2:49:12.960]  April, April of 1775, there's also this, again, the idea is that this is the first place where
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:15.320]  the British are driven out.
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:19.320]  Other places had various kinds of clashes earlier than this.
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:23.760]  But it really is the first place in North America that says, get the British out.
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:26.240]  So I guess I pretty much fit into that.
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:29.640]  Unfortunately, though, there's too much rebellious spirit in these places.
[2:49:29.640 --> 2:49:33.000]  They get into this Shays rebellion stuff, which is not good.
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:36.160]  I don't, wouldn't want to support that at all.
[2:49:36.160 --> 2:49:43.000]  My family actually is from upstate New York primarily, and they're associated with the
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:48.280]  inventor Joseph Henry, who is one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century.
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:52.640]  He's the person who really invented the electric motor.
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:56.760]  And what you've heard about Samuel F. B. Morse is largely nonsense.
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:49:59.600]  He didn't really invent the telegraph.
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:00.600]  Joseph Henry did.
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:04.040]  But he became a professor at Princeton, and there's a hall named after him.
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:10.680]  And he's also the, one of the few people along with Watt and Volt and Ohm and Gauss, there's
[2:50:10.680 --> 2:50:14.840]  a unit, a unit of physical measurement named after Henry, the Henry.
[2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:19.480]  So really one of the great people, along with Gauss, he's one of the two top electrical
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:20.480]  scientists.
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:26.920]  So all of my, my father, my grandfather, great, great grandfather, well they're all named
[2:50:26.920 --> 2:50:32.880]  Joseph Henry Tarpley out of the association of the family with Joseph Henry.
[2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:37.360]  And my great grandfather was in the Battle of Gettysburg.
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:45.920]  He was in the 11th U.S. regular north of Devil's Den in the 5th Corps of Sykes at the Battle
[2:50:45.920 --> 2:50:46.920]  of Gettysburg.
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:47.920]  So.
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:50.560]  All right, let's come back, talk about a little bit more about yourself, and then get into
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:52.200]  what's happening on the economic front.
[2:50:52.200 --> 2:51:02.400]  And then, the L-Z-Bama, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:06.200]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent, self-reliant news bulletin.

[2:51:19.160 --> 2:51:23.800]  prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages
[2:51:23.800 --> 2:51:25.400]  here in the U.S.
[2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:28.040]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[2:51:28.040 --> 2:51:31.160]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S. this fall?

[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:07.040]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:07.040 --> 2:52:08.540]  against this country.
[2:52:08.540 --> 2:52:12.760]  The enemies struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:13.760]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:14.760]  This is his MO.
[2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:15.760]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:17.760]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:22.520]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:25.120]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:29.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:31.760]  in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.760 --> 2:52:35.320]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:40.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:44.720]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and
[2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:45.840]  much, much more.
[2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:46.840]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:52:54.040 --> 2:53:02.040]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:06.200]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:10.200]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:11.200]  the water?
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:14.800]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[2:53:14.800 --> 2:53:16.000]  into the skin.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:20.680]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to

[2:54:53.540 --> 2:54:56.180]  lords and then let's get into what's currently happening
[2:54:56.180 --> 2:54:59.020]  well i i also i'd lived in europe uh...
[2:54:59.020 --> 2:55:03.140]  i've got a summer in italy in nineteen sixty four uh... i i uh... had a
[2:55:03.140 --> 2:55:04.660]  full bright
[2:55:04.660 --> 2:55:07.620]  sixty six to sixty seven in italy also
[2:55:07.620 --> 2:55:10.500]  also visited germany went to moscow
[2:55:10.500 --> 2:55:14.780]  places like this uh... which at that time was was not so common as it is now
[2:55:14.780 --> 2:55:19.580]  and then i gravitated into the national caucus of labor committees right the uh...
[2:55:19.580 --> 2:55:22.260]  the lyrush organization where i spent uh...
[2:55:22.260 --> 2:55:25.220]  quite a bit of time and learned a lot out of that because they were positive
[2:55:25.220 --> 2:55:27.300]  features in this although then the
[2:55:27.300 --> 2:55:32.300]  personality cult aspect of it became overwhelming but uh... i was able to
[2:55:32.300 --> 2:55:34.700]  even under those auspices to publish
[2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:38.340]  who killed all the moral which was nineteen seventy eight in italy and
[2:55:38.340 --> 2:55:39.180]  wrong
[2:55:39.180 --> 2:55:42.700]  that was a question of nato intelligence u s british
[2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:46.900]  intelligence uh... killing kidnapping and killing moral through the
[2:55:46.900 --> 2:55:49.700]  counter gang the patsy is the red brigade
[2:55:49.700 --> 2:55:53.060]  uh... as part of their geopolitical strategy
[2:55:53.060 --> 2:55:57.700]  and then uh... shortly thereafter uh... various things in the nineteen eight
[2:55:57.700 --> 2:55:58.540]  eight
[2:55:58.540 --> 2:55:59.720]  but then uh...
[2:55:59.720 --> 2:56:04.640]  nineteen ninety two the unauthorized biography of board bush
[2:56:04.640 --> 2:56:07.980]  which uh... is on the internet it's been there for twelve years that that the
[2:56:07.980 --> 2:56:12.220]  partly dot net and it's invaluable uh... you know we have a lot of credit to some
[2:56:12.220 --> 2:56:13.120]  of the reporters
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:15.460]  they went to the national archives
[2:56:15.460 --> 2:56:17.860]  uh... in my film martial law
[2:56:17.860 --> 2:56:20.980]  uh... about the whole nazi connections the bushes but but but really a lot of
[2:56:20.980 --> 2:56:22.700]  that original core research in
[2:56:22.700 --> 2:56:25.440]  digging it out of the old newspapers was done by uterplic
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:28.780]  yeah and and uh... number number people have come along they're welcome to do
[2:56:28.780 --> 2:56:31.620]  it would be nice if they acknowledged it but that's that's fine anyway that
[2:56:31.620 --> 2:56:33.080]  that press got bush
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:35.900]  uh... the the grandfather of the current tenant of the white house up to
[2:56:35.900 --> 2:56:37.180]  finance hitler
[2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:40.220]  for that that's uh... one and then uh...
[2:56:40.220 --> 2:56:43.940]  and then uh... in the mid nineties i put together a collection of essays called
[2:56:43.940 --> 2:56:45.500]  against oligarchy
[2:56:45.500 --> 2:56:47.020]  which i hope to publish it
[2:56:47.020 --> 2:56:50.780]  publishing on paper and also on the internet by the end of the year
[2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:52.100]  and uh...
[2:56:52.100 --> 2:56:53.900]  that's a that's a series of that
[2:56:53.900 --> 2:56:55.580]  it is about the british
[2:56:55.580 --> 2:56:57.580]  uh... and the venetians
[2:56:57.580 --> 2:57:01.300]  so uh... some of that scattered over the internet right now you can look it up
[2:57:01.300 --> 2:57:02.500]  and then uh...
[2:57:02.500 --> 2:57:04.300]  eventually uh...
[2:57:04.300 --> 2:57:08.220]  but then uh... after nine eleven nine eleven synthetic terror

[2:57:55.540 --> 2:57:59.860]  well he's a poverty pimp in other words what he does is he takes a bunch of poor
[2:57:59.860 --> 2:58:05.180]  suffering people he do some and make them into a saleable political commodity
[2:58:05.180 --> 2:58:07.860]  by using them for a purpose which is not grown
[2:58:07.860 --> 2:58:11.180]  sometimes that's right he bundles them and then represents them
[2:58:11.180 --> 2:58:12.180]  as their pimp
[2:58:12.180 --> 2:58:12.620]  yet
[2:58:12.620 --> 2:58:17.700]  is a poverty pimp or partition party poverty crack a limited number one
[2:58:17.700 --> 2:58:20.540]  it's divided and conquer and that's what he would bring to the white house i
[2:58:20.540 --> 2:58:22.020]  think we're gonna get into that
[2:58:22.020 --> 2:58:24.940]  but first i want to get into your analysis of the current
[2:58:24.940 --> 2:58:26.740]  economic uh...
[2:58:26.740 --> 2:58:29.820]  feast they're having on this and where you see this going
[2:58:29.820 --> 2:58:32.580]  and we'll talk about the devilish uh...
[2:58:32.580 --> 2:58:34.100]  we're not go bomba
[2:58:34.100 --> 2:58:37.540]  and the wonderful savior john mccain i'm being sarcastic

[2:58:54.620 --> 2:58:58.980]  national sovereignty worldwide but in liberties darkest hour there is hope
[2:58:58.980 --> 2:59:02.140]  the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up it is
[2:59:02.140 --> 2:59:05.380]  essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's
[2:59:05.380 --> 2:59:08.900]  understanding of the new world order master plan we have a short time frame

[3:00:52.700 --> 3:00:57.700]  several great books and uh... we carry two of them nine eleven synthetic terror

[3:01:04.700 --> 3:01:07.380]  okay what's your let's get going here you've really
[3:01:07.380 --> 3:01:09.220]  been for decades covering
[3:01:09.220 --> 3:01:11.940]  uh... the banking system the predatory system how they design these
[3:01:11.940 --> 3:01:14.260]  implosions to consolidate wealth
[3:01:14.260 --> 3:01:18.140]  uh... we know a lot of documents show that they were designing this some say
[3:01:18.140 --> 3:01:20.660]  it's gotten out of their control through their greed
[3:01:20.660 --> 3:01:23.260]  break it down what are we dealing with it right now
[3:01:23.260 --> 3:01:26.180]  well i think it is a it's a crisis that's out of control because you're
[3:01:26.180 --> 3:01:28.020]  dealing with the polycentric
[3:01:28.020 --> 3:01:33.060]  oligarchy with no no effective center that would be able to dictate uh...
[3:01:33.060 --> 3:01:36.180]  the course of future events that right now they're scrambling to catch up
[3:01:36.180 --> 3:01:38.820]  generally speaking i would urge people first of all
[3:01:38.820 --> 3:01:42.500]  stop the bailout in other words uh... this is now a commitment of several
[3:01:42.500 --> 3:01:43.940]  trillion dollars
[3:01:43.940 --> 3:01:47.700]  to bail out the most cancerous the most predatory
[3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:50.980]  massive fictitious capital that the world has ever seen
[3:01:50.980 --> 3:01:55.620]  it is the derivative this is this is not a crisis of home mortgages or any of
[3:01:55.620 --> 3:01:59.420]  this fairy tale that they tell them but the reason for this is not that
[3:01:59.420 --> 3:02:00.820]  some poor person
[3:02:00.820 --> 3:02:04.260]  you know got a mortgage it was too big and then default that that's ridiculous
[3:02:04.260 --> 3:02:08.580]  it is between one and two quadrillion according to my best estimate yes of
[3:02:08.580 --> 3:02:12.180]  derivatives that's what's in crisis and the only way to get out of it
[3:02:12.180 --> 3:02:15.940]  is to wipe that out and that's going to have to be done by government action
[3:02:15.940 --> 3:02:17.100]  webster
[3:02:17.100 --> 3:02:20.940]  let's be clear direction let's be clear i totally agree with what you just said
[3:02:20.940 --> 3:02:24.500]  let's be clear and ron paul said the same thing cannot bail them out
[3:02:24.500 --> 3:02:26.940]  because it sets the precedent
[3:02:26.940 --> 3:02:29.620]  and paul's already told congress sit down and shut up
[3:02:29.620 --> 3:02:32.180]  the you know this is a dictatorship that was in bloomberg of the
[3:02:32.180 --> 3:02:34.900]  international bankers ron paul came out yesterday
[3:02:34.900 --> 3:02:37.500]  on the floor of the house and in the televised speech
[3:02:37.500 --> 3:02:41.180]  saying this is a secret banking government literally taking over
[3:02:41.180 --> 3:02:44.140]  this sets the precedent to bail out
[3:02:44.140 --> 3:02:47.300]  hundreds and even thousands of trillions that they have leverage so
[3:02:47.300 --> 3:02:48.580]  please continue
[3:02:48.580 --> 3:02:51.660]  alec let me also say though that i i i i wouldn't agree with the way that he
[3:02:51.660 --> 3:02:55.620]  puts it i think you basically have three possibilities right now
[3:02:55.620 --> 3:03:00.660]  the first is an immediate deflationary crash in other words if you say
[3:03:00.660 --> 3:03:02.020]  do nothing
[3:03:02.020 --> 3:03:05.100]  or invoke the free market or anything like that
[3:03:05.100 --> 3:03:08.380]  you're going to get chain reaction bankruptcies you're gonna have all of
[3:03:08.380 --> 3:03:09.220]  these
[3:03:09.220 --> 3:03:12.500]  banks go jp morgan goes city bank goes
[3:03:12.500 --> 3:03:16.100]  goldman tax goes good morgan family that's fine
[3:03:16.100 --> 3:03:19.500]  but then within about three weeks there's no food in the stores you get a
[3:03:19.500 --> 3:03:23.660]  good economic breakdown crisis but then the scientific dictatorship fails i
[3:03:23.660 --> 3:03:24.980]  say good
[3:03:24.980 --> 3:03:27.980]  i think that's that's not good you don't want to have no no no you're right
[3:03:27.980 --> 3:03:31.420]  it could bring in correct it could bring in a road water scenario and even worse
[3:03:31.420 --> 3:03:35.820]  system it could bring in death on a mass scale because you won't have food and
[3:03:35.820 --> 3:03:39.740]  electricity you can't move commodities without a banking system
[3:03:39.740 --> 3:03:41.940]  they've got to be credit you can't load up
[3:03:41.940 --> 3:03:45.980]  uh... uh... a semi trailer without some kind of a bill of lading which is a
[3:03:45.980 --> 3:03:48.220]  which is a bit of a bill of exchange so
[3:03:48.220 --> 3:03:49.860]  you've got to have a credit system
[3:03:49.860 --> 3:03:53.580]  that the idea of the immediate crash is andrew melan
[3:03:53.580 --> 3:03:57.220]  uh... back in the nineteen thirty two thirty three andrew melan said
[3:03:57.220 --> 3:04:01.460]  liquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate real estate liquidate bond
[3:04:01.460 --> 3:04:03.460]  liquidate everything it's also called
[3:04:03.460 --> 3:04:07.420]  creative destruction with shampoos there you don't want this you want to avoid it
[3:04:07.420 --> 3:04:08.780]  but the question is how
[3:04:08.780 --> 3:04:13.340]  and if i can just go on with that i will we will on the other side
[3:04:13.340 --> 3:04:16.820]  uh... but at ron paul simply stating that
[3:04:16.820 --> 3:04:19.140]  this is a controlled implosion
[3:04:19.140 --> 3:04:22.540]  and that is predatory in nature and we shouldn't bail them out
[3:04:22.540 --> 3:04:24.940]  and uh... his plan is a little more
[3:04:24.940 --> 3:04:29.620]  detailed and what you're saying what's
[3:04:29.620 --> 3:04:33.820]  the day unlike any other in the long course of american history of terrorist
[3:04:33.820 --> 3:04:36.460]  act of war against this country
[3:04:36.460 --> 3:04:39.100]  the enemy struck america on september eleventh
[3:04:39.100 --> 3:04:40.660]  but who is the enemy
[3:04:40.660 --> 3:04:41.460]  in laudan
[3:04:41.460 --> 3:04:42.500]  this is his m-o
[3:04:42.500 --> 3:04:45.820]  we have to look to the middle east we have to look to the sum of the law

[3:07:40.980 --> 3:07:44.340]  Webster I really want to give you the floor because you are an expert on
[3:07:44.340 --> 3:07:48.100]  banking and these international oligarchies and I'd like to go back to
[3:07:48.100 --> 3:07:51.380]  their roots after you cover what's happening currently and looking forward
[3:07:51.380 --> 3:07:55.500]  I want to hear what's happening currently then looking forward what you
[3:07:55.500 --> 3:07:59.220]  think they're going to do versus what we should do kind of encapsulating these
[3:07:59.220 --> 3:08:04.700]  if you can and then I want to briefly a snapshot back to the black nobility to
[3:08:04.700 --> 3:08:09.660]  the Venetians and then let's look over at those that duplicated that with the
[3:08:09.660 --> 3:08:15.860]  British oligarchs because again you are a historian on those are subjects okay
[3:08:15.860 --> 3:08:19.460]  just let me try to put the analysis of the current situation on the table it's
[3:08:19.460 --> 3:08:23.900]  basically three three points you don't want to have a deflationary crash now
[3:08:23.900 --> 3:08:27.860]  because that means within a month or two months there's no food in the
[3:08:27.860 --> 3:08:31.980]  supermarkets the social dislocations are tremendous you don't want to have a
[3:08:31.980 --> 3:08:36.460]  crash now the second point is what you're getting right now is a hyper
[3:08:36.460 --> 3:08:42.300]  inflationary bailout this is also bad it about a little bit of time it buys
[3:08:42.300 --> 3:08:47.020]  several months but the current policy leads up to the following the current
[3:08:47.020 --> 3:08:51.700]  policy leads to dollar hyperinflation it leads to the death agony of the dollar
[3:08:51.700 --> 3:08:55.860]  being accelerated and it takes the treasury bonds and it drives them into
[3:08:55.860 --> 3:09:00.340]  junk status it means the dollar is worthless ultimately at the end of the
[3:09:00.340 --> 3:09:05.140]  hyperinflationary bailout period you're back in a crash and you're worse off than
[3:09:05.140 --> 3:09:09.780]  you would be if you had the deflationary crash immediately so but both of these
[3:09:09.780 --> 3:09:14.900]  are totally unacceptable this is Hobson's choice if you say no to the bailout
[3:09:14.900 --> 3:09:18.820]  and you don't add anything then you're gonna get the crash and that you don't
[3:09:18.820 --> 3:09:22.900]  want to have the third possibility is the New Deal tradition and the New Deal
[3:09:22.900 --> 3:09:26.700]  tradition would look something like this you want to stop foreclosures great
[3:09:26.700 --> 3:09:32.100]  have a federal law that says no foreclosures for five years or for the
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:37.020]  duration of the crisis that means homes farms businesses anything to do with
[3:09:37.020 --> 3:09:41.460]  infrastructure an airline a railroad a taxi company a trucking company anything
[3:09:41.460 --> 3:09:46.980]  that produces useful products or provide the useful service but now you've got
[3:09:46.980 --> 3:09:51.100]  anything in the real economy anything that involves tangible physical wealth
[3:09:51.100 --> 3:09:56.100]  commodity production moving commodities transporting them changes in the physical
[3:09:56.100 --> 3:09:59.740]  universe is what you've got to let me let me just interrupt i don't know let me
[3:09:59.740 --> 3:10:03.060]  let me finish out because that is it will never get finished with this you've
[3:10:03.060 --> 3:10:06.820]  got to you gotta stop foreclosures you've got to wipe out derivatives you got
[3:10:06.820 --> 3:10:10.860]  one to two quadrillion dollars worth of derivatives these are a dubious illegal
[3:10:10.860 --> 3:10:16.380]  of legality they were made legal by Greenspan the ain Rand freak back in the
[3:10:16.380 --> 3:10:21.460]  1990s with the help of clinton and ruben and the same people so it's a two-party
[3:10:21.460 --> 3:10:27.260]  production derivatives have no value but continuous funding of derivatives which
[3:10:27.260 --> 3:10:31.100]  is what's being done now is incompatible with the future of human
[3:10:31.100 --> 3:10:37.460]  civilization you need a 1% toben tax on all speculation on all transfer
[3:10:37.460 --> 3:10:39.700]  security global authority to pay for it of course
[3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:43.700]  uh... no no no you want that go right into the u.s. treasury you want to stop
[3:10:43.700 --> 3:10:47.660]  oil speculation you need all kinds of vigorous measures to stop oil
[3:10:47.660 --> 3:10:51.900]  speculation in the middle of all the stuff we want to have the social safety
[3:10:51.900 --> 3:10:56.460]  net such as it is guaranteed social security medicare medicaid head start
[3:10:56.460 --> 3:11:01.500]  food stamps unemployment benefits all payments to people have to be maintained
[3:11:01.500 --> 3:11:06.940]  these characters like fold Franklin Reigns jim johnson the people who ran
[3:11:06.940 --> 3:11:10.740]  fanny may into the ground they've got to be made to this gorge that doesn't get
[3:11:10.740 --> 3:11:15.100]  you much money but at least it puts the fear of god into these people generally
[3:11:15.100 --> 3:11:20.140]  speaking what you've got now is preferential treatment for cancerous
[3:11:20.140 --> 3:11:24.580]  fictitious paper there's now a list of seven hundred ninety nine financial
[3:11:24.580 --> 3:11:29.020]  corporations that you cannot short but you can destroy general voters destroy
[3:11:29.020 --> 3:11:34.060]  forward destroy chrysler destroy food companies so it's a double standard and
[3:11:34.060 --> 3:11:38.460]  we need to reverse this this should be the opposite way around we should say the
[3:11:38.460 --> 3:11:43.380]  way we want to have economic recovery is to guarantee useful physical production
[3:11:43.380 --> 3:11:45.860]  let these banks go down
[3:11:45.860 --> 3:11:49.500]  if you're gonna let them go down you've got to have a credit facility to take
[3:11:49.500 --> 3:11:53.420]  their place because without credit everything grinds to a halt the
[3:11:53.420 --> 3:11:57.500]  economic heart of the united sir saying just like with the economic development
[3:11:57.500 --> 3:12:02.100]  corporation during the rate depression only give cheap credit or or you'll
[3:12:02.100 --> 3:12:05.580]  back backed by the government said about the private bankers to get the power
[3:12:05.580 --> 3:12:08.860]  to the people into things that actually build physical infrastructure but let
[3:12:08.860 --> 3:12:11.980]  me just stop you because yeah because i'm gonna forget i'm trying to write notes
[3:12:11.980 --> 3:12:15.420]  here fast and there's each little point i want to go over here with you what we
[3:12:15.420 --> 3:12:18.300]  need to will have you on for two hours next week to really walk through your
[3:12:18.300 --> 3:12:22.820]  ideas because i had richard c cook on earlier who wants to go with one of you
[3:12:22.820 --> 3:12:25.660]  know a plan more like you're talking about
[3:12:25.660 --> 3:12:30.260]  uh... okay i just want to turn this into a ron paul bashing fast only brought
[3:12:30.260 --> 3:12:31.420]  ron paul up
[3:12:31.420 --> 3:12:34.700]  uh... earlier to mention that he was talking about the secret banking
[3:12:34.700 --> 3:12:37.180]  government is fully publicly taken over
[3:12:37.180 --> 3:12:39.140]  so i wanted your comment on that
[3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:40.620]  uh... now
[3:12:40.620 --> 3:12:42.420]  going back here
[3:12:42.420 --> 3:12:47.460]  that's my point we will have a crash now
[3:12:47.460 --> 3:12:51.300]  but the faith and credit of the people won't be completely committed into a
[3:12:51.300 --> 3:12:55.060]  fraud a thousand times deeper than having the crash later and that's what
[3:12:55.060 --> 3:12:56.820]  they're going to do they're gonna have the crash
[3:12:56.820 --> 3:12:59.220]  the in six months a year maybe even sooner
[3:12:59.220 --> 3:13:02.940]  and say well you're fully committed to this you signed on to it you wanted this
[3:13:02.940 --> 3:13:03.700]  you
[3:13:03.700 --> 3:13:06.820]  you're making it up and saying we you know we wanted the two by four up against
[3:13:06.820 --> 3:13:07.780]  the head
[3:13:07.780 --> 3:13:11.300]  uh... and so you i'm saying with the leadership is up there they're not going
[3:13:11.300 --> 3:13:12.300]  to go
[3:13:12.300 --> 3:13:15.900]  with this other model i'm saying the bankers got us into this now they're
[3:13:15.900 --> 3:13:18.380]  telling us on the news that it was all us taking
[3:13:18.380 --> 3:13:20.540]  you know loans on our houses so that's the
[3:13:20.540 --> 3:13:22.140]  false reality
[3:13:22.140 --> 3:13:24.540]  uh... that has been put out there so i'm saying
[3:13:24.540 --> 3:13:27.940]  how well i mean i mean i'm not just putting out ideas
[3:13:27.940 --> 3:13:29.900]  how would we implement
[3:13:29.900 --> 3:13:31.500]  uh... a uh...
[3:13:31.500 --> 3:13:32.580]  type plan
[3:13:32.580 --> 3:13:34.540]  that you are talking about
[3:13:34.540 --> 3:13:36.660]  well if you had a president for example
[3:13:36.660 --> 3:13:41.140]  you could say uh... i as president of the united states and declaring
[3:13:41.140 --> 3:13:45.380]  the international swaps and derivatives association as an enemy alien
[3:13:45.380 --> 3:13:48.500]  under the trading with the enemy act in the defense production act
[3:13:48.500 --> 3:13:51.940]  i declare international swaps and derivatives association and all of
[3:13:51.940 --> 3:13:54.100]  their quadrillions
[3:13:54.100 --> 3:13:58.540]  cancerous derivatives paper to be null and void i'm vesting them i'm
[3:13:58.540 --> 3:14:00.700]  using them i'm confiscating them
[3:14:00.700 --> 3:14:03.820]  i'm wiping them out and i'm sending the third armored division
[3:14:03.820 --> 3:14:06.980]  to the chicago pit to make sure that all trading
[3:14:06.980 --> 3:14:10.140]  in derivatives are stopped but it's funny they're actually sending the third
[3:14:10.140 --> 3:14:11.420]  armored division
[3:14:11.420 --> 3:14:13.900]  to suppress the index you're sending a third
[3:14:13.900 --> 3:14:16.860]  uh... they're sending that to suppress the american people did you see that the
[3:14:16.860 --> 3:14:20.660]  army times yeah this is again what we've got is the world turned upside down
[3:14:20.660 --> 3:14:22.140]  we've got a policy
[3:14:22.140 --> 3:14:25.740]  that defend cancerous paper the seven hundred ninety nine
[3:14:25.740 --> 3:14:30.300]  financial companies goldman fact and jp but says but says fair game meaning all
[3:14:30.300 --> 3:14:33.780]  the shorter is going to move into the real economy this is a war against the
[3:14:33.780 --> 3:14:37.620]  real economy this is so we've got that that the entire value system has been
[3:14:37.620 --> 3:14:41.340]  stood on its head in other words we're defending cancerous paper and we're
[3:14:41.340 --> 3:14:42.940]  willing to take down
[3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:46.860]  uh... useful physical production you gotta reverse that now first of all in
[3:14:46.860 --> 3:14:50.940]  terms of this bailout any reason to be against the bailout is fine keep keep
[3:14:50.940 --> 3:14:52.900]  this open as long as you can't
[3:14:52.900 --> 3:14:56.700]  but if you only stop the bailout you will then get
[3:14:56.700 --> 3:15:00.300]  the chain reaction collapse of the banking system and at that point
[3:15:00.300 --> 3:15:03.220]  everything he says to move because you can't
[3:15:03.220 --> 3:15:06.820]  you can't think about it is no i agree it's got to be it's got to be truly
[3:15:06.820 --> 3:15:10.300]  nationalized not privatize claiming it's nationalized
[3:15:10.300 --> 3:15:11.560]  and they've got to
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:15.380]  uh... basically kick the fellow reserve out and come in with u s back money and
[3:15:15.380 --> 3:15:18.700]  issue credit to everybody and that would truly fix it
[3:15:18.700 --> 3:15:20.500]  yeah i would say that the thing you want to do is
[3:15:20.500 --> 3:15:23.940]  he's the federal reserve and ordered them they've never been ordered arrest them
[3:15:23.940 --> 3:15:27.180]  only that's the point that's the point is they're saying that's a great point
[3:15:27.180 --> 3:15:28.820]  you made fair game attack
[3:15:28.820 --> 3:15:31.620]  you know it's not just blocking seven hundred something of these of these
[3:15:31.620 --> 3:15:32.900]  crime operations
[3:15:32.900 --> 3:15:35.740]  they're now turning all those people all those shortest
[3:15:35.740 --> 3:15:37.700]  loose on the real economy
[3:15:37.700 --> 3:15:41.260]  uh... you so they've gone from half as much game you know you know down to half
[3:15:41.260 --> 3:15:43.040]  so that's gonna intensify the attack
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:47.340]  on on the real economy there they're predatorily rendering what's left of
[3:15:47.340 --> 3:15:48.540]  our beleaguered
[3:15:48.540 --> 3:15:52.620]  uh... uh... industry and and real economy over to them
[3:15:52.620 --> 3:15:55.060]  and and and announcing every hour on the news
[3:15:55.060 --> 3:15:58.340]  bankers did nothing brokerage firms did nothing it was all an accident
[3:15:58.340 --> 3:16:03.060]  it's the american people's fault uh... i mean this is the big heist is it not
[3:16:03.060 --> 3:16:06.140]  and you're right it is the world upside down
[3:16:06.140 --> 3:16:09.900]  look look at general electric general electric is saying we want to be listed
[3:16:09.900 --> 3:16:11.780]  as a financial corporation
[3:16:11.780 --> 3:16:15.740]  because we're really g e capital we're really a hedge fund and drag
[3:16:15.740 --> 3:16:19.500]  the list of the speculative outfit you know we we do make some
[3:16:19.500 --> 3:16:23.300]  electrical generators and stuff like this but who cares about that forget
[3:16:23.300 --> 3:16:26.900]  forget general electric making uh... you know appliances or anything
[3:16:26.900 --> 3:16:28.960]  we want to be listed as a hedge fund
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:30.300]  so then we're protected
[3:16:30.300 --> 3:16:31.460]  now notice also
[3:16:31.460 --> 3:16:34.060]  it only goes for ten days it goes from
[3:16:34.060 --> 3:16:37.540]  uh... next monday that the the rally you see on wall street is a short
[3:16:37.540 --> 3:16:38.540]  covering rally
[3:16:38.540 --> 3:16:42.660]  it's the biggest short covering rally in history it's a limited butcher it says
[3:16:42.660 --> 3:16:47.740]  just attack the economy looted bloody savage it for ten days it's open season
[3:16:47.740 --> 3:16:49.060]  on the american people
[3:16:49.060 --> 3:16:52.700]  right in the in the defense of these people noticed that paulson springs
[3:16:52.700 --> 3:16:56.180]  into activity at the moment when goldman fax is about to blow
[3:16:56.180 --> 3:16:57.940]  could that's where he's got all of his
[3:16:57.940 --> 3:16:59.980]  all of the stock options so
[3:16:59.980 --> 3:17:03.420]  this is this again it's in reverse the main thing you've got to do
[3:17:03.420 --> 3:17:04.380]  destroy
[3:17:04.380 --> 3:17:08.020]  derivatives if there's one guiding principle for the entire thing
[3:17:08.020 --> 3:17:11.580]  wipe out derivatives derivatives are illegal
[3:17:11.580 --> 3:17:12.940]  green span
[3:17:12.940 --> 3:17:16.300]  certified them as legal back in the mid nineteen ninety let's explain the
[3:17:16.300 --> 3:17:18.740]  riveted or just made up crap
[3:17:18.740 --> 3:17:22.820]  that are just that that the bankers is certified and then leverage and they by
[3:17:22.820 --> 3:17:27.460]  real assets where these are futures options indices their structured notes
[3:17:27.460 --> 3:17:28.880]  their swaps
[3:17:28.880 --> 3:17:32.060]  uh... credit swaps collateralized that obligations
[3:17:32.060 --> 3:17:35.380]  all mortgage-backed securities are derivatives by definition to their
[3:17:35.380 --> 3:17:37.020]  paper based on paper
[3:17:37.020 --> 3:17:40.940]  the derivatives represent something that are off balance sheet for banks and
[3:17:40.940 --> 3:17:44.020]  they're out of the real world of commodities except that they
[3:17:44.020 --> 3:17:45.460]  they parasitize it
[3:17:45.460 --> 3:17:47.100]  so the main thing you want to do is
[3:17:47.100 --> 3:17:51.060]  wipe out derivatives you'd be lifting one to two quadrillion off the world
[3:17:51.060 --> 3:17:51.860]  economy
[3:17:51.860 --> 3:17:54.620]  then you could have a recovery provided that you had
[3:17:54.620 --> 3:17:57.700]  a credit issue what you want to do is see the federal reserve and say guess
[3:17:57.700 --> 3:17:58.580]  what boys
[3:17:58.580 --> 3:18:01.140]  you're going to issue one half percent credit or
[3:18:01.140 --> 3:18:02.820]  uh... one percent credit
[3:18:02.820 --> 3:18:06.940]  but only for productive purposes for thirty forty year maturity for the
[3:18:06.940 --> 3:18:11.180]  reason we have to the reason we have to stop the bailout any cost because you
[3:18:11.180 --> 3:18:13.260]  admit not really that it's even worse
[3:18:13.260 --> 3:18:16.540]  to let them will continue the bailout and then crash it later
[3:18:16.540 --> 3:18:19.580]  because this completes the circuit talking about electricity
[3:18:19.580 --> 3:18:23.660]  i mean by you know you had derivatives hanging out here in this criminal fraud
[3:18:23.660 --> 3:18:26.900]  but now the federal government through the treasury and other private
[3:18:26.900 --> 3:18:29.260]  federal reserve are connecting the circuit
[3:18:29.260 --> 3:18:31.060]  to the american people in saying
[3:18:31.060 --> 3:18:34.020]  you now are going to back this up with your credit name
[3:18:34.020 --> 3:18:37.780]  and so we can't allow that to be completed but they are doing it
[3:18:37.780 --> 3:18:40.020]  again you it's time to mobilize politically
[3:18:40.020 --> 3:18:41.500]  first of all block it
[3:18:41.500 --> 3:18:44.580]  and then you might have time for debate you know what kind of policies i would
[3:18:44.580 --> 3:18:46.860]  say the following i think this is important
[3:18:46.860 --> 3:18:47.740]  uh...
[3:18:47.740 --> 3:18:51.340]  the notion of deregulation and privatization are at the root of this
[3:18:51.340 --> 3:18:55.140]  crisis up until nineteen seventy one we had the brettan wood system
[3:18:55.140 --> 3:18:58.540]  where government said here's what the currencies are going to be worth
[3:18:58.540 --> 3:19:02.020]  milton freedman in the chicago school came along and tell no no no
[3:19:02.020 --> 3:19:04.500]  we want the free market we want the free market
[3:19:04.500 --> 3:19:07.820]  this led to the destruction of brettan wood on august fifteenth nineteen
[3:19:07.820 --> 3:19:08.700]  seventy one
[3:19:08.700 --> 3:19:11.340]  by nixon kissinger arthur burns
[3:19:11.340 --> 3:19:12.260]  and show
[3:19:12.260 --> 3:19:16.940]  the next step then is making derivatives legal stay there their green span
[3:19:16.940 --> 3:19:19.820]  got a break in fact uh... webster we're just gonna skip the break
[3:19:19.820 --> 3:19:23.380]  but only for info wars dot com week we can't strip the break why
[3:19:23.380 --> 3:19:26.100]  or in the middle of something i will be back everybody will have to talk to
[3:19:26.100 --> 3:19:30.220]  stay with us
[3:19:30.220 --> 3:19:33.580]  dead enters from my de september nineteen two thousand eight gold eight
[3:19:33.580 --> 3:19:36.940]  sixty three seventy ounce gold coins could be purchased for eighty nine
[3:19:36.940 --> 3:19:40.620]  thirteen four forty four fifty seven for half to twenty two twenty eight per
[3:19:40.620 --> 3:19:44.580]  quarter that's eighty nine thirteen four forty four fifty seven and two twenty

[3:23:53.780 --> 3:23:58.580]  prism planet dot tv viewers okay webster again i was throwing my points
[3:23:58.580 --> 3:24:01.140]  things i want to understand what you were saying and add some
[3:24:01.140 --> 3:24:04.580]  caveats to it but but go back and state that because i totally
[3:24:04.580 --> 3:24:07.940]  agree with you about what they're doing and what needs to be done and the way
[3:24:07.940 --> 3:24:10.580]  you brought it into focus was just amazing
[3:24:10.580 --> 3:24:14.820]  uh... that uh... people think all they're stopping the shorts no only on their own
[3:24:14.820 --> 3:24:19.700]  industry these guys are complete pirates acting as if they know the ship's going
[3:24:19.700 --> 3:24:22.980]  down and they're just pulling out you know you
[3:24:22.980 --> 3:24:26.740]  just every bobble and chandelier out of the mansion
[3:24:26.740 --> 3:24:31.300]  it's it's the triumph of monitorism saying that you can you can destroy
[3:24:31.300 --> 3:24:35.300]  industrial corporations that produce transportation
[3:24:35.300 --> 3:24:36.180]  uh...
[3:24:36.180 --> 3:24:40.220]  in you know capital goods machine tools food
[3:24:40.220 --> 3:24:42.380]  pharmaceutical everything we all
[3:24:42.380 --> 3:24:45.860]  is open season all of them can be destroyed kill people and break things
[3:24:45.860 --> 3:24:47.940]  it's military operations
[3:24:47.940 --> 3:24:52.500]  the seven hundred ninety nine parasitical bank hedge funds and remember this
[3:24:52.500 --> 3:24:55.100]  according to some counts uh...
[3:24:55.100 --> 3:24:59.700]  financial services represent one third of the u.s. economy which is monstrous
[3:24:59.700 --> 3:25:03.340]  it's impossible you can't have this
[3:25:03.340 --> 3:25:07.740]  you've got nothing left to eat to where to live in to drive to fly in
[3:25:07.740 --> 3:25:11.340]  the sale into uses tool because there's all the debt they generate
[3:25:11.340 --> 3:25:14.860]  yeah so they they basically institutionalized that again it's only
[3:25:14.860 --> 3:25:16.140]  for ten days
[3:25:16.140 --> 3:25:18.100]  uh... i would stress again though
[3:25:18.100 --> 3:25:20.320]  this is the fruit of deregulation
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:23.020]  this is the fruit of the end of the brettan wood system
[3:25:23.020 --> 3:25:27.700]  it's the it's the fruit of uh... of lifting the bands on derivatives
[3:25:27.700 --> 3:25:30.260]  that were in place in many many uh...
[3:25:30.260 --> 3:25:31.900]  areas of the economy
[3:25:31.900 --> 3:25:35.300]  up until the mid-nineties up until green span and the clinton administration
[3:25:35.300 --> 3:25:36.260]  ruben
[3:25:36.260 --> 3:25:37.660]  in particular did this
[3:25:37.660 --> 3:25:40.740]  you also got some things left over from the new deal like the glass
[3:25:40.740 --> 3:25:43.580]  legal act the glass legal act was enforced
[3:25:43.580 --> 3:25:47.220]  until november nineteen ninety-nine it said you want to have a bank great
[3:25:47.220 --> 3:25:48.300]  you want to have a
[3:25:48.300 --> 3:25:49.980]  stockbroker
[3:25:49.980 --> 3:25:53.260]  stock-jobbing out to keep them separate break they've got to be separate that
[3:25:53.260 --> 3:25:55.740]  gotta be a complete firewall between them separate
[3:25:55.740 --> 3:25:58.980]  corporations now you look at jp morgan chase city bank
[3:25:58.980 --> 3:26:00.620]  bank of america wakoma
[3:26:00.620 --> 3:26:02.860]  there are these hybrid monsters
[3:26:02.860 --> 3:26:07.420]  that are mainly especially jp morgan chase into derivatives jp morgan is
[3:26:07.420 --> 3:26:08.180]  about
[3:26:08.180 --> 3:26:11.620]  one-third of the derivatives in the world it's something like five hundred
[3:26:11.620 --> 3:26:12.500]  trillion
[3:26:12.500 --> 3:26:14.540]  six hundred trillion of derivatives
[3:26:14.540 --> 3:26:17.420]  and then you've got this interesting uptick rule that they're all screaming
[3:26:17.420 --> 3:26:18.180]  about
[3:26:18.180 --> 3:26:21.820]  cocks at the uh... securities and exchange commission he surely is an
[3:26:21.820 --> 3:26:23.900]  incompetent and should be fired
[3:26:23.900 --> 3:26:27.060]  there's one point where mccain had something to say anyway
[3:26:27.060 --> 3:26:28.460]  cock should be fired
[3:26:28.460 --> 3:26:31.660]  because what he needs to do is to re-institute the uptick rule that was
[3:26:31.660 --> 3:26:33.220]  if you want a shorter stock
[3:26:33.220 --> 3:26:37.100]  you can't do it when it's only going down you gotta wait till it starts to go up
[3:26:37.100 --> 3:26:38.100]  and then you can
[3:26:38.100 --> 3:26:42.220]  shorted uh... that would be more effective on the whole than this uh...
[3:26:42.220 --> 3:26:46.740]  ten-day ban on all short selling the most effective ban on short selling is
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:48.940]  the totem tax on one percent
[3:26:48.940 --> 3:26:52.260]  security transfer tax to take the wind out of the sales
[3:26:52.260 --> 3:26:54.180]  of speculators of all kinds
[3:26:54.180 --> 3:26:55.300]  you simply say
[3:26:55.300 --> 3:26:57.660]  anything that crosses an exchange
[3:26:57.660 --> 3:27:01.180]  one percent tax it's like sales tax we pay sales tax
[3:27:01.180 --> 3:27:05.100]  depending on the state you pay five six seven eight explain that they are in
[3:27:05.100 --> 3:27:09.860]  they are naked shorting with no money they go in and manipulate things putting
[3:27:09.860 --> 3:27:13.540]  nothing in it's totally criminal yeah and of course they now means uh...
[3:27:13.540 --> 3:27:18.020]  goldman fax put out a bulletin saying it's time to short city bank
[3:27:18.020 --> 3:27:23.300]  that's all the goldman fax a you know bankrupt investment bank
[3:27:23.300 --> 3:27:26.340]  survive ourselves by dragging down city bank
[3:27:26.340 --> 3:27:29.220]  which up until recently was the biggest commercial
[3:27:29.220 --> 3:27:32.340]  bank in the u.s. obviously all of these institutions
[3:27:32.340 --> 3:27:35.500]  are no longer what they were so they're even cannibalizing each other
[3:27:35.500 --> 3:27:39.100]  yeah this is practice i didn't and cannibalization among
[3:27:39.100 --> 3:27:40.820]  the finance oligarchs now
[3:27:40.820 --> 3:27:44.860]  i would say the the hyperinflationary bailout that is now proposed
[3:27:44.860 --> 3:27:46.460]  you can see that paulson
[3:27:46.460 --> 3:27:49.140]  wants to ram that through within about a week
[3:27:49.140 --> 3:27:51.340]  he's got this monster paulosi
[3:27:51.340 --> 3:27:53.360]  on his side he's got dot
[3:27:53.360 --> 3:27:56.220]  and frank but he's also got i believe
[3:27:56.220 --> 3:27:58.660]  uh... harry reid and uh...
[3:27:58.660 --> 3:28:01.060]  mitch mcconnell and uh... baner
[3:28:01.060 --> 3:28:04.300]  they're all going to go along with it it's important for people in congress to
[3:28:04.300 --> 3:28:07.340]  say no filibuster it stop it block it
[3:28:07.340 --> 3:28:11.140]  and add killer amendment the killer amendment would be something like this
[3:28:11.140 --> 3:28:12.460]  are you going to give
[3:28:12.460 --> 3:28:14.100]  a trillion dollars
[3:28:14.100 --> 3:28:16.300]  to these financial institutions
[3:28:16.300 --> 3:28:19.700]  and then let them come in for clothes on you anyway
[3:28:19.700 --> 3:28:20.580]  come on
[3:28:20.580 --> 3:28:24.340]  if you get this is going to go to the point i keep making it so incredible
[3:28:24.340 --> 3:28:26.060]  we bail them out
[3:28:26.060 --> 3:28:28.580]  and then they take our houses
[3:28:28.580 --> 3:28:30.500]  but i think that's the way
[3:28:30.500 --> 3:28:33.180]  it never was there going to be and they've already been paid for it yeah
[3:28:33.180 --> 3:28:35.740]  they're going to feel they're going to have their hand in your pocket
[3:28:35.740 --> 3:28:38.700]  to pay for the bailout and they're going to kick you out on the street
[3:28:38.700 --> 3:28:41.060]  because uh... you you were still under this
[3:28:41.060 --> 3:28:44.540]  this foreclosure so it's incredible killer amendment would be you want to do
[3:28:44.540 --> 3:28:45.460]  this great
[3:28:45.460 --> 3:28:48.860]  stop all foreclosures for five years off of the duration
[3:28:48.860 --> 3:28:52.260]  of the crisis that brings me to my next point and i will talk about this
[3:28:52.260 --> 3:28:55.100]  behind the scenes and come back and get into some larger questions with us
[3:28:55.100 --> 3:28:59.940]  amazing i've got to get you up next week of a lot sooner just amazing
[3:28:59.940 --> 3:29:04.020]  the big issue here is congress started speaking out against this last week
[3:29:04.020 --> 3:29:07.420]  and paulson sunday said sit down and shut up
[3:29:07.420 --> 3:29:10.540]  the treasury has contracts with these private banks
[3:29:10.540 --> 3:29:13.740]  and the and with these institutional investors and and bondholders
[3:29:13.740 --> 3:29:17.460]  and so congress is involved congress controls the purse springs this is in
[3:29:17.460 --> 3:29:19.740]  constitutional crisis
[3:29:19.740 --> 3:29:23.500]  we're all i'm gonna skip that break for folks listening on info wars dot com
[3:29:23.500 --> 3:29:26.700]  webster how should that be dealt with them and we need to be calling congress
[3:29:26.700 --> 3:29:27.500]  saying hey
[3:29:27.500 --> 3:29:28.840]  get up off your butts
[3:29:28.840 --> 3:29:32.240]  and tell them you're in the driver's seat because now we have this
[3:29:32.240 --> 3:29:34.700]  unitary executive the furor precept
[3:29:34.700 --> 3:29:36.220]  you know with the bankers
[3:29:36.220 --> 3:29:39.580]  you're pushing bush completely aside showing that they are running the
[3:29:39.580 --> 3:29:41.340]  government right now
[3:29:41.340 --> 3:29:45.380]  yeah remember paulson is a member of the principles committee and this is what
[3:29:45.380 --> 3:29:47.460]  runs the government bush and cheney are
[3:29:47.460 --> 3:29:50.540]  simply figurehead i don't i don't even know what bush thinks about the stuff i
[3:29:50.540 --> 3:29:51.500]  don't think he
[3:29:51.500 --> 3:29:54.140]  he understands it cheney is also uh...
[3:29:54.140 --> 3:29:58.060]  in the you know he's in a in a haze of alcohol and and uh...
[3:29:58.060 --> 3:30:02.820]  in in a shooting at birds that he can't see it looks like he's about to die in uh...
[3:30:02.820 --> 3:30:04.180]  in uh...
[3:30:04.180 --> 3:30:06.380]  video i saw him in georgia
[3:30:06.380 --> 3:30:07.860]  well well you know that
[3:30:07.860 --> 3:30:10.740]  let's let him uh... drift off into the sunset but
[3:30:10.740 --> 3:30:11.540]  in the meantime
[3:30:11.540 --> 3:30:14.740]  we thought we had to press conferences to their book they were really put up
[3:30:14.740 --> 3:30:16.000]  they were decrees
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:19.140]  we had paulson appearing with cock
[3:30:19.140 --> 3:30:20.380]  and Bernanke
[3:30:20.380 --> 3:30:22.220]  and he said guess what uh...
[3:30:22.220 --> 3:30:25.460]  boys and girls were going to take one trillion dollars
[3:30:25.460 --> 3:30:26.440]  and pop up
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:30.620]  these toxic pieces of paper we've got mortgage-backed securities
[3:30:30.620 --> 3:30:32.660]  and collateralized debt obligations
[3:30:32.660 --> 3:30:35.940]  and we want to have the government by up the worst of them
[3:30:35.940 --> 3:30:38.360]  what what price is the government going to pay
[3:30:38.360 --> 3:30:41.740]  uh... recently the last time i looked at collateralized debt obligation is
[3:30:41.740 --> 3:30:45.420]  going to go for five cents on the dollar what prices the government going to pay
[3:30:45.420 --> 3:30:46.420]  are they going to pay
[3:30:46.420 --> 3:30:49.980]  one dollar for each dollar of collateralized debt obligation
[3:30:49.980 --> 3:30:52.260]  this stuff is crazy but the interesting thing is
[3:30:52.260 --> 3:30:54.300]  at the end of the press conference
[3:30:54.300 --> 3:30:57.260]  paulson takes three questions
[3:30:57.260 --> 3:31:00.740]  you try to motivate the public in other words public support seems to be the
[3:31:00.740 --> 3:31:01.700]  last thing
[3:31:01.700 --> 3:31:04.580]  on the mind of paulson he took three questions
[3:31:04.580 --> 3:31:05.740]  at the end of this
[3:31:05.740 --> 3:31:06.580]  uh...
[3:31:06.580 --> 3:31:08.020]  uh... but
[3:31:08.020 --> 3:31:11.140]  appearance right this dictation that he was giving
[3:31:11.140 --> 3:31:14.900]  uh... he was asked you know what what the story with uh... you know how much is
[3:31:14.900 --> 3:31:15.700]  it going to be
[3:31:15.700 --> 3:31:18.860]  how long how long will it take he wants it all done in a week
[3:31:18.860 --> 3:31:21.420]  the treasury is going to come up with a bill
[3:31:21.420 --> 3:31:24.420]  this weekend and they're going to try to bring it through next week
[3:31:24.420 --> 3:31:28.140]  because they all want to go home on september twenty-six
[3:31:28.140 --> 3:31:29.340]  to do their
[3:31:29.340 --> 3:31:30.860]  campaigning so
[3:31:30.860 --> 3:31:35.020]  again i heard everybody for whatever reason you can have any reason at all
[3:31:35.020 --> 3:31:37.100]  stop this thing block it
[3:31:37.100 --> 3:31:41.220]  filibuster it and again i have these killer amendments that would would have
[3:31:41.220 --> 3:31:42.200]  that effect
[3:31:42.200 --> 3:31:44.840]  and that would be reasonable and that would be educational
[3:31:44.840 --> 3:31:46.580]  there would be going to do all this
[3:31:46.580 --> 3:31:48.940]  why not stop foreclosures for five years
[3:31:48.940 --> 3:31:52.900]  why not wipe out those derivatives that have caused this crisis
[3:31:52.900 --> 3:31:57.060]  why not build in absolute guarantees for social security
[3:31:57.060 --> 3:32:00.780]  and the rest of the state safety net why not i think how about this
[3:32:00.780 --> 3:32:04.380]  you're going to save goldman fax from bankruptcy and they're going to go back
[3:32:04.380 --> 3:32:05.900]  to speculating on oil
[3:32:05.900 --> 3:32:09.460]  all of creeping up again right or is up five or six dollars a barrel
[3:32:09.460 --> 3:32:12.020]  we know that goldman fax is about
[3:32:12.020 --> 3:32:13.860]  well it's about a third
[3:32:13.860 --> 3:32:16.500]  through forty percent of all the oil speculation
[3:32:16.500 --> 3:32:20.300]  is done by goldman fax through that london offshore exchange
[3:32:20.300 --> 3:32:23.900]  so what you're going to do is your tax money will save goldman fax
[3:32:23.900 --> 3:32:26.100]  so they can foreclose on you and
[3:32:26.100 --> 3:32:29.380]  speculate on oil okay well so we're coming back to the full audience of the
[3:32:29.380 --> 3:32:36.380]  back it up again recap here we go
[3:32:39.340 --> 3:32:43.020]  final segment with webster terribly uh... on the set up a couple hours next
[3:32:43.020 --> 3:32:44.420]  week to really
[3:32:44.420 --> 3:32:48.220]  break all this down in fact on air webster i forgot to ask you as we skip
[3:32:48.220 --> 3:32:49.660]  the breaks
[3:32:49.660 --> 3:32:52.180]  you got your book in front of you uh...
[3:32:52.180 --> 3:32:55.060]  trace out today as he's working this sunday
[3:32:55.060 --> 3:32:57.100]  uh... but uh...
[3:32:57.100 --> 3:32:59.620]  i hope there's some time we can get you on for a couple hours to really go
[3:32:59.620 --> 3:33:01.260]  through your ideas
[3:33:01.260 --> 3:33:04.140]  on reforming this uh... crime syndicate
[3:33:04.140 --> 3:33:08.460]  uh... for several hours so let's confer on that and i'll call you after the show
[3:33:08.460 --> 3:33:12.480]  uh... but in the time we have left with you webster
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:15.820]  yes i mean you're absolutely right they are imploding the economy they're
[3:33:15.820 --> 3:33:17.220]  sucking it dry
[3:33:17.220 --> 3:33:20.980]  uh... and then they're still gonna foreclose on our houses even though the
[3:33:20.980 --> 3:33:24.180]  tax burden to pay for the bailouts being put on our backs
[3:33:24.180 --> 3:33:26.740]  i mean this is just unbelievable and
[3:33:26.740 --> 3:33:29.980]  they're turning the uh...
[3:33:29.980 --> 3:33:30.900]  the uh...
[3:33:30.900 --> 3:33:32.820]  shortest
[3:33:32.820 --> 3:33:35.060]  loose on what's left
[3:33:35.060 --> 3:33:37.740]  of the already beleaguered real economy
[3:33:37.740 --> 3:33:40.200]  but protecting themselves i mean this is just
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:42.420]  these walls are not going to stop
[3:33:42.420 --> 3:33:44.940]  uh... so you had some ideas try to stop this
[3:33:44.940 --> 3:33:46.940]  briefly get into those almost out of time
[3:33:46.940 --> 3:33:48.420]  and then
[3:33:48.420 --> 3:33:51.540]  getting into the real world i mean a lot we hope they listen to webster tarpley
[3:33:51.540 --> 3:33:52.580]  or others
[3:33:52.580 --> 3:33:54.220]  uh... richard c cooker
[3:33:54.220 --> 3:33:57.500]  but but but we know they have a plan and that's move the military and and suck
[3:33:57.500 --> 3:34:00.020]  everything dry implode the economy and
[3:34:00.020 --> 3:34:02.980]  you know that's just basically the end of america and they move on to the
[3:34:02.980 --> 3:34:04.700]  uh... happy hunting grounds and
[3:34:04.700 --> 3:34:07.100]  like to do another third world countries and suck them dry
[3:34:07.100 --> 3:34:10.220]  just put dictators and you know let's talk about where this is really going
[3:34:10.220 --> 3:34:12.980]  though because we all know they're not gonna listen to us
[3:34:12.980 --> 3:34:14.780]  uh... so please continue
[3:34:14.780 --> 3:34:17.380]  well that they just had one of the things we said during the break which i
[3:34:17.380 --> 3:34:18.540]  think it's important
[3:34:18.540 --> 3:34:19.540]  you you're going to be
[3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:23.900]  you're going to be uh... built of trillion dollars to save goldman fax
[3:34:23.900 --> 3:34:24.940]  goldman fax
[3:34:24.940 --> 3:34:26.780]  it's still going to foreclose
[3:34:26.780 --> 3:34:27.980]  on your house
[3:34:27.980 --> 3:34:31.620]  and thanks to you goldman fax will still be around
[3:34:31.620 --> 3:34:34.180]  to jack up the price of oil through
[3:34:34.180 --> 3:34:35.980]  derivative speculation
[3:34:35.980 --> 3:34:38.940]  that is to say future indices which are derivatives
[3:34:38.940 --> 3:34:42.700]  uh... in that offshore london deregulated market that uh... what
[3:34:42.700 --> 3:34:43.980]  goldman fax
[3:34:43.980 --> 3:34:46.500]  and morgan stanley the two have been saved
[3:34:46.500 --> 3:34:49.500]  other biggest speculators they're they're responsible
[3:34:49.500 --> 3:34:51.180]  for about
[3:34:51.180 --> 3:34:52.540]  forty percent
[3:34:52.540 --> 3:34:55.540]  of the increase in the price of oil is due
[3:34:55.540 --> 3:34:59.300]  to the fact that goldman fax and morgan stanley have have bit it up now
[3:34:59.300 --> 3:35:01.620]  and they were approaching bankruptcy
[3:35:01.620 --> 3:35:05.100]  they were selling those futures contracts that's why the oil price
[3:35:05.100 --> 3:35:08.620]  has gone down now that they're off the hook on bankruptcy they're free to go
[3:35:08.620 --> 3:35:09.980]  back and speculate
[3:35:09.980 --> 3:35:13.140]  and they're going to do that at your expense so this is absolute
[3:35:13.140 --> 3:35:15.660]  uh... monstrous uh... stuff
[3:35:15.660 --> 3:35:19.900]  that's going on again i would call on people mobilize try to stop this uh...
[3:35:19.900 --> 3:35:21.940]  bailout from going through
[3:35:21.940 --> 3:35:22.840]  and again
[3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:26.100]  i think you know any argument you want to make against it is a good argument
[3:35:26.100 --> 3:35:28.180]  but i think the most effective ones are
[3:35:28.180 --> 3:35:32.180]  where's the public interest in all this where the interest in
[3:35:32.180 --> 3:35:35.220]  uh... rebuilding the united states everybody knows
[3:35:35.220 --> 3:35:38.900]  the infrastructure the united states is at the point of physical breakdown the
[3:35:38.900 --> 3:35:40.460]  interstate highway system
[3:35:40.460 --> 3:35:42.380]  is at the point of physical breakdown
[3:35:42.380 --> 3:35:44.300]  the railroad infrastructure is
[3:35:44.300 --> 3:35:48.180]  collapsing like a train crashes all the time look at los angeles but it's
[3:35:48.180 --> 3:35:51.460]  total greed i mean these brokers in these international bankers
[3:35:51.460 --> 3:35:54.660]  they literally are making hundreds of i mean low-level guys
[3:35:54.660 --> 3:35:57.980]  in wall street making five ten million a year the big guys are getting
[3:35:57.980 --> 3:35:59.820]  you know one hundred million dollar bonuses
[3:35:59.820 --> 3:36:03.060]  they just don't care in the public doesn't understand all this so they
[3:36:03.060 --> 3:36:04.580]  have no idea
[3:36:04.580 --> 3:36:09.740]  well if the point of mass mobilization i mean if it obviously you reach it when
[3:36:09.740 --> 3:36:13.460]  the contraction and we're not going into a violent contraction of
[3:36:13.460 --> 3:36:14.540]  production
[3:36:14.540 --> 3:36:17.180]  employment and and living standards
[3:36:17.180 --> 3:36:18.220]  when you get
[3:36:18.220 --> 3:36:22.300]  instead of this gradual decline in the standard of living when you get a sharp
[3:36:22.300 --> 3:36:25.380]  reduction of one third to one half of the current level
[3:36:25.380 --> 3:36:26.660]  i think at that point
[3:36:26.660 --> 3:36:29.420]  political mobilization becomes much more
[3:36:29.420 --> 3:36:32.340]  feasible the question is you know to do what
[3:36:32.340 --> 3:36:34.740]  uh... and again i recommend
[3:36:34.740 --> 3:36:38.460]  activist measures that will actually deal with the cause of the crisis and
[3:36:38.460 --> 3:36:40.660]  again the number one
[3:36:40.660 --> 3:36:42.540]  way to deal with the cause
[3:36:42.540 --> 3:36:46.300]  wipe out derivatives we got between one and two quadrillion
[3:36:46.300 --> 3:36:48.180]  of these derivatives they are now
[3:36:48.180 --> 3:36:51.300]  credit default swaps we haven't talked about them we've talked about the
[3:36:51.300 --> 3:36:54.500]  cdl's will explain to people what a quadrillion is you know that they get
[3:36:54.500 --> 3:36:57.940]  their mind around and trillion that it's uh... you know the whole u s
[3:36:57.940 --> 3:37:01.940]  uh... the whole u s budget is uh... what three trillion
[3:37:01.940 --> 3:37:05.500]  per year the gross national product of the u s is
[3:37:05.500 --> 3:37:09.420]  what between ten and fifteen trillion national that's not about ten trillion
[3:37:09.420 --> 3:37:11.460]  but i don't know if you've heard him
[3:37:11.460 --> 3:37:15.100]  so you're talking about you know if you if you say a hundred trillion you're
[3:37:15.100 --> 3:37:17.460]  about at the price of the world
[3:37:17.460 --> 3:37:20.420]  and if you say a quadrillion that's probably ten times what the planet
[3:37:20.420 --> 3:37:24.180]  earth is worth let's explain the level of this black hole fraudulent debt they
[3:37:24.180 --> 3:37:25.260]  created
[3:37:25.260 --> 3:37:28.380]  i mean we don't know this folks it's just made up so these bastards could buy
[3:37:28.380 --> 3:37:32.980]  every shipping company every coal mine every local police department
[3:37:32.980 --> 3:37:36.980]  and they just sit there with troops laughing oiling their machine guns
[3:37:36.980 --> 3:37:39.860]  i mean they did it's it's it's it's an another announcing they're going to
[3:37:39.860 --> 3:37:43.580]  occupy the u s with regular army and it says
[3:37:43.580 --> 3:37:46.680]  in army times we hope we don't have to shoot you
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:50.100]  i mean that that it's just it's incredible let me add one other thing
[3:37:50.100 --> 3:37:53.700]  though could be that's just taken the question of fascism could be one thing
[3:37:53.700 --> 3:37:58.060]  is to look only at the top down stuff the police state dictatorship totalitarian
[3:37:58.060 --> 3:38:00.900]  stuff but now let's look at the fascist side
[3:38:00.900 --> 3:38:05.060]  you see this thing with governor palin email this is really interesting
[3:38:05.060 --> 3:38:08.660]  bush and company we're reading everybody's mail under the violation of
[3:38:08.660 --> 3:38:10.580]  the faiza act okay
[3:38:10.580 --> 3:38:12.100]  but now you have
[3:38:12.100 --> 3:38:14.340]  hooligans
[3:38:14.340 --> 3:38:15.780]  and and uh...
[3:38:15.780 --> 3:38:20.820]  the mermidans of the obama movement neofascist postmodern fascist
[3:38:20.820 --> 3:38:21.820]  who go
[3:38:21.820 --> 3:38:23.620]  and read your email
[3:38:23.620 --> 3:38:25.780]  and they do it with left cover
[3:38:25.780 --> 3:38:30.140]  anti-establishment cover radical cover grass roots cover
[3:38:30.140 --> 3:38:33.140]  and they're not the government anymore but they're acting as a flanking
[3:38:33.140 --> 3:38:35.220]  operation to the government of the woods
[3:38:35.220 --> 3:38:39.860]  obama is on his way to see the power and he's got these fascist goons
[3:38:39.860 --> 3:38:42.420]  who are going to come in and steal your email
[3:38:42.420 --> 3:38:45.260]  and the public response is different in other words if bush
[3:38:45.260 --> 3:38:47.260]  if bush had been found reading
[3:38:47.260 --> 3:38:50.180]  somebody's email that scandal for the left liberal
[3:38:50.180 --> 3:38:51.140]  but now
[3:38:51.140 --> 3:38:56.060]  when uh... gocker dot com and the son of some democratic congressman
[3:38:56.060 --> 3:39:00.700]  who's some kind of a goon for obama when they go and break into an email account
[3:39:00.700 --> 3:39:02.900]  that's fine because that has left cover
[3:39:02.900 --> 3:39:06.420]  that's the genius of that i understand that and you think obama has the
[3:39:06.420 --> 3:39:09.260]  grassroots support to bring in something really dangerous whereas mccain's a
[3:39:09.260 --> 3:39:10.500]  dead political doc
[3:39:10.500 --> 3:39:13.220]  and we just discredit it but but but here here's the deal
[3:39:13.220 --> 3:39:16.380]  why don't we have the Rothschild's and the british royalty
[3:39:16.380 --> 3:39:18.180]  and every other elite lining up
[3:39:18.180 --> 3:39:21.780]  on the surface at least uh... for uh... john mccain
[3:39:21.780 --> 3:39:24.420]  but i don't see that at all i mean i don't really i could play all the
[3:39:24.420 --> 3:39:27.820]  clips and they're all over but these are individuals this is anecdotal stuff
[3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:31.180]  if you look at the massive evidence of who's given the money
[3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:35.380]  obama is getting five times more out of wall street than mccain is he's getting
[3:39:35.380 --> 3:39:36.580]  the most from
[3:39:36.580 --> 3:39:37.780]  goldman fact
[3:39:37.780 --> 3:39:41.380]  the most from leemann except for hillary clinton that is true
[3:39:41.380 --> 3:39:44.100]  the money look at the money and you will see
[3:39:44.100 --> 3:39:46.820]  that obama is the overwhelming candidate
[3:39:46.820 --> 3:39:49.220]  of wall street look at these people like
[3:39:49.220 --> 3:39:52.420]  look at uh... you know that the federal reserve so you think they're gonna try
[3:39:52.420 --> 3:39:57.180]  to use uh... minorities as the hitlerian brigade if he gets in
[3:39:57.180 --> 3:40:00.060]  because i do see them hiring the illegal aliens for the military and
[3:40:00.060 --> 3:40:01.740]  positioning them in key places
[3:40:01.740 --> 3:40:04.340]  i mean is that what you're saying you're saying he will for the white
[3:40:04.340 --> 3:40:06.460]  bankers kind of be the front
[3:40:06.460 --> 3:40:10.620]  of a brown revolution that's uh... counter i wouldn't i wouldn't see it in
[3:40:10.620 --> 3:40:13.580]  racial terms although that's how obama will try to package it
[3:40:13.580 --> 3:40:17.180]  the idea is that what if you look at strike breaking who has the credibility
[3:40:17.180 --> 3:40:19.060]  to to break a strike
[3:40:19.060 --> 3:40:22.820]  that and i don't think it would be a reactionary nobody likes mccain
[3:40:22.820 --> 3:40:25.500]  but obama has left cover obama is going to say
[3:40:25.500 --> 3:40:28.060]  i'm breaking your strike for the polar bears
[3:40:28.060 --> 3:40:30.340]  and for the poor people starving in africa
[3:40:30.340 --> 3:40:31.820]  and for the snail daughters
[3:40:31.820 --> 3:40:34.060]  and all these other left wing causes
[3:40:34.060 --> 3:40:37.140]  which people are not they're not prepared to fight back on the webster i
[3:40:37.140 --> 3:40:40.780]  gotta get you back on next week so look at your schedule an email trailer i'll

[3:41:03.740 --> 3:41:07.620]  gentlemen looking at the news on info wars dot com and present planet dot com
[3:41:07.620 --> 3:41:10.180]  it's on the economy on the police state
[3:41:10.180 --> 3:41:13.420]  just all the stops are being pulled out this is the time to be paying attention
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:14.300]  to things
[3:41:14.300 --> 3:41:15.660]  and this is the time
[3:41:15.660 --> 3:41:18.380]  to be spreading the word everybody you know
[3:41:18.380 --> 3:41:21.420]  uh... you know we keep telling you get into gold in the silver get into
[3:41:21.420 --> 3:41:25.260]  storeable food get into water filters get secure
[3:41:25.260 --> 3:41:28.100]  yet you know i'm people say what i do i do i uh...
[3:41:28.100 --> 3:41:30.900]  probably can't run around going into a depression you probably can't run around
[3:41:30.900 --> 3:41:31.900]  the full loading
[3:41:31.900 --> 3:41:35.780]  or the third brick you know brigade of the army coming in
[3:41:35.780 --> 3:41:39.260]  uh... or i mean that they're openly announcing everything we told you
[3:41:39.260 --> 3:41:42.300]  uh... god knows what's gonna happen now i mean we've told us it's horrible but
[3:41:42.300 --> 3:41:43.980]  just to see it unfold is still
[3:41:43.980 --> 3:41:47.420]  another thing it's one thing to analyze it predicted read their own documents
[3:41:47.420 --> 3:41:48.020]  where they
[3:41:48.020 --> 3:41:48.740]  say it
[3:41:48.740 --> 3:41:51.220]  it's another thing to see it start unfolding
[3:41:51.220 --> 3:41:52.980]  and uh...
[3:41:52.980 --> 3:41:55.900]  we just thank you all out there for your support of this radio show and our
[3:41:55.900 --> 3:41:58.300]  sponsors and everybody we bring on here
[3:41:58.300 --> 3:42:00.860]  whether it's ron paul or cindy sheen or
[3:42:00.860 --> 3:42:04.140]  webster tarply all the people we support and promote that we're a platform for
[3:42:04.140 --> 3:42:05.620]  everybody resisting tyranny
[3:42:05.620 --> 3:42:07.420]  try to have a real debate about what's happening
[3:42:07.420 --> 3:42:11.100]  for the balance of the show the next uh... eighteen minutes
[3:42:11.100 --> 3:42:13.620]  i am honored to be joined by steve shank
[3:42:13.620 --> 3:42:16.700]  to give us a purse uh... perspective on
[3:42:16.700 --> 3:42:18.180]  what's happening
[3:42:18.180 --> 3:42:21.820]  uh... as the oldest continually operating storeable food company in the
[3:42:21.820 --> 3:42:25.260]  nation somebody who has a you know big factory buys in bulk
[3:42:25.260 --> 3:42:28.260]  can really give us a report on what the speculators are doing
[3:42:28.260 --> 3:42:31.740]  uh... what the famines worldwide i've got reports
[3:42:31.740 --> 3:42:34.020]  on that french news agency today
[3:42:34.020 --> 3:42:37.620]  rising prices to put another seventy five million towards starvation
[3:42:37.620 --> 3:42:41.300]  uh... and that's the u n's food and agriculture organizations of the day
[3:42:41.300 --> 3:42:43.980]  it was
[3:42:43.980 --> 3:42:47.540]  eight hundred fifty million on the edge of starvation this is up from only two
[3:42:47.540 --> 3:42:50.860]  hundred million a few years ago to nine hundred twenty five million
[3:42:50.860 --> 3:42:52.620]  this is being orchestrated
[3:42:52.620 --> 3:42:55.740]  and look at all i know is if there's a ten percent chance of any of this
[3:42:55.740 --> 3:42:58.980]  happening here with war or depression
[3:42:58.980 --> 3:43:02.740]  eighty percent of the country was agrarian on the farm in the great
[3:43:02.740 --> 3:43:04.180]  depression for ten years
[3:43:04.180 --> 3:43:07.100]  and you still had seven million people starved at that's major university
[3:43:07.100 --> 3:43:10.300]  studies just google seven million star during great depression i just came out
[3:43:10.300 --> 3:43:10.980]  of a month ago
[3:43:10.980 --> 3:43:14.460]  big study
[3:43:14.460 --> 3:43:15.640]  is historical study
[3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:17.860]  go pull it up
[3:43:17.860 --> 3:43:20.540]  my point here is is that
[3:43:20.540 --> 3:43:24.020]  if we have a depression and the food stop showing up it's already happening
[3:43:24.020 --> 3:43:26.360]  some places in stores are barren
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:29.640]  thing and a lot of staples are running out and it's it's bad folks
[3:43:29.640 --> 3:43:32.900]  it's really bad the third world starving to death is food rights everywhere
[3:43:32.900 --> 3:43:33.900]  all over the world
[3:43:33.900 --> 3:43:35.980]  uh... hundreds of countries are having problems
[3:43:35.980 --> 3:43:39.060]  i hope none of this happens but if we sail through this and hey there's no
[3:43:39.060 --> 3:43:40.140]  depression and
[3:43:40.140 --> 3:43:43.420]  the bankers are sweet and pat us on the head of the third brigade sweet to us
[3:43:43.420 --> 3:43:46.900]  and hands-out donuts to kids as they're going to do in p r stunts they're
[3:43:46.900 --> 3:43:47.900]  admitting that
[3:43:47.900 --> 3:43:50.660]  uh... so my sarcasm as a basis in reality
[3:43:50.660 --> 3:43:54.100]  uh... then we're fine and you just eat the food and there's going to be bad
[3:43:54.100 --> 3:43:57.020]  inflation that's already here and so you save money that way
[3:43:57.020 --> 3:43:59.820]  but i believe you should get into trouble foods now i'm babbling we're
[3:43:59.820 --> 3:44:00.980]  running out of time
[3:44:00.980 --> 3:44:03.260]  without even getting him up here i wanted to get him on to talk about what's
[3:44:03.260 --> 3:44:03.940]  happening
[3:44:03.940 --> 3:44:07.500]  steve stuff is going from bad to worse isn't it
[3:44:07.500 --> 3:44:12.220]  well absolutely and you know that we we saw a couple days ago the biggest
[3:44:12.220 --> 3:44:13.660]  jump in gold
[3:44:13.660 --> 3:44:17.500]  in the history of uh... investment in things in this country
[3:44:17.500 --> 3:44:21.660]  but the thing that people aren't seeing and that you that you and i have been
[3:44:21.660 --> 3:44:24.100]  talking about all the time alex
[3:44:24.100 --> 3:44:25.460]  is the fact that
[3:44:25.460 --> 3:44:30.460]  if you think gold is hopping like crazy you ought to see what the speculators
[3:44:30.460 --> 3:44:32.260]  are doing with food
[3:44:32.260 --> 3:44:34.420]  they have a sure bet
[3:44:34.420 --> 3:44:37.780]  the world is in famine in the united states
[3:44:37.780 --> 3:44:38.700]  we've got
[3:44:38.700 --> 3:44:42.660]  we've got everybody running around all the patriots and all the people that
[3:44:42.660 --> 3:44:44.440]  even are aware
[3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:47.220]  uh... running around saying what can we do
[3:44:47.220 --> 3:44:52.340]  the individual has to take control we cannot wait for them to do whatever
[3:44:52.340 --> 3:44:53.580]  they're going to do
[3:44:53.580 --> 3:44:57.740]  and the only way to do that is be completely independent
[3:44:57.740 --> 3:45:00.740]  now the victory garden has to come back guys
[3:45:00.740 --> 3:45:05.340]  if people understood alex exactly what's going on with food
[3:45:05.340 --> 3:45:07.340]  we would not have one
[3:45:07.340 --> 3:45:11.980]  green lawn in this country it'll all be rototilled up and people would be
[3:45:11.980 --> 3:45:14.820]  plant anything they could get for fall vegetables
[3:45:14.820 --> 3:45:16.300]  those that don't have
[3:45:16.300 --> 3:45:18.660]  don't have the ability to plant
[3:45:18.660 --> 3:45:20.700]  would be putting in three to four years
[3:45:20.700 --> 3:45:21.980]  of food because
[3:45:21.980 --> 3:45:23.180]  here's what happens
[3:45:23.180 --> 3:45:27.340]  if you have runaway inflation and we have runaway inflation we are going to
[3:45:27.340 --> 3:45:28.140]  have
[3:45:28.140 --> 3:45:29.460]  runaway inflation
[3:45:29.460 --> 3:45:33.540]  the the the world war two germany experience of taking
[3:45:33.540 --> 3:45:36.820]  taking your money to the to the store in
[3:45:36.820 --> 3:45:39.220]  in wheelbarrows for a loaf of bread
[3:45:39.220 --> 3:45:43.300]  is in process right now and what happens
[3:45:43.300 --> 3:45:46.720]  is you you go through first of all the phase where you
[3:45:46.720 --> 3:45:49.620]  get out of the cash and into golden silver
[3:45:49.620 --> 3:45:51.740]  but then the next phase comes
[3:45:51.740 --> 3:45:55.300]  that the golden silver will not buy what is not there
[3:45:55.300 --> 3:46:00.020]  and what you have to do is take your value and roll it next into food
[3:46:00.020 --> 3:46:04.660]  so anyone who understands what's going on
[3:46:04.660 --> 3:46:08.580]  buy up ahead of time while the money still has value
[3:46:08.580 --> 3:46:11.300]  that the the food that they need
[3:46:11.300 --> 3:46:13.820]  now you're going to have to compete right now
[3:46:13.820 --> 3:46:15.860]  uh... you and i talked about this
[3:46:15.860 --> 3:46:18.620]  several times in the last month and a half alex
[3:46:18.620 --> 3:46:19.860]  but the fact is
[3:46:19.860 --> 3:46:21.460]  that all our people
[3:46:21.460 --> 3:46:25.460]  are going to have to compete for their food right now
[3:46:25.460 --> 3:46:30.620]  again speculators who are seeing the most profitable bet in the history of
[3:46:30.620 --> 3:46:31.740]  mankind
[3:46:31.740 --> 3:46:34.580]  in investing in food commodities
[3:46:34.580 --> 3:46:37.980]  even better than that jump that are taken in gold
[3:46:37.980 --> 3:46:40.300]  there will come a time in the very short
[3:46:40.300 --> 3:46:42.260]  future
[3:46:42.260 --> 3:46:44.860]  you will need to get out of your silver and gold
[3:46:44.860 --> 3:46:48.580]  and the only thing that you'll be able to get into that will help any value or
[3:46:48.580 --> 3:46:52.580]  hold value is food and the long-term storeable stuff that goes twelve to
[3:46:52.580 --> 3:46:53.580]  fifteen years
[3:46:53.580 --> 3:46:55.140]  is the only chance we've got
[3:46:55.140 --> 3:46:57.700]  families have to become independent
[3:46:57.700 --> 3:46:59.780]  because for crying out loud
[3:46:59.780 --> 3:47:03.500]  these financial organizations are moving so fast
[3:47:03.500 --> 3:47:08.940]  the government takeover and and the illegal use of public funds to bail out
[3:47:08.940 --> 3:47:12.700]  of this insurance companies there's no doubt let me explain again during the
[3:47:12.700 --> 3:47:16.140]  depression seven million star over that ten years and that's what i think it
[3:47:16.140 --> 3:47:19.580]  conservative number and it wasn't that farmers people say well how did that
[3:47:19.580 --> 3:47:20.300]  happen
[3:47:20.300 --> 3:47:23.220]  a lot of farmers didn't really own their land so they got kicked off
[3:47:23.220 --> 3:47:24.940]  then the food production went down
[3:47:24.940 --> 3:47:26.980]  i mean they kicked like half of oklahoma
[3:47:26.980 --> 3:47:28.780]  you know that's where merrill haggard you know
[3:47:28.780 --> 3:47:31.740]  the okie from muscogee was really from northern california because he was born
[3:47:31.740 --> 3:47:32.180]  in a
[3:47:32.180 --> 3:47:34.620]  railway car on the on the way there
[3:47:34.620 --> 3:47:37.940]  uh... you know i mean and i'm not saying that's even gonna happen but folks
[3:47:37.940 --> 3:47:40.820]  bottom line stuff is getting crazy
[3:47:40.820 --> 3:47:44.460]  and uh... we just thank god people out there like steve shank
[3:47:44.460 --> 3:47:47.260]  who are educating people about what's going on
[3:47:47.260 --> 3:47:49.780]  and uh... steve before we go any further is i want to keep breaking the
[3:47:49.780 --> 3:47:50.940]  standard analyzing it
[3:47:50.940 --> 3:47:53.860]  give people the toll-free number to call and get a free brochure or the free
[3:47:53.860 --> 3:47:54.940]  audio cd
[3:47:54.940 --> 3:47:57.980]  or to learn more but they shouldn't wait to find out about the great high
[3:47:57.980 --> 3:48:00.580]  quality food packages you've got
[3:48:00.580 --> 3:48:04.980]  if eight hundred four zero nine five six three three eight hundred
[3:48:04.980 --> 3:48:06.660]  four zero nine
[3:48:06.660 --> 3:48:09.980]  five six three three or get up on the food
[3:48:09.980 --> 3:48:12.140]  direct dot com
[3:48:12.140 --> 3:48:15.900]  tons of articles there that you can read it and figure out exactly what's
[3:48:15.900 --> 3:48:18.020]  happening but the bottom line is
[3:48:18.020 --> 3:48:22.660]  it is time to act and the only way that people can beat inflation
[3:48:22.660 --> 3:48:24.860]  is to already put that
[3:48:24.860 --> 3:48:29.300]  pay for by and all in their possession the things that they're going to need
[3:48:29.300 --> 3:48:32.060]  in the most important dependency that we have this food
[3:48:32.060 --> 3:48:35.980]  i know i'm sorry like a one-trick pony alex but the fact is
[3:48:35.980 --> 3:48:39.580]  that this is a fact and people are going to have to start
[3:48:39.580 --> 3:48:41.620]  planning on victory garden
[3:48:41.620 --> 3:48:43.420]  learning to grow sprouts
[3:48:43.420 --> 3:48:47.500]  learning to do for themselves at bottom line folks the government is saying
[3:48:47.500 --> 3:48:48.500]  you know
[3:48:48.500 --> 3:48:52.420]  hundreds of trillions of dollars it's not true it's a scam
[3:48:52.420 --> 3:48:55.660]  and and and and it's clear they're gonna just rape everything
[3:48:55.660 --> 3:48:58.740]  i mean i mean earlier what you know the reports of their turning
[3:48:58.740 --> 3:49:01.060]  the speculators loose on
[3:49:01.060 --> 3:49:05.460]  all the real industries but guarding the the parasites i mean it's in the the
[3:49:05.460 --> 3:49:09.300]  media advertises it is stopping speculators it's the opposite
[3:49:09.300 --> 3:49:11.940]  i mean these guys are so criminal
[3:49:11.940 --> 3:49:15.740]  it just blows my mind again give that number out

[3:50:29.940 --> 3:50:33.100]  okay uh... steve continue please
[3:50:33.100 --> 3:50:37.540]  the main thing that i've got a point out alex is that
[3:50:37.540 --> 3:50:40.100]  the the way that we deal
[3:50:40.100 --> 3:50:43.860]  as as individuals and families
[3:50:43.860 --> 3:50:49.020]  uncertain and action unfortunately too certain future than it that is being
[3:50:49.020 --> 3:50:50.860]  brought down around us
[3:50:50.860 --> 3:50:54.780]  is that we have to be independent so that we don't be beholden
[3:50:54.780 --> 3:50:55.740]  you see if
[3:50:55.740 --> 3:50:59.260]  if you have your own bread you never have to stand in the bread line
[3:50:59.260 --> 3:51:02.420]  and historically every single time
[3:51:02.420 --> 3:51:06.540]  that a government has taken over and taken away liberties and freedoms
[3:51:06.540 --> 3:51:09.940]  the way that they control the but the people for this event that are any of
[3:51:09.940 --> 3:51:11.260]  the people who want to fight
[3:51:11.260 --> 3:51:14.900]  is by standing on bread lines because there's no food food is the control
[3:51:14.900 --> 3:51:16.060]  mechanism
[3:51:16.060 --> 3:51:19.260]  and if you take control of that dependency
[3:51:19.260 --> 3:51:21.020]  then you have a chance
[3:51:21.020 --> 3:51:23.860]  to ignore what happens with
[3:51:23.860 --> 3:51:26.940]  whatever mechanism that they put into place
[3:51:26.940 --> 3:51:30.300]  so i know that it sounds like i'm talking food food food
[3:51:30.300 --> 3:51:33.940]  you know one of the things that i hear once in a while from
[3:51:33.940 --> 3:51:37.020]  from critics of you and me talking about food all the time
[3:51:37.020 --> 3:51:39.780]  is all they're just trying to put this food is trying to
[3:51:39.780 --> 3:51:41.740]  this careless to sell the food
[3:51:41.740 --> 3:51:43.140]  let me tell you folks
[3:51:43.140 --> 3:51:47.180]  every morsel of food that alex can get his hands on that we can get our hands
[3:51:47.180 --> 3:51:50.060]  on it jay mitchie michael steven's group
[3:51:50.060 --> 3:51:54.420]  will go to somebody it'll be scarfed up and there won't be enough left
[3:51:54.420 --> 3:51:55.500]  it's not a matter of
[3:51:55.500 --> 3:51:59.900]  selling anymore a matter of saving well i mean let's get down to brass tax here
[3:51:59.900 --> 3:52:02.340]  you're in the business you believe in up in utah
[3:52:02.340 --> 3:52:05.780]  i'm in a business i believe in in information in austin and i only have
[3:52:05.780 --> 3:52:08.380]  sponsors on that i endorse that i believe in
[3:52:08.380 --> 3:52:11.940]  and and and with all i'm going to have been telling you folks for years that
[3:52:11.940 --> 3:52:14.820]  we're gonna see economy i told you three years ago they were going to start the
[3:52:14.820 --> 3:52:16.060]  controlled implosion
[3:52:16.060 --> 3:52:18.580]  in a film in game and with all our guests
[3:52:18.580 --> 3:52:23.220]  uh... by imploding the economy starting with the mortgages the subprime
[3:52:23.220 --> 3:52:24.780]  it happened
[3:52:24.780 --> 3:52:28.260]  now i don't know if stuff is bad as steve saying i believe he believes that i
[3:52:28.260 --> 3:52:32.220]  know he's in the business i hope to god he's wrong but every passing day it
[3:52:32.220 --> 3:52:35.500]  looks like he's right all i know is if there's a ten percent chance of this
[3:52:35.500 --> 3:52:39.300]  happening you've got to have storeable food and yet that if it allows me to
[3:52:39.300 --> 3:52:42.620]  sponsor my radio show and pay my fourteen employees and get a little bit of
[3:52:42.620 --> 3:52:45.260]  money to be able to operate and pay for the bandwidth
[3:52:45.260 --> 3:52:47.500]  of having some of the biggest websites on the web
[3:52:47.500 --> 3:52:51.860]  absolutely that we need to operate and i need food for my family but it's a
[3:52:51.860 --> 3:52:53.220]  everything i do is about
[3:52:53.220 --> 3:52:54.580]  symbiotic
[3:52:54.580 --> 3:52:58.460]  everything i do is about win-win-win-win-win i'm a win-win-win guy
[3:52:58.460 --> 3:53:00.220]  i'm not a winner-loser guy
[3:53:00.220 --> 3:53:04.180]  and so uh... we were right you need to get storeable food bottom line
[3:53:04.180 --> 3:53:08.300]  j michael stevens group e-foods direct dot com we'll put it back up on screen
[3:53:08.300 --> 3:53:09.820]  for everybody

[3:53:16.540 --> 3:53:17.380]  internet
[3:53:17.380 --> 3:53:20.380]  by skipping this break i wanted to spend all that time we had but
[3:53:20.380 --> 3:53:22.460]  let's come back and continue to talk about
[3:53:22.460 --> 3:53:26.060]  where you see the future of food prices going with inflation

[3:53:54.260 --> 3:53:57.980]  the last fifteen something years in air conditioning what guaranteed ten in the
[3:53:57.980 --> 3:54:00.580]  garage like at my house don't have room for it
[3:54:00.580 --> 3:54:02.420]  so i got like
[3:54:02.420 --> 3:54:05.420]  stuff's getting so i don't see how much food i've got a couple years supply for
[3:54:05.420 --> 3:54:06.340]  my whole family
[3:54:06.340 --> 3:54:09.100]  and i've even bought more and given it to family and i keep forgetting for like
[3:54:09.100 --> 3:54:10.940]  months because i'm so busy you're so busy
[3:54:10.940 --> 3:54:12.220]  i want another

[3:54:16.140 --> 3:54:17.620]  that from you
[3:54:17.620 --> 3:54:19.180]  but because i'm realizing
[3:54:19.180 --> 3:54:21.460]  my god you know this isn't enough what i have
[3:54:21.460 --> 3:54:23.100]  uh... just in closing
[3:54:23.100 --> 3:54:25.420]  seeing what's going on in the markets
[3:54:25.420 --> 3:54:28.780]  uh... you were right a year and a half ago when we first started talking to you
[3:54:28.780 --> 3:54:29.700]  again
[3:54:29.700 --> 3:54:30.460]  uh...
[3:54:30.460 --> 3:54:32.740]  but listen to you for years you obviously have a radio show here on
[3:54:32.740 --> 3:54:33.780]  genesis
[3:54:33.780 --> 3:54:35.460]  and let's plug that
[3:54:35.460 --> 3:54:38.140]  but uh... you were right about food prices going up then and now it's
[3:54:38.140 --> 3:54:39.260]  continuing
[3:54:39.260 --> 3:54:43.500]  i mean how much are we going to see general food prices go up the next year
[3:54:43.500 --> 3:54:47.660]  you will see them double and triple and you will not see any any food prices
[3:54:47.660 --> 3:54:50.580]  coming back down it's not going to be like oil
[3:54:50.580 --> 3:54:53.060]  there is a shortage
[3:54:53.060 --> 3:54:54.260]  worldwide
[3:54:54.260 --> 3:54:55.980]  there is a serious famine
[3:54:55.980 --> 3:55:00.740]  we're just clearing the the third year of a worldwide fan of the spot but the
[3:55:00.740 --> 3:55:04.620]  but the speculators have also piled on to the family
[3:55:04.620 --> 3:55:08.540]  or absolutely and after buying it up and they were they're writing in the in
[3:55:08.540 --> 3:55:10.060]  financial magazines

[3:55:20.900 --> 3:55:22.100]  or four months
[3:55:22.100 --> 3:55:25.700]  because four countries can afford to come in with cheap american dollars and buy
