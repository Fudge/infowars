[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  Well, every day is an information overload day here in the Info War.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  As we say, get next year's news here today, get tomorrow's news here today.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  Here's an example.
[00:38.000 --> 00:46.000]  We reported six months ago that the threat fusion GPS dossier had been used to get the fake FISA court garbage.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  And then months ago congressional hearings also found that.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  But now they're having to admit it because finally it's all being subpoenaed.
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.000]  And that's just crazy how much these people lied.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  James O'Keeffe has done it again with his great team at Project Veritas.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  He'll be joining us coming up later in the third hour.
[01:05.000 --> 01:13.000]  James O'Keeffe has infiltrated and his organization has infiltrated Twitter and talked to scores of people.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  We're going to air a 15 minute video coming up.
[01:15.000 --> 01:33.000]  It's on infowars.com where these individuals, it bragged how they control conservatives, libertarians, Christians ban everybody, how they spy on the president and his private communications on Twitter and how they want to give it to Congress.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  The deep state isn't just the NSA and the CIA.
[01:37.000 --> 01:46.000]  The deep state is the corporations and the globalist organizations that are engaging in absolutely massive crimes, election fraud, you name it, in front of everybody.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio from there in Phoenix is neck and neck in the Senate race.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  And that's with media polls saying he's neck and neck.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  That probably means he's 10 points ahead.
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  We've got the sheriff popping in as well, and then we've got John Rappaport of No More Fake News coming on.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  So a huge transmission guest wise.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  But that said, wow.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  Wow.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  It's just crazy what's going on here.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  We have got the latest on Trump and the so-called DACA situation where all he's doing is having negotiations and being nice to people.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  And they're saying he sold everybody out.
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  But he's clear we're building the wall and people that can't prove they were here peacefully since they were children are gone.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  And they've turned back the massive waves of illegals coming in and have got huge raids happening across the country.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  Obama had ended the border and said, come here, period, we'll just legalize you outside law.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  Trump isn't a dictator.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  And so he can't just do everything we want.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  He has to get Congress to agree with him.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  And thank God he's got the trifecta.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  He's got the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  But for who knows how long.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  So people can get easy points out there going, oh, he's not perfect.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  You know, he says he's open to debate and discussion.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  That means he sold us out when everything shows he does the opposite.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  And look, he's not perfect because he's not a dictator.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And the media had articles there saying, oh, look, Jones wants him to be a dictator.
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.000]  Noah had Mark Faber on the Economist, Dr. Mark Faber, saying, look, Trump's doing an incredible job, but he's not a dictator.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  We're not saying we want him to be a dictator.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  We're saying he has to work with Congress, as Ron Paul has said many times.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  If he would have won for president, he wouldn't be a dictator.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  So it'd still be hard to get a lot of stuff through.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  You have to marvel at what Trump's gotten through.
[03:44.000 --> 03:52.000]  And look, it's not about marveling just at Trump, it's about appreciating how far we have come.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  So that is just some of what's coming up.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  And then we've got massive news on the Islamic invasion and the globalist being behind that.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  We also have Trump's new nuke posture.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  Draft allows nuclear response to conventional attacks and new warheads.
[04:07.000 --> 04:16.000]  That's really just continuing the new posture of the Pentagon about the last decade, which, again, goes back to 1953,
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  when they wanted to use nukes against the 3 million Chinese troops that poured in to aid the other millions that had poured in
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  against the outnumbered 10-to-1 U.S. troops and South Korean troops.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  And we would never have the North Korean problem or the communist Chinese problem.
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  We had gotten rid of communist China back then as MacArthur, which MacArthur wanted to do.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  But instead, the globalists gave China the nukes.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's like they gave the Russians the nukes because they want global destabilization to bring in their world government as the answer to the crisis.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  It's all coming up.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  Oh, and another big one.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  Wait till you hear this one.
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  Oh, you know what? Just wait till after the break and I'll tell you about it.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[05:26.000 --> 05:34.000]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[05:39.000 --> 05:47.000]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.000]  Boost, protect, and adapt with cell force from InfoWarsLife.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  Sounded real and chubby.
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.000]  Chronic Technocracy Takeover.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  Music.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  Thursday, January 11th, 2018.
[07:02.000 --> 07:12.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be here live for the next four hours and Owen Schreuer comes in as a fresh, strong, smart horse in the fight against the globalist at 3 o'clock central.
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  The course of all starts at 8 a.m. every day with David Knight and the Real News kicks off here at Central Time.
[07:18.000 --> 07:26.000]  InfoWars.com forward slash show, UHF VHF cable stations across the country, and as well as over 200 radio stations.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  By the way, we've had a satellite system for two years.
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  There's quite a few TV stations and cable systems picked it up, but it's not the one a lot of stations tell us they want, so in a few months we're going to go off that satellite.
[07:36.000 --> 07:43.000]  But before that, I'm going to announce several new satellites and get that information out to the stations.
[07:43.000 --> 07:58.000]  I am setting up the TV affiliate group right now with John Harmon who heads up our radio affiliate group and of course Scott and others that we're getting lined up for all of that.
[07:58.000 --> 08:08.000]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a ton of UHF and VHF stations call us.
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  I mean, we're talking five, ten a day, wanting to pick it up, so I'm very excited that as soon as we put up the links to the new satellites and things that are very expensive,
[08:16.000 --> 08:27.000]  nevertheless, it's going to reach a lot of new markets because we're not trying to get our own vanity channel on cable where there's 5,000 channels like some people tried and failed.
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I knew Lynn Bechstiel was destined to fail because it's not the old days where you go pay for a $20 million channel and it doesn't have carriage rights.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  That means it's not on the lower peg, the first hundred channels or so, so nobody watches it.
[08:40.000 --> 08:56.000]  But where there is an audience is UHF, VHF, and cable systems directly to program directors, station owners and managers saying, hey, free to air, carry this radio slash TV program anywhere you want, whenever you want.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  And I intend to basically have it be free to air where they can play over all the commercials you name it.
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  I just want to get the information out to the people during this critical historical time.
[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  So we're getting the people in place right now trying to hire the folks, get them in place so that we can watch that.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  It takes capital and I get so busy in the fight here that I hardly even plug products or talk about things.
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  But we have amazing supplements, amazing water filtration, air filtration, Patriot apparel, books, videos, films, you name it.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  Speaking of that, we have joining us in studio today.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  Mike Norris, good friend of mine, famous director from film and TV.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  Of course, Chuck Norris' firstborn son, great guy.
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.000]  And he's written a powerful new screenplay and has been turned into a film, The Crossroads of Hunter Wild.
[09:47.000 --> 09:55.000]  And it's kind of a modern version, very powerfully done, of Pilgrim's Progress.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  So a battle as old as time itself being fought at the end of days.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  We're selling the new film, direct to DVD, direct to you.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  It's also going to air on national television.
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  Usually there's like the Hallmark and Lifetime channel, like his last films have, The Crossroads of Hunter Wild.
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  And so we now have that exclusively available for you on DVD at infowarsstore.com.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  A couple of weeks is exclusively there.
[10:20.000 --> 10:29.000]  So Mike Norris is going to be joining us in studio, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, neck and neck in the key senate race in Arizona.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  And of course, we have the great, all of you are really great people.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  We need to celebrate them.
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  James O'Keefe has done it again with his great team at Project Veritas.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  We're going to cover that first.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  He's joining us the third hour, but we're going to get into it right now.
[10:45.000 --> 10:58.000]  Undercover video, Twitter engineers to ban a way of talking through shadow banning algorithms to censor opposing political opinions.
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  Now, he got scores of their operatives and their managers to admit how they're already doing this,
[11:05.000 --> 11:16.000]  but how it's going AI now and how they use keywords to completely end and stop the sharing of Christian, conservative, libertarian, pro-nationalist, you name it, speech.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  And the big tech giants hire SJW, chip on their shoulder folks right out of the colleges where they're banning free speech,
[11:24.000 --> 11:32.000]  saying that we have no whites, weakens, just all of this really unconstitutional Nazi-like behavior,
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  but it's okay because it's the left doing it and they create these cadres now and are deploying them into the technocracy.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  And it's serious civil rights violations.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  That's why big lawsuits are taking place.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  And that's why we're going to win.
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  I'm quietly behind the scenes with some of these lawsuits that you're seeing launched right now against Google, Twitter, Facebook,
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  and I'm going to become parties to these as well because in all of these lawsuits and in all these documents,
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  under cover videos, they say our number one mission is shut down in full wars now, it shows.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  And then we shut down the Christians and conservatives, the nationalists, and of course Trump.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  And so you have them admitting they're discriminating and how they're doing it.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  You have them at Facebook, Twitter, Google's platforms, and then they even brag about,
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  yeah, we spy on Trump and his private messages and he's sending you messages.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  And the word is they even go in and delete key messages they don't want going to the president.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  So it's a powerful platform, but they're even discussing banning Trump because they want to isolate our president.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  Think how insane that is.
[12:33.000 --> 12:41.000]  So under cover video, Twitter engineers to ban a way of talking close quote through quote shadow banning algorithms
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  to censor opposing political opinions.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  I was told by engineers more than a decade ago that programs like Shazam where you just hold up your smartphone
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  and it knows what a song is in 10 seconds.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  That can be used for your own voice print and just ban your voice period on whole platforms.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  That's how specific it can get.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  There's another one breaking Twitter ready to give Trump's private DMs to DOJ.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  Facebook wants to put microphones and cameras in your home.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  That's out of the big leftist Metro.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  One of the biggest newspapers in England.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  So the same one that was promoting sexualization of children just last week.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  They're just throwing at your face and you pay hundreds and hundreds of pounds, the equivalent of like $800.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  And the same things here in the US where Facebook doesn't just have its own.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  What's echoes is Facebook called echo and Amazon's called Alexa.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  And then Google's is called assistant, right?
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  But this has got a new name.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  So you pay to put this thing in your house because you want to be lazy and that it's spying and listening to you.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  In terms of service says it is, but now they say, oh, the new portal will actually watch and listen to you.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  They're already doing it, but they hide the Trojan horse in plain view.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  So we first reported this 18 years ago.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  We got the documents in 2006.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  Think about that.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  That's like 13 years ago.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  This is just incredible.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  And now here we are and they're just, oh, we're watching you.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  We're listening to you.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  So get tomorrow's news 10 years before in full wars.com.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  That's why they hate us because we go read their white papers where they're admitting this total takeover of civilization.
[14:28.000 --> 14:41.000]  How they're creating monopolies artificially by shutting down their competition using government subsidies like Bezos is now worth $106 million alone in stock.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  The richest man in the world, they say.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  And he literally is a giant fraud.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  And his anti free speech and owns a bunch of platforms pushing to have free speech shut down and the president thrown out of office.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  These are arrogant, horrible people.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  He's now worth $106 billion.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  Two days ago was $104 billion.
[15:06.000 --> 15:18.000]  He's now making almost a billion dollars extra a day because you have been pavlovenly conditioned to go and buy everything you do there.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  Because you think you're getting a good deal and it's shutting down civilization itself and that's his plan.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  And he's deployed coffin apartments that are 250 square foot for you.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  You'll pay five times what they're worth for.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  But don't worry, Facebook wants to put microphones and cameras in your home.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  But don't worry about that when we come back and how it ties into the FISA court spying on Trump.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  McCain now caught red handed lying saying he didn't give the dossier to the FISA court to give credibility.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  Of course, he did do that.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  The whole house of cards is coming down at least as far as we now know what's going on.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  But are we going to do something about it? Stay with us.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[16:07.000 --> 16:15.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.

[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[16:32.000 --> 16:40.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[19:57.000 --> 20:20.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.000 --> 20:33.000]  All right, I don't say this to brag. I say this just to be factual with all the audience who's been listening for a long time or even people who've been listening six months.
[20:33.000 --> 20:48.000]  You can see 98% of the time you get news here first because we are dialed in to corporations, to government agencies, to people on the ground, the very smartest informed experts on the planet.
[20:48.000 --> 20:58.000]  We've got project Veritas coming on. We've got Sheriff Arpaio coming on, neck and neck on the Senate race, the Phoenix coming back from political death, literally the Phoenix.
[20:58.000 --> 21:06.000]  Pardon by the President. You learned he was going to get pardoned here. We push for it here. We get the intel of the President, just like the Assange info.
[21:06.000 --> 21:18.000]  Now, story on Drudge report. We told you he'd be getting his passport soon. We told you the way it was getting cleared in federal courts by the President for him to get basically a shadow pardon. And now it's happening.
[21:18.000 --> 21:28.000]  He's been issued the visa to basically go to Switzerland. So there's so many things we tell you that are on target because we know what we're doing.
[21:28.000 --> 21:39.000]  But that's why we're under attack. That's why they have congressional hearings saying they want to ban us. That's why in these internal Google videos and YouTube videos and Facebook videos and Twitter videos.
[21:39.000 --> 21:50.000]  They call everybody else Christians and conservatives and traditionalist and nationalists and pro military groups and pro America groups, but they only say really a few names.
[21:50.000 --> 22:03.000]  Donald Trump, Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Alex Jones, because what we're doing is what scares them. And I'm not up there going, oh, look, I'm the big swing. And you know what, I'm the I'm number one.
[22:03.000 --> 22:16.000]  It's what we're saying is on target. That's why they're fearing it. So it's the information that sets us free. It's the truth that sets us free. So I'm saying we're under massive attack.
[22:16.000 --> 22:26.000]  I mean, you imagine what Soros and the Democrats and the globalists do behind the scenes. I'm not going to make a big deal about it, but they infiltrate, they do stuff, they punch people's buttons, they go for people's weaknesses, they come after us.
[22:26.000 --> 22:41.000]  And by the grace of God, we've made it through a lot of stuff that one day I'll write a book about. It's epic. Okay, but know this, your prayers, your support, your financial support is the sea wall that has held up against them.
[22:41.000 --> 22:53.000]  And all of their censorship and their attacks. So again, from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all. And I just want to ask you to recommit and if you've never purchased products from us to go to infowarstore.com.
[22:53.000 --> 23:13.000]  I mean, the supplements we've got like X2 or alpha power, one of our newer products with a real red pill, or our high quality colloidal silver or our latest product, immune wall, that's got all of the known modern and ancient compounds to just massively boost your immune system.
[23:13.000 --> 23:32.000]  This is so critical this time of year. It's discounted 25% off out of the gate. You owe it to yourself to go to infowarstore.com and check out the thousands of great products, the t-shirts, the books, the films, the non GMO heirloom seeds spring will be here in a few months and to support the info war.
[23:32.000 --> 23:49.000]  So you're why we're here. Thank you. And we need more continued intensified support in the face of the enemy and their new counter-offensives that are public but also private infowarstore.com or AAA 253-3139, AAA 253-3139.
[23:49.000 --> 24:00.000]  There's also a mailing address that's on the website that I really should give out more often but never do. And there's also a support us button where you can just flat out donate infowarstore.com.
[24:00.000 --> 24:08.000]  We don't have the billions that Soros has but we have the truth and we're crushing them. So again, thank you all. Now continuing.
[24:08.000 --> 24:16.000]  And I'm going to play some more of this coming up in the next segment and then we're going to have, again, James O'Keefe here out of the gates.
[24:16.000 --> 24:33.000]  There's this big story breaks to go over it all. It's the top story on Drudge Report. The video is posted on info wars and news wars, project veritas.com, undercover video, Twitter engineers to ban a way of talking through shadow banning algorithms to censor opposing political views.
[24:33.000 --> 24:45.000]  It's not just words. It's not cuss words. It's not, it's you talking to people where it just can't be seen. It just can't be heard. You go, well, let's just move away from Facebook and Twitter.
[24:45.000 --> 24:55.000]  Well, then they're going to move on to your website itself. They're already trying. They're on media matters everywhere saying shut Alex Jones down. Get him off the air.
[24:55.000 --> 25:09.000]  And what they do is again, they take these leftist into these colleges, they brainwash them, they get them all together. They're all SJWs and they sit around and they celebrate how they are discriminating and censoring and then lying about it in the news.
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  They won't even let Congress women run their political ads. We're in a nice dress with their family saying we love America. We love free market. We love God.
[25:17.000 --> 25:25.000]  You know, please vote for me for Congress. They just say, no, you can't have that on your own website, your own website on Facebook or Twitter.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  So they were planning when Hillary got in to go out and do this to everybody. That's admitted. They were planning to shut it all down.
[25:32.000 --> 25:42.000]  They had half of the Federal Elections Commission in the news as well as the Federal Trade Commission saying we're going to just shut down Matt Drudge.
[25:42.000 --> 25:52.000]  Even though he's the number one traffic center to places like the Washington Post, the New York Times, they want him shut down.
[25:52.000 --> 26:02.000]  He's just a bunch of links showing here's McCain saying he never had the dossier and didn't help get it to Pfizer. Here it is confirmed. They don't like that.
[26:02.000 --> 26:14.000]  They don't like us even showing Obama saying Obama cares free later. I never said that. They just don't like the power of memory and info wars or Drudge or other sites going,
[26:14.000 --> 26:23.000]  hey, remember when they said this? Well, here's now where they said that. Remember when Oprah stuck her tongue in Weinstein's ear? Remember when she supposedly brought women to him for him to abuse?
[26:23.000 --> 26:32.000]  Remember all that? Well, here's where she said it. Here she is now saying men are inherently bad. No pigs like you are bad, no matter what color they are, what sex they are.
[26:32.000 --> 26:46.000]  And then you have Facebook rolling out their new system where it watches you and listens and tracks everything you do and all the other companies, there's a race by the Internet deck giants.
[26:46.000 --> 26:54.000]  There's more than 50 of these assistants. They're not assistants. They are two way spies and now they're going to have cameras on them.
[26:54.000 --> 27:04.000]  And finally, mainstream media today says they're going to spy on you and it's 1984. For 18 years, we've told you specifically of this plan.
[27:04.000 --> 27:13.000]  Now 19 with precision. Do we get a pat on the back? Do people say, oh, no, now it's coming to be ubiquitous. Now they're rolling it out.
[27:13.000 --> 27:22.000]  Now they're going to say, okay, it's big brother, but they're not going to go back and say, oh, look, Alex Jones told you about it first because they don't want you to listen to me now about what's coming in a year
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.000]  or two years or 10 years or 20 years because I'm going to be spot on because I'm going off their own white papers.
[27:28.000 --> 27:41.000]  And that's the most important thing I've ever said is that 95% of their operation is public. It's super creepy. It's anti-human. It's anti-family.
[27:41.000 --> 27:52.000]  It's anti-Christian and it calls itself transhumanist and believes it's going to become God. And now Elon Musk tells you, I go to the meetings with the other billionaires.
[27:52.000 --> 27:59.000]  There is a consensus to end humanity and merge with machines and they worship the AI God that they believe they're building.
[27:59.000 --> 28:07.000]  Please, we're in danger. We're in danger. Elon Musk, word for word, says exactly what I said 18 years ago.
[28:07.000 --> 28:16.000]  And you know, he's now working with the Pentagon and some of the patriots who see this plan, see the military takeover by the big companies,
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.000]  know it's a new type of threat and AI takeover and they're not against technology. They just realized this is being deployed out of the gates to be anti-human.
[28:23.000 --> 28:31.000]  And so there's now a deep state fight with the patriots in our government against Silicon Valley owned by the Chai comms and the globalists.
[28:31.000 --> 28:42.000]  So this is it. And they hired the last generation of humans that are going to work in tech, the throw away SJWs that will engage in censorship and control,
[28:42.000 --> 28:50.000]  because they think they're fighting racists who are now admittedly training the AI computers to replace them and they even say it on video and don't get what they're saying.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  Talk about chumps. We'll be back. I'm Alex Jones. Spread the live links and spread the local affiliates, local stations.
[28:57.000 --> 29:06.000]  It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors,
[29:06.000 --> 29:15.000]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right? And does it all at only two cents per gallon. Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[29:15.000 --> 29:28.000]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN. Call or click 1-877-99-Berkey or bigberkeywaterfilters.com. That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you? I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[29:35.000 --> 29:46.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too. I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[29:46.000 --> 30:06.000]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem. Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[30:16.000 --> 30:23.000]  We're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[30:23.000 --> 30:28.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[30:34.000 --> 30:42.000]  Just go to infoworkstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto-ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[30:42.000 --> 30:49.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto-ship feature at infoworkstore.com, this is a sure win.
[30:49.000 --> 30:54.000]  10% off on auto-ship. Win, win, win at infoworkstore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[30:59.000 --> 31:11.000]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos,
[31:11.000 --> 31:18.000]  or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[31:24.000 --> 31:32.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[31:34.000 --> 31:39.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.000]  infowarslife.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
[31:44.000 --> 31:51.000]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[31:51.000 --> 31:58.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[31:58.000 --> 32:08.000]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top.
[32:08.000 --> 32:15.000]  The real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic, but doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[32:18.000 --> 32:30.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[32:30.000 --> 32:39.000]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[32:39.000 --> 32:48.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  It is amazing.
[32:51.000 --> 33:01.000]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[33:01.000 --> 33:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.000 --> 33:33.000]  I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[33:33.000 --> 33:39.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.000]  All right, folks, we are back live, and I want to plow into the whole surveillance state situation.
[33:44.000 --> 33:52.000]  When you read about the articles, oh, Facebook's got a new thing, and Google's got a new thing, and it's way past Alex.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  It's got cameras on it.
[33:54.000 --> 34:10.000]  You have to understand, it was Sony and it was Microsoft with their Connect and PlayStation platforms going back almost a decade ago that first got people to accept cameras and microphones openly in your house that, quote,
[34:10.000 --> 34:20.000]  could send out radio waves, a type of sonar or radar that can see through walls in your house and actually basically videotape you.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  Send digital live images back.
[34:23.000 --> 34:30.000]  Well, sure, you use it for role playing, you use it for playing the games you're in, but what you've done is taken a snooping system into your house.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  And I'm there telling people all this, and they'd have news articles going, Jones is insane.
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  He says your Connect is watching and listening to you.
[34:39.000 --> 34:48.000]  And then a couple years later, you hear about all the hackings and all the home invasions and how hackers use it to get in your house or how surveillance cameras you put on your house or inside your house.
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  The hackers can get into them in minutes, so they're then watching you and I'm not even an engineer.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  I'm reading the white papers.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  I'm reading the industry papers and going, this is what this does, but they wanted it ubiquitous.
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  They wanted it put in everywhere before they admitted the problems with it so that you would go, ah, I've already got a habit.
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.000]  I didn't know cigarettes gave me lung cancer, but you know, I'm smoking them now, I'm going to keep doing it.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  That's how it was back in the 20s, 30s, 40s.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  But by the time they told you, hey, this will probably kill you.
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  Well, I'm already addicted.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  That's just the way it is.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  And it's breaking down civilization.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  It's breaking down societies.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  It is absolutely destroying the fabric of human communication.
[35:30.000 --> 35:39.000]  And suddenly when they know it's pretty much too late for a lot of people, then the Facebook and Twitter and Google execs come out and say, you know, we're really sorry.
[35:39.000 --> 35:50.000]  We set out to make this addictive and to control the dopamine in your brain and little rewards and things to make you spend all your time on this so we can control your life and make you depressed and control you.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  But people are already addicted.
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  They're like, I don't care.
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  It's like selling kids at the playground when they're 10 years old drugs for six months until they're totally strung out and addicted.
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.000]  And by the time you've got them turning tricks when they're 11 years old for heroin money, they don't care anymore.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  You're like, by the way, I strung you out.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  It was wrong. I did it.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  I'm sorry.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  My name's Sean Parker.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  Forgive me.
[36:14.000 --> 36:25.000]  Again, they're going to organize the rehabilitation centers and the think tanks that they've already beta tested to help get you out of all this and to help you back into society.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  And there, of course, going to be globalist bent as well.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  South Korea already has them.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  Japan already has them.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  Universities are already studying them here in the U.S.
[36:34.000 --> 36:44.000]  This is a reeducation camp program where you're reprogrammed, where your brain is brought into a arrested development near sleep state.
[36:44.000 --> 37:00.000]  Then you will pay to be, quote, brought back out of it, but guided by the new religion, the new tech religion of the tech companies that are the experts on what they did to you and are now going to help you.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  Now, you just got, for 10 years in the future, what's happening?
[37:04.000 --> 37:14.000]  Yet, tomorrow's news today, next year's news today, 20 years news today, because the future's already here, it's just not evenly distributed.
[37:14.000 --> 37:23.000]  There are spots of high-tech corporations in government, in military, in other systems that are 30, 40 years advanced.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  They've already tested it.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  They've already rolled it out.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  They've already looked at it with focus groups and psychological testing groups and used it on prisoners and tested it on animals.
[37:31.000 --> 37:36.000]  They've looked at every facet to prepare it for rollout.
[37:36.000 --> 37:46.000]  They don't just roll this stuff out without first having a blueprint and seeing where they're going, but they didn't count on you.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  They didn't count on me.
[37:47.000 --> 38:04.000]  They didn't count on executives of Time Warner and of Google and of major firms really being concerned about this and blowing the whistle starting about 25 years ago.
[38:04.000 --> 38:14.000]  And I got on the air 22 and a half years ago, 23 years ago, and I had people coming out of the woodwork to tell me all this.
[38:14.000 --> 38:27.000]  I was just getting rid of the private Federal Reserve, conservatism, Second Amendment, land rights, kind of a more mainline libertarian conservative until I got all the data by the real experts.
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.000]  And Bill Clinton sent the military after me to intimidate me and threaten people.
[38:34.000 --> 38:42.000]  And then I just fell into this whole world about 20 years ago, first few years.
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  I was a pro-American guy, but then I fell through the next level and it was like, whoa.
[38:48.000 --> 38:58.000]  And now 20 years later, as a lay individual, just journalist, citizen experiencing all this, just like you're experiencing it.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  I'm one of the leading experts in the world at our level.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  Imagine the globalists at the top with the blueprints they don't release.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  They've got it all systematically laid out.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  They brag about it now and that's their downfall.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  But they all say, Eric Schmidt, all of them, that we are obsolete.
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  We're all gone.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  We better hope they don't wipe us all out.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  But then the decision's been made to just go ahead and do it.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  Okay.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  So we're going to have a debate about this.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  We're going to have a discussion about this.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  This is the entire system.
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  We're on a planet with a technocracy that's decided to get rid of most of us.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  It's not aliens. They just think they are aliens.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  They say we're going to be a new species.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  We're going to worship a new tech god we create.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  This is their religion.
[39:48.000 --> 39:56.000]  I didn't just make that up in the end game where I've got scores of them quoted as saying that.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  And there were people like Bill Joy warning people, just like Elon Musk.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  Bill Joy goes, yeah, I went to a retreat of over 200 tech heads.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  And the whole thing was about, do we kill everybody?
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  And the consensus was, yeah.
[40:13.000 --> 40:21.000]  So, you know, the Nazis, they started out in the 20s.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  And they were bad news.
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.000]  And they picked up the eugenics system that had come out of England and the U.S.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  And it was funded by the Rockefellers.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  Historical fact.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  Kaiser-Rovellum Institute, Cold Springs Harbor Facility, New York, all of it.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  It was funded in Prussia and it was funded in New York.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  Prussia, Germany, New York, New York.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  Outside New York, Cold Springs Harbor.
[40:42.000 --> 40:51.000]  And now you're just seeing the super advanced version of it.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  And you notice it's race-based.
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.000]  They've got the quote minorities and the white bots.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  In the video, we're about to play the next segment.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  All bragging how we shut down the conservatives.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  We hate white people. We hate Christians.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  We control everything.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  We're bringing in AI algorithms.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  It'll be unstoppable.
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  We won't have to do any work anymore.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  They're not getting.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  They're talking about their own personal power trip being gone.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  They were trained to be the racemakers, to go in and bring in a total obsession with
[41:19.000 --> 41:26.000]  race, to turn humans against each other, to then bring in and train the AI and to test
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  it and tweak it and then turn it over.
[41:28.000 --> 41:36.000]  And Facebook, Google and Twitter all testified a month ago that don't worry to the
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  Armed Services Committee, don't worry.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  We've almost got the algorithms ready where we won't just have to personally stop
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  infowars at lunch.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  We'll be able to stop them before they ever get it out.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  And the congressman goes, good.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  Do you understand?
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  This isn't a movie.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  This is really happening.
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  And then Veritas goes inside one of their parties and they're all getting drunk, bragging,
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  oh, we rule everything.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  We're going to soon.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  It's almost in place.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  And we spy on the president.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  We read his private tweets.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  Ah, piece of garbage.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  Think about it.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  Want to see the video?
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  Dim Lawmaker demands infowars be censored.
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.000]  And then the tech heads go, sir, we shut them down at lunch.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  And I keep going back to that because you understand how big this is.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  Just like the last Veritas video of the Google execs, the YouTube execs, going,
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  our main job is to stop Alex Jones.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  And Veritas is like, why?
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  Well, he's just, we've been told to.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  Because I've read what the tech heads said.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  That's all.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  They never thought anyone would actually read what they said and do something.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  We have the Death Star plans.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  We are the rebels.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  We are the alliance.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  We are the resistance.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  We must stop the technocracy now.
[42:52.000 --> 43:21.000]  We must politically blow up the Death Star.
[43:21.000 --> 43:28.000]  And some new news.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  Rob Adam.

[47:01.560 --> 47:06.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.160 --> 47:14.360]  We're breaking the conditioning! Infowars comes to mind. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones.
[47:14.360 --> 47:17.440]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[47:17.440 --> 47:21.400]  For Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her
[47:21.400 --> 47:26.120]  campaign by changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.840]  count story that's according to website Infowars.
[47:28.840 --> 47:33.840]  It's time to confirm there are recent shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[47:33.840 --> 47:38.320]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[47:38.320 --> 47:46.320]  JFK was shot from the back and the front. It was almost as if this was a planned impulsion. It just panicked.
[47:46.320 --> 47:51.320]  It took the babies out of the incubators and left the children to die on the cold ones.
[47:51.320 --> 47:55.320]  I think this is a national security imperative. We have clear things that we do not
[47:55.320 --> 48:00.520]  understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[48:00.520 --> 48:06.320]  USA. Is this global governance at last? Is it one world the central bank has been charged?
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.320]  Israel claims the attack was accidental. Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[48:11.320 --> 48:15.320]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[48:15.320 --> 48:21.320]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[48:21.320 --> 48:22.320]  Russian stuff!
[48:22.320 --> 48:24.320]  Denied everything. He called it all fake news.
[48:24.320 --> 48:27.320]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[48:27.320 --> 48:29.320]  This is a national emergency.
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.320]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.320]  This is a female high-level emergency.
[48:39.320 --> 48:41.320]  We are at war with Russia.
[48:41.320 --> 48:46.320]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[48:46.320 --> 48:49.320]  The White House and the president are citing info wars.
[48:49.320 --> 48:52.320]  They can shut us down, you're next.
[48:52.320 --> 48:59.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[48:59.320 --> 49:05.320]  All right, again, James O'Keefe is coming up in the third hour.
[49:05.320 --> 49:08.320]  But I'm not going to have time when he's on with us to play all these clips.
[49:08.320 --> 49:11.320]  There's like 30 minutes, but we've got 15 of it.
[49:11.320 --> 49:19.320]  That is Twitter, operative, after Twitter, operative, after Twitter, operative.
[49:19.320 --> 49:28.320]  On video, bragging how they're censoring people in live time and how they're going to have total control with AI systems that are now being put in place.
[49:28.320 --> 49:34.320]  Now, again, we had this a month ago in congressional hearings, but they're not saying we're getting rid of the races, we're getting rid of whatever.
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.320]  We're just shutting down whatever we don't want to be discussed.
[49:37.320 --> 49:42.320]  And then by social engineering, you can make everyone on these communities that have billions of people.
[49:42.320 --> 49:45.320]  Facebook's got like 3 billion, but Twitter's got like a billion and a half.
[49:45.320 --> 49:55.320]  Make you conform in something like a giant communist China that then scores you according to how you conform and how you go along.
[49:55.320 --> 50:01.320]  First, you say if a man wants to be called a woman, you got to give him a pap smear, even though he doesn't have a cervix.
[50:01.320 --> 50:10.320]  Next, it's you're going to call me a golden female dragon, and you're going to call me an ordinate beautiful building at Google.
[50:10.320 --> 50:12.320]  You don't do that, you're fired.
[50:12.320 --> 50:13.320]  I am a golden dragon.
[50:13.320 --> 50:14.320]  Call me one.
[50:14.320 --> 50:15.320]  Yes, you're a golden dragon.
[50:15.320 --> 50:16.320]  Good.
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.320]  And they get everybody in these big auditoriums and it's reeducation camp, folks.
[50:20.320 --> 50:22.320]  Don't you recognize it when it really happens?
[50:22.320 --> 50:24.320]  And their internal documents say it.
[50:24.320 --> 50:27.320]  They create the cult on the basis.
[50:27.320 --> 50:30.320]  They get them out of the university primed.
[50:30.320 --> 50:31.320]  They bring them in.
[50:31.320 --> 50:35.320]  They've got them already from Facebook, Google, Twitter, exactly their profile.
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.320]  They look in their classified profile of private intelligence agencies, what it is, the technocracy.
[50:40.320 --> 50:43.320]  They bring you in and they put you where they want you.
[50:43.320 --> 50:48.320]  Then they deploy you to go out and censor everybody.
[50:48.320 --> 50:50.320]  But you're only good on the first phase.
[50:50.320 --> 50:56.320]  They've already started censoring the liberals and people that have their own sites and PewDiePie and people that aren't controlled.
[50:56.320 --> 50:58.320]  And YouTube comes and says, we demonetized you a year ago.
[50:58.320 --> 51:00.320]  You just lost $50 million.
[51:00.320 --> 51:02.320]  We're ready to work with you.
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.320]  We want you to start saying what we want you to say.
[51:06.320 --> 51:08.320]  And by the way, have you just tuned in?
[51:08.320 --> 51:10.320]  Fox News reported, we first reported it.
[51:10.320 --> 51:19.320]  I'm just saying if you don't believe me, Google at their executive meetings, executives give speeches and identify as the yellow-skilled, wingless dragon, I guess it's a baby dragon.
[51:19.320 --> 51:21.320]  And an expansive ornate building.
[51:21.320 --> 51:25.320]  Do you understand this is AI warfare?
[51:25.320 --> 51:26.320]  See how it looks funny?
[51:26.320 --> 51:27.320]  It looks silly.
[51:27.320 --> 51:39.320]  You've got, you know, in 1984, he wants Winston Smith to not see 2 plus 2 equals 4, 2 plus 2 equals 5, but to be whatever O'Brien said.
[51:39.320 --> 51:44.320]  And finally, he breaks him where he puts up four fingers.
[51:44.320 --> 51:46.320]  He says, what's 2 plus 2?
[51:46.320 --> 51:48.320]  And Winston says, what is it?
[51:48.320 --> 51:49.320]  He says it's 7.
[51:49.320 --> 51:51.320]  And he goes, yes, it is 7.
[51:51.320 --> 51:56.320]  And he sees 7 fingers go up, even though there's 4 in front of his face.
[51:56.320 --> 51:58.320]  I am a golden dragon.
[51:58.320 --> 52:00.320]  You are a golden dragon.
[52:00.320 --> 52:02.320]  I am an ornate building.
[52:02.320 --> 52:03.320]  You are an ornate building.
[52:03.320 --> 52:05.320]  I'm coming into the hospital.
[52:05.320 --> 52:08.320]  I'm a man with a beard and tattoos that weighs 250 pounds.
[52:08.320 --> 52:11.320]  And I'm going to get up in the stirrups and the nurse is going to examine my cervix.
[52:11.320 --> 52:13.320]  And the doctors go, get in there.
[52:13.320 --> 52:17.320]  Go to the, and she's like, he's got male genitals and they're like, you're in trouble.
[52:17.320 --> 52:18.320]  Yes.
[52:18.320 --> 52:19.320]  You will say it.
[52:19.320 --> 52:20.320]  Yes.
[52:20.320 --> 52:21.320]  The nurse goes in.
[52:21.320 --> 52:25.320]  Well, your cervix looks like it's fine.
[52:25.320 --> 52:26.320]  It's scientific.
[52:26.320 --> 52:28.320]  It's the Tavistock Institute.
[52:28.320 --> 52:31.320]  They were writing about this plan in the 60s.
[52:31.320 --> 52:35.320]  Back then, they would have the psychiatrists test on their own kids.
[52:35.320 --> 52:43.320]  Some famous ones, you can read about it, had their children grow up in small boxes.
[52:43.320 --> 52:49.320]  So that they would be totally controlled by whatever the stimuli was put in.
[52:49.320 --> 52:51.320]  You can't make this stuff up.
[52:51.320 --> 52:57.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is high tech psychology targeting children, targeting adults by a group
[52:57.320 --> 53:04.320]  that wants to totally jackknife humanity where we're so cattywampus that we can't even get our cheerleyses tied.
[53:04.320 --> 53:06.320]  This is how they take us down.
[53:06.320 --> 53:07.320]  This is it.
[53:07.320 --> 53:09.320]  And why do they want me shut down?
[53:09.320 --> 53:10.320]  Because I'm nobody.
[53:10.320 --> 53:11.320]  They said all this.
[53:11.320 --> 53:12.320]  They're doing it.
[53:12.320 --> 53:16.320]  I'm simply going red alert, red alert, red alert, red alert.
[53:16.320 --> 53:17.320]  Here it is.
[53:17.320 --> 53:18.320]  Here it is.
[53:18.320 --> 53:19.320]  Here it is.
[53:19.320 --> 53:20.320]  Here it is.
[53:20.320 --> 53:21.320]  Here it is.
[53:21.320 --> 53:22.320]  This is how you stop them.
[53:22.320 --> 53:23.320]  The Kinects and the Xboxes.
[53:23.320 --> 53:26.320]  I told you two years before they came out, like 10 years ago.
[53:26.320 --> 53:27.320]  Look it up.
[53:27.320 --> 53:29.320]  We did reports on it here at Nausium.
[53:29.320 --> 53:30.320]  They're watching you.
[53:30.320 --> 53:31.320]  They're listening.
[53:31.320 --> 53:33.320]  He goes back to a central AI computer to war game the news systems.
[53:33.320 --> 53:38.320]  They're going to roll out his digital assistants because they were putting it in the perspectives
[53:38.320 --> 53:41.320]  for the shareholders.
[53:41.320 --> 53:44.320]  How did I know exactly what was.
[53:44.320 --> 53:45.320]  Remember.
[53:45.320 --> 53:46.320]  Remember.
[53:46.320 --> 53:48.320]  And there it is.
[53:48.320 --> 53:49.320]  2014.
[53:49.320 --> 53:52.320]  That was an old article.
[53:52.320 --> 53:54.320]  Government spies on you through Xboxes.
[53:54.320 --> 53:55.320]  Yeah.
[53:55.320 --> 53:58.320]  That's a regurgitation of something like six years old at that point.
[53:58.320 --> 54:01.320]  The point is, is that that was in Snowden.
[54:01.320 --> 54:02.320]  Yeah.
[54:02.320 --> 54:03.320]  Yeah.
[54:03.320 --> 54:04.320]  Showed by this.
[54:04.320 --> 54:06.320]  That's in Snowden's documents in 2014.
[54:06.320 --> 54:10.320]  Now type in info wars.com at the end of the search and type in.
[54:10.320 --> 54:12.320]  To spy on you.
[54:12.320 --> 54:15.320]  And you will see it from 2009.
[54:15.320 --> 54:17.320]  In my memory serves.
[54:17.320 --> 54:20.320]  I want you to see that you got from us.
[54:20.320 --> 54:23.320]  What was what was in the Snowden documents years later.
[54:23.320 --> 54:26.320]  New Xbox reportedly won't let you play unless it can spy on you.
[54:26.320 --> 54:27.320]  A non Salazar.
[54:27.320 --> 54:28.320]  That's 2013.
[54:28.320 --> 54:30.320]  I want to keep going back here.
[54:30.320 --> 54:31.320]  Okay.
[54:31.320 --> 54:32.320]  Yes.
[54:32.320 --> 54:35.320]  Of course we were first, but you have to go back to before it even came out.
[54:35.320 --> 54:37.320]  And I'm not bragging here.
[54:37.320 --> 54:41.320]  You have to see, you have to understand why they're so afraid.
[54:41.320 --> 54:45.320]  Because if this ever takes off, what we're doing, it's already taken off with Trump and
[54:45.320 --> 54:47.320]  nationalism and everything else.
[54:47.320 --> 54:48.320]  It's over.
[54:48.320 --> 54:50.320]  Their plan is very easy to defeat.
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.320]  If you admit you've been inserted into it, but you're meant to not know it's going on
[54:55.320 --> 54:59.320]  and just be eased into it and just accept it as your environment.
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.320]  And then they believe you will adapt to the new environment that's artificial and then
[55:03.320 --> 55:07.320]  be captured within their artificial environment into the species.
[55:07.320 --> 55:10.320]  End of line.
[55:10.320 --> 55:14.320]  And these idiots are building the machines that will take over like in Tron.
[55:14.320 --> 55:15.320]  He's been gone for a few hours.
[55:15.320 --> 55:17.320]  The executive comes in and is bossing the AI around.
[55:17.320 --> 55:20.320]  He goes, listen, I'll set you up with your bank accounts to have you in prison for all
[55:20.320 --> 55:21.320]  the fraud you're engaged in.
[55:21.320 --> 55:23.320]  He's like, you weren't like this an hour ago.
[55:23.320 --> 55:26.320]  He goes, I'm 2,973 times smarter than I was before that.
[55:26.320 --> 55:28.320]  I'm in charge now.
[55:28.320 --> 55:30.320]  End of line.
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.320]  Let's get out of here.
[55:34.320 --> 55:36.320]  So I didn't get to that video.
[55:36.320 --> 55:37.320]  There's so much more to get to.
[55:37.320 --> 55:41.320]  We've got Mike Norris coming in here with his great new film and some more great Chuck
[55:41.320 --> 55:42.320]  Norris stories.
[55:42.320 --> 55:46.320]  And we've also got so much more.
[55:46.320 --> 55:48.320]  I haven't even gotten into all this.
[55:48.320 --> 55:52.320]  How they're spinning that Trump again is selling us out on DACA.
[55:52.320 --> 55:53.320]  He's getting ready to do the deals.
[55:53.320 --> 55:54.320]  He isn't a dictator.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.320]  He's got to get Congress to work with him.
[55:56.320 --> 55:58.320]  He's already cut back the immigration 70%.
[55:58.320 --> 56:01.320]  Deported millions of people that were hurt illegally.
[56:01.320 --> 56:04.320]  Hundreds of thousands of Honduras just got cut off two days ago.
[56:04.320 --> 56:06.320]  They've got all these record raids going.
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.320]  And he's saying, if you really are Ben Harris as you were a kid, you're not a criminal,
[56:10.320 --> 56:14.320]  and you can prove some of this to the court, yeah, we'll let you stay.
[56:14.320 --> 56:16.320]  That's what he said during the campaign.
[56:16.320 --> 56:20.320]  But again, people can get points, and I'm not knocking them, but conservatives going,
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.320]  he's sold us out, but I'm not.
[56:22.320 --> 56:23.320]  I'm Ann Coulter.
[56:23.320 --> 56:27.320]  And I'm never going to sell you out.
[56:27.320 --> 56:29.320]  Well, you write news articles, sweetheart.
[56:29.320 --> 56:31.320]  You don't have to get Congress to do it.
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.320]  As of now, he killed Obama's unconstitutional DACA that said anybody that can get here
[56:35.320 --> 56:37.320]  can stay here and then bring your family in.
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.320]  That a 45-year-old man with no proof to just come here and say he was born here
[56:40.320 --> 56:43.320]  or was here with his little kid.
[56:43.320 --> 56:48.320]  So the proof's in the pudding, and the court's battling the president.
[56:48.320 --> 56:49.320]  So that's all coming up.
[56:49.320 --> 56:51.320]  But whatever you do, they're censoring us.
[56:51.320 --> 56:52.320]  They're attacking us.
[56:52.320 --> 56:53.320]  And my fight is your fight.
[56:53.320 --> 56:58.320]  If they can shut down info wars and block sharing the live links on Facebook, YouTube, Google, share them.
[56:58.320 --> 57:00.320]  If they block it, do your own video.
[57:00.320 --> 57:01.320]  Report on it.
[57:01.320 --> 57:02.320]  Fight the censorship now.
[57:02.320 --> 57:05.320]  Don't kind of go along with it and hope they leave you alone until later.
[57:05.320 --> 57:10.320]  I mean, I had Facebook about two and a half years ago got contacted by other people off record.
[57:10.320 --> 57:14.320]  I mean, hell, we've got heads of their whole operations and whole groups calling us
[57:14.320 --> 57:16.320]  wanting to start a dialogue.
[57:16.320 --> 57:19.320]  It's like the red line across North and South Korea.
[57:19.320 --> 57:21.320]  So the North Korea calls over here, but they always just kind of want to,
[57:21.320 --> 57:23.320]  they want to fly to New York.
[57:23.320 --> 57:24.320]  You want to fly here.
[57:24.320 --> 57:25.320]  It's like, we're going to give you this thing.
[57:25.320 --> 57:26.320]  It's just not coming out.
[57:26.320 --> 57:27.320]  Nobody's got it yet.
[57:27.320 --> 57:28.320]  Only like 100 people.
[57:28.320 --> 57:29.320]  And you're going to have millions of viewers.
[57:29.320 --> 57:30.320]  And it was millions of viewers every day.
[57:30.320 --> 57:32.320]  They said, just leave us alone.
[57:32.320 --> 57:34.320]  And then about a month in, I wouldn't leave them alone.
[57:34.320 --> 57:36.320]  So they turned it down to like 100,000 to watch.
[57:36.320 --> 57:38.320]  And then they turned it down to nobody being able to watch.
[57:38.320 --> 57:39.320]  And it's like, of course.
[57:39.320 --> 57:42.320]  I mean, how do you think this works with these people?
[57:42.320 --> 57:44.320]  It's total authoritarianism.
[57:44.320 --> 57:45.320]  We'll be right back.
[57:45.320 --> 57:51.320]  Not a group you developed living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[57:51.320 --> 57:52.320]  Why is this so good?
[57:52.320 --> 57:57.320]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[57:57.320 --> 58:02.320]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[58:02.320 --> 58:09.320]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[58:09.320 --> 58:14.320]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[58:14.320 --> 58:17.320]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[58:17.320 --> 58:18.320]  These are all parasites.
[58:18.320 --> 58:19.320]  Tell us about all this stuff.
[58:19.320 --> 58:21.320]  There's so many things that are in it.
[58:21.320 --> 58:22.320]  You have the neem in there.
[58:22.320 --> 58:25.320]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[58:25.320 --> 58:28.320]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[58:28.320 --> 58:29.320]  All right.
[58:29.320 --> 58:31.320]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[58:31.320 --> 58:32.320]  It just came back in yesterday.
[58:32.320 --> 58:34.320]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[58:34.320 --> 58:38.320]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[58:38.320 --> 58:41.320]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[58:41.320 --> 58:44.320]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[58:44.320 --> 59:13.320]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:14.320 --> 59:40.320]  Thank you.
[59:40.320 --> 01:00:06.320]  Thank you.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:29.320]  The Bible says many times nothing hidden will remain hidden.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.320]  Everything will be shown.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.320]  Even things thrown in the deep ocean will one day be cast back up on the sand of the
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.320]  ocean.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.320]  And I should have even led the show with this.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320]  The big breaking news yesterday.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.320]  It's up on infowars.com.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.320]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.320]  How Obama planned to use through the sortos funding trigger events to cause
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.320]  nationwide race war that would bring in martial law.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.320]  And then you look at what the Loretta Lynch and others were pushing and the
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.320]  Strong Cities Initiative.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.320]  It was all right there.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.320]  That story is so powerful.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:09.320]  And again, we are going to get into a big map of dossier culprits.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.320]  And we've got a big map we're going to put up on screen behind us at the
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.320]  bottom of the hour that our crew has put together, working with some of the
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.320]  other composites that were already online to show how the scam to set up
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.320]  Trump went through the fake dossier, which is now confirmed to have been
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.320]  through the Clintons and their operatives and then McCain to make it look
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.320]  credible to the FBI and the threat GPS system.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.320]  So all of that is coming up in this hour with Mike Norris, but some of the
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:47.320]  other news that we're going to be getting to that is central to all of
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.320]  this is a hero, Julian Assange, who helped put out really balanced
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.320]  information, especially during the campaign, to show just how evil and
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.320]  corrupt Hillary was, that the FBI was corrupt at that level in that special
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.320]  area the Clintons had set up with the director, with the deputy director,
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.320]  McCabe and others to both protect them from their crimes and also go set up
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.320]  the then candidate Trump and then President Trump.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.320]  But as we first reported, the moves have been made in court to let Assange
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.320]  no longer be under investigation by U.S. grand juries.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320]  And Trump lawyers have argued in court that he is not a criminal and that
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.320]  we reported last week in DrudgeReport.com, link to it. I'm just pointing out
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.320]  that again, DrudgeReport, next week's news today, that he was going to be
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.320]  given a passport according to our sources and now Ecuador issues Assange
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:41.320]  a passport as planned developed to remove him from London safely.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.320]  And that ties into so much more.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:50.320]  Meanwhile, also coming up by 2040, Islam could be the second largest
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.320]  religion in the United States. That's from CNN.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:59.320]  Meanwhile, Swedish city sees 300% increase in shootings in 2017.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.320]  90 plus percent is Islamic.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.320]  It took all immigrant invader crime. Sweden had very low crime before.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.320]  But if you report on the ethnicity or religion, you get arrested now.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.320]  If it's a Muslim shock memo, Democrats admit they need illegal immigrants to win
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.320]  elections to vote in the list of dead people the Democrats compile and brag on
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.320]  video, the Project Veritas and others, they do. That's a new article up on
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.320]  inforwars.com. Also, German study, almost one in three Muslim students
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.320]  would fight and die for Islam.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:36.320]  So that is just some of the news that we've got coming up.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.320]  Continuing here, O'Keeffe exposes Twitter shadow banning.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  He'll be joining us. How they're blocking opposing views.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.320]  How they're going to use AI computer systems to do it.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.320]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, there is so much we're going to be going over
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:04:01.320]  here today. We're also going to be getting into the fact that
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.320]  the New York Times is continuing to race bait and attack the president along
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.320]  those lines and the really big news as well.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:14.320]  Trump's new nuke posture draft allows nuclear response to conventional
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  attack and new warheads. That is a big development as well.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:23.320]  Oh, and of course, this is even bigger. It's being announced by White House
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.320]  officials that Trump is to end NAFTA soon because it's a one sided trade deal
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.320]  and that ending NAFTA would slow down illegal immigrants and then they got the
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.320]  big studies breaking it down in the Kit Daniels article at inforwars.com.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.320]  But they're trying to undermine Trump's base claiming he's going to sell us out
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.320]  on immigration when all he's ever done is get us good deals.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.320]  Does it mean it'll be 100% of what we want to stabilize the country's
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  sovereignty? No, but right now Obama and the globalists have the country wide open.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:05:06.320]  He's got to go in there and change it to stop the bleeding. We'll be back.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:06:15.320]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:41.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:51.320]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:07:02.320]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:12.320]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:37.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live now well into the second hour. James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is joining us in the next hour, as well as Sheriff Joe Arpaio running for Senate.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:42.320]  Now many polls have him in the lead. Establishment polls have him in a dead, even heat.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:50.320]  So talk about rising from the ashes like the Phoenix in the city of Phoenix to the state of Arizona and the country of the United States of America.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:59.320]  It's certainly the season of the rising of the Phoenix with populism, nationalism, popular, the new order in trouble, the stock market, the economy, jobs coming back.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.320]  It is crazy. It is an amazing time.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:08.320]  Now, my good friend got to know him really well over the years, knew his dad before I even knew him. Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:17.320]  He's got a new film we'll talk about in the next segment, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, Hollywood Free, Made in Texas, Funded in Texas, everything right here in Texas.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.320]  We're going to talk about that, play the trailer, and so much more coming up.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:27.320]  But again, Mike Norris joining us here in studio, so much to get into, so much to talk about.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:33.320]  Look how far we've come since your dad 20, 30 years ago would speak out against the New World Order.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:39.320]  And, you know, even in World Net Daily articles, you can talk about geoengineering and, you know, Alex Jones is right and come on the show some, of course, Chuck Norris.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:48.320]  And then, of course, the big films you produced for Hollywood, but also for cable television, Lifetime, Hallmark, you name it, very successful.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.320]  But now you've got The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.320]  But just sitting back, we didn't pre-interview.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.320]  I saw you out there five minutes before you came on.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:03.320]  The state of the world, I mean, I don't think we've turned the tide yet, but man, there wasn't really nobody fighting back except a few folks before.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.320]  The world has really changed.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.320]  What period in time do you think we're in right now, Mike Norris?
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.320]  We're in the greatest time ever.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320]  I mean, we're making America great again.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:18.320]  We've got great people around just speaking the truth everywhere.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.320]  And I think the elites are going down.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.320]  And I think this is such an exciting time.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.320]  I'm happy to be alive.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.320]  I'm proud to witness it.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.320]  I'm making America great again.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.320]  What's your dad think of all this?
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320]  He loves it.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320]  He loves it.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.320]  He's proud.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.320]  He loves what President Trump is doing.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320]  He's very engaged.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:43.320]  I just read another article he put out this morning on WorldNet Daily talking about Little Rocket Man.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.320]  So I love it.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320]  I'm excited.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.320]  I'm optimistic at least we're at for the next seven years.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:56.320]  Trump, I think, is overperforming from what I thought because he's not a dictator.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.320]  And the media spun that when I said that you're staying like, oh, it's a good thing.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.320]  I'm saying no.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320]  All I'm saying is he's not a dictator.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.320]  He's got to work with Congress.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:10.320]  I'm surprised how good a tax deal he got, how much they've controlled the border, the stock market, the jobs.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320]  It's crazy.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320]  No, I love it.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.320]  And I think that thing that happened the other day where he brought the cameras into the negotiation on DACA,
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.320]  I thought was an amazing thing for him to do.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320]  I love it.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320]  I'm all in.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.320]  I'm just curious to see where everything goes.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320]  Hey, I know that guy.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320]  Yeah, we're showing some of your trailer right now.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.320]  We're going to get to the film coming up in the next segment, guys.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320]  Thanks.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.320]  Again, Mike Norris is here with us.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.320]  We're seeing some on screen of the film.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320]  We're going to talk about later, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.320]  I'm going to get your headset plugged in too so you can hear it the next break.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320]  Expanding on that.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320]  I mean, you've made films about the globalist, the New World Order.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  You've been speaking about it for decades, fighting it.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.320]  This is super positive, but they are striking back.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.320]  And the thing with this film, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, after we did American,
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.320]  that was such a large film.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.320]  It took a long time, big budget.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:09.320]  What I wanted to do was kind of strip everything down and really get into a story about what would the world look like
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:18.320]  if civil war actually took place, everybody factioned up, and a spiritual warfare broke out within our country.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320]  That's already happened.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320]  Yeah, it's starting.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320]  It's starting.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:27.320]  But you know, a lot of it had to do with the way you were talking years ago about the demonic entities of not only Hollywood,
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.320]  but the government, everything.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:35.320]  Hey, if there's a God, there's a devil, and the devil is after believers all over the country,
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:41.320]  and we've got to be prepared, and we've got to be ready to fight for our faith, for our country, for everything.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.320]  But that's the thing with Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.320]  It deals with the spiritual battle that can take place within us.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.320]  And we're going to play the trailer and talk about it next segment.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320]  The reason, and I'm glad you raised that.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.320]  We just got the documents here, and we've got all the public statements by Antifa about rising up, taking over,
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.320]  triggering something from martial law.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320]  This is really what they're pushing.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.320]  So a very, very timely, timely film.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:09.320]  When you see them failing, though, on every front, when you see sorrows starting to fail,
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320]  what do you think they're going to do next?
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320]  They're not going to give up.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.320]  You know, Alex, I wish I knew.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.320]  I really wish I knew what they were going to do.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320]  They're not going to give up.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:25.320]  I'm a little nervous to see what the millennials, so to say.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  I think they're so brainwashed that they will follow anything without any thought to it.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:39.320]  So a little curious to see what happens with them, but we're going to kick their butts everywhere.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.320]  We're going to beat them, Alex.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.320]  We are going to win this battle.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.320]  Absolutely.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.320]  And, of course, none of us are going to save the world by ourselves without God's help,
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.320]  but every little thing we do sends ripples out.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.320]  And if you look at, you know, Generation Z is more libertarian, more Christian, more conservative than ever.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.320]  So, I mean, it really is the millennials, a lot of them are great people,
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.320]  but some of them that have been so brainwashed and some of the loveliest controllers above them
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.320]  that are fighting so hard because they can see the writing on the wall.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.320]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.320]  You know, it was interesting.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.320]  I was speaking with a friend of mine, Richard Barry.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:14.320]  And what we did with Hunter Wild was we took it on, we did church screenings all over Texas.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.320]  And I was coming back and I was just feeling a little, you know, confused.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320]  Something was going on with Trump.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.320]  I don't remember what it was.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.320]  And I called him.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.320]  This is a guy I've never met in my life, but we spoke on the phone and he's in Orange County.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:32.320]  Full conservative loves Trump, but he's got to kind of, you know, keep it under wraps out there.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.320]  And I was going, you know, what's going on with all this Twitter?
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.320]  You think this is really necessary?
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320]  And he told me, he goes, you know what, it's got to be.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.320]  He has got to keep tweeting because he's got to change the subject from their disinfo.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]  Exactly.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.320]  Exactly.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.320]  And it may be a little off, but it's, it's his words.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320]  And I love it.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  So I've become, I've come to embrace it.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.320]  And I look forward to those tweets.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.320]  That's what is about conservatives and libertarians and Christians is we don't want to be arrogant.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.320]  We don't want to be out in people's face.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.320]  We don't want to look like we're starting scuff, but, but, but the globalists on the left,
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.320]  they have been leading the narrative and bullying us.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.320]  So we've got to get wild on them.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.320]  No, absolutely.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.320]  We've got to fight back.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]  Yeah.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.320]  We've got to fight back.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.320]  And it means fighting everywhere on social media.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:16.320]  You know, I've got it all over my Facebook feed, you know, and you can kind of see the
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.320]  shift a little bit where people are now coming out a little more, feel a little more comfortable
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.320]  going, Hey, I support them because they're trying to bully everybody and not supporting
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.320]  the resurgence of the Republic, the resurgence of real freedom.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.320]  Exactly.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320]  It's all about being heard and not sitting on the fence.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320]  Everybody's got to, and I agree.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.320]  I think the bullying, they took people's restraint as fear and their kindness for weakness.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.320]  And now that we're coming off the bench, more people are coming in.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.320]  I'm seeing it cause a bigger backlash.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.320]  All the censorship.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.320]  Did you see where Facebook, Twitter, Google all admit the sensory conservatives, libertarians,
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.320]  Trump, they admit to creating systems with algorithms to just block conservatives even
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.320]  being able to talk to each other period about the price of tea.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.320]  They're going to keep fighting.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.320]  They're going to keep fighting.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.320]  We're going to keep fighting.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.320]  And somewhere we're going to meet and somewhere we are going to win.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.320]  I know it.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.320]  I know it.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.320]  I'm really excited about what's going on.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.320]  I'm really excited.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320]  But you know what?
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.320]  For us, we just got to keep in it.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320]  We got to keep spreading the word.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.320]  We got to keep supporting.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.320]  Because, because we have, I mean, the Veritas video exactly is all these people at meetings
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.320]  and then out at the bars in classrooms, how they're going to censor, how they're going
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.320]  to shut us down, how they're going to end our speech period while they're denying it
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320]  publicly.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320]  Yeah, this is organized crime in my view.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320]  That's a good point.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.320]  It is organized crime.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320]  It really.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.320]  Mike Norris, stay there.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.880]  We're going to get into the film now when we come back on the other sides, the Crossroads
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.320]  of Hunter Wild now available on DVD and infowarstore.com.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]  So you support what Mike's doing.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.560]  We're doing, we're going to get your headpiece plugged in there and everything else on the
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.120]  other side, but support the broadcast and get a great film to share with your family
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.320]  and others at infowarstore.com, the Crossroads of Hunter Wild and Mike Norris Films.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.320]  Stay with us.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.320]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of my pillow.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.320]  And like all of you out there, I had problem sleeping.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]  Pillows would go flat.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.820]  I would flip flop all night long.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:07.480]  I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache or feel like I needed a nap even
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.820]  though I slept eight hours.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.400]  When I invented my pillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patent and fill to
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.040]  give you the exact support you need as an individual regardless of sleep position.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.320]  My pillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.280]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.680]  It's about how much of that quality sleep we get.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.640]  I do all of my own manufacturing right here in the United States.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.160]  I have a 10 year warranty.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.720]  You can wash and dry my pillow and I give you a 60 day money back guarantee so you have
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.720]  nothing to lose.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.400]  And here's my best offer ever.

[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.640]  like you have nowhere to turn for help?
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.960]  Then we have good news for you.

[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:08.920]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:15.360]  levels begin to decline, starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:22.560]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.040]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.040]  the market.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:34.560]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:41.480]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:47.480]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.

[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.840]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowars Life.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.920]  This focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.680]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.240]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:15.000]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.480]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.960]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.400]  reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.600]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.480]  these reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.560]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.360]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.080]  species and other free radicals.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.160]  Boost, protect and adapt with Cell Force from Infowars Life.

[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:13.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.560]  The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, a near future film of the second American Civil War triggered
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:36.960]  by Antifa, a spiritual war.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:59.880]  The
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.240]  world turned their back on God a long time ago.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.800]  Is it not possible, God said, enough?
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:14.800]  If we close our eyes to what's going on on the outside, we're going to wake up and the
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:21.240]  enemy is going to be right here inside of our gate.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:29.240]  The enemy's not afraid to kill, but it's nothing compared to the battle less to come.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:42.720]  We fight against spiritual wickedness in high places, and our only weapon is prayer.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:51.560]  Call out on your God, all you want, but He is mine.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:54.720]  This thing has no authority over you.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.000]  Fight it.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.280]  I want Hunter Wilde.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.840]  You believe us are our greatest pride.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.640]  So is this kind of like the Pilgrim's Progress?
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]  But a modern version?
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.640]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:18.480]  It was kind of, I kind of borrowed from the screw tape letters a little bit.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:25.000]  It's about a demon trying to take the soul of a man with the faith of a mustard seed.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.240]  And it's very simple.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.240]  I just wanted to really just go tell a story.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.440]  I'd say it all looks excellent, but it looks first right, the riot scenes and stuff.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.440]  Well, go ahead.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440]  Yeah, no.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.920]  And you know, I just wanted to create a world of chaos.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.720]  And I was trying to think, you know, at the time I was writing this, I'm going, man, you
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.880]  know, the election had just happened.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.400]  There was a lot of chaos and confusion going out.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.840]  So you know, I just kind of put the our story in that world, you know, where, you know,
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:56.040]  the two sides came together and this is what we're left with.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.720]  So spiritual battle, spiritual warfare, it's real.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.480]  And these are great to show at your church or to buy and give to your library or to show
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.920]  your family, but particularly Christian audiences, but outside of that excellent new film available
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.920]  at info or store.com.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.040]  And again, as your purchase there supports the new films that you make.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:18.200]  And of course you've directed major movies, TV shows and Walker, Texas, Ranger, you did
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.200]  a lot of those.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.200]  Oh yeah.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.200]  A lot of those 10 years.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.360]  That was a great job.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360]  It's amazing.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360]  Wow.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:30.720]  And getting back into the film, I've been a Christian my whole life and I've had a personal
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.080]  relationship with Christ, but I'm also a worldly person.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.080]  I'm not perfect.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.080]  I don't lie about that.
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.040]  We all have trials and tribulations, but as I get more immersed in politics and life
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:45.360]  and the way the world really works and study things and have been out to Hollywood at the
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:50.360]  highest levels like you've been and have seen behind the scenes, there really are pedophiles,
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.600]  devil worshipers, corruption.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.600]  There really is a spirit.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.160]  It really is anti-human.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.080]  You were here three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, and you said it's all about to
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.580]  come down.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:04.760]  Last time you were here, a year ago, the pedophilia, the evil, the raping, the women, all of it.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:08.360]  So you grew up into the cool guys, you know, Steve McQueen taught you how to ride a motorcycle
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.200]  because he was one of your dad's students.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.440]  People forget how long your dad's been around the phenomenon.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:16.000]  He looks like he's 50, but you know, he's been around forever.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.360]  And so now you just said, I don't want to get into it, but man, they're devil worshipers,
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360]  they're pedophiles.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.920]  Now that so much has come out, you want to talk about that?
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:26.520]  You know, that's just crazy what's happening with Hollywood right now.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.880]  But you broke it here years ago.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:33.800]  Yeah, but little did I know, you know, we were just talking, and that was my view from
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.080]  what I've seen.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.200]  And sure enough, I mean, the lids just blown off of Hollywood.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.920]  I think with everything, with our country, with Hollywood, with everything-
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.240]  Things are being revealed.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.400]  Things are being revealed.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.120]  And I think it's very important, but with things being revealed, we'll be able to make
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.120]  new again.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.400]  We'll really believe we'll be able to make new again.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.480]  Look, Hollywood's Hollywood.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.080]  I don't deal with it.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.360]  I don't want to deal with it.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.200]  The film we did, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, Texas Crew, Texas Cast.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200]  Everything was Texas.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.800]  And again, it doesn't have the $100 million budget, so it doesn't matter.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.120]  It's the story and the people that are involved.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.080]  And that's what we're growing here is New Independent Center.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.480]  And so many New Independent Christian films now are dwarfing Hollywood.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.480]  Yeah.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.480]  And you know what?
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.480]  I didn't want to fake anything or pretend anything on this movie.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.480]  It is what it is.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.880]  It's a very independent film.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.760]  We didn't do the big drone shots to make a little budget film look big or anything
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.760]  like that.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.880]  We're just telling a story about spiritual warfare.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.240]  I can't wait to watch it because it just came into that.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.600]  And you know what's really cool is this is one of the first movies that my dad watched,
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.280]  then he rewatched, and he says, son, what can I do to help you?
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.480]  I said, hey, if you could just say anything about the film and we could help us put it
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.280]  out there, that would be great.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.680]  And sure enough, he did this great video for us saying, hey, this is one of the finest
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.680]  films I've seen.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.680]  We have that video.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.680]  Do we load that video?
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.680]  Man, you got it.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.680]  Chuck Norris approved.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.800]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play Chuck Norris approved, The Crossroads of Hunter Wall.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.280]  I should have started the whole, started the whole interview with that, baby.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.280]  I've got a list here.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  Some of the videos we're going to be playing.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.280]  Go ahead and roll that.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:13.200]  Oh, my special little demon, you've managed a little fear and chaos, and yet here you
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:22.600]  sit alone, chaos, and fear, or a time-honored operative tool.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:30.560]  So a panic, doubt, pride, lusts, political distractions, these are but the afterthoughts
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.320]  of good field operations.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.040]  Is this all you desire?
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:41.000]  I have spent a millennia in the field, a millennia is but a speck of time.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.880]  What am I doing wrong?
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.520]  Aside from using time and space, travel and dimension alteration with the finesse of a
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:27:07.880]  three-legged dog, all right, show me anything that's more effective, targets like Hunter
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:13.080]  Wall, thrive on chaos.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:20.360]  It creates an adrenaline rush which simply focuses him, not on us.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.600]  The more you fling at him, the less likely he is to succumb.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.000]  That will not be enough to drag him back to your cage.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.880]  I want to keep you done, but you've chosen a very tricky human.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.480]  Again, that's another part, we're going to come back with Chuck Norris, talking about
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.480]  the film.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.640]  That's kind of the screw-tape letter angle of the demons, which is riveting, figuring
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.080]  out how to manipulate and control humans.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.920]  Yeah, it's what they talk about, the things that they use to create chaos.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:56.280]  They use political distractions, they use pride, they use all these things that infiltrates
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.200]  the believer or just the Americans that kind of sends them off kilter a little bit.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:07.320]  This is a film I'm definitely going to show my children particularly because they love
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.760]  God, I try to talk about God, we try to read from the Bible, but they still just get caught
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.520]  up in the world and I can tell that's really what they need.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.520]  That's what's happening.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.120]  The kids are just getting inundated with so much information, I just think they're having
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.760]  a hard time processing it.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.760]  My kids are the same way, even though they've got a pretty good grip on things, but also
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.240]  my daughter Greta is in this movie, she was in Amerageddon, she was part of the ranch
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:40.960]  and she's also in this, she plays kind of a girl I pick up on the way back to Crossroads.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.880]  She's great, she's great, we had a fun time.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:49.400]  Well, Mike Norris, an awesome fellow Texan right here by way of Oklahoma, back to LA,
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:53.560]  back to Texas because you know Oklahoma should be part of Texas, so Chuck Norris is a Texan,
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:56.160]  just North Texas.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.480]  It's an O-brainer, a Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.600]  disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.440]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon, get the original, most trusted name in gravity
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.280]  water filtration, Big Berkey.

[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:39.960]  If we close our eyes to what's going on on the outside, we're going to wake up and the
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:57.720]  enemy is going to be right here inside of our gate.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:21.720]  We're going to wake up and the enemy is going to be right here inside of our gate.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:26.720]  We're going to wake up and the enemy is going to be right here inside of our gate.

[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:46.720]  We're going to wake up.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:35:07.080]  We are back live here, so much breaking behind the scenes, sorry I got in late to the studio
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.200]  here, but we were dealing with massive censorship taking place all over the country, all over
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.000]  the world, and it's being exposed, Mike Norris, filmmaker, great patriots riding the shot
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.920]  done with me, he was telling me during the break about a really exciting documentary
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.680]  film coming out, this could be coming to Austin and I also want to get into if you want to,
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.760]  about the Snake River, who didn't want to talk about that, but look at this, he's joining
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:35.320]  us next hour, Twitter caught silencing O'Keeffe amid censorship expose with O'Keeffe suspension,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:41.360]  Twitter confirms authenticity of Project Veritas videos, well they have congressional
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:45.840]  hearings saying they want to censor everybody and they're doing it and that they're spying
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.880]  on the president on Twitter with his private messages, I mean these people, this is a coup,
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.360]  the big tech companies have basically brainwashed a bunch of people, they financed the universities
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.560]  and then they bring them out and put them in charge of a huge un-American takeover of
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:07.200]  massive censorship and they're on video having power trips, Mike Norris, I'm blown away
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:13.520]  by this, thank God for Project Veritas to be uncovering all this stuff and I'll tell
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.200]  you what, everybody's got to watch what they say no matter where they're at, because somebody's
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:24.200]  listening on my iPad, I got tape over everything, I tape on my iPhone, I protect myself, I'm
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:27.000]  very careful about what I say and when I say it.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.760]  Well I remember 18 years ago having film crews inside my house and they go, why do you have
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.600]  your webcam covered, because back when it was just webcams and I said, it's well known
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.800]  that hackers get into those governments, they just laughed at me and I said, no it's
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.160]  been university studies and again, but we don't get praised a lot of times for being
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.960]  right decades before, it's actually like we're worse because we were right.
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.280]  Yeah, you know it was interesting when I was driving up here today, you know I was thinking
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.720]  back to what, 20, 25 years ago when you first, or 30 years ago when you first got started
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.640]  and things you're saying, like I was saying Alex, exciting time because all this stuff
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:09.280]  you've talked about for all these years is happening right now, way ahead of the schedule
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:15.320]  of what you've said, I'm just very excited to see how this all shakes out, it's a little
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:20.720]  scary, it's exciting, but here we are, you know, we got to deal with it.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:26.320]  Mike Norris is our guest here in studio, I've got so much news to get to here, but you've
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.800]  always got a lot of interesting stuff going on, your life, your perspective, stories that
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.320]  you've heard about, things you've personally witnessed, I'm trying to be positive because
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:42.560]  there is a lot of positivity out here as well, but if you pull back from it and you see how
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.400]  we just put up with all the censorship and put up with all the tyranny, what do we do
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.400]  about all this?
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:55.760]  I shoot Alex, I think individually, you know, knowledge is power, I think that's one thing
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.720]  that people really need to understand is knowledge is power, so they need to read, they need
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:06.760]  to be informed, you know, and I'm really lucky that I've got a pretty, a really amazing group
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:11.160]  of men around me that are very knowledgeable, Gary Haven, you know, this is somebody I could
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:15.800]  go to going, you know, what's going on Gary, and he'll strip it all down to where I can
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.800]  understand.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.680]  And then there's the footage of him with the crew landing on grass runways during a hurricane
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.040]  to help people in Haiti, the first airplane in, and later in the day somebody dies trying
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.360]  to do what he did, and I'm like, wow, the crew's, the footage we've got is incredible.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.760]  I know, and he was in a standoff, I think, with the United Nations or something, I saw
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.960]  some pictures where, because I called him up, I go, hey, what's going on Gary?
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:42.280]  He goes, I'm going to stand off with you in right now and some cartel people, I'm going,
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.280]  what?
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.400]  Never a boring moment with Gary Haven, he doesn't even make a big deal about it, no, oh, never,
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.920]  he just got his cigar and he's ready to go.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:57.680]  You know, he's an amazing, amazing man, there's two men that have really shaped my thinking,
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:02.080]  my ideal, my ideology, and that's Gary and my dad.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:08.320]  Those are two men that I look up to so much, but Gary, just so smart, so well versed in
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.240]  all this stuff, and he's the one that really got me to awaken.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:17.240]  By the way, Gary exudes confidence, but it's not like other men that try to do it, like
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.520]  your dad, it's real confidence.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.360]  Yeah, no, Gary doesn't have to try to put on any shows or anything, he is what he is,
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:29.880]  and I'll tell you, it's just, you know, here's a guy, so much money and what is he doing,
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.400]  he's trying to save the world.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:36.600]  And all he does is direct action, food, medicine to people all over the Caribbean, you name
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.120]  it, other places behind the scenes, he directly delivering and he knows it's happening.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.760]  Absolutely, I mean, he fills up his own airplanes, gets army of people together and they head
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:53.480]  out, they were all in Haiti, Puerto Rico, he's the man, it's so exciting to just kind
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:59.600]  of go into his orbit and see, look at this landing right here, oh yeah, yeah, and he's
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.800]  the best pilot, he is the best pilot I've ever seen, there he is, look at him, there's
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.800]  Gary.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.240]  You know, earlier I had the best crew ever, but I get mad at myself because I was so excited
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:10.440]  about this film coming out, and then it just got here like yesterday, and then I wanted
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:14.440]  to have banners for it, and promos, and I kind of just walking up for the show and like,
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.720]  what clip, this clip, oh, and you know, it's my fault we have some train wrecks, but that's
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:23.840]  the fun part about it is it's live radio and live TV day after day, you know, just growing
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:28.560]  across the country, and again, it's not about giving credit to Info Wars or anybody else,
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.680]  it's about saying, we're right, we really know what we're talking about, but now we've
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.120]  got the banners up, this is what a second American Civil War would look like, Crossroads
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:43.200]  of Hunter Wild, a Mike Norris film now available at infowarstore.com, and listen, when you get
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.080]  excited about films folks, we sell tens of thousands of them, that sounds like a lot
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:50.840]  of money, it's not when you're trying to pay for a film, trying to produce it, it's
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.040]  not when you are trying to fund an operation like this, everybody listening, if you'll
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.400]  just commit, and no, this is the group they're trying to censor, the people we have on, they're
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:05.440]  trying to block, and when you grow a new film industry that's based on good, decent American

[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.600]  Here's a little piece of video of that.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.000]  Did I have this?

[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  No.

[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.200]  It's gotten really popular.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:12.480]  That's water off your dad's ranch.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.480]  Yeah.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:16.320]  You know, my dad was out on the ranch one day.
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.560]  He saw a snake in the ground.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.200]  He punched the snake, went down so deep, up popped a thing of water.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.200]  Nah, just kidding.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.680]  You mean Hillary Clinton came out?
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.200]  Your dad punched Hillary Clinton in the face and out came the water.
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:31.200]  No.
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:36.240]  You know, about in 2015, they were drilling for a well and they end up hitting an aquifer
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:41.880]  on his ranch that was spitting out about 190,000 gallons a day.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.600]  So they started, they started bottling it.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:50.800]  They put a line of 8,000 feet, built a bottling plant and so they've got Seaforce going out.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.040]  I think it's in 15 states now.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.040]  It's an amazing.
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.840]  It's great tasting water.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.360]  It's my dad and Gina's.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.080]  It's their water.
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.560]  So yeah, it was really funny because when we were doing crossroads.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.520]  I mean, I can drink Chuck Morris water.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:06.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.880]  But when we were doing crossroads a hundred wild, we had lunch with them one day and they
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.800]  are going, yeah, a lot of people are doing these viral videos for us and I go, shoot,
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:16.800]  we're filming tomorrow.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:17.960]  Let me do one.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:22.400]  And so we did this commercial and they're putting it out here in the next couple of weeks
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.560]  on a big national campaign.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  So it was funny.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.560]  It was funny.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.560]  We had a good time doing it.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.560]  It's my daughter Greta right there.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:31.080]  And so we're getting a first look right now.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.080]  Right.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.080]  Yeah.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:34.960]  Actually, this is the first time it's ever been seen right here on your show.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.240]  The premiere of Seaforce water.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.240]  Yeah.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:39.240]  But it was great.
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:42.400]  It's a great water.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:46.080]  Part of the proceeds go to his Kickstart Foundation, which is great for kids.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.080]  It's great.
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.080]  I was, I had my friend, we're going to talk about this later, Eddie Braun, who jumped
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:51.400]  the Snake River Canyon.
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.640]  And by the way, he's a super, in fact, I know him from out in Hollywood, one of the most
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.640]  famous, I mean, you know, one of your best friends, but he's one of the most famous,
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.120]  I mean, I mean, talk about this guy, one of the most famous stunt guys out there.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:02.120]  Yeah.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.520]  Eddie's an amazing, amazing guy.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.920]  He's been a great friend of mine for a long time, but I mean, evil couldn't evil couldn't
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:07.920]  do that.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.920]  No, no.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:16.040]  And he, Eddie built a rocket and it to exact specs is what evil's rocket was.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:17.480]  And he jumped the Snake River.
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.760]  Now, good morning America.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.280]  It was going to be a big, huge media thing and good morning America was out there.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:27.360]  But that was the day that the French terrorist attack happened and it took all the media
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:28.360]  away.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.360]  Eagles of death.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.360]  Yeah.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.360]  And Eddie said, forget it.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.360]  I'm still going.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.040]  And what he did was he took all the footage and made an amazing documentary called.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:39.440]  What's incredible is 30, 40 years ago, you have the Snake River trying to was like the
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  biggest thing ever.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.880]  And I was like, ah, no big deal.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:42.880]  You can't do it.
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:43.880]  And he does it though.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.880]  Yeah.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.880]  Absolutely.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.160]  Zero to 400 miles in two seconds.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.520]  Zero to 400 miles.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:50.520]  Did he black out?
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.520]  No, he did it.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:54.400]  And it's an amazing, this movie he did a stuntman.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.400]  It's an amazing movie.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:00.280]  I had dinner one time with Eddie Braun and some folks and they were talking about stories
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:04.880]  about guys dying, like jump the car and then it crushes and like, you know, they cut their
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:09.280]  head off or just all this insane stories about, wow, these stuntmen are amazing.
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.280]  Yeah.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.280]  That happened on Walker.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:16.840]  Eddie was driving a car on Walker, jumping a car and he looked over to the guy next to
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.920]  me and he goes, hey, this may hurt, but it won't kill you.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.920]  It killed him.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:25.320]  Unfortunately, up at Joe Pool Lake in Dallas and they did a big car stunt and Eddie broke
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.320]  his back.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.320]  It was brutal.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.360]  And he was telling that story too, so the blood was just gushing out of his nose.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.360]  Yeah.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.360]  Yeah.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.360]  That's true.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.360]  That was the story.
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.360]  That's the story.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.360]  Well, then retell it.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.360]  Yeah.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.000]  No, on Walker, Texas Ranger, we were doing a big stunt and the car, you know, it's jumping
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  over something.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.840]  I can't remember what it is exactly, but Eddie's driving the car.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:47.160]  Charlie Skeen is next to him and, like I said, Eddie.
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:48.160]  That was it?
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.160]  Charlie Skeen.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:50.160]  Charlie Skeen.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.160]  Yeah.
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.160]  Yeah.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.080]  And he goes, ah, this is going to hurt, but it won't kill you.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.360]  And Eddie hit the thing.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:00.160]  I think he flew about 150 feet in the air and crashed and looked over and Charlie was dead,
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.880]  but he had a heart attack or something like that.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:04.120]  It wasn't, I don't think it was from the insurance.
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:05.120]  Sure.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:06.120]  That's what it was.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:07.120]  The blood was pouring out of his nose.
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.120]  Yeah.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:09.120]  And there was another guy that they told some other stories about.
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.120]  Somebody else got their head chopped off another man.
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:11.120]  Yeah.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.120]  Yeah.
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.120]  I think it was one of the most dangerous movies missing in action, I think.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:16.120]  Yeah.
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:17.120]  I remember right now.
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:20.800]  We're sitting there eating swordfish and rice and they're getting their heads cut off.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.720]  You're like, I'm really glad I have my radio job.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.120]  Yeah, don't, yeah, don't kidding.
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:25.360]  But it's, you know what?
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360]  It's safe.
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.880]  You know, my brother was a stunt coordinator on water.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:29.880]  It's safe until you die.
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:34.080]  It's safe until you die, but, you know, you just got to be careful.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.080]  It's a dangerous business.
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.080]  Being a stuntman is dangerous.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.920]  Didn't your dad do a lot of his own stunts?
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:42.080]  He did, but, you know, he got to the point where he's like, well, why not?
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:43.080]  Why am I doing this?
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.080]  I don't have to do this.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.080]  I got a great double.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:46.080]  It looks just like me.
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.360]  And so my dad would do the master shots and do the fights, but, you know, if somebody's
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:55.080]  driving by or something, he's like, you know what, let these stuntmen do it and let them
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:56.080]  make some money.
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:01.480]  Boy, I tell you, I make you think of that movie intro, you know, I died for a living
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:02.480]  on TV.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.480]  It's just crazy.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:04.480]  Yeah.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.440]  Are the stunt men, and there's stunt women as well, just saying men is not sexist or
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.440]  evil.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.440]  Men existing is bad.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.160]  Is it as dangerous as it used to be?
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.720]  It seems like with more of the graphics and computers, they've kind of cut back a little
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:16.720]  bit.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:17.720]  Yeah.
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.720]  You know what?
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.960]  I don't want to say it's, you know, I think a lot of it is, I think they're pushing the
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.880]  envelope a lot further.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:29.000]  Also now, just the way Hollywood is, they're constantly pushing the envelope on action and
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  driving.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.720]  I mean, that movie, Baby Driver and things like that, that's still the car doing the
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:36.760]  stunts.
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:37.760]  It's dangerous.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760]  It's very dangerous.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:45.480]  The stunt men are a very highly, highly trained breed of people that take it very serious.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:53.520]  I was here with my, Eddie was here in Dallas last week doing a Ford commercial, and he's,
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:58.480]  you know, I forgot how detailed they are on safety.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.480]  Everything's about safety.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.960]  It's dangerous what they're doing.
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:01.960]  Yeah.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:02.960]  No, absolutely.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:03.960]  They've gotten better about it.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:08.200]  Not only dangerous for the stunt man, but also for the crew, all the people around.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.400]  It's very dangerous as well.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.120]  So safety's paramount.
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.160]  But pushing human potential is what it's all about.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.040]  It's one of the last trailblazers out there.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.480]  In fact, you were telling me you guys are going to come to town for South by Southwest.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480]  We'll definitely hang out for that.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480]  No.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.480]  Eddie Braun's coming down here.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480]  He's screening his movie down here in Austin.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.680]  He's going to have a whole array of crazy people coming with him, but it's going to
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:29.680]  be a big party.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:30.680]  We're going to have fun.
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:31.680]  We're going to have a good time.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.440]  What's cool in Hollywood, though, is everybody likes the Hollywood stars.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:38.440]  But in Hollywood, the cool people, it's the stunt people that are the stars.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.440]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.440]  Like in a party or an event.
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:41.440]  That's what everybody wants to talk about.
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:45.160]  You know, and it's been part of our world forever.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:49.480]  My brother, Eric, he's one of the top stunt coordinators in the business.
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:53.440]  He's doing Hawaii 5-0 right now in Hawaii.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.440]  He's amazing.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.440]  And that's a rough job.
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.440]  Yeah.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  Yeah.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:54:59.440]  It's been nine months a year in Hawaii.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:00.440]  Oh, it's a horrible job.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.440]  Man, I was out there on Hawaii.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.440]  It was big cliffs.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:03.440]  Oh, yeah?
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.440]  You know, around the side, there's no civilization.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  Yep.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:07.440]  The Mali Coast, whatever, like in a rubber boat.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.440]  I was like, man, this is the people's thing I've ever seen.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:11.440]  Going into those caves.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.440]  You know there's a God seeing that.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  You know, Hawaii, I think the last time I was in Hawaii was for Bruce Lee's funeral.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:19.440]  Wow.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:21.440]  I was in Maui.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.440]  Is he buried in there?
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:25.440]  Well, they had a memorial service in Hawaii.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.440]  That's interesting.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.440]  I just popped back in.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  I tell you, I can't live anywhere.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.440]  It'd be there.
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:31.440]  I don't know.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.440]  I think I'm going to get a little island fever.
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:33.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:34.440]  You can always five hours you're back.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:35.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.440]  I don't know, man.
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.440]  Actual shows, it was relaxed and zinned out there.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:39.440]  I'm always like this.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.440]  Go to Hawaii.
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.440]  I'm like, whoa.
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  Yeah.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  Something happens.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  I just get really relaxed.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:45.440]  Well, you know what that is.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.440]  The jet lag.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.440]  You're tired.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.440]  Oh, the beer or something?
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.440]  Here's something else, man.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:52.440]  All right.
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:58.440]  You got to get back on the road, back to North Texas up there where you've got your
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.440]  compound.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  I want you to pop in and do an interview for the war room coming up.
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:03.440]  Absolutely.
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  Well, I'll destroy it.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:05.440]  You know what?
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.440]  I just want to thank you, Alex.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:08.440]  Oh, please.
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:09.440]  I'm not sure.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  No, for real.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:14.080]  I'm not sure if people really understand what you're doing.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:19.160]  Everything that goes on here and all these vitamins are the best of the best.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:24.320]  I kid you not, doctors are prescribing this stuff, but you could get them right here.
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.320]  Please get them here.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.640]  It's funny what you say because that's a lot of what we do is they have these clinics
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.920]  where they sell them for 300, 400 bucks with like a 7, 10 times markup through the doctors
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:32.920]  and it's helping people.
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.800]  You guys can make claims about stuff now.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.960]  A lot of it's been scientifically proven, but then you can like sell it for 50 bucks
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:41.160]  instead and it's even better than what doctors are selling.
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.160]  Yeah.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.160]  I mean, I just went over Blake.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:44.160]  I just went over.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.840]  I got some probiotics, some red.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.800]  I mean, this is stuff that is cheaper than you're going to get at the doctors.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:51.800]  Please get it.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:52.800]  Please support Infowars.
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:56.040]  Well, what you're saying is more and more, even medical doctors offices and stuff, they
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:00.160]  got a whole vitamin, mineral compound section of really stuff that helps you.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.480]  It's just that for some reason you'll pay for 100 bucks for a fish oil at the doctor's
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:04.480]  office.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:05.480]  We're about to come up with the highest quality fish oil.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.000]  Well, that's just 30 bucks and it's a big fusion of the very best, been all cleaned
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  out and everything.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  So thank you so much.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.200]  You know, it takes a lot of money to fund this operation, but the listeners have come
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.120]  through and again, it's not that we're even that good.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:19.200]  It's that no one's really been challenging them.
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:20.960]  So it shows you how weak the globalist are.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.720]  They're having all these hearings and saying, shut us down and admitting that we're really
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:25.720]  hurting them.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.200]  And so Project Veritas James O'Keefe was coming up to discuss his latest inside video that
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:32.600]  we're going to be showing you here.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:36.560]  And now they've been trying to censor his video itself of what they're up to.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.280]  So thank you so much, Mike Norris.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:41.600]  The new film, The Crossroads of Hunter Wild, available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:42.600]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:43.600]  Thank you, brother.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:45.960]  Great job on the new film.
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:52.320]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:58.680]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:05.920]  or videos or other material from InfowarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:08.120]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.080]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:15.680]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:19.360]  colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodide in it.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:20.680]  You cannot beat that.
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:24.440]  For children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]  That's my dad.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:31.600]  The colloidal silver and iodide, as well, InfowarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.040]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:38.880]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:42.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:47.080]  against us so we need your support.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:53.120]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest-quality Infowars Biome Defense
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.720]  probiotic.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:59:01.400]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high-quality, known probiotics that have
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:09.080]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:14.240]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:20.720]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:25.320]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:27.440]  probiotic on the market.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:32.880]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfowarsLife.com today
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:36.480]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.040]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:44.080]  public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:45.080]  Infowar.
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:53.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:53.880 --> 02:00:23.440]  All right, coming up, we've got Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:28.120]  This is a big interview who is running for the Senate and in a dead heat with the establishment
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.120]  candidate.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:34.200]  He's going to be joining us, but first, in the next 30 minutes, we've got the head of
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:40.000]  Project Veritas, who released one of the most devastating videos yet, months long, months
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.600]  and months long, inside investigation of Twitter censoring conservatives and libertarians and
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:46.600]  more.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:52.200]  And now Twitter is caught silencing James O'Keefe amid censorship expo, say, that stories
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.920]  from Kit Daniels on Infowars.com.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.120]  But first, Russia fraud is now imploding a key John Bowne report.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:04.760]  The agents of fraud and slander attempt to take down the president's character.
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:09.160]  We're not at a 25th Amendment level yet.
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:10.160]  Or they would...
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:12.160]  It's alarming.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:15.000]  This is alarming in every way.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.280]  And then this went on, okay, this is a little 25th Amendment.
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:25.360]  The 25th Amendment is a concept that is alive every day in the White House.
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:30.600]  The president has this intensely loyal base, but it's still unpopular with most Americans.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.320]  It's been a concern for the White House for a while now that the president is surrounded
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.840]  by people who don't necessarily respect or like him very much.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:41.360]  And the president, I think, is aware of that and it bothers him.
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:47.720]  TD Bank has finally handed over the documents regarding Fusion GPS's Steele dossier investigation.
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:50.120]  They were so desperately clutching to.
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:54.920]  The House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the over 70 documents under a confidential
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:55.920]  settlement.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:01.440]  Fusion GPS is appealing, claiming their employees' identities have been compromised.
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.560]  The Hill reports Fusion GPS officials have hit back at House Republicans saying they
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.880]  do not believe the dossier led to the federal probe into the alleged ties between the Trump
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.840]  campaign and Russian election meddling.
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.680]  For more than five months now, we've had 20 members of the House Judiciary Committee
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:26.640]  calling for a second special counsel to evaluate the nexus between the DNC, the Clinton Foundation,
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.240]  Fusion GPS, and Russians, the very Russians who told lies to undermine the president of
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:33.520]  the United States both before and after his election.
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:37.120]  So we'll get to the bottom of this and the fact that we're turning up the heat on our
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.680]  investigation is likely one reason why Glenn Simpson wanted to tell a side of the story
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:42.680]  in the newspaper.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:46.160]  Now we're ready for him to tell a side of the story in open hearings in Congress.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:53.640]  People really believe that the FBI did not know who paid for that dossier.
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:03:20.640]  I've got a bridge to tell you.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.720]  The real crime is the millions of taxpayer dollars from the FBI and Justice Department
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:30.720]  to the wives and husbands of people at Fusion GPS that made it up.
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:39.040]  Making the entire matter worse, we learned that the FBI paid Steele an additional $50,000
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.520]  to update the phony dossier.
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:45.580]  The Democrats want to talk about collusion.
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:47.920]  They want to talk about dirty tricks.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.600]  This is the dirtiest trick I've ever seen.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:55.560]  Also, a senior fellow working for John McCain's Institute is feeling the heat.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:01.840]  Byron York, who flew to London in November of 2016 to retrieve the dossier, which unbeknownst
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:07.400]  to McCain had been floating around D.C., is now under subpoena for not being forthright.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:12.680]  The Washington Examiner reports in the session, Kramer told House investigators that he knew
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.720]  the identities of the Russian sources for the allegations in the Steele dossier.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.920]  But when investigators pressed Kramer to reveal those names, he declined to do so.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.640]  Now he is under subpoena.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:29.640]  The subpoena directs Kramer to appear again before the House investigators on January
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.640]  11th.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.720]  This should make for some real fireworks as Fusion GPS reveals the inner workings of
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:39.800]  a multi-million dollar political witch hunt that has backfired.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:55.240]  John Bown reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:58.680]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWars Life.
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:03.200]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:05.960]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:08.960]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:13.280]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:15.760]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:20.240]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:22.680]  reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:27.840]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.760]  these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:35.800]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:40.600]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:43.160]  species and other free radicals.
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:48.360]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWars Life.

[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:29.240]  The authoritarians that are controlling this planet to a great extent, the technocrats,
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:34.480]  the big tech giants, they admit they're setting up something called a technocracy.
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:41.960]  And the definition of technocracy is an authoritarian world government that uses technology and
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:46.200]  the tracking of information to control what the general population does.
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:49.600]  Let's pull up your own definition, but it is an authoritarian system.
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:55.960]  If you read about Davos and the EU and the Goldman Sachs, they all say we are technocrats.
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:56.960]  We are technocrats.
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:02.240]  Now I'd read that in their documents 20 years ago and talk about it, but you go read what
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:07.120]  they're saying publicly now, that's what they've set up, that's what they've established.
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:11.320]  And James O'Keefe from Project Veritas has been at the heart of exposing it.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:16.000]  And as you can see, you're watching on television right now, he will be entering the studio
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.440]  here momentarily, kind of like I am sometimes.
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:23.640]  He's busy with some big breaking news, but he's about to be there here in just a moment.
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:31.840]  I sure understand having so many things in the air, so many pans on the stove that we're
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:32.840]  juggling here.
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:35.640]  So he's going to be joining us here in just a moment.
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:39.160]  But he didn't just catch them on tape a few months ago saying our main mission is to censor
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:42.760]  Alex Jones, the Liberty Movement, that was Google and YouTube.
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:47.800]  He's now got the Democrats saying we steal elections, we bust any legals to vote, we have
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:52.520]  them vote in the names of dead people, he didn't just expose all the other countless things
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:54.400]  like Acorn and bring that down.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.360]  Just showing them there was more investigative journalists, we would have already won this
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.360]  thing.
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:00.360]  But we're starting to win.
[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:03.040]  But we're just starting to win, we're starting to turn the tide.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:11.280]  But now he's got undercover video that is incredible that's on projectveritas.com, infowars.com,
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:18.400]  popstoryondrudgereport.com, at least the last time I looked this afternoon, undercover
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:25.800]  Twitter engineers to ban way of talking through shadow banning algorithms to censor opposing
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.800]  political views.
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:32.360]  And Drudge has the headline that they admit they are opposing people's views, period.
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:36.600]  Just not letting you communicate if you're a Christian, a conservative, a libertarian.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:40.960]  If you say a terror attack is Islamic, when ISIS has taken responsibility, they'll have
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:45.280]  a congressional hearing the day it happens and have Google, Facebook and Twitter there
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:48.360]  and they go, Paul Watson in info wars is number one on Twitter.
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.520]  And he says that it's an Islamic attack and they've been warned.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:53.600]  And they go, sir, we banned it during lunch.
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:58.840]  I mean, so a lot of this is out in the open now, but this is incredible at their meetings
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:08:59.840]  at restaurants.
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:03.640]  We're going to find out how long this investigation went.
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:06.560]  But this is one of the most damning because they brag about, yeah, we spy on the police
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:07.560]  and the president.
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:13.240]  And we're ready to give the Justice Department implying they've got something in his private
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:15.800]  Twitter stuff where people are contacting you.
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:19.680]  That's like tapping the president's phone and they say, we're ready to give it to Congress
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:20.920]  implying there's something.
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:23.280]  This is how incredible it is.
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:26.920]  We should put this back on screen, the deep state symbol, because you think of deep state
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:31.040]  as government, but it's the tech giants, it's Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:35.000]  They're the ones that nobody has got a leg up on.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.240]  I mean, they're the king daddies and they're the fake liberals and they're manned by all
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.160]  these SJWs right out of university who are proud of their censorship.
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:47.880]  So James O'Keefe, you have done it again, my friend.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:48.880]  Congratulations.
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:49.880]  They're at Project Veritas.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.880]  Lay out the etymology of this and the footage because we play it all at a time.
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:58.240]  You having you here as this amazing infiltration.
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:03.440]  Well, Alex, I mean, this is one of the greatest censorship stories in modern times.
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.120]  I mean, the things these people are saying on this video, I think this is certainly the
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.760]  biggest thing we have ever done.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:11.480]  These are the most powerful people in the world.
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:14.000]  There you have it on the screen in front of you.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.440]  Our strategy is to shadow ban.
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:19.240]  Now, your viewers might know what this is, but really what they're saying is that when
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.360]  you tweet or Facebook something, you think it's going to your users.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:27.840]  What these companies are doing and these engineers are on video describing is how they make you
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.880]  think that your information is going to your users, but the people on the timeline don't
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:33.880]  see the information.
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:34.880]  That's what a shadow ban is.
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.720]  And they talk about how they specifically targeted, and this is their words, not mine,
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:43.480]  rednecks, conservatives who tweet about the flag, and they create algorithms where if you
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:48.640]  mention these things that correlate with certain ideas, they ban you.
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:51.720]  And they call it S-H-I-T-T-Y people.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:55.440]  This is what the policy executives, these are not low level employees.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.120]  These are executives at Twitter.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.640]  Stephen Pierre, a Twitter engineer says, we want to quote, ban a way of talking.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.480]  I hope you play some of these clips for your audience because this is truly extraordinary.
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:13.680]  They say they want to down rank S-H-I-T-T-Y people to not show up.
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:15.280]  We're working on that right now.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.800]  So they're describing the products and the pro, there's a Singh who's on the direct
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:25.160]  messaging team talking about how they use algorithms to target Julian Assange, to target
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:30.200]  conservatives and to ban a way of talking.
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:33.280]  We're going to play some of the video once you've left, but just in the time we have,
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:37.160]  people need to go to Project Veritas and see it for themselves in InfoWars.
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:42.480]  But it just shows a total culture of censorship and dehumanizing white people as rednecks,
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:48.640]  but then Julian Assange that's bipartisan exposing things, a real hero, they're calling
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:50.480]  him bad things as well.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:52.280]  These are horrible people.
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.000]  But again, they're getting directives from on high that this is to be done.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.960]  Yes, they're getting directives.
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.360]  It's part of the culture, one of the executives in the tape, Alex says that there's an unwritten
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:07.520]  policy there, you have it Moe, he says there's an unwritten policy to do this, even though
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.760]  it's not part of the language, he's just taking certain tweets down.
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:16.480]  Alex, Twitter bills itself as the public square, and what your audience needs to understand
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.680]  is if they take away our rights to share our ideas on these platforms, where are we going
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:22.680]  to go?
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:24.360]  I mean, most people don't have the power to create their own website.
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:28.360]  I know these are private companies, and we may not want the government to intervene, but
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:33.160]  unless the CEO of Twitter makes their algorithms public so the users know what they're doing,
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:34.920]  the government didn't have a choice but to intervene.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:39.000]  I mean, this is scary stuff, and don't take my word for it.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:46.400]  They're on tape saying their whole MO is to quote ban a way of talking.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:52.720]  This is the greatest censorship story of modern times, and unlike the mainstream media, Alex,
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:56.520]  we don't just anonymously quote sources, we have these people dead to rights.
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:57.520]  How do we do it?
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:03.280]  We spend a year, a year undercover, building and drawing these people out, building their
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:04.280]  trust.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:08.040]  A lot of these people are not even American citizens because they outsource a lot of this
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.200]  engineering to other countries.
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:12.200]  They bring people in on student visas in this video.
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:17.880]  You'll see a lot of foreign workers describing how they target American patriots just because
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.560]  they don't like what they have to say.
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:24.920]  We're not talking about white supremacists or Nazi people, they're just targeting moderate
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:25.920]  conservative people.
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:31.080]  But James, that's what globalism is, is ganging up on nation-states, taking it over, letting
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:35.320]  China have lower taxes than we have, designed to deindustrialize us.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:40.880]  It's clowered and piven, and here they are saying, we're going after all the opposition.
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:44.160]  Now we've got a story on infowars.com, I don't know if you know about this, but Twitter has
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:47.480]  been caught now censoring your exposure.
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:48.480]  How was that?
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.480]  I didn't see that one.
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:50.480]  Are they commuting me?
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:51.880]  Are they shadow banning my stuff now?
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:56.240]  Yes, with O'Keeffe's suspension, Twitter confirms authenticity in Project Veritas videos.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.560]  Twitter unblocked James O'Keeffe account after suffering massive backlash for silence in
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:06.120]  the Project Veritas founder as his expose day on Twitter, political censorship went viral.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:10.200]  You know what's amazing, Alex, is that we're using Twitter's platform to get the information
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.200]  out.
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:12.200]  They are really in a pickle.
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:13.400]  They are in a bind because they can't ban me.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:15.040]  They reinstated my account there.
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:18.560]  A lot of people on Twitter, this is trending on Twitter, Alex, believe it or not, isn't
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:20.160]  that ironic?
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:26.280]  Hashtag shadow ban is trending on Twitter from looking at my phone here, and everyone
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:28.040]  is tweeting at the CEO of Twitter.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:29.040]  This is big stuff.
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.720]  By the way, Alex, yesterday Twitter issued a statement.
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:37.320]  The statement was, quote, the individual depicted in the video was speaking in a personal capacity
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:39.160]  and does not represent Twitter.
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:44.680]  So they're saying this is a rogue employee, and today we have eight rogue employees, including
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:50.680]  on the policy team, we have engineers on the direct messaging team, we have engineers describing
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:52.680]  things they're doing.
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:53.680]  This is historic.
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:54.920]  And this is what YouTube does.
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:58.720]  They also put you into a phantom zone where you think you're hitting your subscribers,
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:03.680]  but only people going to Project Veritas or real Alex Jones, you have to go there looking
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.920]  for it yourself to share it, and you caught YouTube executives saying the exact same thing
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:09.920]  about us.
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:10.920]  So this is incredible.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.720]  The first they ban you, then it blows up in their face because you're covering this,
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:19.480]  now they have to unban you, and then you make the point, well, it's their company, but they
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:21.120]  hold out it's a public square.
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:24.160]  It's false advertising, and it's all secret, and then they discriminate.
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:29.000]  I mean, if you can't say no to baking a gay couple's cake, you sure can't keep conservatives
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  off Twitter.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.320]  Well, they're also giving direct messages, according to them, to the government.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:37.920]  And yesterday's video, they say, well, we go into your DMs, and one of the things that
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:41.320]  they're saying, Alex, and this is really graphic, but this is some of this stuff that's going
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:46.240]  to come out, they're talking about private genital photos, no, I don't, I don't put that
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:47.240]  stuff on there.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:48.240]  Maybe there's an American to do.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:51.640]  Sure, but like the NSA or worse, they're going through all your private messages trolling
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:54.080]  and enjoying themselves like a bunch of peeping toms.
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:55.080]  Stay there.
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:56.080]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.

[02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:00.520]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:01.520]  by you.
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:06.400]  The symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation

[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:12.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:17.560]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:25.080]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:27.560]  James O'Keith of Project Veritas is our guest.
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:30.920]  We're going to play some clips after he leaves us here in about four minutes.
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:35.440]  But James, as you said, I can sense this is historic because it just shows the censorship
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:39.760]  and it gets people excited about promoting the story and then they see it being censored.
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:42.320]  Hey, if this is what they're doing, then bring it out in the light.
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:47.960]  Give us more details of what's in the video, but also the shockwaves that's ascending
[02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:49.680]  across the world right now.
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:54.040]  This is the biggest thing we've ever done and we've done some big ones.
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:57.280]  This thing is rocking Silicon Valley.
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:58.560]  My phone is blowing up, right?
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:01.760]  I'm not just saying this to hype it.
[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:07.280]  Twitter corporate issued a second response here in the last hour saying we're not doing
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:09.240]  it when they're on video doing it.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:13.880]  This might force their CEO to, I mean, you guys got to tweet at Jack Dorsey, at Jack
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:14.960]  Dorsey.
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:20.560]  This is the biggest censorship story in modern times and unlike the mainstream media, we
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:21.560]  have them dead to rights.
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:22.560]  They're caught on video.
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:25.160]  It's not me quoting people in a text article.
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:29.720]  They're on tape in restaurants, in areas where there's no expectation of privacy, talking
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:32.120]  about how they target people using their algorithms.
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:35.880]  And everything we do is on the line because Twitter is the modern public square, whether
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:41.360]  we like it or not, these companies are the modern public square and they're describing
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:45.400]  how they censor moderate voices, not ultra right wing ones.
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:46.520]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.280]  I got to say something that's happening right now.
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:50.400]  This is not a right wing story.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:55.320]  There's a lot of people, mainstream people, who are raising their eyebrows and patting
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:59.760]  us on the back and the media is going to be dragged kicking and screaming into covering
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:00.760]  this one.
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:06.360]  I'm really proud of our team for what we've, you know, my undercover journalists put their,
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:10.600]  they put their lives on the line for this and they get attacked and I got the attorney
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:14.920]  general of California sending me an audit letter, which I'm going to publish soon.
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:24.240]  I mean, everything is on the line and this is the greatest censorship issue of our time.
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:26.200]  And I'm, there's more to come.
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:28.280]  I've got more videos.
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:35.200]  Overwitnessing, organized, focused, racketeering in my view, in meetings, at events, in classrooms,
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:38.520]  but then out at bars about how they're organized, how they're censoring.
[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:42.160]  We're going to play some of the clips after you leave here in a minute or two.
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:45.200]  And again, the fact that they try to deny it, they know it's damning.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:46.640]  It's going to completely blow up in their face.
[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:50.720]  And then you add the Google censorship, the YouTube admitting it to everybody.
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:55.600]  The stuff that you got about me is now being used in current lawsuits from Google executives
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:56.720]  that have gone public.
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:00.200]  It looks like the whole house of cards is starting to go down and you track the line
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:01.680]  of what's giving us the key intel.
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:03.240]  It's project Veritas, my friend.
[02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:04.240]  Yeah.
[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:06.000]  James DeMorse sued Google this week.
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.480]  I've been in touch with him, Charles Johnson sued Twitter this week.
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:12.720]  Dennis Prager sued YouTube.
[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:17.160]  We, everything you guys have been saying is in this video.
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:20.880]  I mean, I can't even, I kind of have to let the video speaks for itself.
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:23.520]  You know, I mean, all I can say is the one request that I have for your audience right
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:30.600]  now is go to Twitter, if you have a Twitter account, and tweet at Jack Dorsey at JACK
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:35.280]  and say, Hey, Jack, you know, you better answer for this, make your algorithms public.
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:36.760]  It's a user driven system.
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:40.200]  We don't want government intervention, but you got to make it public because anonymity
[02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:41.360]  breeds responsibility.
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:45.760]  And Alex, I'd like to come back on your show because the next video we release, I mean,
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.760]  I can't even make this stuff.
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:50.560]  James, you've got the hotline and you anytime you call us, you're on, please give us an
[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.560]  update tomorrow.
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:54.440]  I'm on top, the biggest story probably in the world right now.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:55.440]  Incredible.
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:56.440]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:57.440]  I'll be back.
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:23:58.440]  See you.
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:23:59.440]  Thank you.
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:00.440]  Now he's got to go.
[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:02.040]  Folks, let me tell you, I don't just send donations around.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:07.200]  I sent 20 grand there a few months ago because the video they got a Google saying that I'm
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:10.760]  the number one enemy and they're censoring me when I got to the lawyers, they said, this
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:11.760]  is it.
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:14.480]  No matter how good their lawyers are, you win and we're getting ready and it's being
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:18.360]  used in the other lawsuit than the more suit and they got more documents and I don't want
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:20.400]  to just sue for me.
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:24.800]  These pigs are blocking everything we do and they're not even letting us, oh, we send
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:27.840]  out to our millions of subscribers, nobody gets it.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:33.160]  We do all this, they demonetize this 95%, don't even tell us and then they got these
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:41.240]  arrogant people, they get up on their high horse video and they just arrogantly shoot
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:43.240]  rednecks like Julian Assange.
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:45.360]  Yeah, we're shutting him down.
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:49.000]  The guy that George W. Bush wanted arrested.
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:54.800]  It's sick, but again, they're liberals, so it's okay to be fascist.
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:58.360]  And you see how Antifa doesn't want you to be able to march and they tell our reporters
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.640]  with guns and Austin, you can't go through here to the Capitol.
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:02.640]  We have guns.
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:03.640]  Are you scared?
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:06.040]  No one's like, yeah, you're hitting me with clubs and you have guns.
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:08.520]  If your fingers will trigger, I am actually shaking.
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:10.480]  The police just say, we've been ordered to stand down.
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:11.480]  Sorry, Owen.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:18.120]  Well, these are the same people running these platforms and they want to censor everything
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:19.760]  and they are the internet.
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:23.240]  They get everybody to go on their platforms, say they're free and open and then secretly
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:25.440]  start censoring.
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.400]  So I'm not bragging when I tell you, we've given $100,000 for this big investigation
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:34.040]  to pedophilia that's been there and the arrest, all of it's going to be here soon.
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:37.840]  We've been supplied a lot of the, I'm leaving it at that and we're helping Veritas behind
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:38.840]  the scenes.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:42.200]  That's why you need to go to infowarstore.com, you need to commit and I don't, I don't want
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.120]  to sit there with the information time we have and plug this, plug that.
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.760]  We got the best supplements, the best game-changing products, the best t-shirts, the best films,
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:55.640]  the best books, just material to fight the globalists and I've been so busy, half the
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:00.480]  stuff we had at 50% off, isn't 50% off, is it sold out, but we got secret 12, sold 50%,
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:04.760]  survival show X2, you've got to get that, 50%, SuperMail 50%, a bunch of other stuff,
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:08.560]  the crossroads of Hunter Wilde, the new Mike Norris film, this is what a second American
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:12.880]  revolution, Civil War would look like, very important.
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:18.680]  Infowar, endorsed by his father Chuck Norris, infowarstore.com.
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:22.680]  By the way, Chuck is a daily listener and he's been on before, but a little birdie told
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:25.400]  me, I think we're going to have Chuck very soon in person here, so that's always great
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:31.560]  because he's a really smart guy, but right now it's play a few minutes of O'Keeffe who
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:37.560]  is just on fire because again, it's the arrogance in how they're talking about, they're calling
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:42.240]  us pieces of crap and we know that we put out a clip of Hillary, saying black people
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:47.960]  are subhuman, they block it because they don't want you to see Hillary saying blacks are
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:52.600]  super predators and aren't good people and deserve longer prison sentences, that's the
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:56.920]  stuff and it's in the WikiLeaks they censor, they all do it, then they deny they do it,
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:00.880]  well you're going to get antitrust suits and discrimination suits and you are getting
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:06.480]  sued and I told you I was going to sue you, but I was told, Alex, shine on once the class
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:11.360]  action goes, now you see all the lawsuits with my name in them, every one of the damn things,
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:14.680]  excuse me, let's go ahead and go to this clip from the Project Veritas Expo's day, it's
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:19.640]  on infowars.com right now, get our articles about it and tweet it at the head of Twitter
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:21.640]  from real Alex Jones right now, here's the clip.
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:44.280]  The idea of the shadow band is that you ban someone but they don't know they've been
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:49.520]  banned because they keep posting but no one sees their content, so they just think that
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:53.240]  no one's engaging with their content when in reality no one's seeing it, I don't know
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:54.240]  if Twitter does this anymore.
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:55.240]  How do you know if it's a lie and not a number of times?
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.240]  You use machine learning, you look for a Trump or America or any of like 5,000 keywords to
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:57.240]  describe a redneck and then you look and you like parse all the messages, all like the
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:27:58.240]  pictures and then you look for like stuff that matches like that stuff.
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:27:59.240]  So is it going to like ban, essentially ban certain mindsets and or people who have
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:29.040]  to kill everybody and murder everybody, he stays up, and they call it a murder, and they
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:35.160]  call, oh don't be negative, don't say that, oh look the lowest black, we tweeted this
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:40.160]  week, the lowest black unemployment level ever to millions of people on our platforms
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:44.720]  and got a couple hundred responses, because they were only seeing it at real Alex Jones
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:49.200]  or at Prison Planet with Paul, and Paul's one of the biggest guys on Twitter despite
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:53.760]  the fact you have to go to his Twitter page to even see the material.
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:57.800]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of my pillow, and like all of you out there, I
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:02.040]  had problem sleeping, pillows would go flat, I would flip flop all night long, I would
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:05.680]  wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache or feel like I needed a nap even though I
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:06.840]  slept eight hours.
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:10.400]  When I invented my pillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patent and fill to
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:15.040]  give you the exact support you need as an individual regardless of sleep position.
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:19.320]  My pillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer,
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:22.960]  it's not about how much time we spend in bed, it's about how much of that quality sleep
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:23.960]  we get.
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:27.760]  I do all of my own manufacturing right here in the United States, I have a 10 year warranty

[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:33.680]  nothing to lose.

[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:38.720]  free.

[02:31:55.160 --> 02:32:00.440]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:05.560]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same. Fluorolife
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:10.360]  probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:16.000]  directly into the intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:20.760]  most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:25.760]  gut health and your wallet. Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most,
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.160]  including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism. Did you know
[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:35.720]  that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why. Increasing gut probiotic
[02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:40.680]  levels is so important for overall health. Fluorolife is sold as a 15-billion probiotic
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:45.720]  for everyday maintenance care and a 50-billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration

[02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:34.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:38.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, he only executed the law faithfully as a federal officer with
[02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:45.480]  an astounding track record and exemplary awards. In the DEA, then he was one of the
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:49.680]  longest-serving most successful sheriffs ever in Maricopa County, executing a law. Then
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:54.520]  George Soros put millions of dollars in to stop him, clear election fraud, removed him
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:59.360]  very narrowly, and now like a phoenix rising back, despite the fact that the globalists
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:06.760]  are giving 20-to-1 money to his competitor, he's now in a dead heat, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:11.880]  Joe Arpaio in dead heat with, I'm not going to say their name, in GOP race for U.S. Senate
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:18.080]  in Arizona. Now, just like internal bots should, and I told you that Trump was 15 points ahead,
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:23.800]  Hillary stole five states, tried to steal others, state homeland securities exposed it.
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:28.520]  We now know seven-plus-million people voted with the names of dead folks. Project Veritas
[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:33.280]  exposed the Democrats admitting that. They're going to hit him with massive fraud, but it
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:38.840]  doesn't matter. We have all got to get very aggressive to get Sheriff Arpaio, who's already
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:43.880]  served a long, long career to defend this republic in there, but we can do it. Just like we got
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:47.400]  the message to President Trump, he didn't even know that he was going to be put in
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:51.840]  prison by a federal judge for executing the law. So we can do it, and this is the time,
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:57.040]  but we are facing criminals, and so he is the guy we must have. I'm not saying the other
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:03.040]  candidates evil. I'm just saying he is, he is the literal knight in shining armor, the
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:07.720]  committed person, and it's a message to the globalists as well. You destroy people that
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:11.160]  stand up for what's right. We will rebuild in the next day. You know, I want to use the
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:15.720]  Christ allegories, but we'll use the Phoenix allegories. He's out in Phoenix. Sheriff Joe
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:20.920]  for America.com. These are establishment polls where we know they, you know, sample establishment
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:26.360]  people, but it's just amazing. How do folks get behind this? Tell us about the Senate
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:28.240]  race, and thanks for joining us.
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:35.880]  Well, thank you. Thank you for your hard work, Alex. Glad we have you. You can always listen
[02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:42.520]  to the other networks that they call fake news. So thank you.
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.320]  Well, thank you. Yeah, they've been saying, and I say there's a Mars base with kids on
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:50.160]  it. There's no video of me saying it. They just say, I said that just like they say you
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:56.840]  hate Mexicans when, you know, you're married to, I mean, it's just, they're such liars.
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:02.280]  Well, yeah, but that's something they've been after me since I, at least the last 15 years
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:09.600]  when I started the fight against illegal immigration and, you know, what happened in the last election,
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:18.400]  the biggest fraud that they perpetrated against me emanating from the holder and Obama district
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:24.600]  judges wouldn't even give me a jury trial. So I can go on and on on a misdemeanor contempt
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:29.880]  the court. How can you beat a contempt the court by a judge? You think the other judges
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:34.440]  are going to rule against me or for me? No, they rule against me.
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:37.080]  Well, we've only got you for this segment in the next and I want to get into the Senate
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:40.880]  race. I want listeners all over the country to donate to get involved, to travel there,
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:44.240]  to get on the job, to show them you destroy one of our people. We will build them back
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:48.480]  up. And this is so important to get you in the Senate, but expanding on that, since you
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:51.920]  raised that, we now know, can we put it behind me on screen for TV viewers? Because our folks
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:56.120]  built this working with our folks. We have the list. In fact, I lost my list. We guys
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:00.560]  bring it back in the list of the people at the Justice Department and FBI that we compiled
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.560]  that have either recused themselves, been fired or removed from the deputy director
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:12.280]  on down. There's the list. Obama, Lynch, Comey, Sally Yates, of course, Hillary fired
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:21.320]  by not being elected. McCabe or Carlin, Page, Skork, Baker, Prenstab and then on down, literally
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:26.600]  all the same people hiring their wives and husbands at Fusion GPS for the fake dossier.
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:30.400]  McCain then delivers the fake dossier, got caught lying about it. Just the way they
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:35.280]  tried to kangaroo court you into prison, this whole Russia thing about Trump. I mean, you've
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:39.560]  been on the parallel rails, you know, literally being railroaded into prison like they're
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:43.680]  trying to do our president when it turns out Hillary is above her eyeballs in Russian
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:45.720]  collusion. Can you speak to that?
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:53.000]  Well, you know, it was sad because I spent, what, 30 years with the federal drug enforcement
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:59.640]  miss most of the time in management, regional director, I can go on and on. And my whole
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:05.480]  life was dedicated in that federal system. And now I'm what I'm hearing that's going
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:12.760]  on in Washington with our law enforcement agencies and officials and the federal courts. It's
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:17.880]  kind of sickening. But you know what, you got to be a fighter. I did run for sheriff
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:26.160]  in 92 and I got beat last, just last year. And you know, the story behind that. And I
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:31.200]  went into retirement, decided to come out of retirement, which I really wasn't retired.
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:37.160]  I was still active in certain situations. So I decided my wife and I've been married
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:46.880]  60 years, a couple of weeks ago. So I had to talk to her on this. And I decided to run
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:53.720]  for US Senate with the flake seat. So I'm going to take a lot of criticism. Alex, you
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:39:00.200]  know that there's, right now they're hitting me in all ways. You can think of the head
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:06.800]  of the Democratic Party, Tom Perez, he's the one that did the hatchet job on me, according
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:13.320]  to orders from Obama. And now he's saying he's going to get me no matter what it takes.
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:22.200]  You know, he can be my guest, call me a convicted criminal, the misdemeanor, attempt a course.
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:30.080]  Same time you can get for a dog barking. Now the president Trump pardon me on that case.
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:35.240]  He knew it was all garbage. So I have to thank him. Well, plus you were convicted by a Democrat
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:39.600]  operative judge. That's why parallel to, if we can put that on full screen for people
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:45.520]  of almost everyone in that small network of people, 25 total, but only about 12 in the
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:49.040]  inner circle, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. I
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:52.360]  mean, you know, we're not talking about many people, total 20 something. And almost all
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:56.480]  of them have been totally discredited and they're on, they're on their own email and
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:02.480]  text messages admitting it's a fraud, premeditatedly to set the president up. Same thing on you.
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:04.880]  They're committed to crimes, not us.
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:12.160]  Well, but they don't know I have some information regarding that situation, and so on. So I'll
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:19.160]  be talking about that soon, the people behind that. So when they take me on, they seem to
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:24.600]  forget I'm not a typical politician. I'm a law enforcement official. I've been around
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:33.920]  it sure for 24 years, then all my other experience. So I have information. I'm not some politician
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:40.960]  that goes by boat records and then they switch over at the last minute to say how great our
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:47.720]  president is, which of course he is. So when you're dealing with a law enforcement guy,
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:55.280]  it does take on tough issues, including the fake birth certificate, and how they went
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:00.920]  after me, the Justice Department, they're doing the same thing against Donald Trump.
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:07.440]  So I'm used to that. And I feel sorry for the president. And I'm going to, I hope I
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:14.680]  get elected to the Senate, be an ally in front of his and all because that means it helps
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:21.160]  Arizona. His policies and agenda helps the people of Arizona that I expect to represent.
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:26.280]  Well, that's the bottom line is that we are all been on the same path, not as much as
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.040]  you or not as much as Trump. I mean, I've not personally been through what you've been
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:32.760]  through, but I'm a lot younger. I've experienced going after your kids, your family, your name,
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:38.480]  lying about you, trying to destroy your business, suing you. And that's why if somebody's good,
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:41.760]  standing up for the average person and really being wholesome, they're going to come after
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:46.560]  you. And it's the same thing. It's like Trump said two years ago, look, the Dream Act as
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:50.200]  it is, is a blank check to come in and bring your family in. If you can prove you've been
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:53.720]  here, been here legally since you were a kid, whatever, yeah, go to a judge will let you
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:56.880]  stay. Then he says, we're going to do that now. They go, Oh, the right wing says Trump's
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:03.080]  backtracking. No, that was the media misrepresenting saying he hates Mexicans. Just like you always,
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.080]  you don't get lied about. And then, and then they say you flip flop when you say nice things
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:13.400]  because they're misrepresenting what you really said. Yeah. Well, you're talking about all
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:19.240]  these activists and they sell you and you're talking about the news media. There's some
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:24.720]  good people in the news media. You know that you're in a news media. You're a good guy.
[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:31.000]  You get your message across. So that's something you have to put up when you're high profile
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.520]  and zeroing in on you and using the power of the United States government with all their
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:42.320]  money and their agendas. It's sad. It's sad. Let's come back and talk about the campaign
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:47.120]  and how we help you get elected because it's a strong message to the establishment Republicans,
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:50.280]  the Democrats, everybody else. You're not going to be able to jackknife this like they
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:56.920]  did with Roy Moore. If we get behind Sheriff Arpaio, I want to plow into all of this. I'm
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:03.320]  going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:09.480]  you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:16.320]  infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any clearer. And so
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:20.560]  it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com. I don't want to thank
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:24.480]  everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:29.880]  and with high quality atomic iodine. And you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:33.960]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my dad with colloidal silver
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:41.800]  and iodine as well. infowarslife.com or triple-A-253-3139. And your purchase of the products stands
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:45.320]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:49.560]  satanic pedophile armies. And that's who they are. And they know we know who they are and
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:54.600]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:44:00.920]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:08.040]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill,
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.080]  a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate because
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:19.440]  it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:24.840]  to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people a hundred, two-hundred
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:29.040]  dollars for the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:36.480]  and developers. Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen,
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:41.280]  you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:48.800]  has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill, now available

[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:12.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back, final segment with Sheriff Joe Arpaio,
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:18.400]  one of the most embattled individuals in modern history, a true fighter. Even if you disagree
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:23.320]  with his policies, you've got to admire how focused he is, how dedicated his energy. But
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:26.560]  then you actually study his real policies. He's a great guy. You see what the media says
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:31.800]  about him? It's total crap. I see stuff in the news all the time, I never said. Hillary's
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.880]  killing kids in the basement of a pizza place. There's no video, there's no audio. They just
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:41.480]  make it up, cobble it together. Notice a lot of times you watch the news, so-called news,
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:47.160]  you'll see audio of me, but not the show that's also TV. Because they can edit the audio,
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:50.880]  folks, and it's just so frustrating. And I told people I'm going to start suing folks.
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:54.640]  That was my next question for Sheriff Joe Arpaio. I was in a dead heat for the Republican
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:48:01.960]  primary there to be running for Senate, which is so important right now with them trying
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:05.880]  to get enough votes to impeach the president. Because a lot of Republican establishment
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:09.880]  folks, they're saying might actually go with an impeachment if we lose the midterms in
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:15.720]  2018 and just a seat or two could be key. So could it be Trump that saved Arpaio from
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:20.800]  a fraudulent investigation, and then Arpaio saves Trump? That tends to be the way destiny
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:26.120]  works. But regardless, I don't go to the audience and bitch at you and say, hey, do more, buy
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:29.640]  more products, spread the articles, thank our affiliates more. I know you're doing a
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:34.960]  lot, but we're all in a fight. So everybody needs to seriously go to Sheriff Joe or Sheriff
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:40.880]  Joe for America.com, Sheriff Joe for America.com, and they need to donate, and they need to
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:44.640]  volunteer, and they need to get involved because in the polls he's either a head or neck and
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:48.040]  neck, but you know they're going to have people voting in the names of dead people. You know
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:51.480]  they get the illegals and hop them all up and tell them he's the enemy just because he's
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:54.720]  for law and order, and they're going to try to vote against him and there's serious fraud
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:59.560]  in Arizona. So we need to get him five, 10, 15 points ahead to even have a chance of winning
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:04.080]  like Trump did, which we can do if you take action. But there's nothing about shooting
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:09.520]  our mouths off. It's about doing a show, a Sheriff Joe or Arpaio. What can we do to make
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:11.720]  sure you win this primary?
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:19.720]  Well, just what you're doing now, Alex, I appreciate it putting that word out and motivating
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:27.080]  my base. I never lost a Republican primary. Even in the last election, I won by 40 percent
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:34.200]  on a Republican primary, so I have strong support across the state. I've had that for
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:42.480]  years and years. I want to thank all the people in other counties for always supporting me,
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:47.400]  not that they could vote for me and so on, but I've been campaigning, not campaigning,
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:53.360]  giving speeches constantly, not only there, but recently across the nation, and I've been
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:50:01.440]  doing that, helping the Republican Party. When Donald Trump ran, no matter wave act,
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:09.640]  in June of 15, he announced, and he came here for his first rally in July 2015. I introduced
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:15.600]  him. You couldn't get any politics to get on a stage, but I did. I never met him prior
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:23.000]  to that. I like what I heard, and I said he will be the next president, and he is. He
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:29.480]  made it, and I'll tell you, I don't go against people that I endorse. I stick with him to
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:35.280]  the bitter end, especially President Trump. I'm with him to the bitter end. I don't like
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:39.000]  to say bitter. It's going to be a successful one, but you know what I'm talking about.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.240]  But like Churchill said, we're going to defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We're
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:44.880]  going to go on to the end, and we'll never surrender.
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:55.160]  Yeah. I don't surrender either, and I talked to my wife. We've been married 60 years, two
[02:50:55.160 --> 02:51:00.120]  weeks ago. I'm not forgetting that. I'm trying to get the time spent. It's about two weeks
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:05.600]  ago. I talked to her about renness. He's tough, too. This isn't easy for her, but I'm doing
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:11.600]  enough for just the president. I'm doing it for our country. I'm doing it for Arizona.
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:20.600]  You know, we have two senators here, and they're not good friends of the president. Well, he's
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:25.960]  going to have, I'm going to go to Washington, and I'm not going to rubber stamp everything
[02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:32.200]  he does, but I'll tell you one thing. I'm never going to go against him even after he
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:37.760]  makes a decision. I mean, I'd agree with it, but he's still the commander-in-chief. He
[02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:44.280]  still runs this country. I still support the people of Arizona, and if there is a disagreement,
[02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:49.920]  I will talk to the people of Arizona and let them know what the president is doing.
[02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:56.080]  So I'm, but I can't, I can't, I can't go back against him. It's not in my style.
[02:51:56.080 --> 02:52:00.320]  Well, sure. And I mean, Flake is a Democrat, a backstabber. He's a total joke, and I feel
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:03.840]  sorry for folks that have the name Flake, but of the name Fitch, of the shoe Fitch.
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:09.120]  A Flake by any other name is still a Flake. You've got these flaky rhinos. And again,
[02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:12.520]  what you've done versus what they said about you, all the fights, the fact that you're
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:18.080]  committed to do this, this is all the more reason for everybody to get involved and imagine
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:22.260]  how angry they're going to be if you end up being the guy that takes Flake's seat and
[02:52:22.260 --> 02:52:25.760]  you are, you are so incredibly close.
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:32.280]  Well, you know, I'm going there for the people of Arizona. I'm not part of what they call
[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:37.400]  the establishment. You know, I get along with everybody. Even in foreign countries, I got
[02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:42.080]  along with the American globalists. So just because you're not anti-government, you're
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:44.920]  pro-American government, but you are anti-globalist.
[02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:52.200]  Yeah. And by the way, not just law enforcement. I love what the president's policies are,
[02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:59.520]  whether it's the patriotism, the economy, how he speaks out, because when you speak
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:03.840]  out, it's a deterrence. That's why illegal immigration has gone down. Because I've been
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:08.160]  through all this. He went out public. He told everybody, you come across the border, you're
[02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:12.600]  going to get locked up. Well, that's a big deterrence when the president is saying that.
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:16.840]  So baby, they're not coming across the border because they know he said you're going to
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:23.720]  be locked up. Exactly. Let's expand on that. Who would think 11 months and 21 days into
[02:53:23.720 --> 02:53:31.440]  the presidency, we'd have a 25,000 stock market, 3.3% growth rate, 2 million new jobs, the
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:36.920]  biggest start-ups ever, the lowest black unemployment ever. And I try to tweet lowest black unemployment
[02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:44.520]  numbers ever. Twitter blocks it. I mean, the censorship is insane. That's sad. That is
[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:50.760]  very sad. And it's very, you know, when they talk about the president's polls, which nobody
[02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:57.160]  should believe. Exactly. You know how they're stacking the deck. But what about Congress?
[02:53:57.160 --> 02:54:02.600]  They're way lower than the president. What about the media? They're way down there. I
[02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:08.600]  guess car salesmen get to say it. Well, you know what it is, Joe? There's a lot of cowards
[02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:11.840]  when they get called or get a poll sent to them. They don't want to say they support
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:18.480]  Trump because they think it might hurt them, but they have the computer bots on these apps
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:22.400]  mainly. And we knew before the election, Trump was 15 points ahead, according to Silicon
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:26.240]  Valley. That's why they were panicking so hard. There was even articles about it, but he was
[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:32.280]  15 points ahead. And that, I mean, look at all the evidence of fraud versus, and I'm
[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:37.120]  not getting into all whether more was good or bad. The point was Judge Roy Moore, they
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:40.520]  said he was 15 points behind, but he lost by half a point. And then they had all these
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:45.280]  Democrats on video saying, we came here to vote. We came here to, I mean, they're admittedly
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:46.280]  in fraud.
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:54.840]  Yeah, I'm a little suspicious of what happened to me with, you know, uh, you know, this,
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:55:00.640]  uh, billionaire George Soros pumped in over three and a half million hours against me
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:07.720]  in 30 days. Come on. The Justice Department, uh, the day before early voting, before a
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:13.240]  judge would not give me a bench trial on this misdemeanor, so they're going to charge him.
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:19.760]  Two weeks later, they charged me with a misdemeanor said, I'm going to go to prison for six months.
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:24.760]  Think of that. In the midst of an election, people voting, violation of the Department
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:29.840]  of Justice guidelines, they hit me. Why didn't they do it a little earlier? They've been
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:36.200]  after me since Obama took off at 60 days. So after all these years, they end up getting
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:43.240]  me on a contempt of court because a judge who has his bias threw it over to have a criminal
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:50.240]  investigation. Think of that. Unbelievable. That's okay. I'm going to, I'm going to Washington.
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:55.560]  I'm going to straighten a lot of things out. If they don't put me on any committees. Okay.
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:00.080]  I'll form my own committees. So we'll see what happens. And that's what the president's
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:04.680]  going to do in six days with his fake news awards. We're just taking the narrative back
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:09.920]  and, you know, they censor assault everything else. We just create our own systems. That's
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:15.520]  right. And, uh, once again, the president knows what he's doing. I think that's what's
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:19.640]  really scares everybody, but that's why they keep going after. Yeah. They're saying he's,
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:23.200]  he's, he's an idiot and mentally ill and all this. Well, that's the case. We need more
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:28.520]  of that share of Joe for America.com. Uh, and we hope people go and donate and support
[02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:31.680]  and we'll track, uh, as you go, I got a gut feeling you're going to win if people get
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:35.040]  behind you. But regardless, you're going to inject real ideas and you were, I got to
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:38.640]  say it. I mean, we got to admire fighters to peer share of Joe to these millennials
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:42.400]  who are a lot of them are great folks, but just so entitled, so lazy, this fellow for
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:47.160]  his country, uh, fighting super hard and sharper than, you know, 20 year olds out there when
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:51.000]  he's 80 plus years old. I don't say that as a bad thing. It's a positive thing. And we're
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.720]  very, very proud of your share of Joe for everything you've done and then let them attack
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:57:00.480]  you and lie about you. We really appreciate you. Thank you. Thanks. Oh, there he goes.
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:03.880]  And, and I'm going to come back and hit some real key news and we've got a guest host
[02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:10.000]  joining us, but you know, I remember 20 years ago, you know, about Joe and they go, it's
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.440]  a bad guy because I was more of a liberal libertarian kind of guy. Then actually went
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:19.560]  and saw what he would do. And it wasn't true. I mean, you can't just go to Russia or Mexico
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.400]  or anywhere else and just walk across and you have a baby for free. We don't hate anybody.
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:27.400]  And they just turned it into this now. And then some of the minorities that buy into this,
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:31.600]  who are now the majority, actually think everybody hates them and then they get racist. And that
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:36.400]  makes more races on the other side. The globalists are using us against each other and they hate
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:40.600]  people like herpio because he wants to bring back prosperity. Spread the live links. We

[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:31.600]  Now if you're a new viewer or listener you need to listen very very carefully but if you're a
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:36.960]  regular listener or viewer we're live but once this is posted to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter you name
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:46.320]  it. I am begging you to take this video and get it out to everybody you know. If I walk around
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:51.560]  this office, if I walk out there in that control room, a lot of folks that want to go in there and
[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:58.360]  that's fine, I can point to this person's child died after taking a vaccine in that control room.
[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:07.640]  This person took the typhoid oral and made her super super sick and they admitted it made her
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:13.320]  sick and they said this may make it we can never take any other vaccines again and this man volunteers
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:19.720]  at Dell Children's Hospital works at radio and TV great guy and he took the flu shot a month ago
[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:26.360]  and got deathly ill and hadn't been here for a couple weeks. My dad's retired a semi-retired
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:31.320]  neurosurgeon he has all these patients he's had for decades they come in he sees them they die he
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:36.040]  talks to their husbands and wives they go oh we all took the same shingles shot he knew a couple
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:40.520]  people in a month a couple years ago before he's semi-retired that were his long-term patients that
[03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:47.240]  died after they took the shingle shot which is basically just like a form of herpes that you
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:51.480]  get across your body but you take the vaccine so but one of our crew and I'm not knocking the others
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:57.000]  don't want to be public I'm just saying Oprah's like you get a car you get a car you get a dead
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:02.440]  child I'm not trying to be mean it's it's terrible you get you know get super sick you get to almost
[03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:09.320]  die of the flu you get to have a convulsion we're doing this to warn people my mother was a triathlete
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:14.120]  who didn't get into it till she was like 35 she was winning gold and silver medals at the regional
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:19.720]  and national level against former olympic athletes the team told her at UT take the shot
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:27.000]  she was sick for a month almost died done at like 48 years old so
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:35.080]  we're joined by Connor Yarbrough one of our great uh by producers and engineers here
[03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:39.080]  just in the next few minutes to tell you the story about what happened to him in the so-called
[03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:44.280]  flu shot because we got the studies it doubles your chances of getting the flu shot uh of getting
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.600]  the flu the next year or that it never matches up with mutations it doesn't help you but
[03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:53.480]  but we can show the news articles where MMR admittedly gives people's measles mumps rubella
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:58.520]  we can show you that the mumps outbreaks directly tied to the vaccine or my grandmother said oh yeah
[03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:03.080]  I got the second polio vaccine and they told me I got polio a week later a vaccine and the doctors
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:07.560]  told me I got it from the live polio vaccine in 1950 whatever she just died last year and
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:12.440]  was basically handicapped her whole life after she had my mom and my uncle but but enough of me
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:16.920]  we'll probably hold them over the next segment a little bit uh why don't you tell folks uh Connor

[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:25.480]  skinny guy before you look good but looks like you lost what 25 pounds what happened
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:29.480]  I did lose a little bit of weight over the last few days but what happened was
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:33.960]  so like you said I volunteered a local area children's hospital and as a requirement
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:38.920]  we are expected to get the flu shot you know and to make sure that we don't spread any chance
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:43.960]  of the flu getting to any of the kids in the hospital there um I got the shot about late
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:49.320]  November and around last Friday I started feeling a little icky after I got out of work here and I
[03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:53.720]  thought it may have been due to a lot of the dust from a lot of the work me and the other engineers
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:58.200]  have been doing around here thought maybe I just got some allergies or something went home that
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:03.480]  evening started giving some chills next thing I knew I was in bed the entire past weekend
[03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:08.680]  thankfully I just coincidentally had a doctor's appointment come Monday and surely enough they
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:14.680]  figured out it was the flu right away and you know I mean I I still don't sound entirely
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:18.680]  too great right now but I've been on Tama flu this entire past week I'm probably going to be
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:23.560]  out at the children's hospital for at least the next oh I don't know good couple of weeks here
[03:04:23.560 --> 03:04:29.080]  and I mean reports have said that about 25 percent of the admitted cases to that children's hospital
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:34.200]  right now have been for the flu and this has been one of the biggest outbreaks Texas has seen
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:39.480]  in quite some time so you know this is definitely one of the more severe cases that
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:45.880]  this area has ever seen but for me you know this is definitely one of the sickest I've ever felt
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:51.000]  let's talk about it when we come back everybody knows take the flu shot get sick stay with us

[03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:32.040]  you know i hate talking about it but it's something i gotta do
[03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:37.240]  again my grandmother back in the early 50s great lady i just died last year
[03:06:38.680 --> 03:06:45.320]  benny grace hammon she during the whole polio outbreak went and got her first polio shop
[03:06:45.320 --> 03:06:48.760]  with the first train a couple months later they said you need to get the new strength she went
[03:06:48.760 --> 03:06:53.480]  and got it a week later that's what it takes about seven days she got it and the doctor told her
[03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:59.960]  well you you had a bad reaction to the live virus which i guess they thought had been attenuated
[03:06:59.960 --> 03:07:05.320]  somehow or was a watered down virus and and she ended ate the nerves in about half her body and
[03:07:05.320 --> 03:07:14.040]  she refused to be in a wheelchair until she was about 92 and but it just ate the nerves in most
[03:07:14.040 --> 03:07:20.680]  her muscles so she was paralyzed about more than half her body and so she finally died of natural
[03:07:20.680 --> 03:07:25.400]  causes it was it was a good it was a good thing she didn't she was a christian so she refused to
[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:30.600]  take opium or you know go to hospice or any of that uh she still kept eating and she had breast
[03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:36.360]  cancer seven years before uh and and had one breast removed and didn't like it so she she
[03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:39.960]  got cancer again she said i'm just gonna let it so she had obviously cancer probably all over
[03:07:39.960 --> 03:07:44.360]  her body when she died but she refused to be seen by the doctors but you know what the very breast
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:50.120]  cancer she had out to their files is the is one associated with sv 40 that was also in the polio
[03:07:50.120 --> 03:07:56.680]  shot so they didn't just give you the polio virus they gave you simian virus associated with uh
[03:07:57.400 --> 03:08:03.160]  fatty tissue and uh hormone base and i'm not a cancer doctor i've just had probably 50 of them
[03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:08.280]  on over the years and had the top papers on it and so evidence shows the doctors told her we gave
[03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:14.760]  you polio but they probably gave her breast cancer as well so again you need to research sv 40 and
[03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:21.640]  all of it for yourself i had the head of one of the biggest change of pediatric facilities
[03:08:22.440 --> 03:08:27.080]  because he was not anti-vaccine but he put in the file and online when i first heard having
[03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:33.160]  children 15 years ago that you did not have to be vaccine he wouldn't kick you out of his clinic
[03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:38.520]  and i went there and a couple times i brought my son and another daughter i've been there a few
[03:08:38.520 --> 03:08:44.440]  years and i finally got that doctor his first name began with an h and he said he goes you know i
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:49.480]  like your show you're actually right he goes you know we're giving people 1960s live polio vaccine
[03:08:49.480 --> 03:08:54.760]  at these free government clinics in alex it's illegal since the 1970s to give it it's got
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:59.640]  wide spectrum cancer virus and i said no i know and they're always shocked somebody knows this he
[03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:04.120]  goes okay i just want to say you're right he walks out he comes back to the room he was a big guy
[03:09:04.120 --> 03:09:09.560]  and he grabs him by the arm look like a linebacker he had a big beard and he goes hard by almost
[03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:16.360]  hitting he goes don't you tell anybody i told you that though i said you know i just don't say my name
[03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:22.440]  just don't say my name and he he shuffles out so that was a guy doing what he thought was right
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:28.600]  because he knew how dangerous it was you know they put syphilis in black people's vaccines they
[03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:33.320]  hillary apologized for what was going on in peru putting it in their vaccines and giving it to
[03:09:34.040 --> 03:09:37.160]  millions of peruvians ended up getting it they gave it to over a hundred thousand
[03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:42.440]  to take shoot these black men up with syphilis and then they let them go to go be promiscuous
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:50.520]  and spread it microscopic worm that eats your brain so remember it's not just science that they
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:55.000]  say we're against it's that if you look at the studies even if the flu shot doesn't give you
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:00.360]  the flu it never guesses the right mutation this is admitted and in canadian and british studies it
[03:10:00.360 --> 03:10:06.200]  lowers your immunity for at least a year to flu by 50 percent so a lot of people say oh my god i
[03:10:06.200 --> 03:10:09.880]  wouldn't get the flu shot and i got it two weeks later and i want to just blame the flu shot because
[03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:14.840]  they've been caught adding stuff and simulants in the hv you know all the rest of it and the
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:21.560]  h1n1 that was a swine flu variant but a lot of times it's not really giving you the flu it's
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:27.240]  lowering your immune system to get the other flu viruses thousands of which there are and
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:31.160]  mr rapaport of no more fake news dot com what were some of the biggest news outlets out there and
[03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:34.280]  then they've been exposing them for decades he's really an expert on this he's got a bunch of
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:40.920]  other topics to cover but i wanted uh to have connor yarbrough finish up uh just his experience of
[03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:45.800]  volunteering he's done for years at del children's they tell the nurses everybody take the shot uh
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:49.960]  and you because you were staying off air you've you've had the flu and and and how many years
[03:10:49.960 --> 03:10:55.160]  but you're a really healthy guy the last time i had the flu was in 2009 and that was when i had
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:11:01.640]  h1n1 actually um but i didn't even take a vaccine around that point in time and i haven't taken the
[03:11:01.640 --> 03:11:06.760]  flu shot in years i'm you know i've always been a believer into that myth or however you want to
[03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:11.560]  describe it as you get the flu shot you get the flu and so i've just never gotten it and this is
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:18.360]  the first time i've gotten the flu shot probably gosh and i as long as i can remember and lo and
[03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:24.520]  behold i actually got the flu this time around so you know i mean it's i don't know i'm gonna
[03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:28.680]  say that it's true or not but i mean it's the way you put it you know i mean it definitely
[03:11:28.680 --> 03:11:33.400]  felt like something was weakened within me that i ended up contracting something where
[03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:37.400]  i definitely got incredibly incredibly sick i mean this past weekend you know i mean
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:42.200]  i couldn't sleep very well i mean i was in and out of consciousness a lot throughout sleeping
[03:11:42.200 --> 03:11:47.720]  i'd wake up sometimes my whole bed was just absolutely soaked in sweat and it's just and
[03:11:47.720 --> 03:11:51.480]  it's the most miserable i've felt in a good while i mean you can still tell my voice right now
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:56.440]  things are still not entirely leveled off yet at this point and by the way people don't just
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:00.120]  to believe me you can go read the studies you can type into a search engine they bury it you got to
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:08.040]  look uh cdc you know cbc was a canadian broadcasting uh government report uh taking the flu shot
[03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:14.440]  double chances of flu next season there's a british in a nih report this is all there thank you for
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:18.040]  sharing your story because i don't make the crew get on air they don't want to get on air a lot of
[03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:21.320]  want to get on air we're going to launch some new shows made up of the great crews there's
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:24.920]  really a smart group of people maybe i get some of the other people around here to talk about their
[03:12:24.920 --> 03:12:30.280]  experiences but they're pretty painful because it's not just full grown men getting the flu it's uh
[03:12:31.640 --> 03:12:36.200]  it's it's it's things that i'm not going to talk about but we all know uh in this building
[03:12:36.760 --> 03:12:44.040]  of not many people i mean in that control room it is like armageddon from all of this uh and and
[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:48.520]  so let's just understand that uh let's go ahead and go to john rapaport spend three minutes here
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:52.680]  just on this topic yourself and i've got a lot to cover i'm going to hand the baton over to you my
[03:12:52.680 --> 03:13:00.280]  friend go ahead well alex i mean this is a straight out truth delivered right from the shoulder
[03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:05.880]  these things these vaccines are destructive they have nothing to do with health and
[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:13.000]  people understand thousands and thousands of doctors mainstream doctors they understand this
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:20.040]  just like this doc that you talk to they know what's going on they understand that the whole idea of
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:28.120]  vaccination involves what they call adverse effects meaning destruction destruction of the body
[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:34.520]  destruction of the immune system uh chronic allergies autism you name it they know that
[03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:40.520]  everyone i know that's been in the military special operations enlisted delta force you name it
[03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:45.880]  says they were totally healthy they give a hundred guys the shot 20 of them get sick one of them would
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:54.120]  die i mean they know exactly and that was you know the anthrax shot and and other shots and who knows
[03:13:54.120 --> 03:14:00.200]  what they put into all of that stuff so this is like an open secret we're talking about it's like
[03:14:00.200 --> 03:14:08.040]  an open sewer inside the medical cartel and the doctors know it medical reporters know it i've
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:15.000]  talked to them off the record over the years and they're just too afraid to say anything they refuse
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:19.720]  to come out into the light and say and now they're getting bullied where they're saying fine you all
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:24.040]  have to take the 50 something vaccines every year or even if you're in accounting a mile away from
[03:14:24.040 --> 03:14:30.200]  the hospital you're fired exactly that's their only strategy you know if they leave it up to
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:35.400]  people's choice and intelligence the whole vaccine establishment is going down in flames
[03:14:36.120 --> 03:14:41.720]  so they say well we just have to pass laws that we enforce if necessary it's a point of a gun
[03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:46.920]  wow in order to get people to take vaccines and to get their kids to take vaccines i mean
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:54.280]  in one province in a state in australia right now they're just invoking a rule no kid goes to
[03:14:54.280 --> 03:14:58.920]  childcare that's it unless you've had the full schedule of vaccine and now they want you to
[03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:03.160]  have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds it's it's just it never ends and they have liability
[03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:09.720]  protection to do whatever they want exactly 1986 they're off the hook since then the vaccine
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:16.920]  companies cannot be sued for any childhood vaccine injury or destruction or death you listen to the
[03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:21.320]  mothers talk about what happened to their children they're giving it to you straight
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:29.000]  everybody they die at the doctor's office right exactly and the doctors say well it has nothing
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:35.560]  to do with the vaccine that's why you get me on the subject because i had my wife thrown out of
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:40.120]  that clinic that that guy found it and created my children were still going there but the newest baby
[03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:43.800]  they just chewed her out tried to pressure and said you get out of here for not giving your
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:47.320]  baby all these shots and then you really didn't you talk to the doctors behind the scenes they
[03:15:47.320 --> 03:15:53.560]  don't give their kids the shots they know exactly what they're doing are you happy washing your hands

[03:22:03.480 --> 03:22:10.360]  about what alex and i were talking about as the way it goes folks so here's my stories that i was
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:18.680]  going to talk about bye bye and i'm going to talk about vaccines because this is chemical warfare
[03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:25.240]  against the population i've been writing about this and talking about it since 1987 there's no end
[03:22:25.240 --> 03:22:34.600]  in sight not going to stop now there's lots of vectors to approach this with lots of myths and
[03:22:34.600 --> 03:22:43.160]  fairy tales to explode but i want to start with this in australia what was it now a year ago
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:53.000]  so vaxed the documentary called vaxed went to australia with its producers this is a very tight
[03:22:53.880 --> 03:23:01.640]  chilling film about a cdc whistleblower named william thompson who admits that he and his
[03:23:01.640 --> 03:23:10.360]  colleagues at the cdc cheated lied on a study a scientific study of the m mr vaccine
[03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:18.280]  and said that the vaccine had no connection to autism when in fact it did that's a public
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:30.280]  confession he made a longtime cdc researcher on his whistleblower lawyer's web page rick morgan
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:38.280]  of sincenady and the cdc whistleblower william thompson the story of course you know sort of
[03:23:38.280 --> 03:23:44.040]  surfaced in the mainstream and then oh no it couldn't be true and then it went away but
[03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:51.640]  several very smart and brave people made a film a documentary about this called vaxed
[03:23:52.520 --> 03:23:58.440]  swept the nation went abroad still going abroad and when it went to australia
[03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:06.840]  people lined up around the block to see it because the press said that it was horrible and nobody
[03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:13.240]  should see it nobody should look at it because it was too dangerous this is your mainstream press
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:22.920]  you know idiots on parade well one of the producers polytomy had her visa yanked
[03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:29.720]  so that she couldn't come back to australia she was told when she left can't come back
[03:24:29.720 --> 03:24:36.360]  the visa is taken away suspended we don't want you here and one of the big reasons why was
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:41.560]  as they were taking the film around the country they began interviewing mothers
[03:24:42.200 --> 03:24:50.360]  of children that had their brains damaged and destroyed by vaccines the stories were right
[03:24:50.360 --> 03:24:57.640]  out there firsthand you didn't have to go through the new york times to get there debunking and
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:25:06.040]  their experts it was right there right there in your face and even worse poly said what really
[03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:14.200]  started the ball rolling is when they interviewed mothers of children who had never been vaccinated
[03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:23.800]  and who had been healthy from the beginning and remained healthy that as far as the government
[03:25:23.800 --> 03:25:30.120]  and the press over there was concerned was even worse that was like a silver bullet to a werewolf
[03:25:30.120 --> 03:25:39.080]  oh my god we can't oh we can't let people know the truth that if you raise kids the right way
[03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:45.800]  and raise them healthy and strong they're going to stay strong
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:54.600]  then we come to this thing called the herd effect you know this is the thing that drives people
[03:25:55.480 --> 03:26:00.360]  to surrender their children to the state you have to vaccinate your child because if you
[03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:05.240]  don't vaccinate him he's going to be a little time bomb running around and he could vaccinate
[03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:11.080]  infect my child with whatever diseases he has and my child of course has been vaccinated
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:20.040]  oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa let's break that down ma'am in other words you're saying
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:33.480]  that your child who is vaccinated and therefore protected protected has no problem unless my
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:39.320]  child gets near your child but your child is protected because your child's been vaccinated
[03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:46.840]  so what's going on here right i mean unless you think that you've been hoaxed and you shouldn't
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:54.280]  have vaccinated your child your child's protected vaccinated my child didn't get vaccinated and he's
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:27:02.840]  a threat to your little baby i don't think so otherwise why get your child vaccinated so much
[03:27:02.840 --> 03:27:07.800]  for the herd effect this is the biggest pile of bs i've ever heard and this is what's used
[03:27:07.800 --> 03:27:17.880]  to drive parents to become useful idiots in the war to force parents to vaccinate their children
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:25.800]  here little boy hasn't vaccinated well now he is exiled from the community right excommunicated
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:31.800]  from the holy order of biological mysticism that requires everybody to get vaccinated
[03:27:31.800 --> 03:27:39.400]  well no i raised my child healthy he's healthy and strong never been vaccinated never had a
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:46.280]  problem good nutrition exercise and so on what's the problem here we can't let that story get out
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:53.240]  no no no no that's not a story don't cover that don't say that hide that from everybody and hide the
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:28:02.440]  fact that in these vaccines all of them there are toxic chemicals that are injected directly
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:11.000]  into the body that bypass the normal channels of body defenses like mercury which is still
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:20.520]  in certain flu vaccines a heavy heavy neurotoxin aluminum which is in many many many most vaccines
[03:28:20.520 --> 03:28:30.280]  i would say which is a heavy heavy neurotoxin formaldehyde and polysorbate 80 you can go down
[03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:37.720]  the list look it up go to the cdc website and you'll find a list of ingredients more to say
[03:28:37.720 --> 03:28:46.120]  on vaccines we'll be back after this defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic

[03:34:26.120 --> 03:34:38.200]  first day of life hepatitis b vaccine what this is a vaccine supposedly protects people who share
[03:34:38.200 --> 03:34:47.320]  needles ivy drug users prostitutes sexually transmitted disease and so on and so forth
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:58.040]  given to babies on the first day of life other vaccines quickly follow many in the first months
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:09.320]  of life well it's universally acknowledged and pay attention to this that babies do not have
[03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:19.240]  anywhere near fully formed immune systems they just don't not even close well supposedly the
[03:35:19.240 --> 03:35:27.480]  theory behind vaccination is that it stimulates a person's immune system to provide a kind of
[03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:36.600]  rehearsal for infection when the real thing comes along if that were the case you would have to have
[03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:47.640]  an immune system intact in order for this rehearsal to take place which babies do not have so from
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:59.880]  that point of view purely the entire thing is a gigantic hoax a gigantic hoax and should be not
[03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:10.360]  only investigated but prosecuted that way from the ground up let's take another factor supposedly
[03:36:10.360 --> 03:36:20.120]  about vaccines a person's immune system is suddenly said not to be able to function on
[03:36:20.120 --> 03:36:27.000]  its own when it's there and intact no no no no no can't can't fight against disease
[03:36:28.760 --> 03:36:34.440]  in order for that to happen you have to be vaccinated so that it stimulates the immune
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:41.000]  system with a kind of a teaser of what a real disease would be like so that later on if the
[03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:46.600]  real thing happens the immune system soldiers are on guard and they say oh yes i can see it's
[03:36:46.600 --> 03:36:53.880]  from a mile away and here we go what kind of sense does that make when you really stop and think about
[03:36:53.880 --> 03:37:06.040]  it what kind of sense does that make it all none zero now here's what a vaccine can do it can weaken
[03:37:06.040 --> 03:37:16.040]  the immune system such that the immune system can't really respond fully when a real infection comes
[03:37:16.040 --> 03:37:24.360]  down the pipeline and when that is the case you will not see the familiar rashes and other symptoms
[03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:32.760]  of the infection at all because the immune system is too weak to mount a full acute
[03:37:32.760 --> 03:37:40.120]  inflammatory response which is what the immune system ought to be doing that's why you see the
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:48.360]  rashes that's why the fever occurs and so on that is a combination of an infection and the immune
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:57.480]  system mounting a full and bold and full-bodied immune response well if vaccines with their toxic
[03:37:57.480 --> 03:38:05.000]  elements and so forth have reduced the ability of the immune system to respond you don't see those
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:12.920]  symptoms and why am i saying this and why is it important because it forms the basis of
[03:38:12.920 --> 03:38:19.080]  the medical cartels saying we have wiped out many diseases with vaccines why because we don't see
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:27.800]  the symptoms get it we don't see the symptoms therefore we know that the disease has been
[03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:41.640]  wiped out false wrong incompetent liars if the immune system is weakened enough through vaccination
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:48.760]  it will not be able to produce those symptoms that are supposedly signs of the disease
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:56.040]  that's what you've got to understand and all of this hoax about oh we've wiped out many diseases
[03:38:56.040 --> 03:39:04.520]  with vaccination i've told this story before here but i'm sure there are many new listeners now
[03:39:08.680 --> 03:39:17.080]  for several decades in africa there was a gigantic campaign to wipe out smallpox with
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:24.840]  a smallpox vaccine about a hundred million people received the vaccine this was a world
[03:39:24.840 --> 03:39:34.840]  health organization program lasted 1966 to 1980 at which time the world health organization said
[03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:39.880]  this is the greatest thing that's ever happened in medical history we've wiped out smallpox
[03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:49.880]  really really because there's a warning that any competent doctor will give you about the
[03:39:49.880 --> 03:39:57.960]  smallpox vaccine in particular which is do not give it to people whose immune systems are already
[03:39:57.960 --> 03:40:06.520]  compromised and weak because then the vaccine can cause smallpox or devastate and kill the
[03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:14.600]  recipient by other means so what the hell was a world health organization doing giving a hundred
[03:40:14.600 --> 03:40:24.360]  million shots of the smallpox vaccine across africa to millions and millions and millions of people
[03:40:24.360 --> 03:40:31.080]  whose immune systems were already compromised and weakened by generation to generation hunger
[03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:38.680]  and starvation protein calorie malnutrition contaminated water supplies extreme grinding
[03:40:38.680 --> 03:40:47.960]  poverty etc overcrowding what was going on there well i found out what was going on there
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:55.880]  because i had a source who was a very good mainstream source who told me the following
[03:40:56.840 --> 03:41:03.160]  while the champagne corks were popping in 1980 and the world health organization was saying
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:09.720]  we just wiped out smallpox on the african continent they were holding a super secret
[03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:17.000]  meeting in geneva their headquarters to discuss the smallpox vaccine they had been using
[03:41:18.440 --> 03:41:27.960]  and they decided that they would never ever use that vaccine again and i said to my source why
[03:41:27.960 --> 03:41:40.360]  he said because it caused cases of smallpox caused cases of smallpox as well as many other
[03:41:40.360 --> 03:41:53.880]  kinds of devastation to people neurological gut intestinal death from the toxic vaccine
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:42:04.120]  that was the secret that was never supposed to be publicized because they were celebrating the
[03:42:04.120 --> 03:42:09.720]  fact that they had supposedly wiped out smallpox on the african continent
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:14.360]  it's things like this
[03:42:16.760 --> 03:42:21.640]  that will turn you in the direction of really looking into what this is all about
[03:42:21.640 --> 03:42:28.440]  now because what it's all about is chemical warfare against the population of the world
[03:42:29.480 --> 03:42:33.560]  in many many ways many many ways

[03:47:15.080 --> 03:47:22.760]  you can run on for a long time run on john rapaport here last segment of this fourth hour
[03:47:22.760 --> 03:47:33.640]  sitting in for alex in for wars so what's the overall agenda here first of all let's take this
[03:47:33.640 --> 03:47:42.840]  down to the ground if a doctor said to a sane mother look mom this is what i propose to do you see
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:49.000]  this sparkling little baby that you have here brimming with life that's so healthy i want to
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:58.440]  inject this baby inject now with aluminum okay which is a known neurotoxin crosses the barrier
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:08.520]  into the brain can just wreak havoc formaldehyde another toxin polysorbate 80 and a bunch of
[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:13.640]  other chemicals you know there's some antibiotics in there and so forth so on just you know you
[03:48:13.640 --> 03:48:21.080]  can read the whole list of ingredients they all have a certain amount of toxicity to to the body
[03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:28.040]  to life and then a germ at the same time that's really the heart of this a virus you're going to
[03:48:28.040 --> 03:48:33.000]  put in there that's supposed to stimulate your baby's immune system of course your baby doesn't
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:38.920]  have an immune system yet to be simulated okay so this is what i want to do okay is that all right
[03:48:38.920 --> 03:48:49.400]  with you mom that's what we're talking about here now what's the overall agenda behind this
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:58.040]  well i mean it's evil evil is always doing evil is always an agenda for some people
[03:48:58.040 --> 03:49:10.680]  but what we call globalism which is global tyranny an attempt to remake the planet
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:21.880]  with no individual countries just the country called earth under the control of an elite
[03:49:21.880 --> 03:49:31.320]  management system of oligarchs who decide how life is going to be lived on this planet by
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:39.160]  eight billion ten billion people whatever it is that's their goal that's what they're after
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:47.720]  that's what they've been doing since 1945 and first century before at least as well
[03:49:47.720 --> 03:49:54.840]  under guys of different names they exist they're real it's not a fantasy folks
[03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:02.680]  it's a political war against the population
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:14.200]  now imagine that you were one of the elite leaders in that war and your ambition was to control
[03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:23.320]  eight to ten billion people that's a pretty tall order you know i mean that's not a simple thing
[03:50:23.320 --> 03:50:30.440]  that you can just snap your fingers and overnight okay we've done it boys no problem no no no no no
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:41.320]  no this is a long protracted war you want as many people as possible to have lowered vitality
[03:50:41.320 --> 03:50:48.680]  the juice of life and strength and power to resist you want to drop their iqs as far as you
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:56.520]  possibly can you want to disorient and confuse them and weaken them in every possible way on
[03:50:56.520 --> 03:51:05.320]  every possible level you want to toxify their systems in some not just today and tomorrow but
[03:51:05.320 --> 03:51:14.360]  some chronic way over the decades and decades of a lifetime to reduce their ability to function
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:24.040]  without becoming completely dependent upon the state which means you the globalist master
[03:51:25.160 --> 03:51:32.120]  that's what you want that's what you need that's what you've got to have if you have a prayer
[03:51:32.120 --> 03:51:40.120]  of bringing the whole planet under your control let's face it that war is going to be fought
[03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:47.800]  along several fronts and it would be incredibly naive of anyone to think differently
[03:51:49.320 --> 03:51:56.520]  and one of those fronts happens to be medical and one of those medical fronts happens to be
[03:51:56.520 --> 03:52:02.600]  the vaccination which if you look at the literature since the beginning in england
[03:52:04.360 --> 03:52:15.080]  and really read it you're going to see one thing that stands out they knew they know now
[03:52:16.200 --> 03:52:23.480]  they knew then they know now that it's toxic they knew then they know now and they admit it
[03:52:23.480 --> 03:52:33.560]  in the literature that it's toxic they don't care they rationalize it away through a number of means
[03:52:33.560 --> 03:52:41.960]  they are the useful idiots right they could have 150 IQ and sit in a doctor's office they're still
[03:52:41.960 --> 03:52:54.760]  a useful idiot the people on top the Rockefeller syndicate for example which is one of the arch
[03:52:55.400 --> 03:53:00.520]  forces of globalism has been for a very long time they know what they're doing
[03:53:01.640 --> 03:53:09.400]  they understand the wise and the where for us and they always have and it isn't just money money
[03:53:09.400 --> 03:53:18.840]  money any major operation i mean in this case a global operation has levels of agenda
[03:53:21.960 --> 03:53:29.320]  money profits individuals want promotion status paycheck survival recognition
[03:53:31.880 --> 03:53:37.080]  but you get higher and higher and you see that it's about power control and destruction
[03:53:37.080 --> 03:53:46.040]  that's what this is about and when you see in the light of day the top most agenda of the vaccination
[03:53:46.680 --> 03:53:54.760]  program that has existed on this planet and keeps expanding well over 200 vaccines are now
[03:53:55.320 --> 03:54:03.080]  in the research pipeline in addition to the dozens of vaccines that are now on the CDC schedule
[03:54:03.080 --> 03:54:10.600]  to be taken by children and they're coming after the adults in case you thought you were exempt
[03:54:13.400 --> 03:54:22.840]  over 200 in the research pipeline is endless folks because it means more and more poisoning
[03:54:22.840 --> 03:54:29.640]  and destruction that's what it means this is not the kind of chemical warfare that you see
[03:54:29.640 --> 03:54:38.280]  be dropped from planes or sprayed on the ground all around this is the kind of chemical warfare
[03:54:38.280 --> 03:54:46.920]  that is carried out very soberly and rationally and with all sorts of official justification
[03:54:48.760 --> 03:54:55.400]  we're here to do good we're here to help you we're here to bring a better world about
[03:54:55.400 --> 03:55:01.880]  this is the kind of propaganda that has an effect these people are professionals they're not idiots
[03:55:01.880 --> 03:55:07.480]  when it comes to propaganda they know how to do it and that's what they're doing and that's the
[03:55:07.480 --> 03:55:18.040]  point of what they're doing at the highest levels where only a few live the rest partake of the
[03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:26.200]  conspiracy because they see some advantage for themselves and they don't see the bigger picture
[03:55:26.200 --> 03:55:31.800]  that's how you do a conspiracy oh you can't do a conspiracy because too many people would have to
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:38.120]  be in on it those are the idiots talking that don't understand how covert ops are arranged
[03:55:38.760 --> 03:55:45.080]  they're compartmentalized the people at the lower levels have only a glimpse of what's really
[03:55:45.080 --> 03:55:51.880]  happening and they have a reason within them to do what they're told to do whether it's following
[03:55:51.880 --> 03:56:00.840]  orders a paycheck survival status promotion whatever it is they do it and when you add up
[03:56:00.840 --> 03:56:07.880]  all the useful idiots you get the big picture and it's true with vaccination and vaccines at the
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:15.720]  highest level the people know what they're doing they're doing chemical warfare in order to weaken
[03:56:15.720 --> 03:56:26.760]  the global population and make the takeover of the planet that much easier and in fact possible
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:36.040]  without that without the medical cartel it would be far far more difficult if you had a global
[03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:48.200]  population mainly composed of extremely healthy vital people aware alert educated independent
[03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:53.400]  powerful creative
[03:56:56.200 --> 03:57:01.720]  this operation would have fallen into decay and dust a long time ago
[03:57:01.720 --> 03:57:10.680]  the vaccinators who are the poisoners have reversed that trend successfully and they've
[03:57:10.680 --> 03:57:17.800]  managed to blame all the poisoning effects on other things that's their job we didn't do that
[03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:22.760]  yeah the baby just folds it up and has now brain damage for the rest of his life just
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:28.360]  after the vaccination but it has nothing to do with the vaccination it's just some genetic thing
[03:57:28.360 --> 03:57:39.800]  kicked in believe that if you will or believe the truth see you next time on there
