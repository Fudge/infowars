[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:39.080]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you
[00:39.080 --> 00:52.600]  for joining us it is Monday the 25th day already the 25th day of November 2013 and we have an
[00:52.600 --> 00:58.120]  absolutely jam-packed radio broadcast lined up for you today obviously we've been tracking this
[00:58.120 --> 01:07.440]  at info wars calm in the last week since Israel and their good buddy Iran came out and excuse me
[01:07.440 --> 01:14.400]  Freud and slipped their good buddy Saudi Arabia came out and said that if they don't like the peace
[01:14.400 --> 01:22.360]  deal that is struck in Paris which was completed Saturday between Iran and the West that they're
[01:22.360 --> 01:28.600]  going to seriously look at attacking that country and that Saudi Arabia has already bought and
[01:28.600 --> 01:34.920]  purchased in his transferring which means they were there years ago the weapons nuclear weapons
[01:34.920 --> 01:42.880]  from Pakistan so they can nuke Iran I just marvel at how good my sources are because as you know
[01:42.880 --> 01:50.800]  I've been on record saying that Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons from the one-stop shop in the
[01:50.800 --> 01:58.240]  Middle East Central Asia Pakistan and that Pakistan is where they reportedly got the
[01:58.240 --> 02:08.680]  material but then were given the technology to cause chain reaction from the Ruskies and I was
[02:08.680 --> 02:13.320]  told that by a very high-level military source and another high-level military source and I was
[02:13.320 --> 02:20.080]  talking to a special warfare source that had been in a lot of really secretive operations and they
[02:20.080 --> 02:29.400]  got very very upset when I raised that and said I don't know how you know this but yes Iran has
[02:29.400 --> 02:36.360]  the bomb and stop talking to me about stuff like this and was basically like it's dangerous that
[02:36.360 --> 02:44.760]  you know that and so I'm not bragging that I know this type of stuff I don't like always having such
[02:44.760 --> 02:53.440]  accurate information but it is what it is so that's why no one said Iran but no one wants to say
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.600]  they have nukes just like Israel doesn't want to say they have nukes or then that gives other
[02:57.600 --> 03:03.800]  countries the excuse to proliferate and have nuclear weapons as well Israel has reportedly
[03:03.800 --> 03:11.520]  800 according to James weapons quarterly last time I looked mainline media here says 200 British
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.920]  news says over 400 but but James is basing England they're usually the most accurate they say upwards
[03:16.920 --> 03:21.560]  of 800 that was a few years ago I had to get into their subscription system to even get that
[03:21.560 --> 03:27.520]  information you have to buy the big quarterly book or contact them online to get information
[03:27.520 --> 03:33.840]  because most of the stuff is not public knowledge a lot of it's seen as semi classified but I guess
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.440]  that the moon is not made of cheese is classified as well that is all coming up and yeah there's
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.680]  the world in daily article Russia helping Iran accelerate nuke program with their centrifuges
[03:43.680 --> 03:52.560]  but but that's separate that was back in January that report the centrifuges need to be up to 90%
[03:52.560 --> 04:00.800]  to really make a good bomb they were up to 20% and now this new deal says 5% and if Iran actually
[04:00.800 --> 04:07.280]  follows the deal and if the UN doesn't set them up like they did Iraq this is a good deal the
[04:07.280 --> 04:12.080]  problem is the globalist are treacherous and they're going to try to claim Iran breaks the deal
[04:12.080 --> 04:17.840]  you're like what are you for Iran no I'm for peace and not having a nuclear war that's why the
[04:17.840 --> 04:23.440]  chairman of the joint chiefs a couple months ago went on Friday night and told Obama on that Saturday
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.640]  we're not going to strike you can't do it nuclear war top generals are threatening to resign and
[04:28.640 --> 04:32.560]  Obama didn't want to let him resign over that so he later just went after him for other issues
[04:32.560 --> 04:40.320]  there's been a purge and I'm not romanticizing the U.S. general staff but they're not suicidal
[04:40.320 --> 04:47.120]  they like to fight wars they can win it's real simple and the Iranians are crazy enough folks
[04:48.160 --> 04:53.280]  to launch their atomic weapons at Israel and others and then Israel is going to bomb all of
[04:53.280 --> 04:58.160]  Iran the Russians are going to respond the Chinese the India the Pakistan's it's world war three

[08:43.360 --> 08:50.320]  the 25th of day of november 2013 i am your host alex jones i want to make a little announcement
[08:50.320 --> 08:59.520]  here i will undoubtedly be calling in and skyping in tuesday wednesday thursday we're running a
[08:59.520 --> 09:05.680]  rebroadcast friday but i have absolutely sworn up and down to take my children hiking and camping
[09:05.680 --> 09:12.000]  and i never take off even when i take off i'm working constantly so i am going to take off
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.120]  the next four days but david night who is proven to be a great co-host and fill in host and host
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.720]  of info wars nightly news he will be here with most of our reporters on the nightly news and of
[09:24.720 --> 09:30.880]  course doing the radio show on tuesday and wednesday and if he wants to he can do thursday
[09:30.880 --> 09:38.720]  as well but certainly a lot of breaking news and i'll be calling in on the show wild horses
[09:38.720 --> 09:44.160]  obviously cannot and will not drag me away but i am going to take my children camping
[09:44.160 --> 09:50.560]  as promised and i was going to go to colorada and also kill two birds with one stone a few weeks
[09:50.560 --> 09:56.080]  ago and go on torch norris tv show pre-tape two episodes of that but i had a lot of family and
[09:56.880 --> 10:04.080]  info wars operation stuff pop up crop up at the very same time so i had to cancel that colorada
[10:04.080 --> 10:11.120]  camping trip so i'm going to take off a few days and do a mini trip outside austin or who knows we
[10:11.120 --> 10:14.880]  may go out to a family ranch in east texas or something i'm not sure yet but my children are
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.360]  hopping up and down absolutely ready to go do that and come back on friday and have thanksgiving with
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.720]  my parents but to hope you all have a great thanksgiving coming up as well there's obviously a lot
[10:24.720 --> 10:29.680]  of big world news breaking we're going to cover it all we have the reports right here
[10:32.080 --> 10:38.000]  i ran nuclear deals saudi arabia warrants it will strike on its own even without israel
[10:38.000 --> 10:48.000]  london telegraph and brags they've secured nuclear weapons from pakistan and of course that's not
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.400]  going to go too well because um you just watch if this happens the reason the joint chiefs have not
[10:54.400 --> 11:01.920]  allowed and they're not in command they've just they've just threatened to quit if obama tries to
[11:01.920 --> 11:09.200]  launch an attack on iran because the word is right around the time the last year of bush's
[11:09.200 --> 11:16.160]  administration six and a half seven years ago they were completing atomic weapons and warheads
[11:16.160 --> 11:23.200]  and then have now completed being able to put them on top of medium range missiles that can hit israel
[11:23.200 --> 11:29.680]  obviously and uh you want to gamble that the iron dome weapon anti-missile system will be able to
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.480]  stop them probably won't be able to stop them so i'm going to just keep announcing that you only hear
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.600]  it here and if you don't believe me that's fine uh i told you saudi arabia had nuclear weapons
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.160]  i mean south africa had them and it came out later uh there's many more countries have them
[11:44.720 --> 11:50.000]  and of course india and pakistan are the big issue if a nuclear war starts it's probably
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.960]  going to be there that's what most analysts say uh they've had a couple wars with each other over
[11:54.960 --> 12:01.600]  the disputed khazmir region and they absolutely hate each other you see folks people think the
[12:01.600 --> 12:07.120]  muslims hate america and on average they don't they want to move here and be in a freer culture but
[12:07.120 --> 12:13.360]  while still keeping their uh their you know their non-radical muslim values uh and many of them are
[12:13.360 --> 12:17.680]  great people but you do have the radical islam that the globalists have been funding supporting
[12:17.680 --> 12:22.480]  and putting in charge because they don't want truly progressive i don't mean globalist neural
[12:22.480 --> 12:28.400]  order socialist progressive but but truly progressive societies uh in the middle east
[12:28.400 --> 12:33.920]  they want backwards controlled areas run by basically better ones that british intelligence
[12:33.920 --> 12:40.400]  hired in 1903 that pretty much run the whole region now and that's what the house of sod is and
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.360]  the muslims hate each other more than anybody else and the indians and pakistan's hate each other
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.000]  now the hindus and the muslims there's a lot of groups in india but it's the hindus and
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.840]  the muslims that are really you study the the cultural battles that's the big issue that's
[12:57.840 --> 13:02.480]  how it is in africa one african tribe will hate the other african tribe right across the river
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.440]  the animus will hate the christians the christians will hate the muslims the muslims will hate the
[13:07.440 --> 13:14.960]  christians uh and people will find a reason to go rob and kill somebody so we call it racism and
[13:14.960 --> 13:22.880]  people nowadays think the only form of of um discrimination or abuse is is racism racism
[13:22.880 --> 13:32.240]  is just a modern term for tribalism between different ethnic groups but historically it
[13:32.240 --> 13:37.920]  be groups of romans before they unified what is idly today killing each other in hundreds of years
[13:37.920 --> 13:45.680]  of war before the the city of rom ended up first conquering what is idly before that was on is
[13:45.680 --> 13:50.080]  just the land of the romans hadn't been known as idly until the last you know thousand years or so
[13:51.760 --> 13:56.800]  and you know those guys over the hill they're bad we're going to kill them exact same genetic
[13:56.800 --> 14:02.320]  group and that's what's frustrating we've been colonized by foreign offshore megabanks who are
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.880]  literally waging war against the human condition and trying to dumb us down and in europe and the
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.320]  us and in australia teaching and globalist standardized tests that two plus two equals five
[14:12.320 --> 14:18.880]  five plus five equals 12 literally uh brown bags and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.040]  so you're all just seeing all this stuff to fight about everywhere and obsessed with
[14:23.040 --> 14:28.960]  what color you are or what religion instead of all of us going under a scientific dumbing down
[14:28.960 --> 14:34.320]  takeover so you so you say well that's ridiculous saying peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are
[14:34.320 --> 14:38.560]  racist and you know don't don't ask for them on the school menu because it hurts hispanic
[14:38.560 --> 14:43.600]  children's feelings that's meant to get the hispanic's going yeah i am offended by a peanut butter and
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.160]  jelly sandwich so we're all fighting with each other when we would all just really be getting
[14:48.160 --> 14:56.640]  along it was christians and good people who came together to end the last 500 years of ethnic
[14:56.640 --> 15:03.760]  slavery because 500 years ago there were big struggles by by in europe predominantly whites
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.720]  who did not want to be slaves anymore to other whites they called it feudalism so as feudalism
[15:08.720 --> 15:13.680]  fell out in the last 500 years they said okay well we've got to turn somewhere else we'll just
[15:13.680 --> 15:19.520]  literally send our ships to the western coast of africa grab people and take them to slave
[15:19.520 --> 15:26.400]  plantations all over the caribbean to produce sugarcane to make rum to ship back to europe
[15:26.400 --> 15:34.720]  and there were big fights in cities burned down in europe if you go back 500 400 300 years ago
[15:34.720 --> 15:39.680]  over ending slavery it wasn't like it was some debate that just started with the north versus
[15:39.680 --> 15:47.120]  the south there were look it up there were anti-slavery riots burning major cities in europe
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.400]  over the african slave trade ladies and gentlemen because they had just gone through it there
[15:52.400 --> 16:00.000]  they estimate that millions of christians died in different religious wars with catholics
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.040]  killing protestants and protestants killing catholics just went on and on and on and wars in
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.720]  the netherlands and five or six giant wars in england and huge wars in france see there's all
[16:10.720 --> 16:16.000]  this real history and i'm not lessening slavery here it's terrible the point is it's like it's
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.760]  the only human experience they teach when it's it's perpetual it's the same story over and over again
[16:21.760 --> 16:26.000]  and now we're going into slavery of the new world order they're poisoning our food poisoning our
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.760]  water destroying our dollar going after our families deindustrializing us and teaching people the
[16:31.760 --> 16:38.160]  oppression is peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that oppression is brown bags that oppression
[16:38.160 --> 16:46.800]  is saying mother and father that's hurtful to gaze this is total cultural overwrite with a plastic
[16:46.800 --> 16:54.640]  fake globalist culture that wants you to be one thing absolutely alone with no community
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.400]  but also not an individual because then you see the television as your friends
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.400]  and the plastic culture is your fake community they have to destroy real community
[17:05.680 --> 17:10.960]  and real communitarianism to then bring in a false communitarianism they have to destroy
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.240]  true sustainability being able to take care of yourself and bring in a false sustainability
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.280]  that actually makes your life unsustainable and has a lot of trappings that sound reasonable
[17:21.280 --> 17:28.000]  it's so sophisticated how they do this now here's what's coming up today obviously nuclear
[17:28.000 --> 17:36.480]  iran deal Saudi arabian warrants it will strike on out on its own that is big big news we told
[17:36.480 --> 17:41.360]  you this for years it's already started in europe now it's starting here i've told you this probably
[17:41.360 --> 17:47.840]  a thousand times that this is the real science financial times of london top financial paper
[17:47.840 --> 17:56.560]  in the world us banks worn fed interest rate cut could force them to charge for depositors
[17:58.160 --> 18:02.720]  that is devaluation of the currency that is why my beginnings and then once it starts
[18:02.720 --> 18:08.560]  speeding up folks it's warp speed now they've they've depressed the economy to try to balance out
[18:08.560 --> 18:14.880]  that they're actually inflating the currency it's it's oh man i tell you it's so sophisticated
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.640]  what they're doing and there's no way they're going to be able to keep control of it no matter
[18:18.640 --> 18:23.040]  how many computerized frauds they've got um so we're going to be breaking all of that down
[18:23.680 --> 18:29.680]  this is the lineup for some really crazy stuff to happen also paul watson's joining us at the
[18:29.680 --> 18:37.760]  bottom of the hour huge breaking news on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com france planned
[18:37.760 --> 18:44.240]  false flag attack in britain intelligence services considered a fascinating muslim leader
[18:44.240 --> 18:53.920]  and then blaming neo nazis and this is in the major german french papers but it's not it's not
[18:53.920 --> 19:01.200]  been picked up anywhere other than that yet this is breaking in the english speaking press at info
[19:01.200 --> 19:09.200]  wars dot com it's also been reported in israel so i guess that's english speaking there as well
[19:10.480 --> 19:17.360]  but the point is is that this is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com paul watson is
[19:17.360 --> 19:21.120]  going to be joining us he can finally talk about his book and what really happens some of what really

[24:37.200 --> 24:43.440]  anyways Vivian Kubrick i know enough about Stanley Kubrick and watch all the films over
[24:43.440 --> 24:47.600]  and over again have all the box sets grew up with my mother and dad you know taking me to see all
[24:47.600 --> 24:54.240]  the movies when they would come back into theaters like 2001 space odyssey dr strange love you name
[24:54.240 --> 24:59.760]  it my mother grew up walking you know the a mile with her friends to go to the paramount theater
[24:59.760 --> 25:06.240]  here in austin texas and watch the Kubrick films when they actually came out she was a teenager
[25:06.240 --> 25:13.280]  whenever dr strange love came out famously exposing the rand corporations and plans to
[25:13.280 --> 25:19.920]  cause a nuclear war so they could set up a military dictatorship now they just use al-qaeda to take
[25:19.920 --> 25:25.840]  away our liberties so we're very blessed but it was i mean i'm not star struck anymore i've been
[25:25.840 --> 25:31.440]  invited to travel the world and go all these amazing places with really famous people but it's all
[25:31.440 --> 25:39.040]  off record and i'm glad that other interesting people want to know me i'm kind of flabbergasted
[25:39.040 --> 25:44.320]  by it sometimes you know kurt vonnegut was a listener and i talked to him and he sent me art
[25:44.320 --> 25:48.800]  but he didn't want to come on the show he said i've sworn to not give any more speeches and i'm
[25:48.800 --> 25:56.240]  done now i mean died like six months later but that's one of the few really famous people i can
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.280]  talk about his own record he sent me art and things but so many other really really famous
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.760]  interesting people who are incredibly smart and person like you'll be around them talking to them
[26:05.760 --> 26:10.640]  and you can't believe you they're actually talking to you and they're everything they say is just so
[26:10.640 --> 26:17.040]  thought-provoking uh and i and i'm just honored to get to know all these people but uh vivy and
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.640]  cubrick of course was his protege he said the smartest of his kids she worked on a bunch of his
[26:22.640 --> 26:27.520]  films and they would give her gnome to plumes so that people wouldn't say nepotism and they'd say
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.400]  who's that person you're got editing who's that person doing the score who's that person on camera
[26:32.400 --> 26:37.520]  you know steven spielberg would try to hire the gnome to plumes that she had and she told me so
[26:37.520 --> 26:41.920]  much about her dad in the two days that we hung out and had dinner two or three hours a night with
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.360]  the crew and most of it she didn't say is off the record but some of it was so i'm just not going
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.480]  to tell any of it someday if she wants to come on the show and talk about all that i mean and
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.000]  because i'm a cubrick fan watch the documentaries read a book about it i'm not like a you know
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.600]  stalker fan to the point of i know everything but i know a lot about stanley cubrick and those are
[27:01.600 --> 27:09.600]  films i can watch over and over again 2001 space odyssey full metal jacket that's and um it's vivian
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.320]  venessa cubrick born 1960 they've got her Wikipedia up there but the issue is is that
[27:18.480 --> 27:23.520]  talking to her it was just really enlightening and i felt uplifted and she just had a really
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.720]  great spirit about her uh and the first night we went down to protest the fellow reserve wednesday
[27:28.720 --> 27:34.960]  night about 200 people 250 showed up great people impromptu to protest the real power structure that
[27:34.960 --> 27:38.880]  killed kennedy when he signed the executive order to begin abolishing the fellow reserve
[27:40.400 --> 27:46.320]  and i was petting this beautiful american bulldog the prettiest i've ever seen that this fellow
[27:46.320 --> 27:53.120]  actually was holding in his arms this really big guy and then i turned and this uh a very interesting
[27:53.120 --> 27:58.800]  looking woman you like you're very alive i said look at my dog and i was like oh sweet very nice
[27:58.800 --> 28:04.720]  black poodle that she had in her arms a medium-sized poodle and and i said well fantastic great job
[28:04.720 --> 28:11.440]  and then i left uh and then the next night we just had our march down to daily plaza to protest the
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.560]  fact that they were going to restrict free speech in most of the city the next day and leon
[28:17.120 --> 28:21.200]  richard pulls up after having marching for hours in the suburban to pick me up take me back to the
[28:21.200 --> 28:28.560]  hotel and leon gets in and goes hey that lady says she's vivian cubrick and uh you know would like
[28:28.560 --> 28:33.040]  to tell you a funny story about her dad and the cia but she never told me it was on or off records
[28:33.040 --> 28:37.520]  i'm not going to tell that story till she comes on in person sometime so i said well get her number
[28:37.520 --> 28:41.040]  and and i drove by and i said you know that actually looks like vivian cubrick i'd seen
[28:41.040 --> 28:46.240]  his daughters before and she's in a bunch of his films so i called the numbers sure enough i looked
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.480]  it up our line that's her she came to the hotel we talked for about three hours absolutely hit it off
[28:50.480 --> 28:56.480]  and then the next day she marched with us they got attacked by police she was in all that uh and
[28:57.200 --> 29:00.560]  we're now digging through all the footage and getting the really hardcore stuff we just put
[29:00.560 --> 29:04.240]  out the first video we saw which shows them shoving me and pushing people the ground and
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.640]  stuff with the hardcore stuff we're now digging it up to put a video out tonight on the nightly news
[29:09.200 --> 29:15.760]  we had like so many cameras out there but that's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast
[29:15.760 --> 29:20.800]  that i never asked her to an interview i said if you ever feel like it come down to austin we'll do it
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.960]  it didn't have to be cubrick on cubrick you know but but obviously just about your view on the world
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.000]  and then the next day after the police attacked her she just kind of said okay i'll be interviewed
[29:30.640 --> 29:35.920]  so we interviewed her live on the street right after the police attacked us under federal orders
[29:35.920 --> 29:40.960]  for no reason and so this is the first interview she's done under the no one in like 10 years
[29:40.960 --> 29:46.240]  uh premiering here because she's a very private person and it's going to be very very interesting
[29:47.120 --> 29:52.720]  to say the least well there i've got we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:14.560 --> 33:24.800]  time run on for a long time run on for a long time sooner or later gotta cut you down sooner
[33:24.800 --> 33:31.520]  monday through friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central we're live back seven o'clock central
[33:31.520 --> 33:42.240]  standard time with info wars nightly news we're working on getting max keiser on because he's
[33:42.240 --> 33:46.800]  the one that's been saying for a long time that when they start trying to charge for deposits in
[33:46.800 --> 33:52.080]  the u.s uh you know that means inflation's about to really spike up well now that's in the financial
[33:52.080 --> 34:00.480]  times of london u.s banks warned fed interest cut could force them to charge depositors that's a big
[34:00.480 --> 34:06.480]  deal the biggest issue is iran nuclear deal now saudi arabia warns they will strike on its own
[34:06.480 --> 34:13.280]  even if israel the us or nato don't over the peace deal iran is struck and it makes them get rid of
[34:13.280 --> 34:18.160]  their enrichment down to five percent which you it's really even hard to have reactors for power at
[34:18.160 --> 34:25.280]  that level uh so it looks like sanctions actually did bring iran pretty much to their knees they
[34:25.280 --> 34:32.240]  failed in taking out syria so they could then take out iran because syria is on israel's flank
[34:32.240 --> 34:38.800]  it had to be taken out first that's why they use saudi arabia backed al qaeda uh but now saudi
[34:38.800 --> 34:44.320]  arabia is literally throwing a fit and out of all the players in the middle east there's some real
[34:44.320 --> 34:53.840]  nasties out there saudi arabia is hands down and al qaeda is hands down heads above the rest in fact
[34:53.840 --> 35:02.480]  way way worse leagues worse than the other players and just mischievous and wanting to dominate everything
[35:03.280 --> 35:09.840]  and i see why i mean from 1903 to 1933 one group of bedouin tribes took over
[35:09.840 --> 35:16.720]  over what is saudi arabia syria and so many other areas with british intelligence backing i mean
[35:16.720 --> 35:21.600]  these guys had 200 square miles in between two mountain ranges of the worst desert in saudi
[35:21.600 --> 35:29.200]  arabia today and under british intelligence backing took the whole thing over and now they want the
[35:29.200 --> 35:35.360]  entire world basically not just north africa not just central asia they're exporting their people all
[35:35.360 --> 35:40.640]  over the caucuses to threaten the russians they publicly threatened to blow up the olympics using
[35:40.640 --> 35:49.520]  al qaeda uh the head of saudi intelligence um been sultan bandar related to the bin laden's
[35:49.520 --> 35:53.920]  i just can't handle it anymore and then i've got to have the tsa look me in the eyes and act like
[35:53.920 --> 35:58.000]  i've done something wrong and want to grab my genitals and put me in a scanner when the government
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.880]  runs al qaeda the illegitimate government runs it and i'm tired of all the cops in riot gear and
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.600]  all the cameras and all the armored vehicles and the billions of bullets saying it's for al qaeda
[36:07.600 --> 36:14.560]  when you know full well it's for the american people and now they admit it's for us and i've had enough
[36:14.560 --> 36:22.560]  and i'm angry and i have to go out and basically get roughed up by police to have peaceful demonstration
[36:22.560 --> 36:28.000]  in dalis for the first amendment which the mayor said was banned and the dalis police did their job
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.480]  and so they just sit in the sheriff's department under federal control to attack us and the
[36:32.480 --> 36:38.240]  message is we own these streets you don't it's pure gangster level we even overheard the dalis police
[36:38.240 --> 36:42.800]  the first night but we missed them then and i guess higher ups countermanded it saying we got to show
[36:42.800 --> 36:48.080]  him and show them these are our streets and they can't be out here and then we're the boss i mean
[36:48.080 --> 36:55.920]  man the level of blockheadedness we got to show them they just can't stand on the street corner
[36:55.920 --> 37:00.480]  and hand out flyers in america we got it well you know what you're going to get shown by the
[37:00.480 --> 37:06.480]  establishment that you don't have anything as well you fools you want freedom you want free speech
[37:06.480 --> 37:12.560]  you want checks and balances that's what made america so successful everybody else is authoritarian
[37:12.560 --> 37:18.720]  everybody else doesn't let people demonstrate and their hell holes western civilization
[37:18.720 --> 37:23.600]  cradle of freedom and it's all being reversed it's all being lost and did you notice all the
[37:23.600 --> 37:30.080]  prosperity is going out the window at the same time and i want my children to grow up in a free
[37:30.080 --> 37:35.440]  country listen if it was some great free country with lower taxes i would leave except that i have
[37:35.440 --> 37:40.000]  and there are a few actually that are better out there i've looked into it but i have such roots
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.960]  here that i'm not going to abandon ship and i see a lot of positive things happening too
[37:44.960 --> 37:50.800]  don't get me wrong i see military waking up a lot of police waking up i see moves start impeaching
[37:50.800 --> 37:56.160]  the attorney general moves to impeach obama i'm seeing a lot of awakening that's good but
[37:56.160 --> 38:02.400]  it's not enough folks i mean they're teaching kids two plus two equals five and that mom and
[38:02.400 --> 38:08.960]  dad is a bad word father and mother and that jelly peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist to
[38:08.960 --> 38:13.120]  traumatize seven-year-olds that they're racist because mommy gave them peanut butter and jelly
[38:13.120 --> 38:18.080]  sandwich so they can henpeck little kids and teach them they're bad because they're white
[38:18.080 --> 38:23.280]  and the new common core curriculum says all whites are racist basically i covered that yesterday i mean
[38:23.280 --> 38:28.640]  this is the type of stuff we're dealing with in this country total vulcanization total psych warfare
[38:28.640 --> 38:34.800]  totally criminal the government is illegitimate at the top it's trying to get the lower level
[38:34.800 --> 38:39.600]  people to carry out crimes it doesn't matter though the government is now illegitimate
[38:39.600 --> 38:44.320]  from pillar to post it didn't matter if the dallas police follow the judges injunction that we could
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.720]  demonstrate it didn't matter if that after the ceremony dealing plaza had to be opened up and
[38:48.720 --> 38:54.720]  we went in first they were open all the barricades we go in the feds across the street in front of
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.960]  witnesses they were not going to let alex jones do that get over there they messed up went over
[38:58.960 --> 39:04.800]  and pushed us out of there to show us we're the boss homeland security we run this show we'll do
[39:04.800 --> 39:12.720]  what we want in america they federalized units in every police department every sheriff's department
[39:12.720 --> 39:19.680]  in major cities now they're federalizing everything else and they sent thugs that had criminal glints
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.880]  in their eyes over there and i just want to thank god for giving me the self-control
[39:25.760 --> 39:28.400]  to sit there and put up with it we're going through all the footage to get the really
[39:28.400 --> 39:32.400]  hardcore stuff rob do would walk down the street and ran back that's how we got this from behind
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.320]  none of us got the first of it except on our live feeds we have to go into the live feed
[39:36.320 --> 39:40.080]  archives to get the really brutal stuff where they had that guy's head pinned up against the wall
[39:40.080 --> 39:45.120]  right there ramming it choking people knocked a girl off a guy's shoulders this is the stuff i saw
[39:45.120 --> 39:48.880]  we're going to get it all and have it by tonight's show we all got back tired this weekend and we
[39:48.880 --> 39:55.120]  just have dozens of hours of footage to go through but we're going to do it now let's just stop right
[39:55.120 --> 40:04.800]  there um i want to shift gears to our top story that is up on info wars dot com
[40:04.800 --> 40:12.880]  um and i'm going to need a document cam here in just a moment the story is up on info wars dot
[40:12.880 --> 40:23.760]  com it is the top story on info wars dot com france planned false flag terror attack in britain
[40:24.400 --> 40:32.000]  intelligent services considered assassinating muslim leader blaming neo nazis and i worked on
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.240]  this article with watson i asked his view on it from the different intel pieces we had
[40:36.240 --> 40:42.640]  and i concur with his analysis a hundred percent this guy that calls for violence against non-muslims
[40:42.640 --> 40:53.200]  and the takeover of europe and turning it into a new muslim holding is a mi6 mi5 operative he is
[40:53.200 --> 40:59.120]  protected and he is connected directly to real terror attacks in france and french intelligence
[40:59.120 --> 41:05.920]  wants him dead but notice they were going to use a false flag to blame it on neo nazis at the same
[41:05.920 --> 41:12.640]  time this is breaking at info wars dot com it's in french german and israeli papers but not in the
[41:12.640 --> 41:24.880]  western news it's up on info wars dot com now joining us is paul joseph watson from england
[41:24.880 --> 41:30.560]  breaking this uh one of the biggest groups in england are the ones that are releasing these
[41:30.560 --> 41:36.240]  documents and basically again i'm not for assassinating people and false flagging and blaming
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.000]  it on the right wing to then restrict free speech in france which they were going to double back and
[41:40.000 --> 41:49.440]  do but this is a great example if true uh of how these intelligence agencies uh even when they get
[41:49.440 --> 41:56.320]  back at each other uh use false flags to get the job done paul watson hi it's good to be back
[41:56.960 --> 42:03.760]  yeah it's it's a report by the pressure group hope not hate uh concerns a french intelligence plot
[42:03.760 --> 42:11.600]  to assassinate the muslim hate preacher the hulk candid cleric abu hamza and basically what happened
[42:11.600 --> 42:16.320]  they were frustrated at the fact that the british british intelligence services which
[42:16.320 --> 42:23.280]  as all our other research shows clearly runs the european branch of al qaeda you've got hundreds of
[42:23.280 --> 42:29.840]  terrorists flocking from britain to syria uh under the wing of angem chowdhury who is also
[42:29.840 --> 42:35.520]  connected to this and again working for british british intelligence but this was based on a
[42:36.400 --> 42:42.480]  a copy of a 1999 nail bomb attack which happened in london killed three people injured dozens
[42:42.480 --> 42:50.400]  uh by david copeland who was a far right terrorist so the french plan to stage a false flag use
[42:50.400 --> 42:57.840]  similar tactics similar weapons to the uh combat 18 neo nazi group in britain then blame it on them
[42:57.840 --> 43:03.360]  and therefore avoid responsibility for their attack but as he said they wanted to get rid of
[43:03.360 --> 43:08.800]  abu hamza because they they thought that the british intelligence services were basically
[43:08.800 --> 43:14.560]  protecting him in fact they referred to london as london is stand because of the ease with which
[43:14.560 --> 43:19.520]  these al qaeda networks go in and out of the country because over and over again we've proven
[43:19.520 --> 43:25.920]  that british intel runs al qaeda in europe haroon rashid as what the so-called mastermind of the
[43:25.920 --> 43:33.760]  seven seven bombings was on the mi-5 payroll and he was one of the closest aids to abu hamza
[43:33.760 --> 43:39.680]  in the late 90s so they were both working for british intelligence hamza admitted he was working
[43:39.680 --> 43:47.280]  for special branches far back as 1997 and then in 2006 he said his his hate preaching
[43:47.280 --> 43:53.360]  had been tacitly approved by mi-5 so that's right let's be clear let's be clear a swat
[43:54.240 --> 44:00.400]  was over the seven seven bombings on record and i literally had police threatened to arrest me when
[44:00.400 --> 44:06.320]  i was on the streets trying to interview witnesses about this with you just a few days after the
[44:06.320 --> 44:12.000]  seven seven bombings i went to london and we turned out it was a drill they were patsies
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.720]  who thought they were part of a drill some figured out in rand they were shot to death at canary
[44:17.840 --> 44:24.880]  area uh there um and then again this is how they set them up but the point is this is on record
[44:24.880 --> 44:33.440]  even fox news uh and the associated press has reported that mi-5 mi-6 were handling uh the
[44:33.440 --> 44:39.440]  the a swat character uh who then was trying to create terror networks but they couldn't do it so
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.640]  then uh they hired people who thought they were part of a drill and and let's understand this
[44:44.640 --> 44:51.040]  we can't get our reporters into england sometimes michael savage can't get into england uh former navy
[44:51.040 --> 44:58.080]  seals can't get into england if they ever criticize islam anyway but you're allowed to be actual al-qaeda
[44:58.080 --> 45:03.760]  and be involved and be involved in terror bombings well exactly i mean look at this group called
[45:03.760 --> 45:11.360]  al-mohajaroon it's led by anjem chowdhury and oma bakri muhammad that's the group that's training
[45:11.360 --> 45:20.240]  and equipping all the terrorists to travel from the uk to syria in uh back in 1997 ron suskin suskin
[45:20.240 --> 45:26.960]  the journalist was told by the the cohort of chowdhury bakri muhammad that they were also working
[45:26.960 --> 45:32.320]  for british intelligence so again they admit they're working for british intel they send all the
[45:32.320 --> 45:37.120]  terrorists out to syria when those terrorists come back they're then arrested by the government
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.880]  so they're all they're all working for british intelligence these are the chief european
[45:42.880 --> 45:49.840]  network leaders of al-qaeda another one abu qatada he was he was the inspiration for european al-qaeda
[45:49.840 --> 45:55.600]  turned out he was mi5 every single case you look at leads back to british intelligence and it's the
[45:55.600 --> 46:01.760]  same with this guy abu hamza which apparently is why the french were trying to assassinate him
[46:01.760 --> 46:08.400]  because there were good agents within those security services in france and they realized that
[46:08.400 --> 46:13.120]  you know he was he was one of the boys he was on the team so they the only thing they could do is
[46:13.120 --> 46:20.480]  hatch this plot to get rid of him expanding on that paul separately five of the leaders of al-qaeda
[46:20.480 --> 46:28.560]  worldwide were all born in the u.s and one of them is jewish adam gadan and his father is the former
[46:28.560 --> 46:35.280]  grandfather is the former head of the adl he was arrested beating up muslims in los angeles until
[46:35.280 --> 46:41.360]  he figured out how to go become al-qaeda so that he could play the part of al-qaeda i mean this is
[46:41.360 --> 46:46.800]  absolutely insane and then they use the al-qaeda threat to take our liberties while turning the
[46:46.800 --> 46:54.480]  middle east and egypt over to al-qaeda well i mean look at the guy who's supposed plot the
[46:54.480 --> 47:00.000]  the christmas day bombing led to the intensification of the tsa harassment the body scanners
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.600]  and war al-aqi he was he was the the inspiration for five of the 911 hijackers yet as fox news
[47:07.600 --> 47:15.200]  reported he was dining at the pentagon months after 911 and it was also admitted that he was
[47:15.200 --> 47:22.480]  working for the fbi so the very inspiration behind the alleged hijackers on 911 visits the pentagon
[47:22.480 --> 47:28.720]  months after and then you know goes on after that to become the inspiration for the time square
[47:28.720 --> 47:35.040]  bombing that attempted bombing the fort hud shooting he was the inspiration behind that and by the way
[47:35.040 --> 47:41.520]  they declared national security on that uh with major hassan for two years he was being run by
[47:41.520 --> 47:47.520]  al-aqi and the cia knew and they declared national security on those emails and will not even declare
[47:47.520 --> 47:52.960]  it a terror attack let's put the fox news headline back up the guys were able to find it exclusive
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.720]  al-qaeda leader dined at the pentagon just months after 911 that's actually not an exclusive we
[47:58.720 --> 48:05.120]  actually broke that ladies and gentlemen uh but the whole issue is that even when i mentioned that
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.640]  now on national tv or radio they laugh and say i'm a liar the number two guy on al-qaeda who i
[48:10.640 --> 48:14.400]  predicted they would fake kill planned to kill them in a drone strike totally made up folks set a
[48:14.400 --> 48:20.240]  nose job beards cut off he's in probably hawaii right now with 15 messresses you know to topless
[48:20.240 --> 48:25.200]  bar literally ladies it's just like the 911 hijackers totally set up double triple agents bare
[48:25.200 --> 48:30.720]  minimum uh triple crossed right there but the issue is this is an intelligence op and why do
[48:30.720 --> 48:38.240]  they do it to take our liberties paul this is incredible and they also do it to um kind of
[48:38.240 --> 48:44.320]  rack it up this racial strife both in the us and uh britain because you remember the walich attacks
[48:44.320 --> 48:51.040]  the uh the killing of lee rigby well it turned out that the culprit of that was again a protege of
[48:51.040 --> 48:57.440]  angem chowdhury who is the guy which according to this report has become his group has become the
[48:57.440 --> 49:05.680]  single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent history yet his cohort admitted before 77 that
[49:05.680 --> 49:12.640]  his group was working with and with the approval of mi5 the biggest gateway to terrorism in british
[49:12.640 --> 49:20.320]  history and they're working hand in hand with mi5 good job paul and i want to give credit where
[49:20.320 --> 49:25.280]  credits do i thought we were the first english speaking group to put this out the hovington
[49:25.280 --> 49:29.600]  post actually had it but i'm glad you've done a report on it pointing out the background french
[49:29.600 --> 49:35.040]  security services plan to assassinate abu hamza and then here it is now out of the telegraph just
[49:35.040 --> 49:39.360]  down breaking as well so we're all basically breaking at the same time french spies and neo
[49:39.360 --> 49:48.160]  nazi plot to kill abu hamza i mean that abu hamza guy is just a disgusting blob trying to radicalize
[49:48.160 --> 49:54.160]  everybody so they can then again take british folks as rights it's so disgusting i mean this is i
[49:54.160 --> 49:59.280]  am so sick of being treated like a terrorist when i'm totally innocent and the government runs the
[49:59.280 --> 50:05.120]  terrorist paul well exactly but those other reports you mentioned don't talk about the
[50:05.120 --> 50:10.960]  fact that abu hamza is mi5 so they only give you half the story which is why people are coming to
[50:10.960 --> 50:16.960]  info wars dot com but so sick of so sick of adam hamza i saw that fat pig on television i was over
[50:16.960 --> 50:21.200]  in england yeah tell about he's on television over there calling for killing everybody i mean
[50:21.200 --> 50:25.840]  it's so obvious he's a government agent it's come out of years he brags he is well eventually they
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.880]  had to extradite him it took years and years despite his clear links to al qaeda finally in
[50:30.880 --> 50:37.520]  october last year they extradited him to the u.s so these uh these pats he's these stooges only
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.000]  have a limited time span before they become redundant i guess they're playing clips of him
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.360]  but they do have a guy who's the guy i saw on tv that looks just like him as jim chowdry yeah yeah
[50:47.360 --> 50:52.560]  yeah he's still active yeah that's the one that's just disgusting we'll be right back ladies and
[50:52.560 --> 50:57.920]  gentlemen stay with us paul watson uh thank you so much let's come back and add any other

[51:15.840 --> 51:22.720]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's
[51:22.720 --> 51:29.280]  the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15
[51:29.280 --> 51:35.440]  point iq increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is

[54:20.880 --> 54:28.160]  folks coming up the last 30 minutes of the broadcast the daughter of Stanley Kubrick a
[54:28.160 --> 54:34.800]  filmmaker and composer in her own right an incredible lady to talk to explosive interviews
[54:34.800 --> 54:41.200]  she's done like one discussion I've looked it up in like a decade about a film in a film panel
[54:41.200 --> 54:45.840]  and then that's it and I'm just flattered that she's a listener and really enjoyed talking to her
[54:45.840 --> 54:49.280]  and learned a lot she says she's gonna come to Austin sometime probably come on air with us and
[54:50.080 --> 54:53.840]  obviously let her let us pick her brain about so many things that are out there because
[54:53.840 --> 54:58.480]  Stanley Kubrick was just the words were close to very very private
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.000]  and people don't really know a lot about him in fact I was told quite a bit and I a lot of it
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.280]  wasn't off record but I'm still just not going to talk about it till she says some of it
[55:07.280 --> 55:12.240]  incredibly interesting I mean she was in there working on a bunch of his film she was his main
[55:12.240 --> 55:17.920]  protege and it certainly wasn't nepotism because you can see the scores she came out with and the
[55:17.920 --> 55:24.800]  work she did on everything from eyes wide shut to full metal jacket and it's amazing that's coming
[55:24.800 --> 55:30.560]  up Dan Bongino will be joining us he can now finally speak about some of the stuff that he did
[55:30.560 --> 55:34.640]  during the Secret Service that's in his book now this book is officially out the publisher will
[55:34.640 --> 55:39.040]  allow him to talk about that obviously that's for 30 minutes Paul Watson's with us right now
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.240]  briefly in the last decade plus the first person I learned about it was about 14 years ago my
[55:44.240 --> 55:50.080]  girlfriend and my wife liked this particular type of coffee that was from Chiapas Mexico
[55:50.080 --> 55:55.840]  was pretty expensive and then I learned that the owners of the company were fans and I wanted to
[55:55.840 --> 56:02.400]  put out a private label of it myself but then they're in some national food stores and got cold feet
[56:03.280 --> 56:08.000]  and then I did research and lo and behold learned that folks that we've worked with for a while
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.280]  inner health botanicals were able to secure it but they get it directly from the same co-op
[56:13.280 --> 56:17.520]  in Chiapas and it is the same coffee I've been drinking this coffee I say 10 years it's 14 years
[56:17.520 --> 56:23.040]  since I met my girlfriend and it is my favorite coffee and it's arabica and in the office there's
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.400]  like 15 different flavors of it you know types and roast but we all the whole office tested it for a
[56:28.400 --> 56:34.560]  few weeks and we decided on this particular blend unanimously it's a medium roast wake up America

[57:00.320 --> 57:05.520]  especially like Guatemalan coffee but better in my view Guatemalan was my favorite previous to that
[57:06.640 --> 57:12.880]  Guatemalan arabica and then we have infused with the organic a special type of mushrooms for the

[1:00:55.120 --> 1:01:00.400]  finally tell us some of what's not classified or restricted about being inside the bubble with
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:04.320]  obama now that his books out he's not bound by the publisher to not be able to talk about it
[1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:08.960]  frequent to guest one of our favorite guests very interesting very smart guy
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:13.280]  we'll get his take on the economy host of issues as well uh because secret services a lot of
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:17.920]  education in economics and how money works it's always good to talk to bonjino uh but right now
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:23.840]  paul finishing up with your story that you know as you said this is this is now in the london telegraph
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:30.160]  but they don't tell you i wish they told everybody uh that the guy is admittedly in previous mainstream
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:35.280]  news an mi5 agent until they set him up and then now there's other minions they're protecting that
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:45.200]  are mi5 assets who are actually trying to turn what do you think the goal is of bringing in the radical
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:49.120]  muslims and trying to turn england over to al-qaeda and the rest of the world why does the new order
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:54.000]  love al-qaeda is it just the saudi arabian money i mean uh why did it why why did the british
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:01.760]  intelligence create saudi arabia i mean i think they just are in love with the uh wahhabist well
[1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:07.440]  it's because they use them as chess pieces around the world to take over rogue states countries that
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:12.560]  are not part of the new world order i mean they should they paid al-qaeda 100 000 pounds back in
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:19.520]  1996 to assassinate gadafi so they were on that early and then of course over 10 years ago it came out
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:27.520]  that the mi5 had double agents within the real ira's oma bomb team actually carried out the
[1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:33.680]  bombing which killed 29 people a lot of children amongst them so these people are ruthless and
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:39.280]  then people say oh well they couldn't have killed diana or dr david kelly they kill kids they carry
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:46.400]  out terrorist attacks on a regular basis uh you know ira attacks throughout the 90s had mi5 fingerprints
[1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:51.280]  all over them and then it came out you know you had headlines like the army asked me to make bombs
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:56.080]  for the ira told me i had the prime minister's blessing then tried to kill me that was kevin
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:01.120]  falton who was quote ordered by his handlers to carry out terrorist attacks by the way we had him
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:08.240]  on the show wasn't he called steak knife steak knife yeah what happened to steak knife i haven't
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:12.320]  seen any update on it i know there wasn't much attention at the time one of the one of the
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:18.080]  british commandos we interviewed got killed after he was on i can't even keep track all this i tell
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:25.280]  you it's so frustrating well i mean watch out for the sas sniper who recently blew the whistle on
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:30.080]  the fight that an sas elite unit killed diana darling he's going to be hanging around very long
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:35.120]  do you man i tell you i mean my government's corrupt and so is yours but it the british
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:39.360]  government's been totally caught doing this what's wrong with parliament are they just intimidated
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:45.520]  well there's a lot there's a few in parliament that speak out against it but yeah there's a
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.560]  derided why would you authorize mi5 to pick a place to blow up little kids i mean i mean if
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:54.160]  they're going to blow people up i mean at least blow up an army base or something to blame on
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:59.040]  somebody at least that's men i mean i'm not even saying that's okay but my god blowing up kids man
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:03.520]  i agree with tony montana no women no kids i mean it just makes me want to throw up
[1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:09.760]  well their excuse was they didn't want their double agent to have his cover blown so if you
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:16.720]  think that's worth killing 29 people for then you know not very reasonable argument is it
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:21.520]  well i mean it shows how oklahoma city they picked it because of a daycare
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:26.000]  mcvay through a fit this has been confirmed he was willing to blow up a federal building to
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:34.240]  get to go after the the right wing but not kill kids so they just set him up amazing all right

[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:21.360]  that down explaining what's really going on of course top story on info wars dot com this is
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:26.800]  confirmed in the foreign press as well france planned a false flag terror attack in britain
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:32.960]  to kill radical muslims uh that were really british intelligence agents that were staging
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:37.680]  terror attacks in france and they were going to blame the right wing for it man talk about
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:43.040]  going after all of the socialist enemies uh so get rid of some of the british agents that are
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:48.880]  staging terror attacks that are muslims uh it's just well known britain pretty much runs al-qaeda
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:54.400]  look at what they're doing right now against syria pretty sophisticated cloak and dagger stuff
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:00.800]  that's up on info wars dot com i've really wanted to get him on on this subject for a while but
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:07.120]  he was bound until the book came out to talk about it i a few months ago got an advanced copy
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:15.200]  uh of uh dan bonjino's life inside the bubble why a top rank secret service agent walked away
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:19.520]  from it all really interesting stuff in the book and i know he can't get into all of it obviously
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:23.760]  our folks won't get the book and and he certainly needs the support because he left a
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.360]  well-paying job and you know obviously as a family he's running for congress right now
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:32.160]  we've been supportive of him and we'll give you his twitter and uh facebook and also his main
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:39.520]  website in a moment says bonjino dot com but i specifically want you now in context with ben
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:45.520]  stein saying obama is a criminal liar impeaching with all the lies about obama care obama saying
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:51.920]  he can act as a dictator to shut off power plants or to uh legalize the legals or to fix his own
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:58.080]  legislation create a crisis it's horrible make me a dictator i can fix it uh i mean this is clowered
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:03.120]  and pivot this is wrecked the country tell us in the context of working as one of his top agents
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:08.160]  the top agent running his foreign details which have been told the most dangerous the most important
[1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:15.520]  position uh because that's where things aren't as controllable uh what should happen to obama
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:20.800]  and what what you think he'll do now that he's a cornered rat uh dan bonjino thanks for coming
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:25.920]  on with us and i appreciate thanks a lot thanks for the opportunity yeah the problem now is we're
[1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:30.560]  getting through these distraction strategies all the time do you notice now uh the iranian deal
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:36.400]  that was convenient right after the 50th anniversary of jfk when that story uh blew through the news
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:42.880]  then obama care got back in for a quick second all of a sudden uh you know uh wow abrick adabra
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:48.480]  look there's a deal with iran that really is no deal at all and keep in mind i'm not an interventionist
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:54.160]  by any stretch i mean terrian streak is strong but if you're going to negotiate at least negotiate
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:59.440]  in good faith uh i don't even know what to say anymore about this alex it's like every single
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:05.200]  time that something breaks bad there's a media cover story that reappears and distracts people
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:09.920]  like a shiny red ball i mean we're we're at a really dangerous place right now with this
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:16.240]  administration that they use the appendages the tool as tactical almost uh and strategic
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:22.080]  propaganda weapons to get the american people to just not pay attention to the evaporation of
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:27.520]  their liberty i mean let me just say this one thing if your health care liberty doesn't matter
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:31.920]  to you which is really evaporating in front of your very eyes with obama care i mean in live
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:36.560]  time right now then really what other form of liberty really matters do you really even have
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:40.320]  political liberty oh we can vote vote for what you don't have your health care liberty you're
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:44.880]  being taxed at confiscatory rates under this administration and all of a sudden again like
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:50.720]  i said the uh a deal a so-called deal appears with iran to distract everybody so it is it's
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:58.160]  so troubling uh people have to speak out i mean someone's got to do something dan what do you
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:03.600]  expect knowing obama personally and being around him all over the world and at the white house
[1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:10.160]  knowing his handlers knowing him his arrogance what do you expect him to do because even though
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:14.560]  they have all these distractions they're not working he's losing multiple points a week
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:22.240]  he's in free fall they're going to pull something uh is it a war is it uh trying to stir up a race
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.920]  war i mean what what in your gut are you concerned about well a foreign intervention would not be
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.960]  off the table i mean it's happened in the past we had you know clinton lobbed the uh cruise missiles
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:38.000]  uh which wasn't even uh you know he would he kill a few uh goats in the middle of the wasn't that
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.800]  the story lobbed him into that there wasn't even anybody around sure so what bothers me is that i
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:47.760]  can't give you an answer alex it's the you know what government's supposed to do the sole role of
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:53.120]  government your article one section eight is to be limited and provide certain right the rules of
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.080]  a level playing field both alex jones dan banjino both understand we both play by the same rules
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:03.760]  government can't come after me and give you a pass right well i say that not to get off on a tangent
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:09.280]  but to tell you the problem is i don't know what he's going to do next that's the problem there's
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:14.160]  absolutely no certainty with this administration i mean things you and i thought only happened in
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:19.040]  the movie like come on the government the irs to go after people that's only in the movie
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:23.680]  now it does they actually apologize for it i mean you know even the little the little
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:27.760]  scandals like the extortion i don't want to say little i don't mean it in a qualitative way
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:32.000]  the the scandals that the media has not even paid attention to in this fog of scandal the
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.880]  administration you know the extortion 17 i say that to some people they're like what are you talking
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:42.240]  about it exactly that's the problem like the fact that these one of the largest losses of life in
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:48.880]  afghanistan in one day on it on this chinook with these heroic navy fields over there who you know
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:53.680]  in in this mission that we can't possibly win anymore and no one's even heard of it so the
[1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:58.640]  fact that we don't know what's going to happen next is the worst answer i could possibly give you
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:03.040]  i mean if that's the worst he did was lob a few cruise missiles in like clinton did
[1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:07.040]  you could say there was at least some predictability right or wrong i have no idea i really don't
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:12.960]  it just seems to use government like this uh like a kid uses the chain sure sure well what about the
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:20.080]  issue of even democrats saying you can't be a dictator you can't give waivers to certain companies
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:26.400]  on your healthcare law via just executive fiat and you can't just say what stands and what doesn't
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:32.320]  in obama care and you can't just by fiat stop all the deportations and you can't just selectively
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:38.560]  shut down what power plants you want but he's doing it so if he doesn't get impeached now
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:44.880]  or if he doesn't get in trouble it sets the precedent and i think this country's basically
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:50.080]  done because a lot of the republican leadership have shown that they'll use whatever undue powers
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:56.160]  have been cemented for themselves as well and i think it's just a culture of corruption you've
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:01.440]  lived in the bubble your book is called life inside the bubble what is happening up there
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:05.920]  where they are above the law the big banks can launder hundreds of billions of dollars get
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:11.440]  caught not even getting trouble uh stuff that makes bernie made off look like a choir boy
[1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:16.400]  what i'm saying is as somebody who's been a new york cop secret service agent lived in dc
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:22.240]  knowing the culture of corruption with your criminology background i see this either we
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:27.760]  turn the tide now or corruption grows to the point where everything collapses yeah i i mean i don't
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:33.280]  i don't disagree with you at all uh you know you see an example of the situation in bangtan
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:39.760]  you know i identify as a republican at the polls but i have no problem whatsoever anyone who follows
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:44.960]  me on social media going after the republicans on this too both sides are are in bed with each
[1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:48.640]  other on situations like this and what from what i've heard and i can't prove it but i'm hearing
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:53.280]  from some good sources about that there were some republicans who were aware of some stuff going on
[1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:59.600]  over there pre libya pre bangazi that they don't want to be outed on either john mccain lindsey
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:05.600]  graham yeah so instead of doing you know the right thing uh they do the easy thing which is all the
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:09.760]  public will forget about this and forget about that and it makes you wonder sure you know who's
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:14.960]  the real bad guy and i say all the time i tweet this out as often as i can because i mean it i
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:19.600]  want people to really remember the battle's not republican versus democrat that that battle's
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:25.840]  already lost the battle's elitist versus just grass roots rank and file america exactly it's
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:31.120]  forget the r and the d it's almost irrelevant well the battle is the good old boys above the law
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:36.800]  who are basically untouchable getting away with murder historically that's how you always get
[1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:42.560]  tyranny and if they're all covering each other's butts and then they're covering the hind end of
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:47.120]  their minions and their minions are covering their minions and they're covering their minions
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:53.840]  then that's how you get a culture of crime and america is converting to a culture of
[1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:59.840]  elitist criminality and it's always there but if you just give into it it's game over right i mean
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:05.280]  look at the michigan right now justin amash he you know the guy votes his conscience he puts every
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:10.000]  vote on facebook he tells you why he did it why why he didn't do it unlike obama who said he'd be
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:16.400]  transparent it's been the most opaque administration in american history but what happens easy easy
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:20.800]  answer be all the democrats are going after right no the republicans are going after them like that's
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:26.640]  the problem these and i described it in my book this carousel of kind of insiders that are they're
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:31.040]  not you they're not people like you and me they they can't stand people they probably really can't
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:36.080]  then you have an audience but as my audience goes they can't stand me either because you're not you're
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:40.160]  not feeding from the trough you know they're not going to buy you off they're not going to buy me
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:44.560]  off they're not going to buy amash off and it's like it almost reminds me when i was a cop you
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:49.280]  know if you've ever met a corrupt cop they always want you to be corrupt with them
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:53.280]  and there's very few of those by the way but the bad bad seeds were the whole bunch but
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:57.120]  you know they want you to be corrupt with them so they don't feel so bad well it's the same way
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:00.880]  in politics it's like well this guy can't be bought off all we gotta get rid of him god forbid he
[1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:04.800]  has principles he'll ruin it he'll ruin it for everybody else exactly and then they'll try to
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:10.640]  go find something you did and exaggerate it a crooked toenail whatever or make stuff up to
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:16.160]  say you're corrupt i've noticed the corrupt literally run around 24 seven saying i'm corrupt
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:21.040]  when i am totally not corrupt i mean i'm not saying i'm a perfect guy but i mean i'm almost
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:26.880]  like leave it to beaver's dad it's like these guys have been arrested for a felony and when you were
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:31.920]  eight you got caught cheap on a spelling test and it's front page news i know i get it they do it to
[1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:37.360]  me all the time i mean i every single thing i do is uh you know some guy comes after before so it's
[1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:40.960]  it's crazy and it's just they want you to be corrupt with them and it's the only way to do it well
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:45.600]  it's like saying Rand Paul in one of his speeches quoted someone who didn't properly credit he's a
[1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:50.960]  pleasure he's uh we're gonna be right back with Dan Bongino talk about his book and his run for

[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:23.600]  i am your host alex jones dad monjino is our guest his book came in a few months ago a really
[1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:30.240]  fantastic advanced copy and i couldn't put it down and it's a short book i mean not really short but
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:37.040]  it it's not super long what is it about 170 something pages 174 pages long and dan we've
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:41.120]  got six minutes left with you talk about the book tell us some of the stories that are in the book i
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:45.360]  know you can't tell us all of them but tell us about life inside the bubble yeah well well first
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:48.720]  before i get that i just want to thank your audience too when you alex you have an amazing
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:53.680]  audience here fiercely loyal to you and they've been unbelievably good to me my social media my
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:58.480]  website everything just blows up on your show so before i get that thank you guys very much
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:03.360]  and um the book yeah it's kind of uh some behind the scenes stories my time in the secret service
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:08.560]  i talk about my time in afghanistan at an active war zone trying to secure the life of president
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:14.240]  obama and how how tough that was getting caught things like sandstorms but it's like trying to
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:20.720]  secure an airfield with the threat of idf you know indirect fire coming in taken out air force one
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:25.520]  a nice part about the book if there's no melodrom i try to tell it uh from almost a self deprecating
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:29.600]  perspective there's nothing worse than uh hero worship uh you know we're all human beings and
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:34.160]  we all go through emotions that what i didn't want to do is write a comic book i wanted to
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:37.760]  i wanted you to read the book and understand what it's really like to be a secret service
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:43.040]  a the emotion you know the fear the elation the pain you know the crying family when you leave
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:47.040]  and uh that's the first part of the book and the second part of the book i dig into bangazi
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:52.480]  excuse me boston and fast and furious and they're not long chapters they're deliberately written
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:58.160]  very short and i did it to kind of make a case at the former federal investigator and criminal
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:03.360]  investigator i wanted to almost write up in an indictment in my perspective and just give you
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:07.760]  the facts and you determine for yourself where you think everything went wrong and i think if you
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:12.720]  read those three chapters you'll have a very unique perspective especially on fast and furious i
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:17.760]  know i told the story the way no one else has we've had a few uh really interesting uh articles
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:22.080]  written up on some major websites that that chapter specifically so i love the book it's
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:26.640]  gone really well we were on the best sello as the amazon all week and i i certainly appreciate you
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.040]  in the audience uh and everything you guys have done for me you bet it's important to buy it at
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:35.920]  the bookstore as well uh because kind of i know from being a publisher and putting books out you
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:39.840]  make almost no money with amazon the way they've got the market corner but that's a that's a whole
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:45.360]  another separate issue we need to support people that are libertarian constitutionalist conservatives
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:49.440]  the power structure has said the republican and democratic leadership they're scared of
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.320]  rand paul and ted cruse becoming a model for people like you to get into congress because
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:27:01.360]  then it's game over we can go back to basically uh 1950 2.0 like keep the good things that have
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:06.080]  happened since 1950 but get rid of all the bad things and move forward with real americana
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:10.720]  i think that's the answer shifting gears with the economy because last time you were on no secret
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:14.800]  service agents you know first and foremost know about counterfeiting and the economy and how things
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:21.440]  are working for me the the illegal takings that's the big criminal operation is shutting down
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:27.280]  his competition uh letting corporations that give obama money operate for me that's really
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:33.360]  racketeering and i look at obama i see a criminal racketeer and ben stein has now come out and said
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:38.320]  he's a criminal racketeer i mean call it like it is as a federal law enforcement guy we're you know
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:42.480]  out of it now i mean i'm not i'm not a federal law enforcement person but i've studied the
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:49.120]  law and criminology hands down obama is a gangster well i'll tell you this if this if some of the
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:55.440]  activities they engaged in they engaged in the private sector you would have without a doubt
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:28:00.240]  you would have a very solid case moving forward andy mccarthy wrote a piece about that he called
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:06.720]  the fraud of obama care where the fcc alice would have you and i in handcuffs doing a perp walk right
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:11.680]  now if the stuff that happened with obama care now you talked about the financial stuff we haven't
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.600]  even dug into what the feds do i mean that's a whole other show we could do on how the fed is
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:21.600]  just destroying the asset accumulated by over a lifetime by our seniors right now and all doing
[1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:25.840]  it under the guise of helping us as they're kind of scratching your back yet reaching into your
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:31.520]  pocket um again with their favors to the to the banks i mean dot frank was nothing but a
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:37.360]  soft to big banks the great irony being the top 10 banks in the country alex had 55 percent of the
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:41.680]  asset in the class before dot frank so you're supposed to break all that up they figure out
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:47.360]  they have much less right now dot frank did that now they have 77 percent so what a stop to these
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:52.880]  big i mean it's disgusting it's like i'm exactly exactly and they politically the big banks funded
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:58.240]  gen 21 to make us poor so we're so poor we can't politically ever challenge them and in closing
[1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:03.440]  now the financial times is reporting that they're going to start charging you to keep money in a
[1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:08.720]  bank that's how devalued they've done with the qe unlimited that's what you're getting at right

[1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:19.040]  i would almost accept a tax hike to get rid of qe that's how desperate i want to get rid of qe
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:24.240]  because qe is the most devastating tax hike of all everything you have everything is worth less
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:28.480]  because it's all the nominated dollars dan it's so refreshing to talk to somebody that understands

[1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:19.040]  you are listening to an infowars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:20.320]  you are the resistance
[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:30.400]  by the way i can call up most republican libertarian type congresspeople and get them on the show
[1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:33.440]  and they're not even really that a popular of guests on the show
[1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:39.040]  so i'm not trying to get people like that on for so-called ratings you can get good information
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:46.720]  from them but ron poll somebody i can pretty much get on whenever i want to i can get rand poll on
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:54.560]  as well but i happen to know it creates conniption fits for me to pull strings to get him on
[1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:58.320]  and the last time rand poll was on earlier this year
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:05.520]  that'll be like january or something he called us and said why don't you ever try to get me on
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:11.440]  i said well we've called a few times they don't give me the message and and again there's always
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:16.160]  camps in these politicians that are mainline republicans working for them we're like don't
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:20.640]  go on that show that discredits you they still think that the mainstream media has power
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:26.080]  when the white house run msnbc goes look rand poll goes on the crazy man show
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:35.520]  and so i don't even attempt to get rand poll on i was making the joke to bonjino because i guarantee
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:39.600]  oh once he gets into congress hopefully there's not election frogs he's very popular and you see
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:45.680]  why he's very well spoken very smart that there'll be people saying don't do that but what we need
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:51.520]  to do as a population is face the reality and get radical because we're facing radical tyranny
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:59.120]  they're saying we're radical i'm not radical i'm radically informed i'm radically angry i mean we do
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:04.720]  real research we know what we're talking about here most radio shows even financial ones they
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:09.040]  can't even have a financial discussion at the level that bonjino and i were just having and
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:16.480]  that's just 101 stuff folks i study financial stuff probably 30 minutes a day and you're like
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:21.120]  well that doesn't sound like much that's more than most people do folks i mean i spend a good
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:26.880]  30 minutes sometimes an hour sometimes longer really doing research talking to all the experts
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:32.640]  i'm getting educated here on air every day talking to these people too i spend three four hours a day
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:40.480]  on air focused and i really know how things work and by the way here's the big secret
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:47.200]  it's not a secret how things work the pundits get up on the mainline shows and don't tell you
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:51.600]  what's really going on because they would lose their jobs if they did dylan radigan gets up and
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:56.320]  goes foreign banks and offshore corporations are above the law they're extracting us down to nothing
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:01.840]  we're being made poor on purpose it's a criminal plan i'm sick of it we have no future both parties
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:05.600]  are run by them what do they got and they're like uh we're not renewing your contract get out of here
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:10.320]  radigan got back with us he's traveling overseas this is when he gets back
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:14.240]  in a few weeks he'll come on um i don't know why our thoughts try to get him on but the point is
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:20.560]  is that we need everybody to act like dylan radigan and get upset when the reality is radical
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:25.840]  and sensational you tell it but the criminals are so radical it's like well it's not polite to say
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:30.560]  what you're doing you know it's kind of like you catch the neighbor doing something horrible
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:37.760]  and it's so horrible what they're doing the instinct is not to report it or not to do something about
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:42.240]  it it's like the it's like the opposite of the snitch culture the opposite of the snitch culture
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:46.160]  can also be bad as well because unless you go over there and beat your neighbor's brains out
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:52.000]  you're not letting you know justice be served that you know that they're say molesting their
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:58.400]  children uh or cooking methamphetamine in their bathtub and beating you know having having pit
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:02.560]  bull fights in the backyard or whatever and there was some guy yesterday i was on the hiking back
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:08.160]  trail and i see him walking and he smiles at me with an aggressive look it had a mean pit bull
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.480]  that acted most pit bulls i know were nice that came over and was actually menacing me it looked
[1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:18.160]  like eyes like a person it was like and i didn't i said god helped me not blow up i'm just gonna walk
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.960]  a little bit towards it as it's walking towards me up around this 20 foot wide path and then the
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:27.680]  dog kind of gave me a look looks so smart i know pit bulls aren't supposedly smart but it just really
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:31.600]  we're looking dog and they kind of like and then turned away but it came over to menace me
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:38.000]  and then the guy just kind of looked at me and i wanted to beat his ass right there because i mean
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.040]  i've got a chihuahua two uh french bulldogs in a lab if you like mean dogs that's great keep them
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:48.320]  on a leash and don't menace me with them there was a woman i've told this story coming down the
[1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:54.480]  hiking bike trail like january second of this year the reason i know is a few days later i went on
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:38:00.400]  pierce morgan i think it was like two days far less maybe january fifth or something the point
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:04.640]  was right before that and i was i was jogging and i finished jogging hiking back up this big hill
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:10.880]  out of the gully and this they had four german shepherds and and i love dogs and they came
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:15.440]  snarling i heard snarling and barking up the hill they did that to somebody else and it was cold
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:20.480]  weather they were in a good mood and they came snarling and and and like running towards me
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:25.040]  and if i would have run these dogs would have chased me down and bitten me so when they got
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:31.040]  within 10 feet i went get out of here get out of here and this woman's husband bows up he's a big
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:36.480]  guy they're like 100 yards 60 70 yards up above them and they're like hey man they're just you know
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:41.040]  they're just barking at you know i'm like no your dogs are snarling they're acting aggressive if i
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:45.040]  would have run from them like most people had done they were gonna attack me i go put them on a leash
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:49.760]  and then the guy got in my face and i said man you're totally in the wrong i said go ahead and
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:55.360]  punch me and i and i was gonna bash his brains out folks and i mean my whole thing is i'm not
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:00.640]  looking for trouble okay but i am it's like with government and all the rest of it what is your
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:05.920]  problem if i had a bunch of mean german shepherds i wouldn't have them off a leash out in the middle
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:12.640]  of nowhere messing with people and i still see those people sometimes and they like bug their eyes
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:17.760]  out and walk by with someone oh god i gotta get off it's alex jones they're like oh and it's just
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:23.840]  like man you're the one that menaced me your dogs ran up growling like they wanted to attack me
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:29.680]  and then i got upset about it and then i was a radical and i was thinking of that again this morning
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:35.680]  how that's how they act when their mean dog runs up to you and you go get out of here and yell at
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:43.360]  it meanly to a predator it's what's supposed to do a bear or a dog and then i'm not supposed to let
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:48.320]  them menace me and get scared and then they're on an ego trip no all that's gonna happen is you're
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:55.280]  gonna end up going into the hospital or maybe you're really tough and i am doesn't matter somebody's
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:05.760]  going to the hospital but nine times out of ten it's gonna be you and and i don't even know why
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:09.040]  i'm getting into that i just start thinking about that dog and it's the same thing with the government
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:12.880]  you're pushing us you're in our face you're growling you're wearing black uniforms you're
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:17.440]  putting all the surveillance stuff in calling it a battle grid you're huge armored vehicles
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:22.480]  helicopters war you've stolen all the money and then you're just bowing up to me and man i'm not
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:28.560]  getting scared here folks i'm scared that i'll do something i shouldn't and then i'll be i won't
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:33.760]  play it smart and defeat you and that's why i'm going to use my cerebral cortex and i'm not going
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:43.360]  to be an animal about this the problem is i've got a powerful political brain and a elegant brain
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:49.520]  like all of you do as well but i also have a big mean savage brain as well and and that's the problem
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:56.400]  but it's also the solution we have to get savage politically we have to get aggressive we have to
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:02.080]  get no holds barred or we're going to be overrun folks if you run from a big mean dog it's going
[1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:06.240]  to bite you on the butt if you're lucky or worse a pack of them they're going to attack you that's
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:10.400]  how people get killed and i've told this story 20 times i'll tell it again i was reading some story
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:16.240]  about a woman killed in a park i think was in canada by coyotes a few years ago and it was a
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:22.000]  it was a pretty good size town it was a park during the day and no one was there and she'd like the
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:29.680]  movies saw a pack of coyotes fell down and began crawling and because i know because it was actually
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:33.520]  some witnesses drove by they were too afraid to get involved and so the dogs went well that's
[1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:37.440]  prey that's even prey would run she'd seen all the movies you're supposed to
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:45.440]  like you know crawl backwards from the coyote in fear whereas a pack of coyotes ran by many times
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:49.360]  out where i live in the country you'll see them run by and i mean they're absolutely scared of you
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:54.720]  but i've seen coyotes in a field with my mom and dad when i was a kid and really cold weather like
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:58.640]  this we were on our ranch we're actually on the ranch next door we want to see a family cemetery
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:03.920]  they let us on there to see a jones and brown family cemetery and we're walking over to see
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:10.560]  graves from like 1829 and stuff and about eight big coyotes all fluffed up in the cold ran out
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:15.440]  about 50 yards away out of the woods and looked at us and then we look back at my mom's like how
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:20.320]  beautiful but the fact that we weren't afraid they then turn and ran she's like look and then they
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:27.920]  turn and ran but imagine an average trendy would just go uh and would fall down and go uh uh on
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:32.560]  their back and the coyotes will come and kill you coyotes have never attacked people until now
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:38.480]  there's a lot of cases of it now and americans act like that like that woman falling down and and
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:44.320]  it's like a playing varmint tapes how you hunt coyotes with you know the sound of squealing
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:49.760]  dying rabbits bringing them in and americans think groveling to government acting like sheep
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:55.280]  acting like slaves is going to protect you all it does is like go out in the woods at night and
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:59.840]  play the sounds of dying rabbits you bring them in when you act like a baby rabbit that's at its
[1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:04.720]  back broken you guys go to youtube and find a varmint tape i'm sure they've got them but people
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:10.480]  hear a varmint tape the sound of squealing dying animals it's a horrible sound i don't but the point
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:22.880]  is is that that's the that's the new sound not of a sheep but it is the sound of the american people
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:30.160]  just squealing to the police and the police if they weren't a predator they start to behave
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:33.840]  like one because you're flopping around on the ground acting completely guilty of something
[1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:39.280]  and then it just enables this whole imperious ridiculous attitude and again i
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:47.760]  i don't want to keep going off into it it it just shows the weird disconnect that's that's
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:52.800]  going on out there now i want to open the phones up till the bottom of the next hour when we premiere
[1:43:52.800 --> 1:44:04.720]  the vivian kubrick interview that uh josh and uh rob Jacobson
[1:44:07.200 --> 1:44:12.720]  put together just since last night in fact josh stayed up all night uh one of our great
[1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:16.400]  camera guys and editors to get this together he and it could have even been even better if he had
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:21.520]  more time but it really turned out very very good we've got some clips from stanley kubrick films
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:25.200]  and she worked on a lot of them obviously and i was really impressed talking to her
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:30.000]  just how informed she was and a lot of stuff she was teaching me a lot of different angles on things
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:34.960]  and so hopefully we'll get her in studio she's gonna come down to austin and if she feels like it
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:41.680]  come in studio and just talk about the whole world that way because so much of it was off record
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:48.160]  the two nights that we hung out myself and her and the crew and she was just telling me stuff about
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:53.280]  herself and about hollywood and about her father stanley kubrick and it was just like
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:45:01.040]  as a stanley kubrick uber fan i was just like oh on cloud nine man i was i mean i don't know
[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:06.400]  and she's right to trust me i actually instructed on my crew i was like any of that you heard
[1:45:07.040 --> 1:45:11.200]  you've signed on disclosure keep your mouth shut about it but she was kind of weaning and whispering
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:16.160]  tell me stuff but it was pretty amazing i mean i because i i know a lot about stanley kubrick
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:20.320]  nobody knows hardly anything about stanley kubrick and and his daughter who has done like
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:24.720]  one interview in 10 years it was amazing i know she's probably listening right now the vivian
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:29.760]  was really great meeting you're just a magical person and i do look forward to uh my wife and
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:34.880]  i taking out to dinner taking you around austin or whatever uh and she moved from california years
[1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:41.680]  ago to outside dallas and uh well i'm not gonna even say why but i i just wow wow so that's coming
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:54.880]  up the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:46:03.120]  air 800-259-9231 uh but um again the interview we have with her she gets into the nature of the
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:08.800]  world and her view of things which i found to be very very interesting we didn't get into all
[1:46:08.800 --> 1:46:12.880]  the stanley kubrick stuff there's some of that because i didn't push her to do an interview
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:19.200]  i don't ever push celebrities or interesting people or famous artists or insiders she's
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:24.480]  like the insider insider i don't ever push them to come on the show or whatever she's people want
[1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:28.960]  to come on they come on and i'm 90 of the celebrities always tell me incredible stuff
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:34.880]  but then it's always off record and i tell you that's what's really cool about being on the
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:42.640]  very cutting edge of the alternative real media is that is that all these really neat people
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:47.040]  end up sharing things with you and then you never burn your sources
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:54.560]  and so just more and more people come to you and when i say something like this is you know
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:59.440]  someone told me off record but here's what they said i'm not saying who they are off record
[1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:02.720]  and somebody tells you this is off record you can say this but you can't see where it came from
[1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:07.920]  that's the person's off record the source is off record but then i can tell you what they said
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:12.800]  because then there's sometimes i'm told stuff that's completely off record period and then
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:18.880]  i can't even tell you what i know or a lot of times you get a high level source intel and and
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:24.160]  and then you confirm it through another source and then a third source and you go okay all right
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:29.680]  Saudi Arabia is already getting nuclear weapons and so is iran iran's already got weapons multiple
[1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:34.400]  weapons and they're just trying to get delivery systems and so all this talk about the centrifuges
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:38.880]  it doesn't matter that they really can't make bombs it's an excuse with bunker busters to try to
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:46.480]  figure out where the nukes are to take the nukes out they're not technically nukes they're they're
[1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:56.560]  atomic but um then do you go on air and tell people about something like that because it's
[1:47:56.560 --> 1:48:01.040]  dangerous to get that type of information you know Stanley Kubrick on record got a lot of
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:08.000]  key info for his films and um i'm not gonna even say anymore because that wasn't off record but
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.240]  i'm not gonna say anything she told me when that wasn't on camera because and again i wasn't even
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:17.280]  going to interview her as the point and then she just came and stepped in on camera where she was
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:22.000]  there and i was talking to the crowd and then there she is again on that friday that final day
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:28.720]  i was like boom you know she talked to us so that's coming up and um we're gonna take your phone
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  calls when come back in the next segment and then before i go to her i've got to get to inside a
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:41.840]  twitter robot factory fake activity often uh bought for publicity purposes influence trending topics
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:50.160]  yeah obama first it was 76 percent of his twitter followers were faked then it was 91 percent folks
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:49:00.080]  they're basically all fake jay-z uh what's her name um jay-z uh all those people all of them
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:04.560]  it comes it's all fake it's all fake but then when somebody has 15 million twitter followers
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:10.320]  it creates a an effect with a sheeple they then believe that that's really popular and it becomes
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:17.440]  popular and by putting out fake popular ideas you then actually create the fraud that that then
[1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:23.600]  becomes the cultural norm and that is hijacking culture people really want freedom people really
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:31.440]  want women or women men or men you know all that stuff mom and apple pie baseball you know wild west
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:36.000]  that's what people really like they don't like nanny state and all this but they they sell the fake
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:42.240]  cultures they sell it all and then they suppress because we happen to have put monitoring systems
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:47.680]  on servers and on youtube and things and and and we've confirmed that the activity on our videos
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:54.080]  is way more than even what they say and it's still gargantuan and so there's just all sorts of
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:50:00.960]  gaming and scamming and manipulation that's going on out there and just be aware of that and i'm

[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:28.480]  you know i've got that card somewhere actually took that home with me and and yeah we are trying

[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:36.640]  cleaned out some of the dead weight and i've really got a great team here now so we're ready to go to
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:44.320]  the next level yeah it was funny when mcbreen pulled up to uh you know for as the getaway driver
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:48.400]  when you were leaving uh i was busting your horns i was like hey you almost lost your
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:52.880]  girlfriend you looked at me like well i don't have a girlfriend and you see i said oh no that's
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:57.920]  your bullhorn that's your girlfriend you laughed a little bit then you took off the left but um
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:56:04.560]  a couple things being in the telecommunications industry a lot of the things that you talk about
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:09.040]  a lot of the information that you have it is right on as far as the telecommunications act
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:13.520]  but there was a lot of there were a lot of things that were implemented before that you
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:17.760]  should know i know i know that i just started researching it from what i was told by engineers
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:22.880]  then i know that i'm not an engineer i just know a symbol amount but no it's all on record that's
[1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:31.440]  what's frustrating sure well you should look up an acronym it's cal ea calia so this was an act
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:37.200]  that bill clinton put in in 94 yeah that's for all the metadata and stuff that's what our insiders
[1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:46.000]  have told me to look into yeah it it stands for communications access for law enforcement act so
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:51.280]  what that did and i was one of the engineers and a lot of the project management you know
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:58.080]  implementation on these things for horizon from new york city downtown i'm saying okay so in other
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:05.920]  words we've got these companies vendors that are based in tel Aviv israel who when we need tech
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:13.120]  support on this they can just log in via ip to this system you know that's right in fact calia
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:18.000]  i know on the phone system it's actually an israeli company runs it and that points out
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:24.320]  that israel talk about the ultimate hack has backdoors into the phone systems yeah and when
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:28.720]  i would be talking to these engineers from the vendors who were giving us product training on
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:35.280]  this stuff i i just started calling it the mi protocol instead of ip i said well this is basically
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:41.200]  the internet is the military industrial complex this computer network and internet protocol
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:46.960]  is the way for them to hack into everything no no that's on record that's why i finally wired
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:50.880]  and i'm sure they got it from me because that's what i've said they have weaponized the web from
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:57.360]  the beginning it is the electronic in slow motion if you can see it sped up in a time lapse it's an
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:58:03.360]  electronic skin growing into everything monitoring everything we're already interfaced with it with
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:08.960]  ipads then it goes to glasses then it goes to a brain port then it goes to our brain imagine it
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:15.200]  like an alien jumping out of the the egg onto our face and then literally taking us over and that's
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:19.840]  the official pentagon plan imagine slow motion you know a computer that would run a wristwatch
[1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:23.680]  today the size of a giant building then it's smaller then it's you know something a thousand
[1:58:23.680 --> 1:58:28.640]  times stronger in your hand than iphone now you're always looking at it now it's sunglasses now it's
[1:58:28.640 --> 1:58:32.720]  it's contacts then it's a chip then it's a port then it's your whole brain then it's your whole
[1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:38.160]  body zipped gone because once you're wireheaded they just hit one button and kill everybody well

[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:48.320]  this for a decade since i've read the magazine sitting in a restaurant it was by the bar where
[2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:53.840]  i was picking up food um that i was reading in my team magazine and just said it's a technological
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:00:59.200]  skin it'll track everything you do it's gonna absorb humanity and that's our plan and then i
[2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:03.120]  go on the radio and talk about it the new york times comes out and says i'm insane i mean i
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:07.680]  i quote ray Kurzweil and they say i said that and then it's like when they're saying it and
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:10.800]  they're saying it's a good idea to get rid of humanity and have us merge with machines those
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:14.960]  that are left it's like oh how smart yeah that's a good idea and i go hey maybe we should debate
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:20.080]  this shut up it doesn't exist you nutball don't listen to him kids he's crazy and i'm just sitting
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:25.520]  here living in a science fiction movie and for one thing's for sure we got front row seats for
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:30.240]  the battle for humanity i don't know how anybody could be bored and i guess that's why i'm gonna
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:35.360]  you know i had kids and i'm gonna go on living and loving if you ain't loving you ain't living to
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:40.080]  quote george straight that will remind me he's coming to town we guys remind me to get tickets
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:44.080]  because remember you said he hadn't come to town in forever but now he is i want i want to
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:48.240]  go see george straight again i didn't see him since i was a kid i mean teenager saw him in
[2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:55.760]  dallas uh let's go ahead and talk to kyle uh in the brass kit kyle you're on the air thanks for
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:01.280]  holding god bless the beating heart of liberty and freedom and god bless the truth and reality
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:05.280]  you constantly express on the show every day in your whole team well god bless you i wanted to
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:10.240]  talk about thank you i wanted to talk about the uh you guys came out with a couple articles uh
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:14.880]  from seattle one was in new zero these were dating back a couple months made six eight months back
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:18.400]  talking about taking the fluoride out of the water and how they got something passed in just their
[2:02:18.400 --> 2:02:25.280]  town how do we get a candidate whether it be democrat or republican to back taking the fluoride
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:30.160]  out of the water and to back taking the gmo's out of the best thing to do is to point out that the
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:36.480]  fda under lawsuit and under 90 plus percent i want to say 99 but it was almost all of their
[2:02:36.480 --> 2:02:44.080]  tarsicologist medical doctors scientists uh toxicologists that worked for the food and drug
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:49.040]  administration and the environmental protection agency about 12 years ago they did it and then
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:55.120]  again about a year and a half ago or two years ago it was in mainstream news they sent registered
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:03:00.720]  briefs to the boss together imagine the organizational skill of those federal employees
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:06.000]  really caring to get everyone in the country almost all of them so they couldn't fire them all you
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:11.120]  understand you didn't bring the brief with the cancer studies and the diabetes studies and the
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:18.320]  brain damage studies from fluoride and the lowered iq studies and so the fed uh the globalists that
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:28.160]  were in our government responded by saying okay we say 1.3 parts per million or 1.6 you got to lower
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:36.640]  you got to lower that to you know not 1.6 but you've got to lower it down to 0.7 parts per million
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:41.760]  and we want it phased out in the next two years out of pesticides it's bio accumulating and we
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:48.720]  want to put out recommendations that uh all these powdered egg companies and the rest of it that
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:52.080]  can have hundreds of parts per million i mean that's why i've eaten powdered eggs for a certain
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:57.360]  vomiting i mean it's just like it's a roach poison and they're just putting it in there and yeah
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:01.360]  it's a great preservative because nothing can get into it you put it in bread anything weevils
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:05.280]  aren't going to eat it it's just why mcdonald's hamburgers or you can put them under glass five
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:11.760]  years later they look fine mold won't even grow on them it's a chemical weapon and it's oh it's
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:18.560]  just incredible so to answer your question uh you sue them you put them on notice and you get a
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:24.080]  local toxicologist or something to go with you and you say hey the epa and fda shed reduce the
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:30.160]  amount of this in the water and you get their study that oh you're still at 1.6 or 1.3 you make
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:33.680]  them reduce it and you say well why don't we just take it completely out instead of force
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:40.080]  medicating and if they don't you sue them for force medicating how's that sound well if we
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:44.320]  have all those other countries that are already taking you out what does it take to have a candidate
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:48.240]  that's trying to get elected to mention all these things i tell you what i'm gonna come back to you
[2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:52.560]  this is so important kyle we're gonna know about strategies on this this is really important and
[2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:58.720]  then we're gonna go to uh kathy chris allen and others i'm alec shones info wars dot com follow
[2:04:58.720 --> 2:05:04.720]  us on twitter real alec shones i had tried everything i'd cut back the amount of food i was eating i
[2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:10.320]  was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals
[2:05:10.320 --> 2:05:16.320]  and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as i had that i immediately could eat half of
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:21.680]  what i was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info

[2:09:01.300 --> 2:09:09.300]  And to get your soul, the power structure has to attack your body and dumb it down
[2:09:09.300 --> 2:09:18.800]  With poisons, fluoride, GMOs, all on record, shredding the body, shredding the mind, so that you're so weakened you acquiesce to what's happening
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:23.800]  We have a caller we're going back to in a moment, Kyle in Nebraska asked me a really important question
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:28.800]  And this is the type of stuff we need to be doing on InfoWars, not only news
[2:09:28.800 --> 2:09:35.800]  I need at least once a week to do a particular subject on what I believe the best battle plan is
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:41.800]  Like Alex Jones' battle plan fluoride, Alex Jones' battle plan electronic voting machines
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:47.800]  Alex Jones' battle plan second amendment, Alex Jones' battle plan borders national sovereignty
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:55.800]  Alex Jones' battle plan, it doesn't mean I have all the answers, but you know, you get other people's perspectives on it as well
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:01.800]  But people are always asking me what I think, so I'll be glad to tell you
[2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:06.800]  How would I get fluoride out? Well in a lot of cities, you've got such an arrogant establishment
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:12.800]  They know that the fluoride gets taken out, that it's the beginning of the end, it's like the Kennedy assassination
[2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:19.800]  If they ever admit that criminal elements killed Kennedy, well then that unravels everything, like a string and a sweater
[2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:21.800]  So they'll do anything to prop that up
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:27.800]  And hydrofluorosalic acid, you do need some calcium fluoride, it's good for you
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:33.800]  You need small amounts of it, it's in all vegetables, it's in a lot of meat, very small amounts
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:35.800]  Trace element that you need
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:42.800]  Just like you need trace amounts of bioavailable arsenic, the type that's in an apple, it's actually good for you
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:46.800]  Major studies on that, look it up, but it's bound and it's a very small amount
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:51.800]  And it helps activate other things in the body, is what scientists, medical doctors, nutritionists have basically said
[2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:58.800]  I'm not a scientist or medical doctor, nutritionists, I'm going off what is known science in the elites
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:07.800]  Like if I wanted to live longer, I would eat a near starvation diet of super high nutrient with a lot of trace poisons in it
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:14.800]  And I would live probably 30% longer, that's on record, you eat plenty, you exercise a lot, you're great looking, you're super happy
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:22.800]  But a little bit plump and stuff, you're going to die when you're 75, that's why there's trees out in California
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:28.800]  That are multi-thousands of years old and they're brethren down in the valley, they get plenty of water and everything
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:33.800]  Live a couple hundred years, they live thousands
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:40.800]  Up on the windswept crags with not enough water, barely surviving, they live a lot longer
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:45.800]  They've got studies on rats, they can make them live three times as longer on their starvation diet
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:51.800]  They've got studies on worms where they can make them live as much as 10 times longer, different types of worms
[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:55.800]  You can look that up and it deals with the DNA strands and the rest of it
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:00.800]  But the point here is, and you're like, what's it to do with fluoride?
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:07.800]  Hydrofluorosilic acid is electrified
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:16.800]  They've manipulated its structure where it's super highly active, bouncing around in your body, frying everything
[2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:21.800]  And then other trace drugs, the fluoride is there, the hydrofluorosilic acid, that's what it really is
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:33.800]  The fluorine family, the electrified fluorine, the hydrofluorosilic acid is in there to supercharge all the other crap they're putting in the food and the water
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:44.800]  The drugs, it is the ultimate, in fact the scientists and doctors I've talked to say, they know of no adjuvant that's better than hydrofluorosilic acid
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:51.800]  My dad took biology at UT and that's all they talked about, was hydrofluorosilic acid, what an incredible adjuvant it is
[2:12:51.800 --> 2:13:00.800]  That's why some drugs have hydrofluorosilic acid in them, in fact all the Prozac family, to then activate the other stuff that's in there
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:10.800]  So it's the base drug that they put in the water to then activate for very small amounts of other stuff will absolutely jack you
[2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:16.800]  See that's why, and I'm not doing a plug here, but I guess I might as well, it's time to take it out and take it this morning, I forgot
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:23.800]  Survival shield, the nascent iodine, the nascent iodine is also electrically souped up and charged
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:31.800]  This particular patented type, I'm told by Dr. Group and my dad's from the National Academy of Science, I've had him check into it before I even got into it
[2:13:31.800 --> 2:13:42.800]  This is most nascent, we believe, we've had nuclear reactor tests, you name it, it's very hard to figure all this out, but we've got a big paper coming out soon
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:48.800]  With a bunch of scientists and lawyers, you name it, this is so proprietary ladies and gentlemen
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:14:01.800]  This particular survival shield, we believe is a very special form and it appears is truly unbound and high-powered electrical
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:07.800]  Okay, and I'm just putting it in layman's terms, to go in and just strip out the fluoride and all the garbage
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:15.800]  And I know it's really helped my clarity, I mean it's amazing, Dr. Group is a genius, okay, this has been around for 20 years and nobody even knew about it
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:22.800]  There's the other iodines out there which you certainly need, I'm not knocking those, but it tastes like rocket fuel and I've taken them, it didn't do the same thing
[2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:34.800]  This is available at InfoWarsLife.com or calling 888-25-33139, but I didn't get into that because of that, I just started thinking, wow, I'm talking about the fluorine hydrofluorosilic acid
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:40.800]  And then I'm not, and then here's the solution sitting right there, the real solution is get it out of your water
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:53.800]  Here's an example right now, the American Dental Association, the American Medical Association, seven years ago, came out because of lawsuits and their own scientists going public
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:15:02.800]  And the EPA folks a few years before them going public, they went public again last year, they went and they had it all in their paperwork
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:05.800]  But the dentist still don't even know this because they don't read the paperwork, they said, no, it's true
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:18.800]  Under five, now they're saying under seven, just this year, do not brush your teeth with fluoride, do not swallow it, do not take the pills, do not take the treatments, and do not drink water that has it in it
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:29.800]  So what do they do? They come out with baby water, with souped up fluoride in it, which on record is a massive reduction in IQ
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:36.800]  You give children this stuff when they're a baby, you might as well beat their head up against a wall, you might as well give them a lobotomy, it's basically a soft core lobotomy
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:46.800]  There it is, CDC and ADA now advised to avoid using fluoride, now you bring that in to the city council in a brief, you go visit all the council members first
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:16:00.800]  And you say, here's the FDA and EPA forced last year by the vast majority of their scientists signing a paper threatening to leave or sue that it's giving people cancer, brain damaging them and causing dental fluorosis and bone tractors, get it out of the water
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:09.800]  So the FDA had to come out with the EPA last year and say, okay, phase it out of pesticide, phase it out of the water
[2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:18.800]  You think that was a victory, that was in the New York Times? No, they're fluoridating more cities, they don't care because of course they're not stopping
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:30.800]  You think they're going to let us remove the adjuvant that supercharges all of this from the food and the water so that they'll have to put mega doses in the water and the food to get us there
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:35.800]  It's only turbocharging, God knows what else they're putting in
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:42.800]  The Soviets, the Nazis used pharma to control people, now they're doing it through the stinking water and the food, okay?
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:50.800]  It's a fact, the Russians used it, the Nazis picked it up, it came out in the Nuremberg trial, they're force-drugging us
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:58.800]  And then I take the Nathan Iadine, and what does it do for me? It helps with all the environmental crap, helps strip it out, oh I just love it
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:06.800]  You can go to, you know, we're New Older, I have the good fluorine jackasses, and I'm telling everybody about it
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:11.800]  You don't have to even get mine, just go get one of the gourmet salts that has it in it
[2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:17.800]  It's not like this, but it's good enough, gourmet salts, try that one, I don't even sell them, get them!
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:21.800]  See what happens, of course Bloomberg says you shouldn't have salt
[2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:28.800]  They want to make a law, the White House regulations are Cass Sunstein, that you shouldn't get sun and sun's bad for you, period
[2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:31.800]  And anyone that says you need sun for vitamin D is a liar
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:45.800]  There are so many studies on record from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, British Medical Journal, that you've got to get at least 30 minutes of sun a week or you would basically die
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:52.800]  In countries where they don't get sun, their cancer rates were off the chart, they sort of put the sun lamps in like Norway and places inside the houses
[2:17:52.800 --> 2:18:01.800]  And suicide rate and cancer rates started going down, you like a freaking plant, folks, you don't have photosynthesis, you have another synthesis, you got to have it
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:10.800]  And yes it ends up burning your skin, and it gets into giving you cancer, but you'll die quicker if you don't, you're meant to go out there, you're meant to die
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:17.800]  You got all these radiation waves of every type you can imagine blasting through us in the universe, we're basically hollow
[2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:27.800]  But you've got to have it, you've got to have a sleep cycle, you're meant to go to bed at night, you're meant to get up when the chickens wake up, that's what you're designed to do
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:35.800]  I'm ranting, I said I'd help the caller, you bring all that to your city council, you publish it in the newspaper, you know, that you've given them as a notice you're going to sue
[2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:41.800]  And then you sue them for forced drugging, you sue them for not following the EPA and FDA guidelines
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:46.800]  And they'll laugh at you and say you're powerless, you can't sue us, we're the government, BS
[2:18:46.800 --> 2:18:51.800]  It's all a mind game saying, you know, that the emperor is wearing clothes when he's butt naked
[2:18:51.800 --> 2:18:55.800]  Does that answer your question, Kyle? We have the evidence, we have the facts, we have it all on our side
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:19:01.800]  You were asking how you get the cities to do it, you simply bring in all the city council under the mayor and you keep bringing it to them
[2:19:01.800 --> 2:19:05.800]  And you say, you come back at citizens communication every week, you say, did you read the briefing?
[2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:09.800]  You say, okay, fine, I brought friends here to give me their time to read the briefing
[2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:16.800]  You read the mainstream news headlines, you read the study headlines, you tell them what happened, you threaten to sue these stores
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:23.800]  Listen, I've already been told by CVS and Walgreens managers, one of them will come up and be on video, it's on the YouTube channel
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:26.800]  And say, yeah, we can't even sell it now because of you
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:31.800]  Literally, people say, I want that off the shelves and they won't buy it, just from me talking about it mainly
[2:19:31.800 --> 2:19:37.800]  And others, like Mercola and others, they're pulling it off a lot of shelves because we just won't buy it
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:41.800]  Just warn everyone, that's a chemical weapon to hurt your baby, doesn't mean the stupid manager knows that
[2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:44.800]  He grew up drinking it, he's walking dead from it
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:46.800]  Does that answer your question, Kyle?
[2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:52.800]  Yes, sir, appreciate it, and I am currently taking these tonight, my mom, Kyle, has one, so she's got one, I got one
[2:19:52.800 --> 2:19:55.800]  And I'm fine, beyond 10, you can drink very soon, too
[2:19:55.800 --> 2:20:00.800]  God bless your brother, or just eat oranges, whatever, the point is that you need vitamin C, it's very evil
[2:20:00.800 --> 2:20:07.800]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine
[2:20:07.800 --> 2:20:11.800]  A practice now banned in nations around the world
[2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:13.800]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[2:20:13.800 --> 2:20:14.800]  Fluoride
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:22.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, in 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:27.800]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record
[2:20:27.800 --> 2:20:33.800]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:42.800]  Bottom line, iodine is important, unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family
[2:20:42.800 --> 2:20:52.800]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com InfowarsLife Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies

[2:22:00.800 --> 2:22:05.800]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind
[2:22:05.800 --> 2:22:15.800]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television
[2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:27.800]  In a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home
[2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:32.800]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer
[2:22:32.800 --> 2:22:39.800]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go, plus they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs
[2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:49.800]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com

[2:22:56.800 --> 2:23:10.800]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent
[2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:29.800]  I-N-F-I-D-E-L Body Armor.com
[2:23:56.800 --> 2:24:20.800]  Alright, coming up is our interview with Vivian Kubrick and then I'll do a little bit of overdrive for those that are patiently holding Kathy, Chris, Alan, Phil, John, I'll try to get to all of you
[2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:31.800]  I appreciate you calling in on a whole host of subjects like CIA and terrorism, JFK protest, candidate for governor wants to talk, folks want to talk about a whole bunch of stuff
[2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:41.800]  Look at this headline. I hope it's not all foggy and cloudy like it's been coming up this Thursday, Friday into Saturday because my dad's got a big mead telescope
[2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:57.800]  From back when I was in college, we would go out like every few weeks out to the Atlanta, the kind of scrub brush desert on clear nights and just take incredible photos with 35mm adapter on film of comets and Jupiter and Saturn
[2:24:57.800 --> 2:25:11.800]  And I've got a big shoebox, a film of all that somewhere, I go into Walgreens and get it developed. We got to get out that telescope and clean it up and we've used it since then but it's all dirty and it's been around for a while, it's been around almost 20 years
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:30.800]  It's a big nice 12 inch, I guess it's the reflector or the reflector, yeah but it's a big round one, it's a big fat short one, I used to know a lot about them, I've forgotten a lot about them but I want to get out there and look at that because it's supposedly maybe the brightest comet seen in modern times
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:46.800]  So we'll be covering that obviously. French riders protest over taxing, horses will suffer, thousands of horse lovers paraded their animals to Central Paris on Sunday in a protest against a planned sales tax they say will put riding centers out of business and send horses to the slaughterhouse
[2:25:46.800 --> 2:26:01.800]  Yeah folks, they've got carbon taxes, gas taxes, new sales taxes, the average French person pays over 80% in tax, the middle class pays 100% right now, you know like that's impossible, no it's meant to bankrupt them, that's the plan
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:16.800]  And then the ultra rich billionaires, they pay nothing, on record they just pay nothing, they all leave the country but then govern in the country and have laws passed that they can have Swiss bank accounts and it's all come out, nobody gets in trouble so just total evil
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:36.800]  And this is what, listen government can be a force of good if good people are in it and it's small and focused and has a mission and a vigilant people are governed by it who keep it on a short leash but when you get a big decadent slob population with decadent, tyrannical, piratical
[2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:50.800]  Corporations that are bigger than government and operate like government and use it as a tool, it is in the conduit where the rubber meets the road of enslavement, I'm trying to hurry because I've got other news to cover before we go to break
[2:26:50.800 --> 2:27:06.800]  And just like the FDA and the EPA, their own scientist got mad, signed petitions internally, demanded fluoride be taken out of the water but still it hasn't been because the globalists control the top of the government
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:27.800]  So they're good people in government, I want to get that straight who were actually, were focused and caring and involved but still we've now got to put pressure on the system and use their research and facts that 90, the last number I saw was almost every EPA scientist
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:36.800]  Signed on to saying it's deadly poison, get it out and people don't even know that, they don't even know you can go pull those articles up, so that's an example of that
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:43.800]  Now I mentioned this and I'm not going to have time to get into it in detail, I've got to do it tomorrow or do a special video or something
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:28:02.800]  Inside a Twitter robot factory and this is really nothing here but it just gets into how you can pay $58 from an online vendor in Pakistan and get a thousand fake Twitter followers
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:19.800]  But the big companies all do this, Sony's been caught doing it, they've all been caught doing it, where all these big Hollywood stars and people literally pay to get four or five million fake followers and then the news division that actually owns that star's career that they're signed with
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:31.800]  In many cases, they've got TV shows with whatever the case is, they will then go look, this star's got five, six, seven million followers or the record company will pay to have TV report that
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:40.800]  And so there's the headline, Barack Obama is political king of the fake Twitter followers and more than 19.5 million online fans who don't really exist
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:48.800]  And that's it, you go to his YouTube channel, his videos have like a thousand views, that's just that they haven't paid for fake bots
[2:28:48.800 --> 2:29:02.800]  Now we've gone and actually looked at it and found that we're actually getting more visitors and more views on videos, we've done this by putting it on a page and then we have something to contract and see if we're actually clicking it
[2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:10.800]  And we know more people are watching YouTube videos that we put up, we've done the test about five times in the test we did and another test is about three and a half times
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:21.800]  So they've got like some governor on the Alex Jones channel, so I told Watson I said get a YouTube channel, do the exact same videos you do on my YouTube on yours and see what happens and they get five times the views
[2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:28.800]  His average video is about 200,000, ours is about 50,000, so that's how this works
[2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:36.800]  And it's there and it's all game and it's all fake and it creates the perception that they're the mainstream and that their ideas are dominant and they're popular
[2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:40.800]  When in truth they're all collapsing and falling in on themselves
[2:29:40.800 --> 2:29:50.800]  Now a very thought-provoking and intriguing premiere of an in-depth interview with Stanley Kubrick's amazing daughter coming up and then we're going to put it on YouTube for everybody
[2:29:50.800 --> 2:29:52.800]  In March, the Empire's on the run

[2:31:03.800 --> 2:31:09.800]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com
[2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:16.800]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing
[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:21.800]  And that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at InfoWars.com
[2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:25.800]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen
[2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:29.800]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you

[2:31:39.800 --> 2:31:40.800]  The book that woke me up
[2:31:40.800 --> 2:31:45.800]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You and a Gender 21 by Rosa Corey
[2:31:45.800 --> 2:31:48.800]  The book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover
[2:31:48.800 --> 2:31:52.800]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen
[2:31:52.800 --> 2:31:55.800]  Exposing the scourge that is vaccines
[2:31:55.800 --> 2:32:00.800]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com
[2:32:00.800 --> 2:32:05.800]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[2:32:05.800 --> 2:32:08.800]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:13.800]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:15.800]  It all comes down to one thing
[2:32:15.800 --> 2:32:17.800]  We are what we eat
[2:32:17.800 --> 2:32:21.800]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:25.800]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff
[2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:28.800]  All of this has been engineered by design
[2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:31.800]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:34.800]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs
[2:32:34.800 --> 2:32:37.800]  To learn more, visit InfoWarshop.com

[2:32:59.800 --> 2:33:10.800]  Our interview with Ms. Kubrick
[2:33:10.800 --> 2:33:12.800]  My name is Vivienne Kubrick
[2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:14.800]  My father was Stanley Kubrick
[2:33:14.800 --> 2:33:16.800]  I live here in Dallas
[2:33:16.800 --> 2:33:21.800]  And I think I have enough experience from that aspect of being Stanley Kubrick's daughter
[2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:25.800]  To know that there are really some things that you have to fight very hard for
[2:33:25.800 --> 2:33:30.800]  And my father as an artist fought very hard for the integrity of his films
[2:33:30.800 --> 2:33:36.800]  Because even he was subject to a lot of pressure to not make the films he made
[2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:50.800]  I would say three different sheriffs came up and they
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:52.800]  May I demonstrate on you?
[2:33:52.800 --> 2:33:55.800]  They went like this
[2:33:55.800 --> 2:33:56.800]  You have to look down
[2:33:56.800 --> 2:33:58.800]  They literally just went like that
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:00.800]  And I said, hey, don't push me
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:01.800]  And they said, keep moving
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:02.800]  And I said, I am moving
[2:34:02.800 --> 2:34:03.800]  And they said, turn around
[2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:07.800]  And I was like going, well, you know, I'm walking, I'm moving
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:11.800]  And then again, separate two other ones
[2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:12.800]  Push me like that
[2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:14.800]  I'm sorry, keep shoving it
[2:34:14.800 --> 2:34:18.800]  And it just seemed to me like, why would you be so aggressive?
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:21.800]  This man is obviously a psychotic
[2:34:21.800 --> 2:34:26.800]  Why can't you just say, okay, everyone, you know, would you mind just going over here
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:29.800]  Excellent on your first amendment rights
[2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:31.800]  How about you stand over there
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:36.800]  Because we've been told by Homeland Security or whoever told them that you can't be here
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:38.800]  Like, why can't they be truthful?
[2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:40.800]  Why can't they be polite?
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:42.800]  Why can't they just be calm?
[2:34:42.800 --> 2:34:44.800]  Why do they have to be aggressive?
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:45.800]  I mean, I was doing nothing
[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:49.800]  And in fact, when everyone was shouting and going crazy
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:51.800]  I mean, to be honest with you, it was all love and respect
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:34:54.800]  I also felt that it's wrong to shout at the police
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:56.800]  You slaves, you scumbags
[2:34:56.800 --> 2:34:59.800]  Because I feel, honestly, I feel sorry for them
[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:04.800]  Because I believe that, I can't believe that all of them are just dead in the head
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:05.800]  I just can't believe that
[2:35:05.800 --> 2:35:09.800]  Sure, but let's recap from what you saw being here today for the last two, three hours then
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:11.800]  We come over, it's over
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:13.800]  There's been lawsuits filed, they had to let us in
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:16.800]  The Dallas police said, yes, you're allowed to go in to the second perimeter
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:18.800]  To the first perimeter, not into the final one
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:22.800]  Then that was open for a private wreath laying for folks that don't agree with official stories
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:25.800]  So we were supposed to be let in, they let us in
[2:35:25.800 --> 2:35:27.800]  The Dallas police did
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:32.800]  And then Homeland Security sent over their auxiliary federalized sheriff's deputies
[2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:35.800]  So that's what happened there
[2:35:35.800 --> 2:35:38.800]  Did you notice how they came in and ordered the other cops to stand back?
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:39.800]  I wasn't looking at that
[2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:43.800]  I was actually looking at each police with my sign, sorry, with my First Amendment
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:46.800]  I was just trying to gently smile at them like going
[2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:48.800]  Hey, this is for you too, you know
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:50.800]  This is for everyone that you love and care about
[2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:53.800]  And you too, because there isn't a police state that's ever been on this planet
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:57.800]  Where everyone didn't get their ass burnt when it really got going
[2:35:57.800 --> 2:35:59.800]  I mean, Hitler's regime
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:03.800]  All the original people that were in the government or helping him
[2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:08.800]  You know, in Russia Stalin, his mates that helped him get it
[2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:12.800]  I mean, you know, you think they might learn that it doesn't actually work
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:16.800]  Tyranny just begets more tyranny until everyone's just shooting and killing each other
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:17.800]  And it's a terrible mess
[2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:20.800]  And then, thank God, it ends
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:22.800]  I'm afraid
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:29.800]  I'm afraid, Dave
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:33.800]  And I personally, I'm just desperate
[2:36:33.800 --> 2:36:36.800]  For the things that are beautiful and wonderful
[2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:40.800]  And exalted about the American people
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:43.800]  It should reign in this country again
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  Instead of the incredibly obvious criminality that's going on here
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:51.800]  I mean, it's like, you know, you'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:53.800]  To not see what's happening
[2:36:53.800 --> 2:36:56.800]  So I'm just really proud of everyone here
[2:36:56.800 --> 2:36:59.800]  I don't agree that all the police are slaves
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:03.800]  I think that they're under incredible pressure to behave
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:07.800]  Yeah, to behave in a way where I believe that at a certain point
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:09.800]  They're going to stop behaving that way
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:11.800]  And I don't know what will happen then
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:14.800]  I guess the National Guard or some other lunatics will come in and kick our heads in
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:16.800]  But I mean, you know, okay, bring it on
[2:37:16.800 --> 2:37:18.800]  But the change must come
[2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:20.800]  And I'm praying for it
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:22.800]  Sure, you know, I'm not looking for physical stuff
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:24.800]  I want them to be free and happy
[2:37:24.800 --> 2:37:27.800]  But I mean, I got punched in the stomach first
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:30.800]  And so they were, they was all targeted by Homeland Security
[2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:32.800]  Now that I'm not emotional
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:34.800]  Then I gave in and let them be mean to me
[2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:36.800]  And shove some guys head over and over again into that
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:39.800]  And punch some person and almost knock a little girl into the ground
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:43.800]  But then they chased us around, passed the barricades and attacked us again
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:45.800]  The thing is that why do it?
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:49.800]  They're peace, they're supposed to be peace officers
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:54.800]  Not guys being intimidating, pushing a woman who is doing nothing
[2:37:54.800 --> 2:37:56.800]  But doing what they're saying
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:37:59.800]  Shoving me in a way that if I was in a bar and I was six foot two and a man
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:01.800]  They're probably getting a fight
[2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:06.800]  When do you actually take on your own ability to think for yourself
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:09.800]  Even if you're in a position where you're supposed to take orders
[2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:11.800]  When's that point arrived?
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:13.800]  And that's the point that these police officers need to get to
[2:38:13.800 --> 2:38:15.800]  Which is why I feel sad when you guys scream at them
[2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:18.800]  You slayers, you bastards, you know, it's like
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:22.800]  I just, I just wish that actually, seriously
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:24.800]  I mean, I thought about doing it and then I got shy
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:27.800]  But I just felt like saying, listen
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:29.800]  I don't know what you're thinking
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:33.800]  But please, stand up for what's right
[2:38:33.800 --> 2:38:35.800]  They surely know what that is
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:37.800]  We're just talking about First Amendment stuff
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:41.800]  Well, by the way, the Dallas police when they came over
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:44.800]  Were like, what are you doing? They told them to let them in
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:47.800]  And the point was that was ordered by the feds, yeah
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:49.800]  That's just crazy
[2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:50.800]  That building's right there
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:52.800]  Crazy
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:54.800]  Well, anyway, listen
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:38:56.800]  Police, hold on, hold on
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:00.800]  Hey, just the guys I want to talk to
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:03.800]  Sir, what's your name?
[2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:08.800]  Where do I file about the Sheriff's Department that was here?
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:11.800]  Oh, come on, you can talk to it
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:13.800]  Because we can't go...
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:16.800]  So the Sheriff's Department's in charge here
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:19.800]  Because they assaulted us when the Dallas police let us in
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:21.800]  We're supposed to be let in
[2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:23.800]  As you know, sir
[2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:25.800]  Oh, come on, you can talk to it
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:27.800]  You're not ignoring us
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:29.800]  Private property
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:33.800]  Oh, private property, what is this, city property?
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:36.800]  Well, you're on private property
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:41.800]  The imperious nature
[2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:44.800]  I don't know who that guy is
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:47.800]  Private property, the Dallas police department is private property
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:49.800]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:50.800]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:51.800]  Yes, David Knight
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:57.800]  I gotta say, when I'm watching this on television, one of the things that has really been making me angry all day
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:00.800]  Is the attitude we just saw from that cop you tried to talk to
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:02.800]  And this is going on yesterday as well
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:05.800]  You walk up to them, you ask them a polite question
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:07.800]  They just ignore you like you're not even there
[2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:09.800]  Like you're treating you like you're trash
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:10.800]  Exactly
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:11.800]  It's that kind of arrogant attitude
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:13.800]  And that's what's behind all this stuff
[2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:14.800]  That's what we've been seeing
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:17.800]  I'm not surprised at all to see these guys come out and attack you
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:19.800]  They don't treat you with any respect
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:21.800]  They have no respect for the public
[2:40:21.800 --> 2:40:24.800]  I agree, finishing up your point, I'm sorry, I broke that off when they walked by
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:28.800]  David Knight, my co-host, was just pointing out the imperious nature
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:29.800]  I was very polite
[2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:31.800]  I wanted to say I was assaulted
[2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:32.800]  And he literally knew about it
[2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:34.800]  Because I saw him looking up the window all day
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:38.800]  And pointing at me and waving when he was up there, that same police officer
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:40.800]  And the guy with two stars on his thing
[2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:42.800]  He rules a third-world country
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:43.800]  But the point...
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:45.800]  It's public parking, it's not private parking
[2:40:45.800 --> 2:40:46.800]  No, I know, he used this info
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:49.800]  He said public parking just to get me to leave him alone
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:52.800]  Like I wasn't allowed to be there and then shove my hand away
[2:40:52.800 --> 2:40:54.800]  I'm going to ask you a question, Alex
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:40:55.800]  Sure
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:40:57.800]  Why do you think they are frightened of talking to you?
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:40:59.800]  Because that's clearly what that is
[2:40:59.800 --> 2:41:02.800]  That's fear, inhibition, unwillingness to communicate
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:04.800]  What's that about?
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:05.800]  Why are they?
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:08.800]  I mean, maybe that's not a question you can answer
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:09.800]  No, I don't know why
[2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:11.800]  Because they're in such a controlled culture
[2:41:11.800 --> 2:41:14.800]  Of compartmentalization and being dominated
[2:41:14.800 --> 2:41:17.800]  They just are in a position where they can dominate people under them
[2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:19.800]  They get dominated from above, it's all hierarchical
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:22.800]  Right, but imagine that you say to him
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:25.800]  Could you explain to us why the following, whatever your question might be
[2:41:25.800 --> 2:41:27.800]  Why can't he stand there?
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:29.800]  He is a public servant
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:31.800]  He is a peace officer, right?
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:33.800]  A peace officer, a servant of the public
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:35.800]  Why can't he communicate with you?
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:38.800]  That's because they've put military occupation rules in
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:41.800]  Where no one's allowed to talk but the public spokes people
[2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:43.800]  So it dehumanizes them
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:46.800]  Just like they tell soldiers now, even when you're off duty and civilian clothes
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:49.800]  Don't be political, don't say what you believe in if you're against the war
[2:41:49.800 --> 2:41:52.800]  Even though as a citizen the law says you're allowed to
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:53.800]  They intimidate
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:41:55.800]  Freedom of speech, even for them
[2:41:55.800 --> 2:41:57.800]  That's right, well here, tell us
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:01.800]  Well, no, I mean, I just, why don't the police have freedom of speech?
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:05.800]  Why can't they offer their opinion, their individuals
[2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:06.800]  They have individual rights
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:10.800]  Why should they be dominated by hierarchical instruction?
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:13.800]  Now that, to my mind, if they're peace officers
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:16.800]  If they're public servants and citizens
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:19.800]  They should be permitted to give their opinion
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:22.800]  So who is it that's forbidding them to speak?
[2:42:22.800 --> 2:42:26.800]  Honestly, I just think that they're frightened to speak
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:28.800]  Probably because of what you were saying
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:32.800]  That they have just an incredible peer pressure on them
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:35.800]  Or more like an officer ranking pressure
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:38.800]  Where they are told you are not allowed to talk about this
[2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:41.800]  I don't see why they shouldn't, they're citizens
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:43.800]  They have every right to speak
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:46.800]  They're police, as individuals, should not be shot up
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:47.800]  Why should they?
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:50.800]  Well, I mean, you talked about throughout history
[2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:53.800]  What happens to countries when these police states come in in tyrannies
[2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:54.800]  It just gets worse and worse
[2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:55.800]  In fact, I'm gonna steal that quote
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:42:57.800]  Tyranny begets tyranny
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:42:58.800]  I'll give you a credit if you want me to
[2:42:58.800 --> 2:43:01.800]  Or I'll sit there and take the credit and say, I don't know what I'm joking
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:04.800]  But the point is, is it tyranny begets tyranny?
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:06.800]  And then it just spins out of control
[2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:08.800]  Thank God, excuse my expression
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:11.800]  Because then, otherwise, we'd be just underpan tyranny
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:13.800]  But tyrannies always end
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:15.800]  Not before there isn't a great deal of suffering
[2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:18.800]  And I'm just hoping that through technology, the internet
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:20.800]  The incredible, wonderful good work that you guys do
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:23.800]  And other, you know, independent newscasters
[2:43:23.800 --> 2:43:25.800]  And individuals who talk about this
[2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:28.800]  And try and do things on a very grassroots level
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:31.800]  I'm really hoping we can circumvent what would
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:35.800]  Seems to be almost a turnkey totalitarian state
[2:43:35.800 --> 2:43:38.800]  That we are just, I mean, they, well
[2:43:38.800 --> 2:43:41.800]  I mean, doesn't Obama just have to call martial law
[2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:42.800]  And then that's it
[2:43:42.800 --> 2:43:44.800]  Well, he's already doing most stuff by executive order
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:45.800]  Outside of Congress
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:47.800]  And they put in the internet kill switch
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:48.800]  The total surveillance grid
[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:51.800]  They call the spy systems they put in
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:53.800]  The battle grid, what's it called?
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:54.800]  David, you were reading it today?
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:43:56.800]  It's called the battle net inside
[2:43:56.800 --> 2:43:58.800]  Battle net, battle net, yeah
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:43:59.800]  And it's battle with us
[2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:01.800]  It's not battle with criminals
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:03.800]  They all skim the money off the top of that
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:07.800]  I mean, it is just incredible
[2:44:07.800 --> 2:44:10.800]  I gotta say, awesome police are not anywhere as arrogant
[2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:11.800]  As these guys
[2:44:11.800 --> 2:44:13.800]  And Dallas police aren't as bad as a lot I've seen
[2:44:13.800 --> 2:44:15.800]  But man, I tell you, they really
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:17.800]  Dallas citizens need to start acting like humans
[2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:18.800]  Around the police
[2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:19.800]  Because it's really gone to their head
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:20.800]  I mean, a lot of these cops
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:21.800]  Some of them I can tell are listeners
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:22.800]  And wave at me and stuff
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:24.800]  But some of them are serious mental patients
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:26.800]  Can you imagine just walking around
[2:44:26.800 --> 2:44:27.800]  In a uniform feeling powerful?
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:29.800]  Because you're part of a power structure?
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:31.800]  Well, I think, you know, unconsciousness
[2:44:31.800 --> 2:44:33.800]  Is something people really need to understand
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:35.800]  I think, you know, people assume
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:38.800]  That everyone is fully in their own skull
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:40.800]  In present and attending life
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:43.800]  But I think a lot of people are so profoundly
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:46.800]  Disengaged
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:48.800]  So out of communication
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:51.800]  That they really just fall beneath
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:52.800]  A certain level of awareness
[2:44:52.800 --> 2:44:55.800]  So I don't think they're capable
[2:44:55.800 --> 2:44:58.800]  Of actually seeing what's going on around them
[2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:00.800]  And making a choice for themselves
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:02.800]  That they should do a certain thing
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:03.800]  In other words, a good thing
[2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:05.800]  So anyway, that's my end
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:07.800]  And we were here an hour ago being attacked
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:09.800]  And here we are now, it's all opened up
[2:45:09.800 --> 2:45:11.800]  But they were supposed to open it up
[2:45:11.800 --> 2:45:13.800]  And then they were just waiting for a call
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:14.800]  Even though it had already all been decided
[2:45:14.800 --> 2:45:16.800]  We were following what was agreed upon
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:18.800]  One of the head cops called
[2:45:18.800 --> 2:45:20.800]  And goes, yeah, that's true, let them in
[2:45:20.800 --> 2:45:23.800]  And then Homeland Security, the federal building
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:25.800]  The same federal government taking over
[2:45:25.800 --> 2:45:27.800]  50 years ago today
[2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:31.800]  They literally ordered auxiliary police
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:34.800]  For a special unit over to attack us
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:36.800]  And try to start a fight, but they failed
[2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:38.800]  And now the info is going on
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:41.800]  What is your overall view of the state of the world
[2:45:41.800 --> 2:45:43.800]  The whole world government
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:45.800]  The whole cybernetic systems, the whole technocracy
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:47.800]  It is a turnkey takeover
[2:45:47.800 --> 2:45:49.800]  What do you think the in-game of the rulers are
[2:45:49.800 --> 2:45:51.800]  Because everything I see them doing
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:54.800]  Is trying to suppress human consciousness and awakening
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:56.800]  Because they know there's an awakening happening
[2:45:56.800 --> 2:45:58.800]  In my view, what's your take on that?
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:00.800]  Well, actually, it just makes me think of
[2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:02.800]  There Will Be Blood
[2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:03.800]  Did you ever see that film?
[2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:04.800]  Excellent film
[2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:06.800]  Right, I can't remember the director's name
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:09.800]  John Paul Johnson, something, yeah, brilliant
[2:46:09.800 --> 2:46:11.800]  I think that one has to understand
[2:46:11.800 --> 2:46:15.800]  That anyone that's attracted to that level of power
[2:46:15.800 --> 2:46:18.800]  I think is already in a kind of disease state
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:20.800]  Very few people would ever want to get to that level
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:24.800]  Of domination, power, and to get to that place
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:27.800]  You have to do a lot of really, I think, pretty bad things
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:29.800]  So once those people get there
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:31.800]  And once they get that kind of power
[2:46:31.800 --> 2:46:35.800]  I think that that's what you're looking at is insanity
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:38.800]  You're just looking at individuals who are insane
[2:46:38.800 --> 2:46:44.800]  And so mangled in their souls
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:47.800]  That they actually have no love or appreciation
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:48.800]  For the rest of humanity
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:50.800]  And I think that is what's happening on this planet
[2:46:50.800 --> 2:46:53.800]  That those individuals have gotten to that level of power
[2:46:53.800 --> 2:46:56.800]  And I think they, you know, keep on going
[2:46:56.800 --> 2:46:59.800]  Like the Rockefellers, I don't know how they manage to keep
[2:46:59.800 --> 2:47:02.800]  Spawning more evil creatures
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:04.800]  But, you know, they do
[2:47:04.800 --> 2:47:06.800]  And up they stay and sit on all of us
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:09.800]  And it's repeated itself so many times throughout history
[2:47:09.800 --> 2:47:12.800]  It's just now technology has given them
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:16.800]  A kind of an omnipotence that is terrifying
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:19.800]  And that's why laws do have to be put in place
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:21.800]  And when people say, like in England
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:23.800]  Well, as long as you're behaving yourself
[2:47:23.800 --> 2:47:24.800]  You've got nothing to worry about
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:27.800]  But they don't understand that's such a simplistic viewpoint
[2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:30.800]  Because the very people that are protecting
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:34.800]  Both intellectual, you know, domains
[2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:37.800]  Artistic domains are the first ones
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:40.800]  Who are going to fall victims to that system
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:43.800]  Yeah, of course, if you're just, you know, running a shop
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:44.800]  And you mind your own business
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:45.800]  No one's going to come get you
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:48.800]  But the people that really keep society moving
[2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:51.800]  Keep art free
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:54.800]  And really expressing what needs to be expressed
[2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:56.800]  They're the first ones to get it in the back of the neck
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:47:58.800]  And it's not in the kind of obvious way that it used to be
[2:47:58.800 --> 2:48:01.800]  Where you just get poisoned, stabbed, or whatever
[2:48:01.800 --> 2:48:04.800]  You get sort of, like, intimidated
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:07.800]  Or you get dropped out of a circle of artists
[2:48:07.800 --> 2:48:10.800]  That would have otherwise been, you know, backed with money
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:13.800]  Or you won't get spoken about in the news
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:16.800]  I mean, you get, it's a very subtle way
[2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:18.800]  Of just eliminating you from the scene
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:20.800]  But when you have those monitoring systems
[2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:22.800]  That we, you know, like the NSA
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:24.800]  Thank God for Edward Snowden
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:26.800]  Bless his heart, Jesus
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:29.800]  I mean, I can't imagine the embarrassment
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:30.800]  Oh, that was the other thing
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:33.800]  How about Obama putting, what's his name?
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:36.800]  James, what's his face at the head of the NSA?
[2:48:36.800 --> 2:48:38.800]  Oh, absolutely, James Clapper
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:40.800]  Right, in charge of the independent committee
[2:48:40.800 --> 2:48:43.800]  That's going to investigate the NSA
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:45.800]  That's like having Hitler over Nuremberg
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:47.800]  On those key points you're making
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:49.800]  Because you're really on target with that
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:52.800]  They, the bad guys want all the intel
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:55.800]  So you can't expose their criminal operations
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:48:57.800]  And they use the intel on you
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:48:59.800]  Like Google sells the data it's coming out
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:01.800]  To all the shops online
[2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:04.800]  So that when you go to a shop, they know you have more money
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:07.800]  The cookie shows it, the prices are higher
[2:49:07.800 --> 2:49:09.800]  Like I could do that with my shopping cart
[2:49:09.800 --> 2:49:12.800]  I could buy that data, that metadata they call it
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:15.800]  And Google that cookie data, and when they come to the
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:18.800]  Infowars.com shop, it would have a higher price
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:20.800]  No, no, I'm serious, that's one example
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:24.800]  Of what the Panopticon technology can do
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:26.800]  What did she say, Panopticon?
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:29.800]  It's a French term, you know, for the around prison
[2:49:29.800 --> 2:49:31.800]  And then they would have a tower where the guards
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:34.800]  Could always watch you, Panopticon, Panopticonic
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:36.800]  Oh, well, I think the crucial thing is
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:40.800]  Is that we have to, as individuals
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:43.800]  Really, really support the Constitution
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:46.800]  Because that is the most unique
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:48.800]  Nowhere else has it really, I think maybe
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:50.800]  Different countries are coming, but it's the most
[2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:55.800]  Unique declaration of real spiritual rights
[2:49:55.800 --> 2:49:57.800]  And it is a spiritual thing, I mean how many of us
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:49:59.800]  You know, have different opinions
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:01.800]  But the bottom line is that real independence
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:03.800]  Freedom of thought, freedom of speech
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:06.800]  Freedom of expression, with a great regard
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:10.800]  To helping and being of service
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:12.800]  Because I don't think, you know, people should
[2:50:12.800 --> 2:50:14.800]  Just feel free that they can just go around
[2:50:14.800 --> 2:50:15.800]  And clock people on their head and go,
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:17.800]  Yo, I'm free, I'm going to clock people on their head
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:19.800]  No, it's libertarian, you're free to do everything
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:21.800]  You want until it hurts somebody else
[2:50:21.800 --> 2:50:23.800]  Or crosses onto there, but I mean this is like
[2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:25.800]  Clockwork Orange though, because they are
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:27.800]  Hiring the criminals to be the police now
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:29.800]  What we saw today, not all of them
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:32.800]  But that key group at the middle that
[2:50:32.800 --> 2:50:33.800]  Attack first
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:36.800]  It's impossible, I don't believe it
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:40.800]  A job for two who are now of job age
[2:50:40.800 --> 2:50:43.800]  The police
[2:50:43.800 --> 2:50:45.800]  You know, I have to tell you, I just felt
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:48.800]  Really sad when I saw them turn up
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:51.800]  I just thought really, it's going to come to this
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:53.800]  We're talking about the First Amendment
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:56.800]  Actually, I want to just say, there was a New Zealand
[2:50:56.800 --> 2:50:58.800]  TV lady that was there yesterday
[2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:00.800]  And I stood behind her with my son with the First Amendment
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:02.800]  She said, I don't stand there, you know
[2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:04.800]  You're blocking everything, and I said
[2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:06.800]  Well, you know, I'm just standing back here
[2:51:06.800 --> 2:51:08.800]  Anyway, we got into a little thing over
[2:51:08.800 --> 2:51:10.800]  And she didn't want me to be in the picture with her
[2:51:10.800 --> 2:51:12.800]  And she said, look, I'm not having some lunatic
[2:51:12.800 --> 2:51:13.800]  Stand behind me with this
[2:51:13.800 --> 2:51:15.800]  I said, lunatic?
[2:51:15.800 --> 2:51:18.800]  I said, I'm defending the First Amendment
[2:51:18.800 --> 2:51:20.800]  You know, it's like the assumption that
[2:51:20.800 --> 2:51:23.800]  To be out here expressing yourself
[2:51:23.800 --> 2:51:25.800]  Is an act of lunacy
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:27.800]  I would say that's a pretty good indication
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:31.800]  Of how totally distorted
[2:51:31.800 --> 2:51:33.800]  Reality has become for the people
[2:51:33.800 --> 2:51:36.800]  Who are supposed to be defending
[2:51:36.800 --> 2:51:38.800]  Truth, right?
[2:51:38.800 --> 2:51:40.800]  I know you've been interviewed before by the media
[2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:42.800]  You're obviously a famous filmmaker in your own right
[2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:44.800]  And I love that score that you did on Full Metal Jacket
[2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:46.800]  That's my favorite ever, that's so haunting
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:51:58.800]  What was your dad?
[2:51:58.800 --> 2:52:00.800]  I know you were taking that question, but I'd love to know
[2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:02.800]  Is your dad with his great artist's mind
[2:52:02.800 --> 2:52:04.800]  To see real reality?
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:06.800]  What would he think about what America turned into?
[2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:08.800]  Because his films predicted it
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:10.800]  Well, I was saying to you last night
[2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:14.800]  I feel that my father was very haunted
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:16.800]  By those factions on this planet
[2:52:16.800 --> 2:52:19.800]  That try to manipulate humanity
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:21.800]  I think the films that he made
[2:52:21.800 --> 2:52:23.800]  He wanted people to think for themselves
[2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:25.800]  Experience for themselves
[2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:27.800]  Whatever it meant to them
[2:52:27.800 --> 2:52:29.800]  But I would say that if you look at every film he made
[2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:32.800]  It certainly addressed all these things that we're speaking about
[2:52:32.800 --> 2:52:35.800]  I mean, Clock of Orange, Thought Control
[2:52:35.800 --> 2:52:38.800]  You know, anti-war films
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:40.800]  The fact that war is just pure slaughter
[2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:43.800]  That it's got nothing to do with any of the usual things
[2:52:43.800 --> 2:52:45.800]  That they send people out
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:46.800]  Doctor Strange Love?
[2:52:46.800 --> 2:52:48.800]  Uh, a yellow
[2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:50.800]  The whole point of the Doomsday Machine
[2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:52.800]  Is lost
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:54.800]  If you keep it a secret
[2:52:54.800 --> 2:52:56.800]  Why didn't you tell the world, eh?
[2:52:56.800 --> 2:52:58.800]  Any other final points you'd like to make
[2:52:58.800 --> 2:53:01.800]  Those are really a lot of thought-provoking things you're saying
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:03.800]  I believe there's an awakening happening
[2:53:03.800 --> 2:53:05.800]  I see it, the system's scared
[2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:08.800]  And so that's why they are really trying to suppress us
[2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:10.800]  And it's just more key than ever
[2:53:10.800 --> 2:53:13.800]  That everybody start resisting in little ways
[2:53:13.800 --> 2:53:16.800]  Lovingly, but also aggressively when we have to
[2:53:16.800 --> 2:53:18.800]  So there's no way they can stop all of us
[2:53:18.800 --> 2:53:21.800]  It's essential to stop the evil from totally taking over
[2:53:21.800 --> 2:53:23.800]  Because you can see it's trying to take over
[2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:25.800]  Because it can see the end is near
[2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:29.800]  Yeah, I think the important thing that you're outlining here
[2:53:29.800 --> 2:53:32.800]  Is that people have to learn how to confront evil
[2:53:32.800 --> 2:53:34.800]  And not to alter it or to lessen it
[2:53:34.800 --> 2:53:36.800]  And to somehow, you know, go
[2:53:36.800 --> 2:53:38.800]  Well, I'm sure they didn't mean to push you
[2:53:38.800 --> 2:53:42.800]  It's like, well, you know, you need to face
[2:53:42.800 --> 2:53:44.800]  You need to confront
[2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:47.800]  And really properly look at what's happening
[2:53:47.800 --> 2:53:49.800]  And not try and explain it away
[2:53:49.800 --> 2:53:51.800]  Or give it justifications or anything
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:53.800]  Because at this juncture
[2:53:53.800 --> 2:53:56.800]  We still, by our fingernails, have the chance
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:53:59.800]  To make a difference and turn this around
[2:53:59.800 --> 2:54:02.800]  And to not take part and to just watch
[2:54:02.800 --> 2:54:04.800]  You know, I mean, it's a little scary, believe me
[2:54:04.800 --> 2:54:07.800]  I was a little scared when those sheriffs turned up
[2:54:07.800 --> 2:54:10.800]  But if you don't stand there and push back
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:12.800]  Not in a stupid aggressive way
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:15.800]  But if you don't push back, if you don't face it
[2:54:15.800 --> 2:54:17.800]  And confront it for what it is
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:20.800]  It'll just take over and then no one will be free
[2:54:20.800 --> 2:54:21.800]  Well, you're right
[2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:23.800]  And the power structures made the calculation
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:25.800]  That we're cowards, we've given up, we're going to roll over
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:27.800]  They do stuff like that
[2:54:27.800 --> 2:54:29.800]  So people don't come out and demonstrate against wars
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:31.800]  What happened at the G20
[2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:33.800]  They do that so people see people being attacked
[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:37.800]  They get scared so that they can then take over everybody's freedom
[2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:39.800]  That's why you've got to go out and do this
[2:54:39.800 --> 2:54:41.800]  And face the fear and get through it
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:43.800]  It's actually kind of fun to fight, Terri, so why not?
[2:54:43.800 --> 2:54:45.800]  So that they understand that they've miscalculated
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:47.800]  And that it's going to backfire
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:49.800]  But tyrants always miscalculated
[2:54:49.800 --> 2:54:53.800]  They have this mind of God, Google, NSA, spy grid
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:56.800]  They're not gods, they can't read that info
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:54:59.800]  Because they're so evil, how could they, who are so unenlightened
[2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:02.800]  Ever think that they could read all the data they're getting
[2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:05.800]  Because the data only shows that their system's already failing
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:08.800]  I would just like to add
[2:55:08.800 --> 2:55:10.800]  That I think to describe it as evil
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:13.800]  Is to give it certainly an adjective to describe it
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:15.800]  It certainly results in evil
[2:55:15.800 --> 2:55:18.800]  But I think the important thing is that it's an incredible
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:20.800]  Degree of insanity
[2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:23.800]  Because only insanity would breed acts
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:26.800]  That are so destructive and harmful
[2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:29.800]  And when you think of the destruction of the animals
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:31.800]  And the environment and the corporations
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:34.800]  That just seem to daily, you know, stride forward
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:36.800]  Through every decade destroying everything
[2:55:36.800 --> 2:55:38.800]  Why aren't they even worried about Fukushima now
[2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:40.800]  When it's melting down even worse? They don't even care anymore
[2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:42.800]  91% of the reactors are leaking
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:46.800]  Insanity, look, if you're really insane
[2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:49.800]  You have no grasp or care for what's going on
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:51.800]  And I think that's what this is
[2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:53.800]  It's like organized insanity
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:55.800]  And I think people need to recognize that
[2:55:55.800 --> 2:55:58.800]  And realize there's a lot more sane people
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:00.800]  I would say this is probably about, you know
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:03.800]  Billions of sane people on this planet
[2:56:03.800 --> 2:56:06.800]  And just a very few nutters
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:10.800]  And it's those nutters that have to be regulated
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:12.800]  Because obviously one can't just sort of like
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:14.800]  Blow them off the face of the earth
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:16.800]  You know, I wish a couple of angelic beings
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:18.800]  Would come along and go, oh, you're really crazy
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:20.800]  Right, off the planet you go
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:21.800]  But...
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:23.800]  But those bad guys are here to test us
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:26.800]  I've no idea, but what I would really like
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:29.800]  Is regulations and laws, because those work pretty well
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:31.800]  Right now we've had those laws and rights
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:34.800]  In the Constitution blown away by the, you know, Patriot Act
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:36.800]  That's right, they've gotten rid of the good laws
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:38.800]  And put in all the tyranny
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:40.800]  Right, and I think that we've got to try really hard
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:43.800]  And pay attention and spend an hour, maybe every day
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:46.800]  Looking online and, hey, let me help you
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:49.800]  And actually, you know, do your research
[2:56:49.800 --> 2:56:51.800]  You know what you're doing with that equipment
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:54.800]  I do, but that was just a cable
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:57.800]  Anyway, I just really implore people
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:56:59.800]  To really just pull their finger out
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:01.800]  And do a little bit of work, that's your job now
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:03.800]  You know, it's a new job
[2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:05.800]  It's not enough to be a citizen
[2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:07.800]  Because there's too much organization
[2:57:07.800 --> 2:57:10.800]  To dismantle your position as a citizen
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:12.800]  You have to do something different now
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:14.800]  Wow, that's key, they're trying to dismantle
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:17.800]  Our real citizenship and our machinery of freedom
[2:57:17.800 --> 2:57:19.800]  And so what do we do?
[2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:21.800]  I think we actually have to take on
[2:57:21.800 --> 2:57:23.800]  And this is the hard part, everyone
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:26.800]  You're going to have to operate using your own awareness
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:29.800]  Your own, you have to think for yourself
[2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:32.800]  And you have to dig down deep into your soul
[2:57:32.800 --> 2:57:35.800]  And work up enough courage to do things about it
[2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:37.800]  Even if it's just your science and petitions
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:39.800]  You listen to Alex, you know
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:41.800]  For instance, the Guardian
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:43.800]  What's his face there, Glenn
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:46.800]  Well, I mean, that guy
[2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:49.800]  They may arrest him when he gets back to the US
[2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:54.800]  I don't know what to say other than it's just so insane
[2:57:54.800 --> 2:57:56.800]  Everybody should be rallying around him
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:57:59.800]  Yes, absolutely, Edward Snowden, I love you
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:01.800]  I think you're an incredibly brave man
[2:58:01.800 --> 2:58:04.800]  And anyone who says you aren't patriotic
[2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:06.800]  Well, you're not thinking for yourself
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:08.800]  If you say he's not patriotic
[2:58:08.800 --> 2:58:11.800]  Look, the German government, right
[2:58:11.800 --> 2:58:14.800]  They've all issued themselves encrypted cell phones now
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:16.800]  Even everybody pissed off at being monitored
[2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:18.800]  Well, that's the thing, you get rid of checks and balances
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:20.800]  And freedom, it always blows back
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:22.800]  The tyrants, you don't escape it
[2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:24.800]  You've got to give everybody a respect
[2:58:24.800 --> 2:58:27.800]  And liberty and freedom, co-your kids have it too
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:29.800]  When someone robs your neighbor's freedom
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:31.800]  They're robbing your freedom
[2:58:31.800 --> 2:58:33.800]  I think the important part is that everyone
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:35.800]  Regardless of your position
[2:58:35.800 --> 2:58:37.800]  Regardless of whether everyone that you know
[2:58:37.800 --> 2:58:39.800]  Thinks you're a complete extremist or lunatic
[2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:41.800]  The fact is that when you start to think for yourself
[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:43.800]  Folks, the full interview will be posted on YouTube
[2:58:43.800 --> 2:58:46.800]  In about 30 minutes at infowars.com
[2:58:46.800 --> 2:58:48.800]  We're going into overdrive
[2:58:48.800 --> 2:58:50.800]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen
[2:58:50.800 --> 2:59:16.800]  But that's part of the live interview
[2:59:20.800 --> 2:59:22.800]  The health environment, we talk about pollution
[2:59:22.800 --> 2:59:23.800]  The water quality
[2:59:23.800 --> 2:59:26.800]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states
[2:59:26.800 --> 2:59:28.800]  Most people won't even be ready
[2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:29.800]  Won't be able to get out of town
[2:59:29.800 --> 2:59:31.800]  Because there'll be absolute panic
[2:59:31.800 --> 2:59:33.800]  There is no preparedness without strategy
[2:59:33.800 --> 2:59:36.800]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness
[2:59:36.800 --> 2:59:39.800]  Strategic relocation film

[3:00:09.800 --> 3:00:11.800]  You want answers?
[3:00:11.800 --> 3:00:13.800]  Well, so does he
[3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:17.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:00:17.800 --> 3:00:20.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:23.800]  Alex Jones
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:24.800]  Alright, we just joined us
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:27.800]  We just aired most of the Vivian Kubrick interview
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:30.800]  I had told the crew to cut almost all of me out
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:32.800]  Because I've been on the air about four hours at that point
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:34.800]  In the freezing cold
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:35.800]  And when I get tired, I really start going
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:37.800]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, because that's like
[3:00:37.800 --> 3:00:39.800]  Now I say uh
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:41.800]  But we're going to put that out on YouTube
[3:00:41.800 --> 3:00:43.800]  In the next 30 minutes at infowars.com
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:44.800]  And prisonpana.com

[3:00:51.800 --> 3:00:53.800]  The police attacking us that no one's seen yet
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:00:57.800]  Uh, that will be, um, posted
[3:00:57.800 --> 3:00:59.800]  That had aired live in overdrive
[3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:01.800]  But just the audio
[3:01:01.800 --> 3:01:02.800]  And it had been breaking up some
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:04.800]  So it's high def audio, high def video
[3:01:04.800 --> 3:01:07.800]  Uh, premiering that here, that interview
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:08.800]  And if I could never get her to come to town

[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:11.800]  And all the amazing Hollywood stuff
[3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:13.800]  She was telling me about how she tried
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:15.800]  To stop animal abuse in Hollywood
[3:01:15.800 --> 3:01:17.800]  You got to drudgerport.com today
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:19.800]  That's like the top story
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:23.800]  Is all about, um, Spielberg again

[3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:45.800]  And man, she was telling me about
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:47.800]  Man, that's on record she did that about Spielberg
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:51.800]  And, uh, and about, um, animal deaths
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:55.800]  And just how they tried to cover it up
[3:01:55.800 --> 3:01:57.800]  But so I can talk about that
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:01:59.800]  But it's just funny
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:01.800]  She was talking to me about that a lot privately
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:03.800]  And then now it's a big story today
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:05.800]  In the news
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:09.800]  Movies, TV, awash, and hidden animal abuse
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:11.800]  In the old days, they're going to have a horse battle
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:12.800]  Or whatever, they just run the horses
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:14.800]  Actually off the real cliff to die
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:17.800]  And I am against the abuse of sentient animals
[3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:20.800]  Uh, my issue is, is that it then turns into
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:23.800]  A total anti-human movement
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:26.800]  And isn't used to actually even protect, uh, animals
[3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:30.800]  But everybody I know loves whales and
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:34.800]  Giraffes and things like elephants
[3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:37.800]  But the larger issue is, I don't want the animal movement
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:39.800]  To turn into an anti-human movement
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:42.800]  I said I'd go into overdrive to, um, take your phone calls
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:44.800]  And I appreciate everybody holding
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:46.800]  Uh, I'll see how many I can get to right now
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:48.800]  And then I've got to end it, I apologize
[3:02:48.800 --> 3:02:51.800]  Because my voice is going out from this weekend screaming
[3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:53.800]  Let's talk to Kathy in Texas
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:55.800]  You're at the JFK protestor, you want to talk about it?
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:56.800]  Go ahead
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:02:58.800]  Excellent, Alex
[3:02:58.800 --> 3:02:59.800]  Excellent
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:02.800]  And it was heartening to, uh, witness
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:06.800]  See the brave, uh, and beautiful men, women, and children
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:09.800]  Out there standing up against tyranny
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:12.800]  Uh, also, uh, I want to thank you
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:15.800]  To the outstanding InfaWars crew
[3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:20.800]  And, uh, if, uh, Sheriff Bob is up there
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:23.800]  And that first probably needs to reevaluate
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:27.800]  Her ultimate commitment to the U.S. Constitution
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:31.800]  And I want to wish you and all InfaWars out there
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:33.800]  Four years out there, a happy Thanksgiving
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:36.800]  And God bless you in the name of Jesus
[3:03:36.800 --> 3:03:37.800]  Thank you very much, Kathy
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:38.800]  We're going to jump
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:40.800]  Kathy had beautiful words, but, man, her phone
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:42.800]  Had that perfect frequency
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:45.800]  My dad's cell phone does that
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:47.800]  And it's almost like migrating voice
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:49.800]  But times 10
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:51.800]  Like a little bit of it is endearing, I guess
[3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:54.800]  But a lot of it is, wow
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:03:56.800]  You could put me in a torture chamber with that
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:03:59.800]  And it wasn't her voice
[3:03:59.800 --> 3:04:03.800]  It was the perfect, just like, like a laser beam of sound
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:05.800]  Telephones can do that
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:07.800]  Chris and George, you only got about a minute
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:09.800]  Go ahead
[3:04:09.800 --> 3:04:11.800]  Hi, Alex, how's my cell phone doing?
[3:04:11.800 --> 3:04:15.800]  Very soft and wonderful, very heavenly
[3:04:15.800 --> 3:04:19.800]  All right, listen, I got another mild, mild criticism
[3:04:19.800 --> 3:04:24.800]  You know, you're talking always about the dumb-down populist
[3:04:24.800 --> 3:04:27.800]  And a portion of the American people
[3:04:27.800 --> 3:04:31.800]  That are waking up, low-right heads and all that
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:34.800]  You know, you realize those are not the people
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:37.800]  That you're talking to on your show
[3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:42.800]  The people that get on your show are not those people
[3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:44.800]  No, I know, but I'm not talking about you
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:45.800]  I always say that
[3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:47.800]  I'm talking about these are victims
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:49.800]  We shouldn't even be mad at them
[3:04:49.800 --> 3:04:51.800]  We need to reach out to them
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:52.800]  And the people I'm really mad at
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:04:53.800]  Are people that are aware of all this
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:54.800]  And are just using it for power
[3:04:54.800 --> 3:04:56.800]  But I hear you, I apologize
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:04:57.800]  I'll try to be more clear
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:26.800]  Thank you so much.
