[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  I only decided to go to DC a week ago, I fly in, I've been planning to bullhorn the White
[00:23.000 --> 00:31.000]  House on Wednesday, but I felt a disturbance in the force, and I said we must go to the
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.340]  White House now, and we've checked the times. I was there for 45 minutes, I was bullhorning
[00:37.340 --> 00:44.240]  while Jack Dorsey came in and spoke for the entire meeting with the President, and the
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.400]  President could hear it, because other folks don't know how to use bullhorns properly
[00:48.400 --> 00:57.200]  that are out there. I want to give lessons, I'm not joking. And then, of course, Fox News
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.240]  covered it, a bunch of others covered the fact that I was pointing out that Jack Dorsey
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.600]  specifically had lied to Congress when he said they don't censor. They then thought,
[01:06.600 --> 01:11.440]  and the President, I'm told, thought that Jones had inside sources on the meeting that
[01:11.440 --> 01:16.800]  only a few people knew about. I didn't. I did not have inside sources. It just keeps
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.760]  happening over and over again that on the same day at the same time, Trump and I will
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.400]  say the same thing, and that's been noticed, it's been picked up. They're bad apples. They
[01:27.400 --> 01:43.280]  tried for a coup. It didn't work out so well. And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I?
[01:43.280 --> 01:50.520]  All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C. You've been watching,
[01:50.520 --> 01:58.120]  you've been seeing, you've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible
[01:58.120 --> 02:09.520]  in our country. Corruption at the highest level, a disgrace. Spine, surveillance, trying
[02:09.520 --> 02:14.640]  for an overthrow. And we caught them. We caught them.
[02:14.640 --> 02:20.640]  Trump has caught them. More documents came out yesterday of Strock and Page. After Trump
[02:20.640 --> 02:26.080]  was in the White House, trying to manipulate their moles inside the White House. You've
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.280]  now got Samantha Powers and the rest of them coming out and saying, oh, other people might
[02:32.280 --> 02:39.120]  have jumped into our computers and given the authorization for unmasking via the NSA. You
[02:39.120 --> 02:45.040]  got Clapper and Brennan on TV running around saying that, oh, we were under orders of Obama,
[02:45.040 --> 02:49.000]  so we can't go to jail. I don't think it's surprising at all that we continue to hear
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.500]  the sociopathic ramblings of Mr. Trump claiming that there was this effort to try to prevent
[02:55.500 --> 02:59.920]  him from being elected or to unseat him. They're saying all of that because they know they've
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.720]  committed major crimes and they know Trump is not business as usual and that they're
[03:03.720 --> 03:09.800]  about to get their asses prosecuted. This is real. This is happening. This is going
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.880]  down. This was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government.
[03:15.880 --> 03:21.280]  We had people coming out to vote from all over this country that are in love with what
[03:21.280 --> 03:26.560]  we're doing. It's called Make America Great Again. That's what we've done and we're doing.
[03:26.560 --> 03:31.760]  And this was an overthrow and it's a disgraceful thing. And I don't, I think it's far bigger
[03:31.760 --> 03:37.200]  than Watergate. I think it's possibly the biggest scandal in political history in this
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.640]  country, maybe beyond political. So I think that a lot of things are being learned right
[03:42.640 --> 03:48.800]  now just like you just mentioned just a few moments ago, again, with Strachan Page. He's
[03:48.800 --> 03:54.240]  a sick people. He's a sick, sick people. So let's see what happens with McCabe and Comey
[03:54.240 --> 03:59.560]  and Brennan and Clapper. They weren't in the act. And let's see what happens and let's
[03:59.560 --> 04:05.440]  see how high it goes up because it's inconceivable. When it goes to Clapper, Brennan, Comey, these
[04:05.440 --> 04:10.640]  people, I would imagine that some other people maybe a little bit higher up also knew about
[04:10.640 --> 04:12.720]  it and maybe a lot higher up.
[04:12.720 --> 04:21.080]  I talked to not one, not two, but three people, three people who had talked to the president,
[04:21.080 --> 04:28.000]  two of them in person last week when I was in D.C. But they said, Trump is going after
[04:28.000 --> 04:35.120]  two of them. And he went on Hannity and said it last night. So this is a big deal. This
[04:35.120 --> 04:40.960]  is a really big deal. And if you're not getting chills, I'm getting them right now. The opportunity
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.560]  to route the globalist and really get a fresh start is so good for all of our children not
[04:45.560 --> 05:00.440]  just here, but worldwide.
[05:00.440 --> 05:06.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship. And I've noticed
[05:06.000 --> 05:12.240]  that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most
[05:12.240 --> 05:20.120]  suppressed. And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant
[05:20.120 --> 05:26.280]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[05:26.280 --> 05:30.240]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political
[05:30.240 --> 05:35.480]  action did. And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others are trying to shut in
[05:35.480 --> 05:41.200]  fours now. This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking
[05:41.200 --> 05:46.840]  your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for
[05:46.840 --> 05:50.320]  what you've done, but I want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos
[05:50.320 --> 05:54.720]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 win,
[05:54.720 --> 05:59.480]  we're dead in the water. I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. Infowarsstore.com. Thank
[05:59.480 --> 06:08.480]  you.
[06:08.480 --> 06:15.200]  Is the U.S. involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling
[06:15.200 --> 06:26.560]  anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya? To Turkey? It is a big idea, a new
[06:26.560 --> 06:31.760]  world order. How is it that this organization is so well funded, so organized?
[06:31.760 --> 06:37.240]  Lamek's stately militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically
[06:37.240 --> 06:42.640]  vulnerable areas of the country. The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel
[06:42.640 --> 06:48.240]  Hakim Bel-Hajj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO. A world in which there
[06:48.240 --> 06:53.160]  is the very real prospect of a new world order. The Russians say they're negotiating with
[06:53.160 --> 06:59.080]  North Korea to hold joint military exercises. Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up,
[06:59.080 --> 07:04.680]  creating an ominous alliance against the United States. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
[07:04.680 --> 07:09.200]  is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S. government is negotiating with
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.560]  Iran. Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to
[07:13.560 --> 07:20.000]  conduct attacks on Iran. We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.680]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and created an important part in events now.
[07:26.680 --> 07:31.280]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of the International Monetary Fund aid package.
[07:31.280 --> 07:40.200]  We had broker the deal to transition power in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[07:40.200 --> 07:45.800]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the
[07:45.800 --> 07:51.000]  opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[07:51.000 --> 08:10.400]  It's known as the Milder Bird Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[08:10.400 --> 08:17.080]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[08:17.080 --> 08:30.280]  the Info War. It's Monday, April 29, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're going to
[08:30.280 --> 08:36.000]  be here for the next four hours in the war room with Owen Schroyer's coming up. I came
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.680]  in on Saturday to a special report covered it as well yesterday on the Sunday regular
[08:40.680 --> 08:44.600]  broadcast at 4.00, 6 p.m. And out of all the incredible breaking news we've got here in
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.040]  front of me, I really have trouble not just getting right back into this because it's
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.440]  so incredible. We have millions of people, tens of thousands a day coming into the United
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.560]  States. We have 5,000 getting caught. We have on average 1,600 being released just into
[09:01.560 --> 09:07.720]  the general population with no medical testing being done at all for the first time in U.S.
[09:07.720 --> 09:12.240]  history. It started under Obama about eight years ago, about two years into his administration
[09:12.240 --> 09:16.600]  and Trump's been able to get Congress to change the law or to get the funding to build the
[09:16.600 --> 09:24.120]  emergency centers. And so we are projected to have 1.5 million illegals this year and
[09:24.120 --> 09:31.600]  that is a very low estimate in my research by ICE. And that's with the backdrop of measles,
[09:31.600 --> 09:38.840]  mumps, rubella, pertussis, drug-redistant tuberculosis, bubonic plague, leprosy, and
[09:38.840 --> 09:45.800]  over 100-plus other horrible bacterial and of course viral diseases that have been eradicated
[09:45.800 --> 09:52.000]  from the United States and Europe now spreading like wildfire. Yesterday's Sunday show was
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.120]  titled Emergency. Terrorist can't 21 states with lethal biological weapons. DHS confirms
[10:00.120 --> 10:05.320]  over 10,000 weaponized human carriers have been purposely let in and that's a conservative
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.960]  estimate of 10,000 disease carriers just in the first few months of this year. That was
[10:09.960 --> 10:14.120]  the only number I could find by ICE was back in February that they thought already 10,000
[10:14.120 --> 10:18.600]  disease had gotten in just from preliminary checks they would do for an hour and then
[10:18.600 --> 10:23.840]  they ordered to release them because they just didn't have places to put them. So it's
[10:23.840 --> 10:29.120]  probably 20,000, 30,000 now, we don't know, but you have TB, drug-resistant, your kid
[10:29.120 --> 10:34.200]  gets put in a quarantine for a year. You get the measles, you get put in quarantine for
[10:34.200 --> 10:38.440]  three weeks, you get pertussis, you get put in quarantine for a month and this is new
[10:38.440 --> 10:44.920]  drug-resistant, vaccine-resistant pertussis. This is vaccine-resistant measles because
[10:44.920 --> 10:49.200]  it's new strains, ladies and gentlemen, most of the time the measles, mumps, rebella shot,
[10:49.200 --> 10:54.320]  they admit doesn't protect you, but it 100% doesn't protect you from new third world strains
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.320]  and yesterday I spent the entire two hours of the Sunday show showing CDC documents,
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.040]  mainstream news, ABC news, Fox News, local health departments, but it was all regional
[11:06.040 --> 11:11.760]  news. Only ABC nationally interviewed a bunch of experts saying this is illegal aliens doing
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.360]  this, they called them migrants, not invaders. So think about that, you've got the images
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.280]  last year and this year of Guatemala border being crushed into Mexico, tens of thousands
[11:21.280 --> 11:26.320]  pouring across at one time, using children as human shields, they now admit they just
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.400]  dump out on the side of the road when they're done with them, that's all over the news. This
[11:30.400 --> 11:38.200]  is so incredibly cold-blooded. This is so incredibly cold-blooded and we're being hit
[11:38.200 --> 11:46.080]  by massive open borders, we're being hit by total criminality, 90 plus percent military
[11:46.080 --> 11:52.160]  age men coming in out of Latin America, in Europe it was only 80%, raping, robbing, killing,
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.960]  doing whatever they want. And I played the clip Saturday, I played it Sunday, maybe I'll
[11:56.960 --> 12:03.120]  play them again today, Fox News local, ABC news local from California and New York and
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.720]  Michigan and Texas and local health department officials and border patrol talking to local
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.280]  news saying we're ordered to release them, they've got diseases, we've released people
[12:12.280 --> 12:20.560]  with 105 fevers and bumps all over their bodies. It's obviously smallpox, that's right smallpox
[12:20.560 --> 12:26.560]  is coming in, wait till smallpox starts spreading, that really can kill you. Measles, you know
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.760]  maybe you've got a one out of 5,000 die that get it, run down immune systems, now smallpox
[12:31.760 --> 12:37.200]  it gets you a nice 20% deader, so even in modern times, how about a little bit of that,
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.880]  how about some black plague, some ebonic plague, how about stuff there's no cure for, like
[12:42.880 --> 12:50.440]  transferable or wet leprosy, it's called wet leprosy because you tend to drip when you
[12:50.440 --> 12:55.800]  got it, the dry one just peels off your skin and you can't really spread it, nobody really
[12:55.800 --> 13:02.640]  knows even how you get it, but the wet, ooh the wet feels so good and then you wipe your
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.600]  butt or whatever when you're in that leper colony, you get leprosy on your ass or you
[13:06.600 --> 13:11.600]  touch the little kid and they get it, their nose falls off in a year, nothing funner and
[13:11.600 --> 13:16.120]  by the way, they're having to set up leper colonies again in Florida and Texas in areas,
[13:16.120 --> 13:23.360]  look it up, there's big old juicy leper colonies now, big old juicy ones where the folks come
[13:23.360 --> 13:27.160]  in with a leprosy and then they go live in their leper colonies, isn't that nice because
[13:27.160 --> 13:35.960]  your tax payers pay for it, just like we'll pay for having your genitals cut off, that's
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.280]  right, if you want to have tax payers paid for your genitals cut off, we'll do that too,
[13:41.280 --> 13:47.800]  but good part about leprosy is you don't have to pay, you get it on the old dingaling, it's
[13:47.800 --> 13:52.840]  bye-bye, so I just want everybody to be able to think about all these goodies that are
[13:52.840 --> 14:00.320]  coming in and how stupid the system thinks we are, that is all this pours into the nation,
[14:00.320 --> 14:04.200]  they then tell us that it's those of us that haven't had shots in a decade or those of
[14:04.200 --> 14:09.400]  us that haven't had the vaccines, that it's all our faults, we're going to break it back
[14:09.400 --> 14:15.200]  down when we come back with AOC and others saying I don't think you should have any borders
[14:15.200 --> 14:20.680]  and Beto's saying and everybody else and French Imam tells Muslims to not donate money to
[14:20.680 --> 14:27.680]  rebuilding Notre Dame, piss on Notre Dame, that's all coming up here today in the latest
[14:27.680 --> 14:32.360]  attacks on Trump and is Trump selling out to big pharma on his going sideways now and
[14:32.360 --> 14:39.080]  flip-flopping on vaccines, it's all coming up today, let me just tell listeners that

[17:04.160 --> 17:09.240]  the world, George Washington had warned us against foreign wars, the United States of
[17:09.240 --> 17:16.120]  Empire shows that World Wars 1 and 2 left England broken, its former colony the US had

[18:00.400 --> 18:05.640]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block,
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.840]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.840 --> 18:17.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.680 --> 18:23.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.560 --> 18:28.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses, they began studying this effect in published
[18:28.920 --> 18:35.080]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet
[18:35.080 --> 18:40.520]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, pollen block is natural and effective, it
[18:40.520 --> 18:45.680]  is not an antihistamine, in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking
[18:45.680 --> 18:51.080]  the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[18:51.080 --> 18:56.880]  in the body, go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to InfowarsLife.com and

[19:59.360 --> 20:17.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.360 --> 20:23.360]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[20:23.360 --> 20:30.360]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commons.
[20:30.360 --> 20:33.360]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[20:33.360 --> 20:34.360]  Dallas.
[20:34.360 --> 20:40.360]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[20:40.360 --> 20:45.360]  It is a big idea, a new order.
[20:45.360 --> 20:54.360]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion, it's just pancake.
[20:54.360 --> 21:05.360]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[21:05.360 --> 21:16.360]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers
[21:16.360 --> 21:21.360]  not in the hands of criminals.
[21:21.360 --> 21:25.360]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be off, we can take all of them.
[21:25.360 --> 21:30.360]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[21:30.360 --> 21:37.360]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[21:37.360 --> 21:52.360]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[21:52.360 --> 22:07.360]  I intend to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today on all these big issues and topics.
[22:07.360 --> 22:13.360]  And if you just tuned in, you know I started the broadcast out, really outraged.
[22:13.360 --> 22:17.360]  That we have millions of people pouring into the country illegally a year.
[22:17.360 --> 22:19.360]  They're not even doing any vetting.
[22:19.360 --> 22:24.360]  The border patrol is not even allowed to because the beds are overwhelmed, the courts are overwhelmed.
[22:24.360 --> 22:29.360]  The plan by Obama and the deep state to swamp the country and try to bring down the Trump presidency
[22:29.360 --> 22:35.360]  with massive hordes under a UN plan is already 70% complete.
[22:35.360 --> 22:39.360]  The president doesn't declare a real national emergency as commander-in-chief
[22:39.360 --> 22:43.360]  and put the regular army and marines on the border
[22:43.360 --> 22:49.360]  and actually deport these people by force overriding the courts, which he can do in a constitutional crisis
[22:49.360 --> 22:53.360]  as commander-in-chief like Eisenhower did.
[22:53.360 --> 22:59.360]  We will be totally swamped. All the illegals will be given voter cards and the Democrats will have checkmate.
[22:59.360 --> 23:06.360]  That's why AOC and others are saying we shouldn't have any borders at all.
[23:06.360 --> 23:09.360]  Think of the outrageousness of this.
[23:09.360 --> 23:15.360]  She has walls on her home. She has doors. She has a bank account. She has her own private pin number.
[23:15.360 --> 23:21.360]  She has walls. She has skin. She has shell membranes.
[23:21.360 --> 23:26.360]  Mexico has a border. You fly into Mexico. They want to know where you're staying and what you're doing.
[23:26.360 --> 23:30.360]  You try to stay a few days extra. They find you.
[23:30.360 --> 23:35.360]  But not here. We've got another arrogant America hater who's been caught in more incredible lies
[23:35.360 --> 23:39.360]  that are up on infowars.com and newswars.com are going to be covering
[23:39.360 --> 23:46.360]  where she went on CNN and MSNBC and said that Trump and Conway lied about her
[23:46.360 --> 23:52.360]  and that she took off a week to visit Puerto Rico to visit her grandfather that Trump reportedly ruined.
[23:52.360 --> 23:57.360]  That's a big lie. No Democrats like you ruined it. Always stealing all the money.
[23:57.360 --> 24:02.360]  And that she didn't tweet about all the church bombings
[24:02.360 --> 24:05.360]  when she tweeted immediately dozens of times about the synagogue,
[24:05.360 --> 24:12.360]  I mean about the mosque shooting in Christchurch over in New Zealand.
[24:12.360 --> 24:17.360]  And then it turns out she was tweeting the whole time. She's a liar.
[24:17.360 --> 24:23.360]  But that's all she does. She lies when she sent out hundreds of tweets during that week.
[24:23.360 --> 24:29.360]  And there's evidence of it. She tells the news. I sent no tweets out that week.
[24:29.360 --> 24:35.360]  She just insults your intelligence. That's what these people do.
[24:35.360 --> 24:43.360]  The United States sent more aid to Puerto Rico than we've ever sent to any of our, quote,
[24:43.360 --> 24:51.360]  protectorates or possessions before. It's not a state. It's a protectorate or a possession.
[24:51.360 --> 24:57.360]  Think about that. We sent billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[24:57.360 --> 25:01.360]  Billions in aid was sent by private groups. And I talked to security forces and people that were there
[25:01.360 --> 25:05.360]  hired blackwater types and they said it was incredible corruption.
[25:05.360 --> 25:09.360]  The Democrats that run the island just stole the money.
[25:09.360 --> 25:13.360]  But that's okay because they said it's all Trump's fault.
[25:13.360 --> 25:19.360]  And anywhere Democrats run a city or an island or a town or a county or a state,
[25:19.360 --> 25:23.360]  the roads have giant potholes. There's human feces everywhere.
[25:23.360 --> 25:27.360]  There's drug needles everywhere. That's the culture. That's the society.
[25:27.360 --> 25:34.360]  That's the atmosphere that they create.
[25:34.360 --> 25:41.360]  That's the system that they establish. That's the system that they deploy.
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.360]  That's what they are. It's what they do. They steal.
[25:46.360 --> 25:51.360]  And they create racial and cultural and religious divisions to get us all in fighting with each other
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.360]  in regard to action while they run off with the cash.
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.360]  You ever heard of bank robbers or stagecoach riders in the old days or train robbers?
[25:59.360 --> 26:05.360]  They'd set a big fire in town, a ride outside town at a church or something,
[26:05.360 --> 26:07.360]  knowing the whole town would get together with buckets of water.
[26:07.360 --> 26:10.360]  Ride as a train came in so they could rob it.
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.360]  So sheriffs and others began to learn, wait a minute,
[26:14.360 --> 26:20.360]  every time there's a fire that's suspicious we've got to watch the bank or the train station
[26:20.360 --> 26:23.360]  or the stagecoach station.
[26:23.360 --> 26:26.360]  Wait a minute, there's a fire at the church? Didn't payroll just come in last night?
[26:26.360 --> 26:29.360]  It's about to be here. Get to the payroll station, get to the bank.
[26:29.360 --> 26:32.360]  And you show up and then the robbers are in there.
[26:32.360 --> 26:37.360]  This is what the Democrats do, ladies and gentlemen, and it's all in the WikiLeaks,
[26:37.360 --> 26:39.360]  which is why they're so pissed.
[26:39.360 --> 26:44.360]  They're in the WikiLeaks telling Hillary, top professors, we've got to create racial division.
[26:44.360 --> 26:48.360]  It hasn't worked so far, but we believe if we create maximum race war,
[26:48.360 --> 26:51.360]  we'll be able to defeat Trump.
[26:51.360 --> 26:53.360]  It's just unbelievable.
[26:53.360 --> 26:58.360]  So when we come back, I'm going to get to AOC and Beto and all the latest clips,
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.360]  of them not saying the world's going to end.
[27:00.360 --> 27:03.360]  No, no, no, no, those were the clips a few weeks ago.
[27:03.360 --> 27:07.360]  Do what we say or the world's going to end, as cult leaders always say.
[27:07.360 --> 27:14.360]  No, saying that we don't need any borders at all and borders are basically Nazi.
[27:14.360 --> 27:20.360]  And just think about the type of mental midget morons that the establishment has picked to go out and spew this garbage.
[27:20.360 --> 27:23.360]  But think about the fact that we're having so much trouble even defeating them
[27:23.360 --> 27:29.360]  when their crimes are so naked and so brazen and so out in the open.
[27:29.360 --> 27:33.360]  Beto likens U.S. immigration laws to slavery.
[27:33.360 --> 27:34.360]  That's right.
[27:34.360 --> 27:37.360]  If you don't let in unwashed third world masses and give them everything free
[27:37.360 --> 27:42.360]  and a voter registration card and a driver's license, you're making slaves.
[27:42.360 --> 27:44.360]  They're speaking to young people.
[27:44.360 --> 27:48.360]  They're speaking to folks that haven't lived yet who are entitled saying,
[27:48.360 --> 27:50.360]  you deserve free education.
[27:50.360 --> 27:54.360]  You deserve free money, a free quote living wage, even if you don't want to work
[27:54.360 --> 27:56.360]  in the words of AOC in a Green Deal.
[27:56.360 --> 28:03.360]  Free education, free housing, a free living, free health care.
[28:03.360 --> 28:07.360]  And if you're black, why reparations?
[28:07.360 --> 28:10.360]  Think about how sick that's slavery.
[28:10.360 --> 28:13.360]  98% of people who look up the statistics in this country
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.360]  have no relations with anybody that ever owned a slave.
[28:15.360 --> 28:18.360]  Most people came here after slavery who were white.
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.360]  No connection with slavery in Europe since the time of the Romans,
[28:22.360 --> 28:27.360]  white on white slavery, but if you're Italian, are you going to have to pay reparations?
[28:27.360 --> 28:32.360]  Your ancestors 2,000 years ago had German or French slaves, Gaulish slaves.
[28:32.360 --> 28:34.360]  Think about the slavery of that.
[28:34.360 --> 28:37.360]  To say because you're white, you owe a black person money
[28:37.360 --> 28:40.360]  as if they even want that money.
[28:40.360 --> 28:42.360]  Think of the insult the Democrats put out the black people.
[28:42.360 --> 28:44.360]  Hey, you're black. You deserve some reparations.
[28:44.360 --> 28:45.360]  What?
[28:45.360 --> 28:47.360]  You know those reparations are going to come with the strings,
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.360]  that you're going to be their slaves.
[28:49.360 --> 28:51.360]  So the people paying the reparations for slaves,
[28:51.360 --> 28:53.360]  the people getting the reparations are going to be slaves.
[28:53.360 --> 28:55.360]  Look at welfare. Look at it breaking up the family.
[28:55.360 --> 29:07.360]  It's all a plan. It's all a plan.
[29:26.360 --> 29:29.360]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look,
[29:29.360 --> 29:31.360]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:31.360 --> 29:33.360]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[29:33.360 --> 29:38.360]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product
[29:38.360 --> 30:00.360]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[30:00.360 --> 30:02.360]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[30:02.360 --> 30:04.360]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[30:04.360 --> 30:09.360]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[30:09.360 --> 30:11.360]  The fish oil is better than it.
[30:11.360 --> 30:13.360]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[30:13.360 --> 30:18.360]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[30:18.360 --> 30:22.360]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[30:22.360 --> 30:25.360]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[30:25.360 --> 30:27.360]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best,
[30:27.360 --> 30:29.360]  and it'll give you the damn burps.
[30:29.360 --> 30:32.360]  And I'm just sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[30:32.360 --> 30:34.360]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[30:34.360 --> 30:35.360]  It's so good.
[30:35.360 --> 30:37.360]  In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[30:37.360 --> 30:40.360]  I eat five culottes of krill oil before I go to bed.
[30:40.360 --> 30:43.360]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[30:43.360 --> 30:51.360]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[30:51.360 --> 30:53.360]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what?
[30:53.360 --> 30:57.360]  I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[30:57.360 --> 31:00.360]  I just can't do it.
[31:00.360 --> 31:04.360]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym
[31:04.360 --> 31:08.360]  or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[31:08.360 --> 31:10.360]  Believe me, I know.
[31:10.360 --> 31:14.360]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[31:14.360 --> 31:20.360]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[31:20.360 --> 31:23.360]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day
[31:23.360 --> 31:26.360]  to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water,
[31:26.360 --> 31:30.360]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours
[31:30.360 --> 31:34.360]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive
[31:34.360 --> 31:40.360]  to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[31:40.360 --> 31:44.360]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[31:44.360 --> 31:48.360]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[31:48.360 --> 31:53.360]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[31:53.360 --> 31:56.360]  Unleash the SuperMail in you.
[31:56.360 --> 31:58.360]  SuperMailVitality.
[31:58.360 --> 32:27.360]  InfowarsStore.com.
[32:28.360 --> 32:32.360]  We've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[32:32.360 --> 32:36.360]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[32:36.360 --> 32:40.360]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[32:40.360 --> 32:42.360]  I've got two in my home.
[32:42.360 --> 32:45.360]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[32:45.360 --> 32:48.360]  with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[32:48.360 --> 32:52.360]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[32:52.360 --> 32:53.360]  Have clean air.
[32:53.360 --> 33:03.360]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[33:03.360 --> 33:14.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.360 --> 33:16.360]  It's never going to get any better.
[33:16.360 --> 33:17.360]  Don't look for it.
[33:17.360 --> 33:19.360]  Be happy with what you got.
[33:19.360 --> 33:23.360]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[33:23.360 --> 33:25.360]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[33:25.360 --> 33:28.360]  The real owners, the big wealthy business,
[33:28.360 --> 33:31.360]  just to control things and make all the important decisions.
[33:31.360 --> 33:33.360]  Forget the politicians.
[33:33.360 --> 33:37.360]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[33:37.360 --> 33:38.360]  You don't.
[33:38.360 --> 33:40.360]  You have no choice.
[33:40.360 --> 33:41.360]  You have owners.
[33:41.360 --> 33:43.360]  They own you.
[33:43.360 --> 33:45.360]  They own everything.
[33:45.360 --> 33:47.360]  They own all the important land.
[33:47.360 --> 33:49.360]  They own and control the corporations.
[33:49.360 --> 33:51.360]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress,
[33:51.360 --> 33:53.360]  the state houses, the city halls.
[33:53.360 --> 33:55.360]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[33:55.360 --> 33:57.360]  And they own all the big media companies.
[33:57.360 --> 33:59.360]  So they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[33:59.360 --> 34:02.360]  They got you by the balls.
[34:02.360 --> 34:05.360]  They want obedient workers.
[34:05.360 --> 34:07.360]  Obedient workers.
[34:07.360 --> 34:10.360]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork.
[34:10.360 --> 34:14.360]  And just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay,
[34:14.360 --> 34:17.360]  longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime,
[34:17.360 --> 34:20.360]  and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[34:20.360 --> 34:23.360]  And now they're coming for your social security money
[34:23.360 --> 34:27.360]  so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[34:27.360 --> 34:29.360]  It's a big club.
[34:29.360 --> 34:31.360]  And you ain't in it.
[34:31.360 --> 34:34.360]  You and I are not in the big club.
[34:34.360 --> 34:36.360]  The owners in this country know the truth.
[34:36.360 --> 34:38.360]  It's called the American Dream
[34:38.360 --> 34:41.360]  because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[34:41.360 --> 34:43.360]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[34:43.360 --> 34:47.360]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[34:47.360 --> 34:51.360]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[34:51.360 --> 34:53.360]  They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them.
[34:53.360 --> 34:55.360]  That's against their interest.
[34:55.360 --> 35:14.360]  Let's go.
[35:25.360 --> 35:35.360]  So if you just joined us, you saw that powerful piece from the grave, George Carlin.
[35:35.360 --> 35:38.360]  But that was before Trump. That was before Info Wars.
[35:38.360 --> 35:41.360]  I can tell you I'm for real. I can tell you you're for real.
[35:41.360 --> 35:45.360]  And I know Trump is hitting on about seven out of eight cylinders.
[35:45.360 --> 35:47.360]  The Clintons were hitting on zero.
[35:47.360 --> 35:50.360]  George W. on about three.
[35:50.360 --> 35:52.360]  Trump is trying to pragmatically bring the country back.
[35:52.360 --> 35:54.360]  He's trying to turn the economy on.
[35:54.360 --> 35:57.360]  And he's trying to do it from the swamp.
[35:57.360 --> 36:00.360]  And that's why you see them coming after him so hardcore.
[36:00.360 --> 36:03.360]  But later in the next segment, I'm going to go over some of the clips of him
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.360]  coming out and saying take the measles shot over the weekend
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.360]  versus him a few years ago seeing how dangerous vaccines are.
[36:10.360 --> 36:15.360]  So is he selling out to Big Pharma?
[36:15.360 --> 36:18.360]  That's a question David Knight was asking this morning during the show.
[36:18.360 --> 36:22.360]  He did a great job. David Knight, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Central.
[36:22.360 --> 36:25.360]  They had to get their shots. Well, Mr. President, how many?
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.360]  It's like 60 something they mandate now and try to act like it's a law.
[36:29.360 --> 36:32.360]  It's going to be 100 soon. They got hundreds of shots.
[36:32.360 --> 36:34.360]  Big Pharma wants to get government to just mandate it.
[36:34.360 --> 36:41.360]  They lobby and then some corporate company makes me pay to have something put in my body.
[36:41.360 --> 36:45.360]  So the left can kill babies after they're born and say it's a woman's body.
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.360]  You know, it's got another brain, another heart.
[36:47.360 --> 36:50.360]  By the way, I didn't cover this last week and I want to do it.
[36:50.360 --> 36:54.360]  Well, you guys print me the article from m4s.com from Adam Salazar Friday.
[36:54.360 --> 36:56.360]  I forgot to cover it.
[36:56.360 --> 37:01.360]  Major university textbooks are teaching that babies are parasites like cancer
[37:01.360 --> 37:04.360]  and need to be cut out of their mothers.
[37:04.360 --> 37:08.360]  The left always said that, but it's got all the graphs and videos
[37:08.360 --> 37:12.360]  and shows it like a cancer. I want to cover that too.
[37:12.360 --> 37:15.360]  That's what the problem is. It's total information overload here.
[37:15.360 --> 37:19.360]  But let's get into AOC right now.
[37:19.360 --> 37:25.360]  No, not her brazenly lying again after being challenged on ignoring Sri Lanka massacre.
[37:25.360 --> 37:32.360]  She just lied and said, you know what? I just wasn't online for that week.
[37:32.360 --> 37:38.360]  I didn't send any tweets out. She sent over a hundred out.
[37:38.360 --> 37:42.360]  She's been challenged for not caring about the churches being blown up
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.360]  and sending out dozens and dozens of tweets blaming Christians and white people
[37:46.360 --> 37:49.360]  for what happened at Christchurch in New Zealand.
[37:49.360 --> 37:53.360]  But when a bunch of churches get blown up, killing over 290 people,
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.360]  she didn't say a word. Well, she just said it was a lie that she was busy.
[37:57.360 --> 38:05.360]  Then it turns out she'd been there. She'd been sending texts out.
[38:05.360 --> 38:08.360]  She was just putting out a bunch of bulls.
[38:08.360 --> 38:11.360]  There's another article up on m4wars.com.
[38:11.360 --> 38:20.360]  We're good old AOC. God lover is saying that illegal aliens have a right
[38:20.360 --> 38:23.360]  to do whatever they want, whenever they want. Here's the headline.
[38:23.360 --> 38:31.360]  AOC, well, hell, just hear it from her for yourself. Here it is.
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.360]  Here's the current status of our legal documented path.
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.360]  It is completely unjust. And so the whole legal system right now
[38:41.360 --> 38:44.360]  and the way that the president is choosing to administer
[38:44.360 --> 38:48.360]  and grind off all of the agencies to a halt
[38:48.360 --> 38:52.360]  that process legal forms of immigration
[38:52.360 --> 38:54.360]  is forcing people into the shadows,
[38:54.360 --> 38:58.360]  and he is creating undocumented populations in the United States.
[38:58.360 --> 39:01.360]  And then they're being targeted and their rights are being violated.
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.360]  So that's what's actually going on. Folks, first they said there was no border crisis.
[39:06.360 --> 39:08.360]  Now they say Trump created it.
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.360]  The UN plan was to overwhelm the courts and the systems.
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.360]  And Trump tried to get that fixed in legislation the last few years.
[39:16.360 --> 39:21.360]  So she's again completely lying, but here's the finale of what she had to say.
[39:21.360 --> 39:25.360]  That's what's actually going on. And so especially in this moment,
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.360]  first of all, I believe in human rights. I don't care.
[39:30.360 --> 39:33.360]  No borders. No walls.
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.360]  I don't care. I don't care if you're documented.
[39:37.360 --> 39:40.360]  I don't care if you're undocumented. I don't care if you're out.
[39:40.360 --> 39:43.360]  Back this up 15 seconds as I was interrupting it.
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.360]  Maybe we should pull up all the chance at the universities.
[39:45.360 --> 39:49.360]  No borders. No walls. No USA at all.
[39:49.360 --> 39:53.360]  No borders. No walls. No USA at all.
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.360]  And then now the Democratic Party, Ilhan Omar, says America sucks.
[39:58.360 --> 40:03.360]  The other Muslim woman just got into Congress, says she's afraid of America.
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.360]  There's all these articles about how the Muslims are victims now.
[40:06.360 --> 40:10.360]  After all these churches got blown up, poor little babies.
[40:10.360 --> 40:16.360]  That whole stack of news where they're beheading people because they said the wrong thing online
[40:16.360 --> 40:20.360]  or because they were, quote, gay or, well, I'll show you some of the articles coming up.
[40:20.360 --> 40:24.360]  I mean, it's just fantastical that the left defends all of this.
[40:24.360 --> 40:30.360]  I'm sorry. Here she is. Here's AOCs. No borders. No walls. No USA at all. Moment.
[40:30.360 --> 40:33.360]  Moment. First of all, I believe in human rights.
[40:33.360 --> 40:42.360]  I don't care. I don't care. I don't care if you're documented.
[40:42.360 --> 40:45.360]  I don't care if you're undocumented. I don't care if you're out here.
[40:45.360 --> 40:53.360]  I don't care if you're in Rikers. I believe in your fundamental human rights, fundamental human rights.
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.360]  So that's standard UN propaganda that any border at all is evil.
[40:57.360 --> 40:59.360]  Everyone has a right to go everywhere.
[40:59.360 --> 41:04.360]  But the globalists live behind huge armored walls and you, of course, can't see what they're doing.
[41:04.360 --> 41:06.360]  This is incredible.
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.360]  Oh, that if Michael Savage wants to fly to England or thousands of other conservatives, they're banned.
[41:10.360 --> 41:16.360]  Or thousands of other conservatives can't fly to Australia now because they've been seen as bad people.
[41:16.360 --> 41:23.360]  Or if you are Australian and critical of Islam, you're banned from the US.
[41:23.360 --> 41:28.360]  That's what's going on. I've got a whole stack of news here we even get to yesterday and new articles today
[41:28.360 --> 41:36.360]  where mainline reporters are being put in prison in Europe for saying simply that there is an Islamic rape culture coming to Europe.
[41:36.360 --> 41:44.360]  Swedish artist jail term extended after he committed hate crime of saying Muslim migrants have not integrated.
[41:44.360 --> 41:50.360]  All right, you can say nothing negative, no speech beyond the Soviet Union.
[41:50.360 --> 41:58.360]  These are rancid authoritarians who we've, quote, given the moral high ground.
[41:58.360 --> 42:05.360]  Let's go to Beto here as much as we can get to Beto talking about how it's slavery here it is.
[42:05.360 --> 42:10.360]  Immigration, millions living in the shadows, working some of the toughest jobs,
[42:10.360 --> 42:16.360]  trying to make a minimum wage, some not even making that kept in modern day bondage their immigration status
[42:16.360 --> 42:23.360]  used as leverage to keep them down from fully participating in this country's success and in our economy.
[42:23.360 --> 42:30.360]  An economy that works too well for too few and not well enough for most Americans.
[42:30.360 --> 42:36.360]  You heard that it's slavery to come here illegally and be able to have your baby for free and get welfare.
[42:36.360 --> 42:41.360]  When Democrat cities work undocumented, they use you as a permanent underclass.
[42:41.360 --> 42:48.360]  You see, they're the ones doing all this, they're the ones trying to keep the system like this so they have a permanent underclass,
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.360]  then they point their finger at us and say we're the bad guys.
[42:52.360 --> 42:59.360]  Unbelievable guilt tripping, Beto, what a molester of the truth, what a degenerate, what a lying piece of filth.

[46:53.360 --> 46:55.360]  Thank you for making Infowars possible.
[46:55.360 --> 47:15.360]  God bless you.
[47:26.360 --> 47:29.360]  All right, here's what's going to happen.
[47:29.360 --> 47:31.360]  I'm going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[47:31.360 --> 47:33.360]  And I've got a lot of news to cover as well.
[47:33.360 --> 47:41.360]  But I specifically want to talk to folks in the border states where the millions of illegal aliens are,
[47:41.360 --> 47:43.360]  spreading diseases.
[47:43.360 --> 47:45.360]  You know, in the old days when you came here legally,
[47:45.360 --> 47:49.360]  they would check you for diseases and quarantine and they weren't sure.
[47:49.360 --> 47:51.360]  I would say, oh, look at the Statue of Liberty.
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.360]  Everybody sits on top of a quarantine center.
[47:55.360 --> 48:00.360]  Ellis Island has thousands and thousands of beds on it.
[48:00.360 --> 48:07.360]  Basically jail cells because you have to get these people better before you let them in.
[48:07.360 --> 48:10.360]  And it makes me so angry that they've got the nerve to then say,
[48:10.360 --> 48:17.360]  arrest anybody who hasn't taken their vaccines when it's a CDC admitted fact that the vaccines don't protect you.
[48:17.360 --> 48:20.360]  And they sure don't protect you from new strains.
[48:20.360 --> 48:22.360]  And I already played all those newscasts yesterday.
[48:22.360 --> 48:25.360]  It's even on the news.
[48:25.360 --> 48:31.360]  But it's only on local news because the health department in most areas are actually run by real doctors and real scientists.
[48:31.360 --> 48:36.360]  And they're telling people what's happening.
[48:36.360 --> 48:38.360]  Not the mayor of New York.
[48:38.360 --> 48:45.360]  Now he blames people that haven't vaccinated the Orthodox Jewish community just insane.
[48:45.360 --> 48:54.360]  Speaking of the Jewish community, in the third hour, we have a Christian researcher coming on who has been exposing how the left is funding anti-Semitism in this country,
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.360]  just like George Soros has been caught doing, to create division.
[48:59.360 --> 49:05.360]  So they're behind the movement to fight anti-Semitism, the left, but they're also behind the main anti-Semitism,
[49:05.360 --> 49:18.360]  which is part of a class of civilizations on a Gaelian dialectic, Jan Irvin will be joining us to discuss that coming up in the third hour.
[49:18.360 --> 49:26.360]  But we're going to have open phones some then too, specifically because you had two conservatives at this conservative synagogue,
[49:26.360 --> 49:32.360]  one border patrol and another army veteran who got so outraged when this guy was shooting people.
[49:32.360 --> 49:37.360]  He did a war growl and went, I'm going to kill you and chase the guy down.
[49:37.360 --> 49:45.360]  The coward got in his car, was fumbling around, was about to shoot him when finally the border patrol agent had gotten a gun from somebody else and stopped this guy.
[49:45.360 --> 49:49.360]  He only killed one person. That's still too many injured three others.
[49:49.360 --> 49:54.360]  But that coward thought he'd go in there and that no one would oppose him.
[49:54.360 --> 49:58.360]  But because somebody charged him, he got run off his quarry.
[49:58.360 --> 50:08.360]  And again, it's such an illustration when you go online and YouTube leaves up all these accounts.
[50:08.360 --> 50:11.360]  And I say, fine, leave them up. I believe in free speech, even though I disagree with it.
[50:11.360 --> 50:21.360]  They leave David Duke's account up, which by the way is tame compared to some of these accounts with people saying Hitler's good and saying, kill all the Jews.
[50:21.360 --> 50:29.360]  And then of course, the very same accounts say that I am a sellout to Israel and that Stephen Crowder is a sellout to Israel.
[50:29.360 --> 50:35.360]  And it's very, very hurtful because I don't say kill all the Muslims, even though I disagree with Islam.
[50:35.360 --> 50:40.360]  I don't say kill all the Mexicans, even though there are a lot of illegal Mexicans coming in.
[50:40.360 --> 50:49.360]  There's a lot of great Mexicans. You can't sit there and say a religion or a group of people, every one of them is bad.
[50:49.360 --> 50:55.360]  And then from what I know about Israel and what I know about Jews, on average, is that they're very diverse.
[50:55.360 --> 51:04.360]  I mean, you've got the Hasidic Jews and a bunch of subsects, you've got Orthodox, you've got liberal, and you've got reformed, and you've got agnostic,
[51:04.360 --> 51:08.360]  and you've got that strain of Jews that are communists, just like you've got that in other groups.
[51:08.360 --> 51:19.360]  But it's just such a mental illness that there's a whole religion giving magical powers to Jews.
[51:19.360 --> 51:26.360]  You know, if anything, I've been persecuted by Jewish groups, by the ADL, by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[51:26.360 --> 51:29.360]  It's got a lot of political leftist Jews in it.
[51:29.360 --> 51:36.360]  And their job is to sell racial division and discord and to demonize America and capitalism as racism.
[51:36.360 --> 51:42.360]  And so there are some really mean, evil, bad leftists out there, and some of them have to be Jews.
[51:42.360 --> 51:48.360]  But I'm not going to sink to their leftist race-based level and teach all their race division like they do.
[51:48.360 --> 51:52.360]  I believe Martin Luther King, and it's about what ideas you have and what you stand for.
[51:52.360 --> 52:03.360]  But I'll say this to all of the people that bashed Jews 24-7 like it's a little treat, a little special goodie they're putting out.
[52:03.360 --> 52:11.360]  They've never made films about the USS Liberty being an Israeli false flag that LBJ was involved in as well to bring us into a war.
[52:11.360 --> 52:12.360]  That happened.
[52:12.360 --> 52:15.360]  I've interviewed Jews that were involved in their own military and said it was wrong.
[52:15.360 --> 52:17.360]  Governments do that sometimes. It's bad.
[52:17.360 --> 52:20.360]  All major governments do it. It's wrong.
[52:20.360 --> 52:24.360]  It's like torture. All governments tend to do it. It's bad.
[52:24.360 --> 52:35.360]  But the very people that say I'm this Israeli operative like a fetish, like a trophy they have all day long, because they're really just jealous of how hard we work and what we've built,
[52:35.360 --> 52:38.360]  never attack Trump as an Israeli operative.
[52:38.360 --> 52:44.360]  Even though he thinks that Israel is a lot better than turning it over to the Muslims and he likes Netanyahu and likes having a friend in the region.
[52:44.360 --> 52:47.360]  They buy a lot of our weapons and a lot of our products.
[52:47.360 --> 52:50.360]  And if he turned it over to the Muslims, they'd all be killing each other in about an hour.
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.360]  It's very sad and Saudi Arabia doesn't take one ballast ending an end, but Israel's supposed to.
[52:55.360 --> 53:01.360]  But notice Trump's daughter is married to an Orthodox Jew, Jared Kushner.
[53:01.360 --> 53:05.360]  Trump's vehemently pro-Israel.
[53:05.360 --> 53:09.360]  And you never hear a word out of the QAnon group saying I'm an Israeli agent.
[53:09.360 --> 53:12.360]  Because they can't take Trump on.
[53:12.360 --> 53:18.360]  They've got a siphon off and claim they speak for Trump.
[53:18.360 --> 53:22.360]  And then Pence is with some sheriff's deputies that mean well.
[53:22.360 --> 53:25.360]  And not everybody involved in the QBoom. It's bad. A lot of them are good.
[53:25.360 --> 53:29.360]  They do some Q thing and then Pence sees it and deletes it.
[53:29.360 --> 53:34.360]  And I'm not in competition with the quote, nebulous, anonymous Q thing.
[53:34.360 --> 53:38.360]  It's like anonymous, the anonymous internet situation.
[53:38.360 --> 53:40.360]  People said, are you four anonymous 10 years ago?
[53:40.360 --> 53:45.360]  And I said, I can dress up in a Guy Fawkes mask and put out anonymous stuff on anonymous channels.
[53:45.360 --> 53:46.360]  You never know what's mean.
[53:46.360 --> 53:47.360]  I could put out whatever I wanted.
[53:47.360 --> 53:50.360]  Do you just trust some anonymous thing?
[53:50.360 --> 53:54.360]  Now, if some anonymous source keeps giving you things that prove to be accurate, great.
[53:54.360 --> 53:57.360]  But most of what Q said wasn't true.
[53:57.360 --> 53:58.360]  Some of it was true.
[53:58.360 --> 54:03.360]  But only because Mueller came up empty and Trump has them by the shorthairs they had to back off.
[54:03.360 --> 54:06.360]  Not because Mueller was a good guy the whole time.
[54:06.360 --> 54:09.360]  I know for a fact Trump doesn't like Mueller.
[54:09.360 --> 54:12.360]  People said, oh, Sessions is really good.
[54:12.360 --> 54:18.360]  No Trump genuinely didn't like Jeff Sessions and thought he was a coward.
[54:18.360 --> 54:25.360]  So all I'm saying is that this becomes a diversion and distraction.
[54:25.360 --> 54:27.360]  Who do you have in that conservative synagogue?
[54:27.360 --> 54:35.360]  A border patrol agent that happened to be Jewish and was trying to go for Passover to be part of his culture and his God.
[54:35.360 --> 54:43.360]  And then another army veteran decorated Patriot who had courage to stand up against that guy and then we just say these people are crap.
[54:43.360 --> 54:45.360]  Let me tell you something.
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.360]  At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or if you're Jewish or whether you're an agnostic.
[54:49.360 --> 54:53.360]  And there are a lot of Muslims too that a lot of Muslims would call heretics, but they want to live in peace.
[54:53.360 --> 54:59.360]  What matters is if you believe in free market and freedom and America and the Second Amendment and family.
[54:59.360 --> 55:04.360]  And you stand for that and you believe in the nation state and we're all bound together by that.
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.360]  And I guarantee you, if you took the average little troll, want to be Nazi online.
[55:09.360 --> 55:15.360]  And if you took them to one of these conservative synagogues and they actually met and talked to those people,
[55:15.360 --> 55:23.360]  you'd find smart, compelling, hardworking, good people that care about this country and understand the threat to this nation.
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.360]  Now, if you go to some leftist church or some leftist synagogue or some leftist mosque,
[55:28.360 --> 55:38.360]  you're going to find the scum of the earth that hate this country and hate the family and hate God who've captured churches
[55:38.360 --> 55:47.360]  who've captured churches and synagogues to tell us there is no God, that God is dead because they want to be God.
[55:47.360 --> 55:50.360]  So it's just not reality based.
[55:50.360 --> 55:55.360]  And so I challenge people out there that attack me and I'm not responding to you because your attacks hurt me.
[55:55.360 --> 56:01.360]  I'm responding because I know a lot of you are just in your own form of group psychosis, group think.
[56:01.360 --> 56:06.360]  And you really attribute magical powers to Jews like they're leprechauns or something.
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.360]  But you attack me because that's the popular algorithm that the left allows online.
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.360]  You've got some anti-Semitic Alex Jones rant, baby Google green lights you all the way.
[56:16.360 --> 56:21.360]  You've got some unity situation like I promote Google banjirash.
[56:21.360 --> 56:22.360]  They don't want unity.
[56:22.360 --> 56:30.360]  I'm really trying to make things work here. But remember, the Owen Benjamin's of the world, talented comedian, nice guy I had on
[56:30.360 --> 56:34.360]  until I found out he was saying Germany had a great leader in the early 40s.
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.360]  Bull crap. Hitler was a psychotic demon. Both my grandfathers almost died fighting him.
[56:39.360 --> 56:42.360]  And they saw the dead bodies. They saw the piles of dead people.
[56:42.360 --> 56:46.360]  Don't give me that crap that I'm censoring or I sold out.
[56:46.360 --> 56:50.360]  No, dude, you're on YouTube. I'm not. I'm under attack and banned everywhere.
[56:50.360 --> 56:53.360]  They've taken my bank accounts away. They're trying to shut us down right now.
[56:53.360 --> 56:56.360]  I've been sued 20 something times. I'm on the front lines.
[56:56.360 --> 56:59.360]  I'm changing the world and our audience is.
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.360]  And people like Owen sit there and say, oh, you know, Trump's great, but oh, Jones is a sellout to Israel.
[57:03.360 --> 57:09.360]  No, go after Trump and that you don't have the wavos because the anti-Semites won't do it.
[57:09.360 --> 57:12.360]  And I'm sorry you're Jewish. You don't like your dad, Owen.
[57:12.360 --> 57:16.360]  Sorry you got daddy issues, bro. I don't have daddy issues with my dad.
[57:16.360 --> 57:23.360]  My dad's just a red-blooded American. He never told me, hey, I'm English and Irish and Scottish and American Indian.
[57:23.360 --> 57:28.360]  That's who we are. He brought me up that we're Americans. We believe in freedom.
[57:28.360 --> 57:31.360]  That's what it came down to.
[57:31.360 --> 57:34.360]  Please don't forget, we're only here because of your support.
[57:34.360 --> 57:36.360]  We've got great products and new super sales.

[57:48.360 --> 57:55.360]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6. You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[57:55.360 --> 58:01.360]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[58:01.360 --> 58:08.360]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force. I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[58:08.360 --> 58:14.360]  Because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[58:14.360 --> 58:15.360]  I appreciate that.
[58:15.360 --> 58:17.360]  What happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[58:17.360 --> 58:22.360]  It's really great. It's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[58:22.360 --> 58:28.360]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste. It just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[58:28.360 --> 58:32.360]  We look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbo-charge women.
[58:32.360 --> 58:40.360]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[58:40.360 --> 59:06.360]  I'm glad you plugged it. Infowarsstore.com or triple-A-253-3139.

[59:52.360 --> 59:57.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:07.360]  Now, who's done DMT or done five grams of psilocybin, they know that you have some kind of communication with something else.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.360]  The question is, is that something else inside your psyche, or is that something else a chemical doorway?
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:19.360]  Is there a chemical doorway inside the mind that opens up, and the belief is that when you die,
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:25.360]  and this is what the afterlife is, that when you die, your brain produces these chemicals.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.360]  These chemicals open up this doorway, and this is the portal to the next dimension.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:46.360]  I have heard that I have talked to Army generals, commanding generals, major generals, general generals, CIA everybody,
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.360]  and they're all 100 percent, and I thought it was a sigh out before, and then I've researched it.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:58.360]  I've talked to hundreds of people now, not on air, but I'm going to make a film on this, who've taken ayahuasca and DMT.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:08.360]  I've not taken it for obvious reasons, and it's unbelievable because they 100 percent in San Francisco is the main project site.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:18.360]  Literally have an alien base, and they are literally communicating, and they've got like astronaut-level people taking super hardcore levels of drugs
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:22.360]  and going into meetings with these things, and making intergalactic deals.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.360]  And that's what the government believes and says they're doing.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.360]  When you say the government, that's a broad stroke, you're using a broad brush.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]  What do you mean by the government?
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.360]  A breakaway rogue intelligence agency.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:41.360]  So what you're saying is essentially that they're using psychedelic drugs to communicate with interdimensional beings.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360]  Spirit guides.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:49.360]  Okay, you're saying that the government is aware of this, and they must be aware of this, they've heard enough people talk about it, they must have done experiments on it.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360]  What does science do?
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.360]  They want to know the secrets of the universe.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:59.360]  For sure, and people that have the courage to experiment with these things and try them themselves realize that this is such a profound experience,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:07.360]  that it's so alien, that if an alien landed right now in our parking lot, and a little gray man with big black eyes got out,
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.360]  it would be nothing compared to what I've seen on psychedelic trips.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:18.360]  Well, let me just tell you, me getting into this show is just because people need to understand that I've known about this for a long time,
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.360]  and I just don't think people are ready for it.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.360]  It was actually a horrible experience.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.360]  Really?
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.360]  That was my worst, yeah.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360]  I had a great experience on it.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]  You did?
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360]  Yeah.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360]  What was wrong with it?
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:35.360]  So, you take like one puff, and before you exhale, there's a synthetic version too, right?
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.360]  I was taking the venom.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.360]  You're shot out of a cannon, there's no lead up.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360]  It's no warm up.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]  It's like...
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:50.360]  And I felt like I was actually like strapped to the outside of a rocket, you know, going through space and through clouds,
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:57.360]  and like the G-Force was pulling down my cheeks, and it was just this mental storm without any...
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.360]  Nothing to orient myself.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.360]  There was no space.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.360]  There was no time.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.360]  There was no self.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.360]  And it was just unendurable, this punishing roar in my ears.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.360]  It was horrible.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360]  It was terrifying.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.360]  I remember being a kid, and my parents, they don't really get mad about this, it's whatever.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.360]  They didn't even know what they were hearing at the time, but they had friends, they knew at UT,
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.360]  that were involved in research projects, and then they were...
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.360]  Nine times out of ten, I read about research projects in San Francisco.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:31.360]  UT has some, MIT has a lot, and shot me anytime you want, but this was in like the 60s.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:38.360]  The intention is to use this technology to explore and map the DMT realm.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:45.360]  It looks like Imperial College London is going to deploy this technology in further research into DMT,
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:52.360]  and that that research is not going to be purely and simply into the therapeutic potential of a psychedelic,
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.360]  which is very important research to do.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.360]  It's going to be an investigation into the nature of reality using a psychedelic,
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:03.360]  the mysterious nature of reality, and it is odd, and you know this from personal experience,
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.360]  that when you get plunged into that DMT realm,
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.360]  it is so different from the realm of our daily world.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:16.360]  Filled with geometry, filled with these sprightly intelligences, completely internally coherent,
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:24.360]  how can that be generated by the brain, or are we dealing with some other level of reality that we haven't encountered yet?
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:29.360]  I think that ancient cultures, and in particular my lost civilization,
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.360]  were deeply involved in exploring the mysterious nature of reality.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.360]  They had virtual reality gloves where you'd put them on and put goggles on,
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.360]  and you'd go into stuff that looked like the holodeck from Star Trek, 20 years before it existed.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.360]  This was patented in 1957, it's a VR machine.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.360]  Exactly, no, exactly.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]  That's crazy.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.360]  It gives you wind, vibration, aroma, stereo sound, color, motion, wide vision.

[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.360]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.360]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.360]  I need to open the phones up starting at the next segment.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.360]  So our borders are wide open.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.360]  Illegal aliens are allowed to come in with any disease they want.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.360]  They're not even screened.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.360]  They're allowed to spread all over the country.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.360]  Local governments admit that the spread of measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis,
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.360]  so many other diseases that are even more serious like drug-resistant tuberculosis
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.360]  are coming from the illegal aliens in every case and then spreading from there.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:07:00.360]  But meanwhile, the mayor of New York is ordering forced inoculations of orthodox Jews
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:06.360]  because Leviticus says don't put somebody else's blood or seed inside of your body.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.360]  It sounds like a smart thing to do unless you're a woman and it's your husband.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.360]  I mean, because this is some serious business, it's how you get diseases, it's how you get contamination
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.360]  and they admit these vaccines are full of contaminants.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:29.360]  And so now, measles scare delays flight to New York City, jet blue accused of profiling orthodox boy.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.360]  So everybody else can come into the country undocumented,
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.360]  but if you come in documented or you're just flying around inside the U.S.,
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.360]  oh, I heard the Jews have the disease.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.360]  Isn't this weird? Hitler said the Jews were carrying diseases.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:50.360]  So, see, you can't profile the legal alien, but you can profile those Jews. Here it is.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:56.360]  The Port Authority temporarily quarantined that plane while the passengers got checked out tonight.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.360]  Now, that plane had just landed from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.360]  at a time, of course, when our area is in the midst of a measles outbreak.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:09.360]  News for us while Ali was live at JFK with what we're learning about this scare.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:14.360]  Yeah, Adam and Jumi, after being on a plane for four and a half hours,
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.360]  coming all the way from Santo Domingo to here at JFK,
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.360]  passengers had to wait a little bit longer before the plane.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.360]  We thought might have an issue that was of concern,
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.360]  and the Port Authority wanted to check it out before we entered a terminal with a whole bunch of people.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.360]  It turns out that everything is just fine.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.360]  You just heard crews on board the aircraft giving the all clear to the passengers on flight 410
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.360]  after medics had to come on board and make sure no one on the flight had measles.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.360]  Representatives from JetBlue told us they got reports of a medical emergency on board the flight
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:53.360]  and then requested to hold the plane for medical services out of an abundance of caution
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  so a customer could be examined.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.360]  The flight landed around 9 p.m., but it wasn't until about 40 minutes ago
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.360]  that we started seeing some of these passengers come out after going through customs.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.360]  The passengers told me they didn't really know what was happening on the plane,
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:12.360]  but rumors were circulating that someone on board may have had measles.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.360]  The Port Authority got some sort of medic type guy to come on with a mask,
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.360]  and a policeman probably caught authority with a mask,
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.360]  looked at the kid, decided that it was probably mosquito bites,
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.360]  left everybody on the plane so that everything was fine.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.360]  We also spoke with a Passover program director.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.360]  He told us he organized this trip for Orthodox families.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.360]  He tells us JetBlue crew saw an Orthodox Jew with mosquito bites
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.360]  and unfairly profiled him as having measles.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:49.360]  Now with almost 700 cases in the U.S., there have been almost 400 cases of measles confirmed in New York
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360]  since the outbreak began last October.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.360]  The majority of cases are children under 18 years old in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360]  and in Rockland County.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:01.360]  Now, although there have been no deaths from the outbreak, there have been several complications,
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  including a couple dozen people hospitalized and at least six even in the ICU.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.360]  For now, that is very latest.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.360]  Live at JFK Airport, Kuala Lumpur, News for New York.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.360]  So let's walk through all the BS here.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.360]  Number one, maybe a couple deaths total.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360]  They act like measles is the end of the world.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.360]  No, they're covering up drug-resistant TV.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.360]  They're covering up the Black Plague, the Ibonic Plague.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.360]  They're covering up all these things killing a bunch of people.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.360]  They're covering up all people dying in the desert of Mexico before they get here of diseases.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.360]  They're covering up those illegal aliens triggering it.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.360]  But then, oh my gosh, they see an Orthodox Jew flying in.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360]  They got mosquito bites.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.360]  Quite frankly, should have been tested.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.360]  If there's a measles outbreak, but so should the illegal aliens.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.360]  They should be stopped.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:57.360]  AOC says you have no right to stop anybody coming in to the United States, period.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.360]  It's madness.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.360]  It's insane.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.360]  But again, don't blame those of us that know the measles vaccine never protects you anyways.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.360]  And don't blame those of us that know that it hardly ever kills anybody.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.360]  Maybe one out of five million that get it, literally.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:17.360]  No, this whole measles thing is a cover for all the real diseases spreading in this country,
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  like drug-resistant pertussis out of the third world that's killing a bunch of people.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]  And guess what?
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.360]  Vaccine doesn't protect you.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.360]  Look up its own insert.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.360]  They'll admit, oh, all the strains that are out now, we don't have one for that.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.360]  They still tell you, get it.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.360]  Even though it doesn't protect you, it lowers your immunity.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.360]  Every time you take a vaccine, it lowers your general immunity.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.360]  It may teach you immunity to one thing, but it messes you up.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360]  Look it up.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.360]  I showed all the articles yesterday.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.360]  I want to queue up the AOC club again in a minute.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.360]  We're going to post that one first, where she specifically says, though,
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.360]  no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.360]  She says, I don't care where you're coming from.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.360]  You have a right to be here, period.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.360]  And you have a right for everything to be free, just like she said in her Green Deal.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.360]  Those that can't work or don't want to work.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.360]  Well, then who's got to work, you dumbass?
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.360]  It's called slavery if I've got to pay for somebody.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.360]  But O'Rourke says if we don't have open borders, give folks free things, that's slavery.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.360]  Incredible.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.360]  But here is, again, ABC News admitting and Fox admitting.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:22.360]  I've got a bunch of these admitting that the patient zeroes, this is a Fox News piece,
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.360]  is the illegal aliens.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360]  Here it is.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:30.360]  Normally, when it comes to measles, we do have small outbreaks that happen in the United States.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.360]  But those cases usually happen when travelers from abroad come and bring the illness.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:42.360]  Having said that, the more recent generation of parents have not vaccinated as many children.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.360]  So the potential for it to be spread has increased, which heightens our fear.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:56.360]  And now of this year, of late this year, we have five cases in LA County of actual documented measles cases.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.360]  And then let's go to that Fox News clip that I just mentioned.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.360]  The clip I wanted to go to.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.360]  This is Fox News.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.360]  Officials admitting illegal aliens started measles epidemic.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.360]  That was AP admitting it too in California.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.360]  But here's New York.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.360]  Today, a New York County has declared a state of emergency.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:21.360]  Starting today, children not vaccinated against the measles virus are banned from public places.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.360]  So far, there are 153 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland County.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.360]  The Rockland County Executive Ed Day joins me now.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.360]  Why did you take the step?
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.360]  I took the step because we've been battling this for six months.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:41.360]  Six months ago, we had seven infected individuals come from overseas to a local community in Rockland County.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:47.360]  The health department did a wonderful job with the mission of minimizing exposures and maximizing.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.360]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360]  Came from overseas.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.360]  So it's the same thing over and over again.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.360]  So it's fine to actually, if you see somebody, it looks like they have smallpox to check them.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.360]  But the only reason they did it was because the guy was an Orthodox Jew,
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.360]  and they knew to quote, look out for that because they heard, oh, it's the Jews in New York.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.360]  Who are having, by the way, parties at their houses like everybody else does.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.360]  When somebody's got it, bring the kid over, get it all done at once.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.360]  You want to get your kids sick with it when they're not run down, but when they're healthy,
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.360]  which is a form of natural inoculation people have done for thousands of years,
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.360]  and statistically much, much better.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.360]  Get a fever, get a few spots, you're done.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  But if you get measles when you're super run down,
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.360]  it's the only time you can get brain damaged or died.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.360]  It's still incredibly rare.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.360]  Here's the toll-free number to join us on the open borders.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.360]  This form of biological attack that the deep states engaged in against our nation,
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.360]  against Trump, flip-flopping.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.360]  We'll get to those video clips.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.360]  I mean, I think this is one of the big central issues.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:50.360]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.360]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.360]  877-789-2539.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360]  First-time callers in this hour.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360]  First-time callers, please.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.360]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.360]  Where if you've called in and been on hold and not gotten in,
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.360]  we'll also take that call and give new callers a chance, though.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.360]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.360]  Just please give me your take on this national emergency
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360]  and what you think Trump should do,
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.360]  why you think he's starting to flip-flop on vaccines.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360]  Very, very scary point.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.360]  And then, we're going to get into all the other subjects.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  French Imam tells Muslims not to donate money for building Notre Dame.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.360]  Wait until you see all the other Islamic invasion news

[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:55.000]  calls here in just a few minutes but let me run over some of the other news we
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.420]  haven't hit yet that I'll be getting into in more detail coming up suddenly CNN
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:07.720]  ABC News they're all reporting on how Alexa of Amazon is listening to you with
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:12.200]  real people listening and basically codifying and selling your data you see
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.600]  once it's admitted once it's out in the open once it's ubiquitous once it's been
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.740]  accepted once people are already habituated and addicted and have formed
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:27.220]  habits then they tell you everything that I told you about Alexa when it first
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:32.580]  came out what six years ago and all the other systems hell I talked about it
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:38.940]  20 something years ago before the CIA director at the time came out and said
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.060]  oh your toaster and your dishwasher are gonna be watching and listening to you
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:49.620]  in wired magazine so the system has such disrespect for you that they live
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:56.300]  behind walls and they eat non-gmo and they get clean vaccines but they tell
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.580]  you you can't have a border or wall then they bring in radical Islam and protect
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:07.500]  it but then tell you that Christians are bad and then AOC doesn't say a word
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.500]  when Christians are killed or shot but virtue signals to Muslims and then the
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:16.060]  White House questions that so she lies and says oh I never tweeted about
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:20.780]  anybody that week which was all a lie it's just how they get away with this
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:27.340]  over and over and over and I'm asking people where does it in where is it all
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:32.260]  going what are we gonna do when our government is just run by a bunch of
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:35.500]  criminals then we get Trump in who's trying to halfway turn things around
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:42.580]  act like he's the devil my point is is that things should be a lot better than
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:51.780]  they are now quite frankly but people are in a learned helplessness morass people
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:57.460]  watch television all day folks watch Netflix all day they watch HBO and to
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:01.260]  them they are passionate about what's happening in that theater of the mind
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:07.900]  not passionate about what's happening in the real world I never watch Game of
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.180]  Thrones when I say never I mean I might watch it it's about what seven eight
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:16.540]  years I don't know might have watched it ten times and my oldest daughter likes
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.500]  to watch it and my son likes to watch it and they don't watch a lot of TV but I
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:25.700]  let him watch it and last night I watched what they said was the grand finale
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:33.100]  battle and it had some decent actors and it was just non-stop violence and when
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:39.940]  the bad guy gets killed I've never seen my oldest daughter act this excited and
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:45.580]  jump around for like three minutes screaming I mean I call it a prosthesis
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.980]  like a fake limb when you like to watch football and when your team wins you get
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:54.500]  this tribal feeling of victory I mean I would imagine if you were a firefighter
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:00.260]  and you got a burning you know child out of the building and saved them I would
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:04.700]  imagine you would feel vitriolic and have endorphin flow or I would imagine if
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.420]  you got a state to pass a law saying we're not gonna kill babies in the third
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:13.300]  trimester or how about after they're born you'd feel like you had done
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:19.460]  something at a spiritual level and I put my daughter down it was to see passion
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:26.820]  that I've never seen in her since she quit competitive swimming and she was
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:33.820]  the fastest in the city at her age group like 11 years old when she quit or in
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:39.420]  the middle of a divorce but the point was I've never seen that excitement it
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:46.220]  was like a real bad guy with you know 80 episodes she's watched multiple seasons
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:50.140]  and and and there's a villain that she did that did all these bad things to
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:57.380]  people she cared about that don't exist and she was in ecstasy
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:01.940]  meanwhile that shows and I'm not saying she's a bad daughter she's a great
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:07.380]  daughter it shows that I've been a bad dad at some levels and that we've all
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:15.620]  been bad that our children are passionate about fantasy because somehow we
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:18.900]  haven't taught them how to be passionate about the real world and I get it
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:22.700]  you sit down it's in a dark room everything's done for you it's all
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:30.820]  interesting but that world's not real there isn't some demon of light that
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:37.460]  can raise the dead coming with a giant zombie horde to kill us the zombie horde
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:42.620]  is us watching television not having a life the zombie horde is us getting the
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:47.180]  vaccines that lower our IQ and drinking the fluoride the zombie horde is
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:50.340]  millions of babies being aborted each year we don't even care or know we've
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:55.220]  lost our humanity because we're spectators now and that's really what
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:26:01.340]  we're talking about here you know we've built the only multimedia standalone
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:07.260]  operation that's promoting Americana Renaissance in the world and the enemy
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:10.860]  fully recognized that in the last three years and has moved heaven and earth
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:15.420]  try to shut us down and we still have an important voice to still have a big
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:20.660]  effect only because of you and when I get up here on air talking to you who's
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:26.100]  not an audience like NFL watchers or Game of Thrones viewers they got about
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:32.940]  judging you I'm just pointing this out I'm thanking the audience you are in the
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:36.900]  real world you're in the real game you're watching and involved in spreading the
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.940]  word and in giving us intel and financially backing us and praying for
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:46.460]  us spiritually backing us at a level that nobody else is this is the real
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:51.220]  world this is where we first told you about the illegal spine and told you
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:55.220]  about the attempt to overthrow Trump and about killing babies after they're
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:59.660]  born keep their organs years ago and now it's mainstream news the enemy knows
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:04.700]  that we have the map of humanity we have the map of the future we have the map
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:09.020]  in the memory of what humanity was to carry it forward so of course the good
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:13.660]  guy is a fellow in a wheelchair in Game of Thrones who has the genetic map and
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:17.580]  the genetic memory everyone else has lost the genetic memory to carry on
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:22.700]  humanity spirit and the devil wants to destroy the genetic memory and kill that
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:26.820]  particular individual and so even Game of Thrones is telling you the big game
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:31.740]  plan and the big secret I watched one episode and there were all the archetypes
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:36.100]  and I would say watch this lady you'll walk off and disintegrate into dust my
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.900]  son goes no she won't she walks off and disintegrates into dust I said watch
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:43.900]  that it'll be that girl that kills the bad guy just 30 minutes in my son said
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:48.740]  no way it'll be a dragon kills him I knew the whole show even though I've
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.620]  never even really watched it the eight or nine times before out of one side of
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:58.020]  my eye because I already know what the enemy knows and the enemy can't help
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:01.140]  but tell you what they're doing and everything they do because God has one
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:05.820]  rule the enemy can have control of the air the broadcast the enemy can have
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:12.460]  control this planet but the enemy must tell you in riddle what the enemy is
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:17.260]  doing to you and they don't want you to have the memory of the race or the
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:22.540]  consciousness and the current position and the future destiny we have the
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:27.660]  destiny we are not sitting here in a wheelchair and I'm not putting you down
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:32.100]  if you aren't one we know the enemy operation we can defeat them and they
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:35.740]  want us destroyed to understand your Game of Thrones analogy is they want to
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:41.180]  seize this fortress they want to tear us apart but it will be the little people

[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:08.660]  if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:11.940]  better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:17.100]  liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.860]  the children's you've got the adults got the krill oil if you're gonna get the
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.900]  full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:27.100]  give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:30.300]  burps and I'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:34.300]  the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good it in my view I'm not a medical
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:37.500]  statement here but let me tell you something I eat five capillates of krill
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:43.860]  oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is made
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:51.540]  basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.380]  you notice I just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got I just
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:32:00.140]  can't lie to you I just can't do it we've taken thousands of years of known
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:04.740]  research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:08.500]  find the very best systems that God gave us your mother nature to detoxify the
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:13.140]  body that's why I'm introducing Z shield toxic metal and chemical defense
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:18.140]  support it's made in the USA it's filled with known compounds from nature that
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:21.460]  are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:26.500]  info or it is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:30.260]  been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:34.260]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want to
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:38.260]  yourself you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:43.140]  the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can

[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.180]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:54.580]  support and your prayers together we're changing the world now it's time to

[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:40.980]  spreading diseases but more people should be treated instead they're allowed
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:45.060]  to spread it and then American citizens and others are blamed for it we'll cover
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.700]  any other issue when they get into as well I'm going to your calls here in a
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:52.860]  few minutes but hey did you see the news for TV viewers will put it up on screen
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:34:00.260]  sports illustrated swimsuit issue features a muslim woman in a burkeene
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:07.700]  that's right first it shows her in a jib and clothes down to her ankles and then
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:15.420]  it features her in a rainbow colored swimsuit a burkeene and it's just how
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:20.660]  beautiful this is and how wonderful this is and how it's the greatest style the
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:26.140]  burkeene because if she doesn't wear that in an Islamic country they'll cut her
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:31.380]  head off or throw her off a building and so you got sports illustrated not
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:35.260]  praising women in Iran taking their burkas off and driving cars and saying
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:40.860]  we have rights no no no no no no no no no now you praise women going under the
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:47.140]  Islamic knife and having their genitals cut off and here's some of the other
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:52.780]  news French Imam tells Muslims not to donate money to rebuild Notre Dame
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:35:01.740]  that's a Paul Joseph Watson article upon info wars calm and no one's going to
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:07.540]  see it unless you get it out to them an Imam in France that's on national
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.900]  television told Muslims not to donate to the rebuilding of Notre Dame asking
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:15.620]  those who do you have no shame during the lecture the Imam asserted that only
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.500]  Christians you donate to the cause because it's a symbol of their religion
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:23.140]  and not the symbol of Muslims he went on to complain that the words would be
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:29.420]  twisted to openly discourage Muslims from donating to rebuild anyways and
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:36.700]  then it goes on from there Swedish artist jail term extended after he committed
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:40.540]  quote hate crime of saying Muslim migrants have not integrated you can

[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:11.140]  Middle East and North African people that's a fact Park was also imprisoned
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:16.300]  for race hatred because you've heard of Muslim migrants as bladder according to
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:21.660]  Wiktionary bladder means a person living in northern European country who is

[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:57.540]  whiteness and white shouldn't breed if you tell Africans they shouldn't have

[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:49.540]  excellent like this like the reason he did I'm gonna read is on ours like his
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:55.580]  site summit.news father gagged found guilty of family violence for calling
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:38:05.060]  his trans daughter the state's taken a she she she takes steroid shots but

[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:32.620]  viewer discretion advice of these people being hung up by their legs upside
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:39.540]  down crucified that's just some of it but now a lot of the liberals are
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:44.460]  coming out like like Cher and others Johnny Rotten's not really a liberal but
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.500]  in saying that the homeless are all over the place pooping all over the ground
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:54.380]  ruining fancy areas of Los Angeles well get used to it that's the way that's the
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:58.580]  way it goes that's the that's the new system that everybody's supposed to put
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:01.900]  up with but there's some folks being hung by their necks and hung by their feet
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:06.380]  and crucified you can look that up if you'd like to but hey it's the religion
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:12.180]  of peace time to submit to it right or we'll all be put to the sword okay we're
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:17.140]  gonna go to Jeff and Joe and Zach and Josh and Laura and Greg and James and
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:23.540]  Philip and Josh and Jaren here in just a moment I just want to briefly remind
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.340]  listeners that just like our information is really game-changing and
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:34.900]  and powerful any products we bring you are game-changing and powerful and we
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:38.420]  were getting deep earth crystals the last five years before that we were
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:43.020]  getting very clean seaweed derived iodine that you could call atomic but it
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:48.020]  was still partially bound it was only like 99% pure that sounds good but then
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:52.700]  you don't get full absorption when it's bound then we couldn't get it for about
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:57.180]  a year because we're put over a barrel by the deep earth mining companies but
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.660]  then in my search I found another deeper crystal source that was just as good but
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:04.300]  they said listen you should add the other two types of iodine because some
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:07.620]  people can't absorb pure iodine even though most people can't absorb the
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:13.260]  non-pure but we find better absorption rates now put out x3 it's just as good
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:19.180]  as x2 in fact you know I think it's probably better for children and the
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:22.500]  elderly and others whatever you consult your physicians because iodine is a big
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:26.220]  deal this is the only clean iodine out there well I want you to experience x3

[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:27.020]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:30.860]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:35.300]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:40.020]  but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:45.380]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:50.740]  it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to

[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.940]  when they say they want to save the planet they want to destroy the planet

[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:21.740]  because they know americans have guilt they know we have a conscience
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:26.540]  that we've got to submit and be the globalist slaves
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:30.540]  no borders no wall no usa at all here she is

[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.620]  the poor illegal aliens, they're letting them spread it everywhere and then telling
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:22.260]  us it's our fault we got to pay for it.
[01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:25.260]  So we're going to go to Zach, we're going to go to Josh, we're going to go to Laura,
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:26.260]  we're going to go to everybody.
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:29.780]  Zach, in Denver, you're on the year worldwide, thanks for calling today.
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:36.220]  Hey Alex, great to be on there for some color here on the Alex Jones show.
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:37.220]  Welcome.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.220]  Awesome, yeah.
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:43.060]  So you were talking about vaccines before, just wanted to call in and put in my two cents.
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:51.060]  I have never been vaccinated before, but I'm 25 right now, only needles that have ever
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:56.700]  been in me, I got stitches twice and had a little bit of numbing, but that was it, still
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:50:00.700]  refused the tetanus at the time.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:05.580]  But lately, I mean, I'm 25 now, my whole life has been the same thing, I got chicken
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:11.180]  pox when I was in middle school, I was out of school for a week, there's no problem there.
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:17.980]  But as of about probably six months ago or so, it's been this whole measles outbreak
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.500]  that the media really has taken and run with.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:28.500]  And then now every time I come home or see something like that on Drudge, it gets to
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:34.780]  my fiance, she is vaccinated and now I'm 25 years later being accused of why, why don't
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:35.780]  I get vaccinated?
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:36.780]  Now.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:37.780]  Oh, that's exactly what it is.
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.300]  Well, hey, sweetheart, if you're vaccinated cupcake, you're protected.
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:45.860]  And so did you watch yesterday's show or did you watch the Saturday emergency report?
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:49.500]  Because people are sending those reports out and they can pull up Saturday's report and
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:54.620]  also pull up yesterday's two hour show, but I did a 44 minute report Saturday where I
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:59.900]  showed the CDC's own admissions that these vaccines don't protect you in most cases,
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:03.420]  that there's new strains that they totally don't protect you and that the illegal aliens
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.620]  are bringing it in.
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:09.180]  So this claim that, oh, I've been vaccinated, but you're still going to make me sick.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:11.500]  But I thought your vaccine protected you.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:16.060]  Why doesn't your fiance get upset about the illegal aliens being brought in?
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:19.060]  Because she only reads the headlines.
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:21.940]  She's the headlines of, hey, measles outbreak.
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:26.820]  This is how many people are affected, not where it came from, what's happening with
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:31.260]  it.
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:33.500]  It's incredible, my friend.
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:35.220]  It's absolutely incredible.
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:40.620]  And again, that's why everybody's got to go to infowars.com and get yesterday's show
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:46.460]  that we just had on screen or what's even shorter and even more hard hitting.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:50.060]  And that is Saturday's show.
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.340]  Saturday was the key show.
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:52:00.420]  The Sunday one was titled, that's Sunday.
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.420]  Just it doesn't matter.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.420]  Just stop.
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:03.420]  It's all right.
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:04.420]  You guys agree.
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:07.020]  I don't expect you to pull stuff up in live time, but we're not going to put the wrong
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.740]  thing up.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:14.020]  That's the Sunday show and that's the two hours and it's hard hitting too.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:19.100]  And people can go to infowars.com and newswars.com and they can get that and send it to their
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:20.820]  friends and family that get in their faces.
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:21.820]  This is a war.
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:24.500]  Just send it to all the health department links you can.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.020]  Force them to look at the reality.
[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:27.700]  They know what they're doing.
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:31.860]  So let's just do Sunday since you said it.
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:38.420]  Now Saturday was titled exclusive.
[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:44.740]  The measles outbreak is a giant false flag and a hoax.
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:52.540]  CDC admits that every major outbreak of measles has been caused by migrants, i.e. illegal
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:53.540]  aliens.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:57.780]  Now, that's a very important report.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:00.580]  The name of the video on our own servers, exclusive.
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:04.380]  The measles outbreak is a giant false flag and a hoax.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.500]  That's why they want us off air.
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.300]  They don't want you to share that.
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:10.140]  Now, that was Saturday's emergency report.
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:12.380]  Now we can put Sunday up and thanks for finding that, guys.
[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:14.980]  I don't know how they pull stuff up so quick.
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:20.180]  The Sunday report is the full show, but I cover it really in the first 30 minutes, biological
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.180]  weapons attacks launched against the U.S.
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:25.780]  That's what it is when you open the borders up and attempt to take down Trump and collapse
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:26.780]  our economy.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:32.220]  Now, sure, on the Sunday show, we probably had a million and a half people tune in conservatively.
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:36.780]  But that little video we posted last night of the live show and it's 25,000 views.
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:38.100]  On YouTube, it had a million.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:39.500]  That's why they took us off there.
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:42.900]  Because people are interested to know what's going on.
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:46.220]  But they can't stop you from sharing it.
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:50.380]  So I salute you and I thank you, but we need to warn people about what's really happening.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:53.180]  And I lay it all out, I show the government documents.
[01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:59.860]  Where anything in a vaccine, especially what's got protein in it, whether it's a virus or
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:05.060]  whether it's egg or whether it's human protein, because a lot of these vaccines, the actual
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:13.460]  pathogen is grown on dead baby parts or on a emulsification of babies.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:15.660]  And then you have an autoimmune response.
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:21.300]  Well, guess what happens when you've got human tissue in a vaccine and now it's mixed with
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:24.860]  tetanus or measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:29.180]  Your body doesn't think the pertussis bacteria is just a bacteria.
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:32.060]  It thinks human flesh is.
[01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:36.220]  And then you get cancer because your body starts attacking itself.
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.780]  Or you get an autoimmune disease.
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:41.460]  This is 101 science.
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.340]  That's why you can't have a vaccine contaminated.
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:48.340]  That's why the Guardian reports that the elites of the planet, the Chinese Communist leaders,
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:53.340]  the US leaders, the German leaders, the British leaders, all the major leaders, the Japanese
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:57.020]  leaders get, quote, clean vaccines.
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.660]  They cost up to $1,000 a shot.
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:03.020]  Everything's been scanned through electron microscopes.
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:04.860]  It's been tested again.
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:10.220]  You've got to go into special clean facilities to make sure that the needle is electronic.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:16.060]  I'm not a doctor, but I've read the schemes, it goes into a clean room, gives the shot.
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:21.780]  You basically put your body, your ass up to a membrane that injects you through.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:26.500]  Because the needle, if it carries something into your body and then has a pathogen of
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:30.700]  virus or a bacteria that's been attenuated, your body then has an autoimmune response
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:31.900]  to it.
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:33.100]  It's still dangerous.
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:39.100]  Again, if somebody puts a deadly virus or bacteria into you that's been attenuated, that means
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:40.740]  broken, killed.
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:42.460]  Your body's going to learn how to beat it.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:45.780]  You may have a horrible autoimmune response and die from it, but still, you didn't die
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:48.460]  from the pathogen, you die from the response.
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:56.740]  If there's egg or wheat or anything or human tissue or DNA in there, your body then sees
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:02.300]  whatever it is, a hormone, anything, as an outside enemy.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:06.980]  And it's bye-bye bluebird.
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:10.500]  These are up tens of thousands of percent, as everybody knows it, infant mortality's
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.060]  way up, cancer's up multi-thousand percent.
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:16.460]  This is all incontrovertible fact.
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:25.220]  Now, I said I'd take a bunch of your calls, but I always just get back to this.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:30.060]  Government and corporations want a precedent to put in your body what they want, when they
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.060]  want.
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:35.860]  I had a guest on next hour, it's really powerful info, but I decided to host the fourth hour.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:41.460]  And so, I'm going to have that guest on on the fourth hour, if they can do it, if not,
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:42.460]  fine, whatever.
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:45.140]  But I'm going to continue with your calls, I promise I'm getting to everybody.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:48.300]  All right, so we're going to come back and talk to all the other callers on the other
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:55.340]  side, I'll try to move quicker, but you have to understand this one point, if these idiots
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:59.420]  are supposedly vaccinated, why are they saying you're going to make them sick?
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:03.020]  It's one more way to be a victim, one more way for people to get leverage over you and
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:05.060]  bitching you.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:08.140]  The media teaches people to be losers and whiners.
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.300]  That's point number one.
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:12.500]  You had your damn shot, why the hell ain't you protected then?
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:15.020]  Don't blame me, dumbass.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:24.620]  Number two, anything in the vaccine that's delivered to you, you're going to end up having
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:33.100]  a larger response to and probably an autoimmune response permanently, permanently, understand?
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.140]  And the more you get shots, the worse it gets.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:37.140]  I see the ads on TV all the time about vaccines.
[01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:41.100]  They say if you've had a reaction to this, other vaccines, you can't take this.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:47.140]  Hell, we had an employee almost die from it last year.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.220]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:50.220]  Go ahead.
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:52.220]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:55.900]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:56.900]  It just gets old, man.
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:59.860]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:02.100]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:06.300]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:08.780]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:11.980]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:14.540]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:15.540]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:16.540]  You know what, Alex?
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:18.540]  Hey, put it on pause again.
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:23.100]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:24.980]  under attack, we need your help.
[01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:29.340]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:32.340]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:33.340]  Do you understand?
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:34.580]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:36.820]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:41.980]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info World.
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.140]  Do you understand?
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:44.820]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:48.820]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:53.820]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child that has supported this broadcast
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:55.820]  over the years and that has stood with us.
[01:58:55.820 --> 01:58:59.980]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates, but I'll tell you like
[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:05.260]  it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under, you're our only sponsors.
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:09.300]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:11.700]  We aren't able to continue on.
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:14.060]  So remember, you are the Info War.
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:15.180]  I'm not the leader.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.180]  You are the leader.
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:17.980]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:23.380]  We've got giant specials running right now at infowarstore.com that are unprecedented.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:28.220]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need, from across the board,

[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:32.420]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:38.820]  I want to encourage you again, go to infowarstore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:42.140]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:44.140]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:51.140]  God bless you.
[01:59:51.140 --> 02:00:03.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:10.100]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:38.100]  front lines of the Info War.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.220]  Josh in Michigan, then Laura in Texas.
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:42.100]  Josh, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:43.100]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:44.100]  Good to talk with you.
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:49.180]  I've been a long time listener, and I wake up every morning, and I thank God that I'm
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:50.180]  aware.
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:55.220]  But I also want to thank you because you vote me up to a lot of things that have gone on.
[02:00:55.220 --> 02:01:00.740]  Just in my short lifetime, I'm 41 years old in Southern Michigan, and what I've seen,
[02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:05.340]  and I'm going to take a little bit different of a take on this whole border issue, is the
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:09.140]  amount of acceptance that the media crams down our throats.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:16.060]  It was back in the 70s, they wanted us to accept abortion.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:20.780]  How many presidential speeches did Obama do where we had to accept Islam, where they
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:21.940]  want to kill Christians?
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:24.020]  That's what they're calling us to do.
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:26.700]  And now it's let's kill babies after they're born.
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:32.380]  Well, yeah, it's go back to the abortion issue, and my whole thing is, why has the
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:35.900]  church become so weak?
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:36.900]  And I've been trying to...
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:37.900]  I'll tell you why, brother.
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:38.900]  We've had it so good.
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:40.500]  Freedom created so much wealth.
[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:41.500]  People are lazy.
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:42.500]  And I'm not calling for everybody to be killed.
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:43.500]  It's the opposite.
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:49.380]  But what if people start killing pro-post-birth abortion politicians and calling it a post-birth
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:50.380]  abortion?
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:53.900]  Say that again, I'm sorry.
[02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:58.140]  What's going to happen if people start killing these pro-post-birth abortion politicians?
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.540]  These politicians that support killing babies after they're born, what's going to happen
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:04.820]  when somebody goes and kills them and says, hey, this is just a post-birth abortion?
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:05.820]  You're absolutely right.
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:09.060]  You know, I was talking to my brother-in-law, Misha, about where can we attend?
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:13.060]  Where can we find a pastor that's going to stand, you know, if most of this country claims
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:16.140]  that they're Christians, and then, you know, and the globalists want to infiltrate this
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:20.860]  country with Islam to destroy us, everything that they've done through the media and through
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.900]  television is to destroy us.
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:23.900]  Exactly.
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:28.700]  Everything Hollywood does is to put you in a false reality and then sap your essence and
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:31.060]  make you weak and make you go along.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:36.420]  And then, by successive approximation, people are so scared of some liberal group boycotting
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:40.540]  them, we all roll over, and then it's more and more and more until now, we let convicted
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:46.020]  pedophiles have access to elementary school students all over the United States and Europe
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:50.540]  to teach them about sex and parents let them do it to show how open they are.
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:55.780]  We are a white flag society, and running the white flag up must stop now.
[02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:59.060]  In full wars, my friend is not running it up, and that's why we're under attack, but
[02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:00.060]  you know what?
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:04.220]  It's an honor to be under attack, because it's made us even stronger with key people.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:07.700]  We don't have as big an audience as we used to have, but we have an audience of the thinkers
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.140]  now, and we've gone to the next level thanks to you.
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:11.820]  Where do you think all this is going, Josh?
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:15.620]  Well, I want to say two things to that, where I think it's all going as Satan is going to
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:21.820]  continue to try to destroy the human race, which we are the bride of Christ, but I want
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.060]  to go back and touch on something you said.
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:27.260]  Do you think you don't have as big of an audience as you think?
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:31.580]  I say your listeners are finding more secretive ways to hear you without exposing it to the
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.900]  globalist so that they can't shut you down.
[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:37.340]  Well, brother, brother, brother, brother, I know that word of mouth were bigger than
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:40.660]  ever, and I know that in a way we are stronger than ever, but I'm going to be honest.
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:45.060]  I get mobbed everywhere I go saying, why can't I hear you anymore?
[02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:46.820]  I wish you were still on air.
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:49.300]  They don't see me on YouTube or a hundred other platforms anymore.
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:53.580]  And then they think, oh, Alex Jones is off air because the media says, yes, we have more
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:58.380]  listeners than ever and viewers at Info Wars, but it's still not as big as it was.
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:02.780]  And people literally everywhere I go, aren't, I guess, as dialed in as you, they're not
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:03.780]  dumb.
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:04.780]  They're just not conscious.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:06.140]  So they don't know that we're still on air.
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:09.820]  That's why you've got to tell people info wars.com forward slash show.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:13.180]  You have to reach out and tell folks about the local AM and FM stations.
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:17.060]  And I know you're doing it, but folks, when something's forbidden, people really want
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:18.060]  to hear it.
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.900]  But if they don't know it's forbidden, they won't tune in.
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:20.900]  Does that make sense?
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.300]  It makes perfect sense, but I want to let you know that me, my father, Bruce, my brother
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:28.540]  in law, Misha, we are pounding the pavement, getting people to listen to you so that they
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:32.660]  can, you know, going back to the vaccination thing, spreading the word, you know, vaccinations.
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:36.900]  I've got personal experience where vaccination caused permanent brain damage, permanent nerve
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:37.900]  stay there.
[02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:38.900]  Stay there.
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:39.900]  Stay there.
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:40.900]  Absolutely.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:43.860]  I've got like five members of my family who's got their feet went numb for a while.
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:44.860]  One of them couldn't breathe.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:45.860]  Let me put in the hospital.
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:46.860]  I want to hear your story.
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:47.860]  We come back.
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:51.140]  We'll stay with us, everybody, we'll wrap back at 60 SecondsNewsWars.com.
[02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:56.260]  It's two-way air, we'll figure it out.
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:58.380]  InfowarsStore.com is how you support us.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:01.340]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:08.260]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:09.260]  city.
[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:12.940]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:14.660]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:19.660]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:28.380]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:31.300]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:34.660]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:39.060]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:41.020]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:46.180]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:47.180]  house.
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:51.820]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:52.820]  Have clean air.
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:06:22.140]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:31.740]  We're back live.
[02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:33.220]  We're taking your vaccine horror stories.
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:34.900]  We're talking about the borders being open.
[02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:39.340]  The government admitting it's the illegals spreading all these drug-resistant diseases.
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:40.340]  It's incredible.
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:42.340]  Where is it all going?
[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:46.540]  Josh in Michigan, tell folks you said that you had a problem with the vaccine you took.
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:47.540]  No, no, no.
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.260]  It wasn't a vaccine that I took.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:55.940]  It was a family member very close to me that the school systems forced you to take a number
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:07:01.380]  of vaccines and when you take them, you're then allowed to go to school.
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:03.700]  But if you don't, you've got to jump through a bunch of red hoops.
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:07.460]  So the gentleman elected to let his daughter take the vaccination.
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:13.860]  She instantly had brain damage and now she can kind of operate in an independent way.
[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:16.340]  She's about 19 years old now.
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:19.660]  This has happened about a decade ago, but she has to be fed through it too because she
[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:24.580]  has no, she has permanent nerve damage in her digestive system to where she can't follow
[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:25.580]  food.
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:31.900]  Sir, sir, literally, this is why I don't shy away from vaccine news or abortion news,
[02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:37.740]  but I get so mad when I'm researching it that then I do stuff like, you know, punch a hole
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:40.100]  through a door and break my hand.
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:44.140]  Because at a biological, physical level as a male, I'm not doing, you know, physical
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:47.980]  level, you're just supposed to go after who's ever doing this, but we can't do that in this
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:50.780]  modern system because the public isn't ready for that type of leadership, so it's going
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:52.420]  to do an information war.
[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:56.140]  And that's how people should use information violently and aggressively getting it out however
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:57.140]  you can.
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:00.060]  This is some passive apologetic way.
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:07.860]  I remember 12 years ago, 13 years ago, they were doing Gardasil test in Texas for whatever
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:11.340]  reason they tricked Rick Perry, who I don't think is a bad guy overall compared to like
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.340]  an Obama.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:14.980]  There are some folks that know him well, he's actually a pretty good guy who comes to guns
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:21.020]  and private property, but he believes in the system so much, and he believes in doctors,
[02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:27.900]  he doesn't believe that anything above it could do wrong.
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:34.100]  They couldn't get George W to make a national emergency declaration because they can do
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:38.380]  that to make a vaccine mandatory, and by mandatory they just mean it's recommended by the health
[02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:39.380]  departments.
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:42.500]  That way it gets around testing and safety studies.
[02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:45.340]  We have bills introduced in Texas to make vaccines have safety studies.
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:50.260]  If you have folks who didn't know they didn't have safety studies, they have liability protection.
[02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:55.100]  And so Perry allowed them, it was Merck was the company, to do studies in Texas.
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:09:00.740]  Well, I started getting calls from people's 11-year-old girls that were in the studies
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:06.300]  who had autoimmune diseases, got red spots all over them, got paralyzed, and then when
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:11.460]  the drug came out, it said it was experimental, said it could give you Guillain berets or narcolepsy
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:17.300]  or could sterilize you, all sorts of polyps coming out and little girls ovaries, and along
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.220]  these girls had to have hysterectomies, you name it.
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:27.860]  And so Japan stopped it, India stopped it, but Perry declaring a health emergency got
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:28.940]  a state to do it.
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:31.100]  You could have the president or a state governor do it.
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:33.420]  So that became a mandated vaccine nationwide.
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:37.340]  Now they pulled it back because it killed and hurt so many girls, but exactly.
[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:41.180]  Why would Merck want to do that with something they knew was going to kill people?
[02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:43.980]  It's a test to see what they can get away with.
[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:45.700]  Let me show you this right here.
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:49.780]  This is the Merck insert for the measles, mumps, rubella shot that's currently being
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:50.780]  given.
[02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:51.780]  Not the fake fact sheet.
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:54.780]  They'll always say, oh, go to the pharmacy, get a fact sheet.
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:05.060]  This is the Merck actual measles, mumps, and rubella document, zoom in on that baby.
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:08.360]  It says it can give you type one diabetes.
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:09.860]  It says it can kill you.
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:13.700]  It says it can sterilize you, give you narcolepsy, give you neurological disorders, can kill
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.700]  you.
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:16.420]  It can have cancer viruses in it.
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:20.020]  Anyone can go to a Walgreens or a CVS or a Walmart and say, hey, I'm thinking about
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:21.260]  taking the MMR.
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:25.340]  I want the insert by law.
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:26.820]  They have to give it to you.
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:31.340]  Every ampule that has the vaccine in it comes with these.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:34.140]  Now, let me go further, and I'm going to go back to you, sir.
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:35.140]  Put them on hold.
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:36.140]  This is too important.
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:41.140]  We had a woman working here, I'm giving her private information, I'm saying her name,
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:54.220]  who went to Vietnam about two years ago, and she went to Vietnam, and they told her, you've
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.620]  got to take all these vaccines.
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:04.820]  One of the vaccines almost killed her, hospitalized her, and when she came in two weeks later wearing
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:08.860]  a mask, they told her your immune system is gone for the next few months.
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:13.420]  She got to wear a mask now, and they said she can never take another vaccine again.
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:17.020]  It'll kill her because she had an autoimmune response.
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:21.060]  Like, I got stung by bees my whole childhood, thought kids that got stung by them were wimps.
[02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:29.260]  We used to fight waspin and yellow jackets with ping pong paddles inside underneath people's
[02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:31.300]  houses and in the bushes.
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:32.860]  That's how crazy I was as a kid.
[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:36.900]  Well, one time I was digging in the garden, and about 30 Africanized bees came out of
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:37.900]  a tree.
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:41.340]  My parents had paid me when I was in college to dig up this, they had four acres and till
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:43.660]  this area as they could plant stuff, a big garden.
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:45.060]  I got hit like a movie.
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:51.380]  I run in their house like a cartoon with a black swarm of bees around me, and I get
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:56.940]  in there, and I have like 12 stingers in my head, maybe 15, swell up, almost die.
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:12:01.380]  Again, the first 20 times I got stung never happened.
[02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:07.860]  Now, I stepped on a bee in my backyard two years ago.
[02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:13.380]  All of a sudden, two minutes later, I got swell up, started getting red, guzzled Benadryl,
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:16.180]  put begging powder on it, and didn't have the full response.
[02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:18.020]  Now, what do you think happens to your baby?
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:20.020]  I'm going to just keep public service announcing this.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:22.220]  I know I said this first hour and last hour.
[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:24.380]  How are you not supposed to, folks?
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:26.100]  It's the same thing.
[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:29.260]  Why do you think it's the third round that little boys who don't have a strong of blood
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:30.900]  brain barrier as little girls?
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:34.860]  Any doctor will tell you little girls are twice as tough as little boys, not in a fist
[02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:35.860]  fight.
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:39.860]  Women can handle more gunshot wounds, more starvation, women, because they got to have
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:40.860]  babies, folks.
[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:43.260]  They got to be tough.
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:49.780]  Women have twice as strong of blood brain barrier, you understand?
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:52.660]  That's why women don't get autism as much.
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:54.620]  It's 90% autism of little boys.
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:57.140]  It goes right into their brains.
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:02.300]  Any high-performance mammal has a thinner blood brain barrier and a higher metabolism.
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.740]  Black people, and it's true.
[02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:07.580]  We're all humans, but on average, black people are more athletic, and they have even a thinner
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:08.820]  blood brain barrier.
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:12.860]  All the studies show, aluminum dioxide, worse for black people than anybody else.
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:15.380]  Fluoride, worse for black people than anybody else.
[02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:19.260]  Look it up, especially black males.
[02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:20.260]  Cannot take it.
[02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:22.660]  Who's the next group can't take it?
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.660]  White males.
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:24.940]  And it goes down the line from there.
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:29.260]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality of what's going on.
[02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:34.820]  This is the science, not the pseudoscience, the reality.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:43.220]  So you remember that the baby has gotten 45 shots by 18 months, and at 18 months they
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:46.820]  give that baby not six or seven or eight shots.
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:52.500]  They give them up to 10 shots at once, and that's when the little boy has the convulsion,
[02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:55.860]  and that's when the little boy dies.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:56.860]  There's a study.
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:57.860]  Feds.
[02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:00.620]  Black suffer most from fluoride.
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:01.620]  Fluoride anyways.
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:02.620]  Harvard study.
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:07.940]  Let me tell you, fluoride will hurt anybody, drinks it.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:14.460]  But if you are from Africa, you better stay real far away.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:18.180]  Some studies show twice as bad, but that's studying women and men.
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:24.620]  The studies in men, four times worse for a black male to ingest fluoride.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:26.060]  Four times worse.
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:27.180]  Four times.
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:28.180]  Four times.
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:29.180]  Four times worse.
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:32.540]  You're not going to hear that out of your black leaders, though, because they want you
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:33.540]  dead in the hammer.
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:37.820]  They're hired to kill your ass, all the black supremacist idiots.
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:39.980]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh in Michigan.
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:40.980]  Finish your point.
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:41.980]  I'm sorry for running over.
[02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:42.980]  You go ahead.
[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:46.700]  No, no, you're fine, but I think that a lot of what's going on right now is basically
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:51.380]  a God versus Satan spiritual level of war, where even when you're talking about the vaccination
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:57.140]  where more boys are susceptible, well, if we're all made in God's image and Jesus came
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:01.340]  to earth as a man, wouldn't it be, it's a simple definition of like Satan's trying to
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:03.340]  destroy men.
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:05.380]  If you're taken over, you wipe out the man.
[02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:06.380]  That's 101.
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:07.380]  Exactly.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:12.500]  And that's with shocking to me, going back to my reference of why the churches are kind
[02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:18.100]  of weak on all these points where media and globalism is forcing all these, you know, with
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:22.060]  this country was founded on conservative values and then the 10 commandments.
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:23.660]  That's what I was brought up and taught.
[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:26.980]  And then when you look at the laws, they'll shout about murder.
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:27.980]  Okay.
[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:28.980]  Murder is against the law.
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:29.980]  It makes perfect sense to me.
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:32.980]  But all they've done is tell us to accept, accept, accept.
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:36.380]  And it's like, well, when the state kills a newborn baby, it's not murder because we
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:37.380]  didn't count it as alive.
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:41.620]  But if you want to keep the baby, we call it the suscetate, we'll wave a wand and we
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:42.620]  do.
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:43.620]  God bless you.
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:44.620]  Great points, Josh.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:45.620]  All right.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:46.620]  I promise I'm going quicker.
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:50.620]  When we come back, Laura, Tom, Leonard, Jared, Paul, Joe, Jeff, everybody, your calls are
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:51.620]  straight ahead.

[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:56.180]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.180 --> 02:17:00.100]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:01.660]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:04.620]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:07.900]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:10.140]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:11.460]  I can help you too.

[02:17:53.940 --> 02:18:00.060]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall
[02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:02.060]  so they'd have it during the winter.

[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:19.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:26.100]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:28.380]  and do nothing.
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:32.740]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:36.980]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:37.980]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:37.980 --> 02:20:41.500]  I want to be clear to infinity.
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:44.860]  I want to be 1 trillion percent clear and beyond.
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:50.060]  When I got calls 20 years ago to be in major movies with major roles, I thought it was
[02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:51.060]  pretty cool.
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:54.900]  But I never worship Hollywood.
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:58.500]  Then I went out to Hollywood and I found out that Hollywood was trying to co-op me.
[02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:02.580]  They were point blank about it, to join their operation.
[02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:03.580]  I said no.
[02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:07.740]  And I said no to all the other offers, but I want to explain something.
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:13.140]  Where I'm at now, it's not just it was easy to turn down the offers like it was 15 years
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:15.660]  ago, 18 years ago.
[02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:20.980]  You couldn't put guns to my head or even my family because their souls are going to
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:23.900]  be free and make me serve this system.
[02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:28.580]  It's not like, oh, we're champions for saying no to the new world order or we're good guys.
[02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:30.580]  We're just not crazy.
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:32.060]  You think I want to spend eternity?
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:33.700]  By the way, our souls are eternal.
[02:21:33.700 --> 02:21:34.700]  It's been proven.
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:35.700]  The globalists all know it.
[02:21:35.700 --> 02:21:38.820]  They want us chained up with their evil asses forever.
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:39.820]  Their control freaks.
[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:41.900]  I do not want to be with these people.
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:42.900]  So it's like swim.
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:44.380]  You ever swam down like 50 feet free diving?
[02:21:44.380 --> 02:21:45.380]  I've done it.
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:47.460]  Some folks go 1,000 feet free diving.
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:49.220]  You think you're tough going to 50.
[02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:50.660]  Your lungs compress at about 50.
[02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:51.660]  That's why it gets easier down there.
[02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:56.140]  You can get deep, all of a sudden it puts pressure on your blood.
[02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:58.740]  The oxygen is more buoyant, more bioavailable.
[02:21:58.740 --> 02:21:59.740]  It's really incredible.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:03.460]  You just got to remind yourself, I've been down here about a minute and a half and I'm
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:04.460]  feeling good.
[02:22:04.460 --> 02:22:05.460]  I got to go back up.
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:08.940]  As soon as you start going back up, though, you can panic because the blood isn't as buoyant
[02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:09.940]  anymore.
[02:22:09.940 --> 02:22:15.740]  In that last 30, 40 feet, your brain is like, woo, I'm dying here, baby.
[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:21.620]  But the point here is the feeling I get, getting away from Hollywood, saying no to the threats,
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:26.300]  saying no to them, threatening to even kill me, is like going for air.
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:29.580]  It's not like I'm a champion and saying no to their payoffs and it's hard.
[02:22:29.580 --> 02:22:31.780]  It's like clawing for air, man.
[02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:38.300]  It's like get me to God, get me away from them, get me to God, but see I can't get air
[02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:42.300]  until I bust the surface and it's like, oh, Jesus, thank you.
[02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:43.740]  You understand that, folks?
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:47.260]  We're not not with the New World Order because we're goody two shoes.
[02:22:47.260 --> 02:22:48.580]  I'm a sinner.
[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:51.380]  I'm a killer.
[02:22:51.380 --> 02:22:56.500]  I want to shove ice picks through my enemies' eyeballs, but I love Jesus and I love children
[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:58.860]  and I'm not with Satan.
[02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:00.180]  You understand that?
[02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:01.820]  And I just want to get that across to everybody.
[02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:03.780]  Get your soul right, folks.
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:05.860]  Get your soul right.
[02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:10.140]  They're coming after Christians because we are the real deal, not the fake ones.
[02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:13.540]  That's how they come after Christians is putting all these fake ones out, but people that really
[02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:15.820]  love God.
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:16.940]  So you feel like you're drowning.
[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:17.980]  You feel like you can't get air.
[02:23:17.980 --> 02:23:19.140]  You feel like you're suffocated.
[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:20.500]  You're depressed.
[02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:23.060]  Get on your knees and ask Christ to come into you and defend you.
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:24.420]  You won't have any more fear.
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:30.340]  The only fear you'll have is separation from Christ and then as long as you're doing good
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:33.700]  to stand up for what's right and fighting evil, you're not going to have that judgmental
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:36.100]  thing on your shoulder all day telling you how bad you are.
[02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:37.300]  That's the devil.
[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:39.380]  The devil's the accuser.
[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:40.780]  You submit to God.
[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:42.540]  The past is going to be clear.
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:45.140]  The question is, are you going to follow those directives?
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:51.300]  All I get is love from God, despite how bad I am, which makes me ashamed of how good God
[02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:52.300]  is.
[02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:54.820]  But see, God made us and knows us better than we do.
[02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:58.180]  But just get right, folks, and I know most of you already have, and I'm not up here on
[02:23:58.180 --> 02:23:59.900]  some damn high horse.
[02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:02.540]  I have the knowledge of good and evil, just like Adam did.
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:04.900]  I'm just telling you, man, God's the answer.
[02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:05.900]  Get with God.
[02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:06.900]  All right.
[02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:08.900]  I said I'd go to your calls and I'm ranting.
[02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:09.900]  Woo!
[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:10.980]  Laura in Texas.
[02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:11.980]  You're on the air.
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:12.980]  Welcome.
[02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:13.980]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:15.300]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:16.300]  Welcome.
[02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:17.300]  Hi.
[02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:18.300]  My name is Laura.
[02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:20.420]  I live in Pearland, Texas.
[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:22.340]  I have been here for two years.
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:24.260]  I came from Los Angeles, California.
[02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:27.180]  I live there 49 years of my life.
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:31.260]  And I was calling to talk to you about the impact of illegal immigration on kind of on
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:32.260]  my life.
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:33.260]  Yes.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:35.540]  Tell us what's been like for you.
[02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:40.340]  Well, it was, it was pretty hardcore.
[02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:46.100]  And I have to tell you that President Trump is, he's 150% right.
[02:24:46.100 --> 02:24:49.820]  Let me tell you, the worst of the worst are coming.
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:54.900]  And I spent the majority of my life growing up amongst these people.
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:56.900]  And I'm not saying all of them, but far...
[02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:00.460]  No, but America's wide open and weak now, so we're being exploited by the same groups
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:02.460]  that have exploited Mexico.
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.460]  You're exactly right.
[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:04.460]  And that's what it is.
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:07.980]  It's the people who are supporting illegal immigration are the ones who profit off of
[02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:08.980]  it.
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:09.980]  You're right.
[02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:13.780]  They put up the sogs and show sogs have taken over.
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:14.780]  That's right.
[02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:19.620]  And one of my pet peeves about illegal immigration is, I always want to bring this up.
[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:22.740]  These people come here for a better way of life because they're fleeing these countries
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:25.900]  that are, you know, poverty stricken and cartel ridden.
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:29.220]  Well, why do they come to our country, live here for two, three years, and then they go
[02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:31.740]  back to those countries on two and three week vacations?
[02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:33.940]  This is what I want to know.
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:36.980]  If it's so hard for them to live in their countries, then why do they come here and
[02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:38.300]  then they go back on vacation?
[02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:40.180]  I've seen it time and time again.
[02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:43.220]  And again, we're not building up these countries.
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:45.060]  We're being brought down, which is the globalist plan.
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:46.540]  We're not helping these people.
[02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:47.540]  It's designed to.
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:48.940]  I mean, they admit it.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:52.620]  What do you make about the disease coming in and then citizens get blamed for the disease,
[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:55.380]  even though it's admitted that it's the government, if we're going to let these people in, we might
[02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:57.040]  as well treat them and take care of them.
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.100]  But to bring them in and let them spread disease, that is meant to bankrupt the country.
[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:06.380]  And I'm outraged because I can totally relate to your conversation with the gentleman before
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:07.780]  regarding vaccinations.
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:10.820]  My 32 year old child was vaccine injured.
[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:14.620]  He was vaccine injured at age seven and he suffered from severe Tourette syndrome.
[02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:22.780]  This is during the epidemic of the growing, you know, ADD, ADHD, OCD Tourette syndrome.
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:24.700]  Let me tell you, I was part of it.
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:28.900]  And I am outraged that these people, how can they have open borders and have these people
[02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:29.900]  coming through?
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:34.540]  And then they demand that we are the ones I know so many parents, so many parents who
[02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:38.900]  had perfectly behaved boys, and then whatever they're adding to these vaccines, and they
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:43.620]  test them, there's hundreds of things in them, is causing, you'll get a brand new, like
[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:49.100]  Trump said earlier tweets, your kid gets the shot and now the behavior is totally different.
[02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:56.900]  Aluminum, formaldehyde, aborted fetal parts, thimerosal, hello, the most deadly things
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:26:58.420]  on earth known to man.
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:27:01.740]  And we put those in our children, believe me, I didn't know before.
[02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:02.980]  Let me tell you another thing I'm going to tell you.
[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:06.100]  I know a lot about the human immune system, I'm HIV positive.
[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:08.700]  I know a lot about it, I've done a lot of research about this.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:13.900]  Then my kid gets vaccine injured, I had no idea, and doctors are saying we don't know
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:18.060]  what it is, it's not vaccines, bull, bull, it is the vaccines.
[02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:19.060]  It is.
[02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:22.420]  Well, they spread HIV to begin with in the vaccines, that's been declassified, and they
[02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:23.420]  call it conspiracy theory.
[02:27:23.420 --> 02:27:24.420]  I think everybody's dumb.
[02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:28.380]  Ma'am, they sterilized people in Africa and Latin America and Asia and declassified it
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:29.380]  in the 90s.
[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:33.500]  The U.N. would add a hormone that's only released in women in second trimester.
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:37.380]  Well, the body would then, in the tetanus shot, see that hormone and cause an abortion
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:43.500]  each time, and also autoimmune problems in the uterus and ovaries.
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:47.340]  And so absolutely, when they add, because they grow a lot of these vaccines on fetal
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:52.340]  tissue, when they put it in there with a bacteria or a virus that your body has a response,
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:55.980]  again, I keep saying it every second because it's so key, your body then starts having
[02:27:55.980 --> 02:27:58.260]  an autoimmune response to fetal DNA.
[02:27:58.260 --> 02:28:03.700]  Well, a lot of that same DNA is in you, and then that's how you get an autoimmune disorder.
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:04.700]  Right.
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:06.820]  Our body's rejected.
[02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:07.820]  It rejects it.
[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:08.820]  Absolutely.
[02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:13.460]  Listen, my grandmother died at 93 years old, almost 93.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:19.300]  She never had an allergy until she was like 70 years old, and it was all the vaccines
[02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:20.300]  and all the crap.
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:22.460]  And everybody I know has allergies now.
[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:27.020]  I was up in D.C. We had a D.C. cop hired as our security, other people.
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:29.420]  He said everybody he knows is sick.
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:30.940]  We were going to meet with some State Department people.
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:33.340]  The head lady was sick with allergies that day.
[02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:34.900]  The military's all sick.
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:35.900]  We're getting hit.
[02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:37.020]  We're getting hit hard.
[02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:38.500]  Don't lie to yourselves about this.
[02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:40.540]  And it's the shadow government doing it.
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:42.660]  That's why they're so pissed that Trump might get control.
[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:47.220]  But I've got callers saying third-dimensional chess, why Trump's flip-flopping on this.
[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:50.140]  We'll take those calls when we come back with Jeff and others.
[02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:51.140]  Thank you, Lauren.
[02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:52.140]  God bless you.

[02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:09.900]  my life.

[02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:04.860]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.860 --> 02:30:05.860]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:10.820]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:16.140]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.

[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:24.500]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:29.500]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:36.700]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:32:49.740 --> 02:33:19.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:32.860]  It's 2 a.m., let me figure it out.
[02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:36.140]  You know, people ask me, how do you handle getting attacked by mainstream media, me and
[02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:37.140]  a lot about.
[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:42.300]  And I always say, don't feel sorry for me.
[02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:44.260]  Be involved and fight back.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:46.740]  These are criminals we're dealing with.
[02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:54.140]  I mean, I see articles all the time that are literally 99% not true.
[02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:57.100]  They had one in the New York Observer that I didn't even read all of it and I was just
[02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:59.140]  totally made up.
[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:04.780]  They just randomly go find any leftist in Austin just to make up any story they want.
[02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:09.060]  It was an article in BuzzFeed, like last year it said, Alex Jones was once walking down
[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:13.540]  the hallway at a movie theater and he told one of the servers at Alamo Draft House he
[02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:16.820]  doesn't believe any of it and it's a fake.
[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:17.820]  What?
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:20.980]  I don't believe in America, that's why I'm helping relaunch it.
[02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:25.220]  I don't believe in pro-life, that's why I go out and protest for children.
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:26.820]  Of course I believe what I'm doing.
[02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:29.820]  It's like saying Trump didn't want to win the presidency, BS.
[02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:36.300]  I've had many conversations with the president and all he says is let's keep fighting, we're
[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:39.580]  going to win Alex, we're going to restore the country and save the planet.
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:43.100]  Remember, Trump said, I don't care about a Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:34:43.100 --> 02:34:46.020]  I want planetary victory.
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:50.620]  Now, one caller says, well, Trump went from saying vaccines are dangerous, there's too
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:54.140]  many of them, they're hurting kids, autism is way up, it's saying take your measles shot
[02:34:54.140 --> 02:35:00.100]  and we're going to go to Patty who's a nurse, Jeff says it's 3D chess and you know I used
[02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:05.660]  to hear that and I really believe that but on some cases I've actually had conversations
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:09.660]  with people, I'll just leave it at that, I'm not going to say the president, but people
[02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:16.380]  that talk to the president, NRA board members, I'll leave it at that, where Trump said listen,
[02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:21.300]  let me just tell Pelosi and all of them, sure, whatever you want, we'll look at doing it
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:26.220]  to get them to say we want a total ban on guns and then Pelosi and Schumer, two weeks
[02:35:26.220 --> 02:35:31.340]  later at the meeting, I'd already been told that it was coming, I mean I was let in on
[02:35:31.340 --> 02:35:39.620]  this just so I wouldn't go haywire and Trump goes, oh, we'll look at everything.
[02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:44.900]  And they said we want to ban all guns basically and then they would look like fools, I get
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:50.140]  that Trump does that but the measles vaccine doesn't protect you from the measles almost
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:55.500]  all the time, the insert admits it, they have to tell you this, it's like the HPV shot says
[02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:59.660]  it protects girls against human papillomavirus in their cervix that only kills like 3,000
[02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:04.060]  people a year, which is super rare cancer compared to 340 million people and then that's
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:13.460]  run down people that usually have HIV, AIDS and then you know a common cold can kill you
[02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:18.580]  and so I just don't like to legitimize this stuff at all and I understand the president
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:22.020]  wants to sound reasonable but we'll go to Patty and Wyoming but first Jeff in Oregon,
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:23.980]  what do you think's really going on here Jeff?
[02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:24.980]  Hey Alex.
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:25.980]  Hi.
[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:32.460]  Too much is going on, thank you for your show, thank you for your dedication, well on the
[02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:36.580]  vaccine thing, I think it's a bit crazy that people think that we're against vaccination,
[02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:39.380]  we're not, we're against what they're putting in it.
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:43.020]  Exactly, we're against their liability protection, we're against all the additives, we're against
[02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:45.220]  the insert says it can kill you, exactly.
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:49.260]  Yeah, and if you're gonna say, and like you said, like you hit on a lot of points all
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:54.020]  the time, well that's why I listened to you but like you said, if your child's vaccinated
[02:36:54.020 --> 02:36:57.380]  why are you worried about it, doesn't your vaccination work, don't you have faith in
[02:36:57.380 --> 02:36:59.380]  it?
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:03.660]  Let me ask you this Jeff, why do you think, I'm sure you saw this, 2020 back when it was
[02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:10.060]  still, I mean mainstream media used to tell the truth sometimes, 2020 in 2003 had documents
[02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:15.260]  from 2000 that were leaked to them by the CDC board member of the CDC head saying, oh my
[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:19.260]  god we've brain damaged millions with the vaccines, it's causing autoimmune disorders
[02:37:19.260 --> 02:37:24.500]  and boys mainly, there'll be a rebellion if this, if anybody finds out but I'd never
[02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:28.620]  give this to my grandson, we've gotta cover this up, we've gotta stop it, well guess what,
[02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:30.740]  they covered it up, they didn't stop it.
[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:36.220]  Now that was on ABC News, anybody can pull that up, it's confirmed, there's no debating
[02:37:36.220 --> 02:37:41.260]  it and they go, oh Alex Jones says he's fake news, no I don't, years ago they tricked me
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:46.500]  on two topics, even though I didn't produce the fake Pizza Gate story, there was real
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:50.740]  pedophilia going on in New York and the WikiLeaks, they got us to cover some of what the media
[02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:55.780]  was covering in DC, the media said, oh just say you're sorry for the fact that that place
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:59.820]  was a wrong steer, they never get it, say they're sorry when they're wrong, oh Jones
[02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:04.260]  admits he's fake about Pizza Gate, same thing with the whole Sandy Hook situation and the
[02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:08.260]  men and I said, yeah I think your kids died but this isn't a big topic I cover and I didn't
[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:12.500]  create it, that's when there was blood in the water with the left because to them it's
[02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:17.220]  not about apology, it's about you saying you're bad so they can be the moral high ground and
[02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:19.500]  take your freedom, you understand?
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:20.500]  Absolutely.
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:24.780]  What was your point about Trump and this flip-flopping on vaccines?
[02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:31.180]  Okay, I equate all of that to people thinking that their boat is sinking because it rained
[02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:33.460]  and there's water on the deck.
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:40.980]  Every time that I see people, oh my god Trump did this, I don't know if it's just an over
[02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:45.860]  amount of faith in him but I have been just like sit back and watch, I have not freaked
[02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:51.460]  out about one time, not on anything that he's done, not with the gun grab, nothing, I just
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:55.860]  think that he has an intelligence level and he plays on a different field than us.
[02:38:55.860 --> 02:39:00.020]  I mean look at him, a lot of people say he was given his first 10 million and I like
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:04.860]  to tell people this, you know what, a lot of people win the lottery and they're broke.
[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:06.580]  In two years.
[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:14.420]  In two years and he is done incredible things, he's an incredible man and with today being
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:20.460]  the camera filled society that we are and him being the family man that he is, if there
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:24.380]  were dirt on him being a family man, it would be out.
[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:25.380]  And that to me.
[02:39:25.380 --> 02:39:26.380]  No, I hear what you're saying.
[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:29.380]  You're saying he brings that out now so they can't say, oh look, he's against vaccines
[02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:31.460]  but then he can come back later and expose them.
[02:39:31.460 --> 02:39:33.580]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:38.140]  Patty in Wyoming's a registered nurse wants to talk about vaccines and offering the inserts.
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:39.140]  Go ahead, thanks for calling Patty.
[02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:40.140]  Thanks for holding.
[02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:42.300]  Hey Alex, I love you.
[02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:44.820]  I love your guest host Mike Adams.
[02:39:44.820 --> 02:39:45.820]  Thank you.
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:49.260]  I have four products on auto ship, $200 a month.
[02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:50.260]  Thank you.
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:51.260]  Man, we couldn't do it without you.
[02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:54.420]  You are literally standing against Hillary and George Soros because she's still in control
[02:39:54.420 --> 02:39:56.860]  of the shadow government and that's who's running the attacks on us.
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:39:57.860]  So thank you.
[02:39:57.860 --> 02:39:58.860]  Amen.
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:03.620]  And a sneaky way to introduce people who maybe aren't listeners or aren't awake.
[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:08.980]  What I do is I send a lot of gifts to friends and family from the info war store and then
[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:10.700]  that kind of wakes them up a little bit.
[02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:15.460]  I've actually have two people now that watch you and go to your website regularly because
[02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:16.460]  of gifts that I've sent.
[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:20.020]  So I just want to put that out as a suggestion.
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:22.460]  Patty, that is so beautiful.
[02:40:22.460 --> 02:40:27.060]  You send somebody some turbo force, send somebody some of the protein bars and then say, oh,
[02:40:27.060 --> 02:40:30.620]  by the way, you might want to tune into the forbidden show and actually see what is actually
[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:32.180]  being said versus what you're told.
[02:40:32.180 --> 02:40:33.180]  Yeah.
[02:40:33.180 --> 02:40:37.820]  And you know, when they see the quality of the products, they can't help but go.
[02:40:37.820 --> 02:40:41.220]  And I also encourage them to go, I'm like, here, I'm going to send you this.
[02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:45.540]  I think you might like it, but you know, feel free to go to the store, go to the website.
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:47.020]  There's a lot of great information.
[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:51.740]  He has very informative guest hosts, but you know, like Mike Adams and I buy, I also buy
[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:53.900]  products for Mike as well.
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:40:57.860]  And they have, it has really opened two people that I've sent gifts to.
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:41:00.380]  Now they watch you just about every week.
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:02.500]  Well, every one of you are the only ambassadors we have.
[02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:04.820]  You know, the reason we're still here is God bless you.
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:06.380]  What is your view on the vaccines overall?
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:07.780]  Patty is a registered nurse.
[02:41:07.780 --> 02:41:12.580]  Well, as a registered nurse, I was actually asked to leave a clinic and told that I wasn't
[02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:20.420]  a good fit because I sided with the parents of a toddler who was brought in and encouraged
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:24.060]  them to do their research because they were concerned about the amount of shots that their
[02:41:24.060 --> 02:41:26.420]  baby, their little baby boy had been given.
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:31.420]  And I said, do the research and then another which infuriated management.
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:38.020]  And I said, you are that you are the responsible for your child's health, not the medical establishment.
[02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:43.500]  And if you don't agree with the vaccine schedule, it's your right to ask them to change it or
[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:50.020]  not have the vaccine given at that, you know, at that time in that child development.
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:53.180]  Child's immune system isn't even developed until they're two years old.
[02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:58.620]  Why are we giving immune response vaccines to children who aren't, whose immune systems
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:41:59.620]  aren't even developed?
[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:00.620]  That's right.
[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:01.620]  They get immunity.
[02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:02.620]  Stay there because you're a nurse.
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:06.100]  You know about this, but I've read the science, but imagine they tell us to go do research
[02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:10.500]  on a hotel we're going to stay at, do research on a 401k, do research on a college we're
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:14.700]  going to go to and go look at people's ratings, but oh, Facebook, Twitter, trying to ban people
[02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:17.380]  having ratings or articles about vaccines.
[02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:19.780]  There's no liability to the companies.
[02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:21.100]  They're protected.
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:22.100]  There's no safety studies.
[02:42:22.100 --> 02:42:26.020]  We come back, I want to ask you the rest of the story and how you think parents and others
[02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:27.020]  should respond.
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:31.900]  What an amazing lady, Patty, in Wyoming, a registered nurse telling you what's going
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:32.900]  on.
[02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:33.900]  That's right.
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:34.900]  Vaccines do nothing the first two years anyway.
[02:42:34.900 --> 02:42:36.340]  Think about all that.
[02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:38.900]  This is all known facts.
[02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:42.180]  What you're doing is wrecking these children's immune systems forever.
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:43.180]  Wow.
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:47.660]  The more vaccines we take, the more we see our problems multiplied.
[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:48.660]  What's really going on?
[02:42:48.660 --> 02:42:55.380]  We'll ask Patty Herb you straight ahead.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:57.340]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:57.340 --> 02:42:58.340]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:00.260]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:00.260 --> 02:43:03.980]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're wrecking.
[02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:04.980]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:07.940]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:10.180]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:14.700]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:16.900]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:19.900]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:22.620]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:23.620]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:24.620]  You know what?
[02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:25.620]  I'll take it.
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:26.620]  Hey, I'm going to pause again.
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:31.140]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:32.140]  We're under attack.
[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:33.140]  We need your help.
[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:37.460]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:40.500]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:41.500]  Do you understand?
[02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:42.660]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:44.940]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:50.220]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
[02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:51.220]  Do you understand?
[02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:52.940]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:55.220]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[02:43:55.220 --> 02:43:59.020]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:01.860]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates.
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:06.380]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about
[02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:08.980]  ash and acid rain.
[02:44:08.980 --> 02:44:14.380]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:15.900]  to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:22.420]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:26.420]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:27.780]  in the rainwater.
[02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:33.140]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:39.220]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:44.860]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:50.180]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:57.020]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:57.020 --> 02:45:01.220]  Eating your protein has never been easier with InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[02:46:58.860 --> 02:47:01.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:22.860]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:29.860]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:36.860]  This is the real fight on this planet, with all the mystery around us for the future.
[02:47:36.860 --> 02:47:41.860]  The fight for consciousness, the fight for being, the fight for destiny.
[02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:46.860]  And if I've done anything right, with all my obnoxiousness, it's that I'm awake and
[02:47:46.860 --> 02:47:48.860]  I'm trying to get others to think for themselves.
[02:47:48.860 --> 02:47:52.860]  And like the last caller said, all the great guests we have on are the things we do here.
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:56.860]  We have a very informative guest joining us to get into this synagogue shooting and more,
[02:47:56.860 --> 02:48:00.860]  and how the left is trying to stoke anti-Semitism online.
[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:11.860]  And again, as a scientist, if you pull back, the left allows all the Jews run the world stuff on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:13.860]  And I say let it, it's First Amendment.
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:17.860]  Then the left accuses those of us that aren't anti-Israel of being the anti-Semites.
[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:20.860]  There's a dialectic here.
[02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:24.860]  And so people that say Hitler did a good job are left on YouTube, I'm not.
[02:48:24.860 --> 02:48:25.860]  Why?
[02:48:25.860 --> 02:48:27.860]  Because I'm unifying people.
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:29.860]  I want to unify people.
[02:48:29.860 --> 02:48:32.860]  I genuinely care about everybody.
[02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:36.860]  It doesn't mean you've got a bunch of racist Hispanics or racist blacks that don't like me because of what color I am,
[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:39.860]  that I won't tell them to screw off and get right back on their face.
[02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:40.860]  They're a bunch of idiots.
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:45.860]  But just like black folks shouldn't blame white supremacists that hate them for other white folks.
[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:46.860]  So that's coming up.
[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:48.860]  We'll do this segment more with calls.
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:50.860]  I've got to say this will go bankrupt.
[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:55.860]  I shouldn't sit here and promote the products and say help keep us on there and get the products because that's a byproduct of it.
[02:48:55.860 --> 02:48:57.860]  These are really great products.
[02:48:57.860 --> 02:49:04.860]  And we've got ultimate bone broth formula at 50% off even though we're very close to selling out on this.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:06.860]  We haven't sold out on this in about six months.
[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:09.860]  We're very close to selling out on this new even stronger formula.
[02:49:09.860 --> 02:49:18.860]  We have it in chocolate flavor and it's got a whole bunch of concentrated healthy chicken based bone broth with all of the incredible things that does for your bones,
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:21.860]  your energy, everything, meal replacement.
[02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:27.860]  A little scoop of this in with your whey or whatever for your pre-workout, post-workout, weight loss, you name it.
[02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:28.860]  It's incredible.
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:46.860]  Chicken bone broth powder, protein, multi-collagen complex blend, collagen, chicken collagen, a bunch of key herbs, alfalfa,
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:52.860]  chagi mushroom, bee pollen, turmeric root, and so much more.
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:54.860]  I mean, there's nothing stronger.
[02:49:54.860 --> 02:49:55.860]  Everybody loves bone broth.
[02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:57.860]  Everybody says it's all the rage.
[02:49:57.860 --> 02:50:01.860]  I looked at all the marketing five years ago and I said, what's the fastest growing thing?
[02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:02.860]  And they said bone broths.
[02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:06.860]  We're like one serving of something like this in a glass jar for the same price of this.
[02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:08.860]  So they're like, you know, 30 servings or whatever.
[02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:10.860]  Everybody feels the attributes and everything.
[02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:11.860]  Oh, this is great.
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:14.860]  We just give you the best, strongest concentrate out there.
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:17.860]  You need to get ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:50:17.860 --> 02:50:18.860]  It's amazing.

[02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:28.860]  So Patty's a registered nurse in Wyoming giving her take on vaccines.
[02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:31.860]  We've had nurses on with their public names before.
[02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:34.860]  They've gotten in trouble about how they give the preemie babies the vaccines.
[02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:35.860]  They stopped breathing.
[02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:40.860]  So they've got to have the respirators ready, but the hospital orders that are the other horrors.
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:46.860]  Have you ever seen any autoimmune responses or problems in children that take vaccines?
[02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:47.860]  Oh, yes.
[02:50:47.860 --> 02:50:48.860]  Many times.
[02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:49.860]  Yeah.
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:50.860]  Absolutely.
[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:51.860]  It's horrible.
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:56.860]  And unfortunately, you know, most people trust their medical, the medical establishment
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:50:58.860]  to take care of their children.
[02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:01.860]  And I just encourage, and we all have to do that.
[02:51:01.860 --> 02:51:08.860]  And even though you don't think you're making, maybe making any headway, it even, we don't
[02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:13.860]  know if we, if we plant a seed when it's going to come to fruition.
[02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:15.860]  So we just have to keep planting those seeds.
[02:51:15.860 --> 02:51:17.860]  And I left that clinic and I don't care.
[02:51:17.860 --> 02:51:19.860]  I mean, I wasn't going to be a part of that.
[02:51:19.860 --> 02:51:24.860]  And if they were going to prevent me from helping to educate, encourage parents to protect their
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:26.860]  children, well, I don't, I'm not working there anyway.
[02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:28.860]  I'm not going to work there.
[02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:32.860]  But I think I really want to encourage people to understand that the medical profession is
[02:51:32.860 --> 02:51:33.860]  very indoctrinated.
[02:51:33.860 --> 02:51:38.860]  And they're some of the most closed-minded professionals out there.
[02:51:38.860 --> 02:51:41.860]  They truly believe what they are pushing, most of them.
[02:51:41.860 --> 02:51:46.860]  And you and we and all of us need to protect ourselves and our children.
[02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:50.860]  And if it comes at a personal cost, it costs me my job.
[02:51:50.860 --> 02:51:52.860]  I don't, there are plenty of jobs out there.
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:54.860]  Let me ask you this.
[02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:56.860]  Who would take products that are secret?
[02:51:56.860 --> 02:51:58.860]  Who would take products of liability protection?
[02:51:58.860 --> 02:52:02.860]  Who would take products that don't have any safety studies and who have a long train of
[02:52:02.860 --> 02:52:03.860]  care events behind them?
[02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:07.860]  Again, and now they want us to take more, more, more and have the president to put hundreds
[02:52:07.860 --> 02:52:08.860]  of these things in us.
[02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:09.860]  God bless you, Patty.
[02:52:09.860 --> 02:52:10.860]  Keep it up.
[02:52:10.860 --> 02:52:11.860]  We salute you.
[02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:13.860]  What an amazing lady.
[02:52:13.860 --> 02:52:18.860]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[02:52:18.860 --> 02:52:20.860]  Who would that be?
[02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:22.860]  It'd be Tom and then Leonard.
[02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:26.860]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more.
[02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:28.860]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[02:52:28.860 --> 02:52:29.860]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:29.860 --> 02:52:30.860]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:52:30.860 --> 02:52:32.860]  I just want to thank you for your products.
[02:52:32.860 --> 02:52:37.860]  I have the info ward decals on outside of my cell phone case.
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:40.860]  My truck, sport the shirts, all the equipment.
[02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:43.860]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:44.860]  God bless you, brother.
[02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:48.860]  And I keep, I have three or four info ward bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[02:52:48.860 --> 02:52:52.860]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:53.860]  You're our only hope, brother.
[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:55.860]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[02:52:55.860 --> 02:52:59.860]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:05.860]  And the reason why I called is like I said, I need some anonymity here, but I'm a law
[02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:09.860]  officer in the state of Texas, just south of Fort Worth, so Northeast Texas, I guess
[02:53:09.860 --> 02:53:10.860]  you could say.
[02:53:10.860 --> 02:53:13.860]  And with this border patrol issue, it's always been bad.
[02:53:13.860 --> 02:53:19.860]  There has always been illegals for as long as we've been here.
[02:53:19.860 --> 02:53:27.860]  But since probably, I noticed it about three or four years ago when it got really, really
[02:53:27.860 --> 02:53:28.860]  bad.
[02:53:28.860 --> 02:53:34.860]  There's one neighborhood of where I'm at where I started noticing MS 13 gang signs spray painted
[02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:39.860]  on stop signs or in areas of where I'm at.
[02:53:39.860 --> 02:53:42.860]  And you start seeing the repercussions from that.
[02:53:42.860 --> 02:53:44.180]  You see the violence go up.
[02:53:44.180 --> 02:53:54.860]  The drugs flew into our areas and it went from small town country to war zone.
[02:53:54.860 --> 02:53:57.860]  And I'm not even kidding.
[02:53:57.860 --> 02:54:02.860]  If anybody doesn't believe, like I said, I'm a true blue Texan, God fearing gun totem,
[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:04.860]  that kind of guy.
[02:54:04.860 --> 02:54:06.860]  We need to stand up and say something.
[02:54:06.860 --> 02:54:07.860]  You're one of the few that's doing it.
[02:54:07.860 --> 02:54:09.860]  I'm one of the few that's doing it.
[02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:14.860]  Most people are so comfortable thinking we're Texas, we're red, we're always B. We don't
[02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:15.860]  have this problem.
[02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:17.860]  We're on the border and we're fighting this fight daily.
[02:54:17.860 --> 02:54:23.860]  I see it every day I go to work and I'm telling you people, you need to wake up, look around
[02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:25.860]  where you're at and protect yourselves.
[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:30.860]  However, you have to have your food, have your water and have your guns to defend yourself
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:35.860]  because we need to shut this border down and we need to start taking care of our own.
[02:54:35.860 --> 02:54:38.860]  Well, let me break this down for folks.
[02:54:38.860 --> 02:54:42.860]  The previous record coming into El Paso was 3,000 a day.
[02:54:42.860 --> 02:54:45.860]  They reported a month ago they're getting 15,000 some days.
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:46.860]  There's no beds.
[02:54:46.860 --> 02:54:47.860]  There's no police.
[02:54:47.860 --> 02:54:50.860]  You imagine being one border patrol and having 1,000 people to deal with.
[02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:51.860]  It's impossible.
[02:54:51.860 --> 02:54:53.860]  So people say, well, Trump's not done his job.
[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:55.860]  He tried to get 12 billion.
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:54:57.860]  He got a billion, 300 million.
[02:54:57.860 --> 02:54:58.860]  This is Congress.
[02:54:58.860 --> 02:54:59.860]  This is the Democrats.
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:01.860]  This is an admitted U.N. plan.
[02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:04.860]  And as you said, you go to Mexico or Guatemala.
[02:55:04.860 --> 02:55:05.860]  It's lawless.
[02:55:05.860 --> 02:55:06.860]  People are scared.
[02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:12.860]  Even previously safe areas like Cancun are not safe anymore.
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:14.860]  And so this is coming here.
[02:55:14.860 --> 02:55:20.860]  And when Nancy Pelosi says MS-13 are God's children, I've confirmed in Austin, a blue city,
[02:55:20.860 --> 02:55:23.860]  that they're bringing in smuggled illegals, they're using them.
[02:55:23.860 --> 02:55:26.860]  They're keeping them basically as slaves.
[02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:32.860]  And the Democrats are now using MS-13 and others who can infiltrate back and forth of the border as hitmen.
[02:55:32.860 --> 02:55:35.860]  And I've even been told you better keep your mouth shut or we're going to send MS-13.
[02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:36.860]  We'll go ahead and do it then.
[02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:41.860]  But I'm saying, folks, we are inches from collapsing to a lawless society like Mexico.
[02:55:41.860 --> 02:55:47.860]  And I think that's what you're saying as a police officer who says the problem has always been bad, but now it's exponential.
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:49.860]  Well, that's what I'm saying is.
[02:55:49.860 --> 02:55:52.860]  I love, I'm an American red, white and blue all the way.
[02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:57.860]  But you know, as well as I do, Alex, as a Texan, you have a special pride about you.
[02:55:57.860 --> 02:56:02.860]  And you think the state's all right, even though the Republicans believe we're going to lose the state to blue in within four years?
[02:56:02.860 --> 02:56:03.860]  Of course.
[02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:04.860]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:05.860]  I'm a proud Texan.
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:07.860]  I have family who fought and died at the Alamo.
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:09.860]  My blood runs deep in this state.
[02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:10.860]  And I'll be there.
[02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:13.860]  And isn't it sad to see it falling apart like this?
[02:56:13.860 --> 02:56:15.860]  It kills me.
[02:56:15.860 --> 02:56:22.860]  To see my kids look at their history books and look how just much is left out.
[02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:30.860]  I take my kids over a couple of years to the Alamo, to San Jacinto, to different historical sites in this great state to teach them what the real is.
[02:56:30.860 --> 02:56:33.860]  Did you know the left is announced they're taking control of San Jacinto in the Alamo?
[02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:35.860]  They're going to put leftist crap up.
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:37.860]  It infuriates me.
[02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:43.860]  We've made a trip to the Alamo every year for the last four years almost just because of what may happen.
[02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:45.860]  And this is what I'm talking about.
[02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:49.860]  Oh, they've announced they're going to say Santa Ana, even though he's a dictator and hated, they're going to announce he was a good guy.
[02:56:49.860 --> 02:56:50.860]  Oh, yeah.
[02:56:50.860 --> 02:56:54.860]  Well, tell that to my ancestors who got put on their knees and killed like dogs.
[02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:57.860]  Well, I'll tell you the good news here is everybody knows the media is liars.
[02:56:57.860 --> 02:57:01.860]  And so most folks, whatever the media is saying, they believe the opposite.
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:03.860]  And that's what I'm saying is we're Texans.
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:04.860]  We're proud.
[02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:05.860]  We're Godfair.
[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:07.860]  And we will fight.
[02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:09.860]  I've heard you say this multiple times.
[02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:13.860]  I was at one of your rows a few years ago in front of the Alamo where you were talking about Gunner.
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:15.860]  I don't even remember when that was.
[02:57:15.860 --> 02:57:19.860]  That was the first authorized political speech since the Alamo reopened 50 years ago.
[02:57:19.860 --> 02:57:21.860]  The Land Commissioner did it.
[02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:22.860]  And we we laid it all out.
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:23.860]  That was powerful.
[02:57:23.860 --> 02:57:24.860]  That was special.
[02:57:24.860 --> 02:57:25.860]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:26.860]  God bless.
[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:27.860]  Yeah, it's bad folks.
[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:31.860]  We're the happy hunting ground for MS-13 and drug gangs from Latin America.
[02:57:31.860 --> 02:57:37.860]  They're coming up here and using the illegal alien population to hide in and they're oppressing those people.
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:39.860]  And the Democrats are heavily involved.
[02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:40.860]  They've made their deal.
[02:57:40.860 --> 02:57:41.860]  Well, they're right back.
[02:57:41.860 --> 02:58:10.860]  Stay with us.
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:17.860]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path.
[02:58:17.860 --> 02:58:24.860]  Alpha power can help lose performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:28.860]  Let alpha power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:31.860]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[02:58:31.860 --> 02:58:35.860]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with alpha power.
[02:58:35.860 --> 02:58:45.860]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[02:58:45.860 --> 02:58:47.860]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:58:47.860 --> 02:58:49.860]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:58:49.860 --> 02:58:50.860]  It is.
[02:58:50.860 --> 02:58:54.860]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:58:54.860 --> 02:58:56.860]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:58:56.860 --> 02:58:58.860]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:03.860]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:59:03.860 --> 02:59:05.860]  You've got the children's.
[02:59:05.860 --> 02:59:06.860]  You've got the adults.
[02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:07.860]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:59:07.860 --> 02:59:10.860]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:59:10.860 --> 02:59:14.860]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:15.860]  And I'm sorry.
[02:59:15.860 --> 02:59:16.860]  You want something like this.
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:17.860]  You don't get stuff for free.
[02:59:17.860 --> 02:59:19.860]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:59:19.860 --> 02:59:20.860]  It's so good.
[02:59:20.860 --> 02:59:21.860]  In my view.
[02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:22.860]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:59:22.860 --> 02:59:25.860]  I eat five cants of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:59:25.860 --> 02:59:28.860]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:59:28.860 --> 02:59:36.860]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:59:36.860 --> 02:59:38.860]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[02:59:38.860 --> 02:59:42.860]  But you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:59:42.860 --> 02:59:48.860]  I just can't do it.
[02:59:48.860 --> 03:00:16.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:16.860 --> 03:00:23.860]  John Irving's got some big news on the attempt to create a religious race war in this country coming up.
[03:00:23.860 --> 03:00:26.860]  Taking your phone calls right now in this segment.
[03:00:26.860 --> 03:00:28.860]  We'll get some more of your calls as we get to him.
[03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:30.860]  But this is important information.
[03:00:30.860 --> 03:00:33.860]  He's going to premiere here for you.
[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:35.860]  Right now we've got still loaded calls.
[03:00:35.860 --> 03:00:37.860]  It's hard to get there by all such good callers.
[03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:39.860]  Greg and Dallas, thanks for holding.
[03:00:39.860 --> 03:00:40.860]  I really appreciate you.
[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:45.860]  What is your take on this attempt to break our border in this whole operation?
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:51.860]  Alex, we need to take out the bridges from Guatemala up to Chiapas.
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:54.860]  All those secondary roads down there.
[03:00:54.860 --> 03:01:02.860]  One night Trump sends the B2s, secret missions, just takes out the bridges, takes out the roads.
[03:01:02.860 --> 03:01:09.860]  Well, you know, I'm not for preemptive war, but actually when the UN and others organize to collapse our borders
[03:01:09.860 --> 03:01:14.860]  and to organize these refugee centers and do this, that would be constitutional.
[03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:15.860]  Here's the problem.
[03:01:15.860 --> 03:01:23.860]  You need to cut the UN funding to USAID that's doing it and need to indict the Democrats involved in all this, which Trump's starting to do.
[03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:31.860]  So I really think before we have the B1 bombers or the B2 bombers drop smart bombs on the bridges down there,
[03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:36.860]  I think we should simply cut the hat off the snake and cut the UN funding.
[03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:38.860]  Something Trump says he's getting ready to do.
[03:01:38.860 --> 03:01:41.860]  He says he's pulling out of the UN small arms treaty.
[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:43.860]  No, I agree.
[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:45.860]  I think we should do that.
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:51.860]  And I think, I don't know if he's spying on these traitorous Democrats right now.
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:53.860]  He should be.
[03:01:53.860 --> 03:01:57.860]  I don't know how he catches them in an attempt to and lets these snakes keep operating.
[03:01:57.860 --> 03:01:59.860]  I mean, they're still chewing the hell out of me every day.
[03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:01.860]  I mean, I got them all over my ass.
[03:02:01.860 --> 03:02:02.860]  Yeah.
[03:02:02.860 --> 03:02:09.860]  I don't mind sitting here boiling, you know, in the stew, but it's still, I mean, it'd be nice to get moving here.
[03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:11.860]  Well, if there's evidence against them.
[03:02:11.860 --> 03:02:15.860]  And we ought to have the military grabbing them in the middle of the night, shoving their butts down.
[03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:16.860]  Well, here's the problem.
[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:17.860]  Then we become them.
[03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:18.860]  I think we expose them.
[03:02:18.860 --> 03:02:21.860]  We openly charge them and we do it in the open daylight.
[03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:22.860]  But I appreciate your call.
[03:02:22.860 --> 03:02:24.860]  I understand your frustrations.
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:28.860]  They want to do arrest everybody in the dead of night and all the rest of the crap, the military wouldn't do it.
[03:02:28.860 --> 03:02:33.860]  But just one thing that woke up the military was when they sort of drawn up Liston or Obama to arrest me and others.
[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:34.860]  That all came out.
[03:02:34.860 --> 03:02:38.860]  I mean, they, listen, we're going to win this thing.
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:41.860]  As long as the people just stay focused and stay involved.
[03:02:41.860 --> 03:02:42.860]  Greg, I appreciate your call.
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:46.860]  But, but yeah, I mean, we could definitely, I don't, I don't want to go into this way.
[03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:50.860]  Look, as the neoconsul set Trump up, but constitutionally, it's organizing the collapse down there.
[03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:52.860]  And so we need to stabilize our borders period.
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:54.860]  And that is in our sphere of influence.
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:57.860]  And we've invaded central and South America before over crap like this.
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:59.860]  So we'll see what happens here.
[03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:01.860]  I'll take a lot of calls here.
[03:03:01.860 --> 03:03:04.860]  Who's up next James in California.
[03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:05.860]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:07.860]  Go ahead.
[03:03:07.860 --> 03:03:08.860]  Hey, Alex.
[03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:09.860]  How are you?
[03:03:09.860 --> 03:03:10.860]  I'm good.
[03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:11.860]  Go ahead.
[03:03:11.860 --> 03:03:12.860]  Hey, I don't know.
[03:03:12.860 --> 03:03:13.860]  I just kind of want to challenge you a little bit.
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:15.860]  I've been a long time listener.
[03:03:15.860 --> 03:03:19.860]  Let's start listening to you out when you were on Dr. Stan Monteith's program.
[03:03:19.860 --> 03:03:20.860]  That's fine.
[03:03:20.860 --> 03:03:21.860]  Challenge me.
[03:03:21.860 --> 03:03:22.860]  Go ahead.
[03:03:22.860 --> 03:03:23.860]  Yeah.
[03:03:23.860 --> 03:03:29.860]  Well, your latest product, you know, about don't California my Texas or don't California the U.S.
[03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:31.860]  or whatever that is.
[03:03:31.860 --> 03:03:32.860]  I take offense to it.
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:34.860]  I know there's some patriots out here in California.
[03:03:34.860 --> 03:03:37.860]  Probably you too, because you know what?
[03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:38.860]  We're out here fighting.
[03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:42.860]  You know, we've been out here getting involved with everything that we can.
[03:03:42.860 --> 03:03:47.860]  Well, you know, I say, I say in the video that it's not like a sports team saying we're better than California.
[03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:50.860]  I'm saying don't do to Texas what's been done in California.
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:53.860]  It's to wake people up around the country about what the left does.
[03:03:53.860 --> 03:03:55.860]  I think it's very clear.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:58.860]  The ad I even cut says California has a lot of great people, a great history.
[03:03:58.860 --> 03:04:00.860]  I just don't think that's fair.
[03:04:00.860 --> 03:04:02.860]  Listen, I totally respect you.
[03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:06.860]  I think you're on the wrong end of this thing because you keep talking about unity.
[03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:07.860]  You keep talking.
[03:04:07.860 --> 03:04:10.860]  You just said it like in the last segment, you broke into it.
[03:04:10.860 --> 03:04:12.860]  You broke into it saying, you know, I'm all for unity.
[03:04:12.860 --> 03:04:14.860]  We've got to have unity.
[03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:16.860]  Well, how united are we?
[03:04:16.860 --> 03:04:19.860]  We're just going to toss a state out and just let it.
[03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:23.860]  I think we need to recognize that California is the enemy of territory at this point.
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:30.860]  I don't think they arrest you if you don't say the right pronoun for this imaginary other gender.
[03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:33.860]  I think we need to admit it's occupied territory.
[03:04:33.860 --> 03:04:35.860]  How would you like to know what?
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:38.860]  How about shirts that say save California?
[03:04:38.860 --> 03:04:41.860]  Or is that an insult to say California is up the creek without a paddle?
[03:04:41.860 --> 03:04:43.860]  I just don't know.
[03:04:43.860 --> 03:04:44.860]  I got a guest coming up.
[03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:45.860]  I'm going to pop back to you.
[03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:46.860]  He lives out in California.
[03:04:46.860 --> 03:04:47.860]  Let's get his take on it.
[03:04:47.860 --> 03:04:48.860]  Stay there.
[03:04:48.860 --> 03:04:49.860]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:49.860 --> 03:04:50.860]  Stay there, James.
[03:04:50.860 --> 03:05:00.860]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:21.860 --> 03:05:25.860]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:05:25.860 --> 03:05:29.860]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:36.860]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:05:36.860 --> 03:05:38.860]  This country is in a war.
[03:05:38.860 --> 03:05:43.860]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos,
[03:05:43.860 --> 03:05:49.860]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[03:05:49.860 --> 03:05:50.860]  I'm in your hands.
[03:05:50.860 --> 03:05:51.860]  You're in my hands.
[03:05:51.860 --> 03:05:52.860]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:52.860 --> 03:05:54.860]  Thank you.
[03:05:54.860 --> 03:06:07.860]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:12.860]  All right, John Irvin, smart guy, an author, researcher, podcaster.
[03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:16.860]  We've had him on about the dangers of marijuana, figuring schizophrenia.
[03:06:16.860 --> 03:06:19.860]  Even Joe Rogan's been talking about now.
[03:06:19.860 --> 03:06:21.860]  We've had him on about DMT.
[03:06:21.860 --> 03:06:29.860]  And last time he was on, we talked about the CIA, from the evidence I had, mapping using basically the equivalent of interdimensional astronauts,
[03:06:29.860 --> 03:06:34.860]  believing they were going in with IV drips and mapping these other dimensions.
[03:06:34.860 --> 03:06:42.860]  Well, that came out in mainstream news that major universities are now doing public programs to send in what they call interdimensional cosmonauts,
[03:06:42.860 --> 03:06:44.860]  basically, to map other dimensions.
[03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:46.860]  Does it mean I believe all this?
[03:06:46.860 --> 03:06:48.860]  This is what the establishment's into.
[03:06:48.860 --> 03:06:49.860]  This is what they're up to.
[03:06:49.860 --> 03:06:54.860]  We'll also continue with at least H.B. Scott, Paul, Kevin, and James, and Leonard, and Jaren,
[03:06:54.860 --> 03:06:56.860]  trying to get to all of you before the war room starts.
[03:06:56.860 --> 03:07:02.860]  And then we'll have John Irvin on again soon to get into more of his findings.
[03:07:02.860 --> 03:07:06.860]  But the reason he joins us now is he's a Christian writer and researcher,
[03:07:06.860 --> 03:07:08.860]  and he's going to publish findings on this soon,
[03:07:08.860 --> 03:07:16.860]  bringing into all the meat potatoes of it today, but he has an article, The Terrible Talmud Debunk.
[03:07:16.860 --> 03:07:20.860]  And he has a big paper, April 2019, getting into this.
[03:07:20.860 --> 03:07:25.860]  He's found leftist groups are funding a lot of the anti-Semitism,
[03:07:25.860 --> 03:07:32.860]  and I don't care if the mentally ill Nazis and people that are sorrows funded most of the time,
[03:07:32.860 --> 03:07:37.860]  and ADL funded, media matters funded, and it's come out, Southern Property Law Center funded, especially that group.
[03:07:37.860 --> 03:07:39.860]  I'm not trying to curry favor with you guys.
[03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:40.860]  I get it.
[03:07:40.860 --> 03:07:41.860]  You say somebody's a Jewish agent.
[03:07:41.860 --> 03:07:47.860]  It makes you all high and powerful, and you're the pure people, and you know, it's total crap.
[03:07:47.860 --> 03:07:49.860]  Total mental illness, total crap.
[03:07:49.860 --> 03:07:51.860]  Israel's a diverse country.
[03:07:51.860 --> 03:07:55.860]  It's staged terror attacks, the Levant affair, you know, to do things.
[03:07:55.860 --> 03:07:57.860]  Israel's had bad leaders, good leaders, just like the U.S.
[03:07:57.860 --> 03:08:03.860]  But I'm not anti-Israel, and it's not because I'm getting anything from Israel.
[03:08:03.860 --> 03:08:08.860]  In fact, 90 percent, if you wanted to say, of Jewish organizations that I've found are mainly liberal,
[03:08:08.860 --> 03:08:11.860]  and I've had them attack me, try to get me off the air.
[03:08:11.860 --> 03:08:12.860]  But I don't blame Jews for that.
[03:08:12.860 --> 03:08:14.860]  I blame leftists for that.
[03:08:14.860 --> 03:08:18.860]  But I am one of the most attacked people by Jewish bashers out there.
[03:08:18.860 --> 03:08:19.860]  They say that I'm Jewish.
[03:08:19.860 --> 03:08:23.860]  When I'm not, if I was, I'd be proud of it, and would tell you that.
[03:08:23.860 --> 03:08:25.860]  But it really is a mental illness.
[03:08:25.860 --> 03:08:29.860]  And then I noticed that combat vet who stopped the synagogue shooter, I scared the hell out of him.
[03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:34.860]  The shooter comes in, shoots three people, kills one, shoots four people, wounds three, kills one.
[03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:38.860]  This fellow army veteran charges him down, pens him in his car.
[03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:42.860]  Then a border patrol individual who was off duty found somebody else's gun,
[03:08:42.860 --> 03:08:46.860]  went and apprehended the guy before he could kill more people.
[03:08:46.860 --> 03:08:50.860]  And I just, you know, saw the YouTube comments about, uh-huh, you know, wish they'd have gotten more.
[03:08:50.860 --> 03:08:52.860]  This is just sick.
[03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:55.860]  And I guess you Nazis join Islam.
[03:08:55.860 --> 03:08:59.860]  Notice when I bash radical Islam, the white supremacists come out and attack me.
[03:08:59.860 --> 03:09:08.860]  Because you know, I'm a Jewish agent because I don't like Islam with, what is it, like 1.8 billion people.
[03:09:08.860 --> 03:09:10.860]  It's about to be 3 billion.
[03:09:10.860 --> 03:09:12.860]  So that's the whole background here.
[03:09:12.860 --> 03:09:18.860]  And then AOC won't tweet about dead Christians in Sri Lanka, but she'll tweet about dead Muslims.
[03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:21.860]  I'm not against Muslims in general, but they're protected.
[03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:26.860]  And so, and this fetish about Israel, I barely think about Israel, I'm not involved with Israel.
[03:09:26.860 --> 03:09:31.860]  But then this obsession with it, Yann has done some research into the billionaire
[03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:36.860]  that does all these ads against Trump and leptis groups, and I've confirmed the left is the main pusher.
[03:09:36.860 --> 03:09:39.860]  In fact, we've seen in IP addresses, back when we ran our own comments,
[03:09:39.860 --> 03:09:45.860]  where you'll have leptis groups going back to leptis foundations posing as Nazis and posing as liberals,
[03:09:45.860 --> 03:09:49.860]  all creating a race diatribe just like WikiLeaks shows the Democrats are doing.
[03:09:49.860 --> 03:09:53.860]  So Yann's looked into all this, and some of the new stuff that's coming,
[03:09:53.860 --> 03:10:00.860]  and massive Islamic expansion attacks on churches is now just being dubbed as religious violence.
[03:10:00.860 --> 03:10:04.860]  So Yann at LogosMedia.com and TriviumEducation.com.
[03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:06.860]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:10:06.860 --> 03:10:08.860]  Thanks for having me back, Alex.
[03:10:08.860 --> 03:10:10.860]  So what's the way to quantify and just recap?
[03:10:10.860 --> 03:10:12.860]  Because I agree with your research.
[03:10:12.860 --> 03:10:15.860]  I haven't gotten to the whole article on air or your new stuff is probably published.
[03:10:15.860 --> 03:10:21.860]  I mean, what's this dialectic? What's going on here? Because clearly David Duke is on YouTube.
[03:10:21.860 --> 03:10:28.860]  All these other people that say Hitler did a great job, like Owen Benjamin,
[03:10:28.860 --> 03:10:33.860]  until recently wasn't saying stuff like that. He seems to have gone crazy.
[03:10:33.860 --> 03:10:37.860]  But what is going on here? I mean, what's really happening?
[03:10:37.860 --> 03:10:42.860]  Well, in my opinion, it's a dialectic, and they are trying to...
[03:10:42.860 --> 03:10:45.860]  And I've taken a lot of flak already for exposing this.
[03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:51.860]  I've been doing a series on my show. You just showed one of the images with Lloyd DeYong doing a series.
[03:10:51.860 --> 03:10:58.860]  First, we did a seven-part series exposing Islam, and then people were requesting that we go into Judaism.
[03:10:58.860 --> 03:11:00.860]  So we started investigating that.
[03:11:00.860 --> 03:11:05.860]  The first show was on the Noahide laws, how it supposedly a conspiracy.
[03:11:05.860 --> 03:11:10.860]  We refuted that, and we started just going through the Torah,
[03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:13.860]  and then we began to go into the Talmud.
[03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:20.860]  And so for decades, if not since the 1890s, there's been a number of quotes floating around
[03:11:20.860 --> 03:11:24.860]  that are claimed to be from the Talmud.
[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:26.860]  Let me just give you an example.
[03:11:26.860 --> 03:11:33.860]  Whoever disobeys the rabbis deserves death and will be punished by being foiled and hot, excrement and hell.
[03:11:33.860 --> 03:11:37.860]  And so we started going through the Talmud and fact-checking all of these.
[03:11:37.860 --> 03:11:43.860]  And we were able to debunk just about all of them at this point.
[03:11:43.860 --> 03:11:47.860]  And then, of course, immediately I was called a Jewish shill, a Zionist agent.
[03:11:47.860 --> 03:11:50.860]  I'm a Christian. My family is Danish and Welsh.
[03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:56.860]  I have no ties with Israel, no ties with Mossad, no ties with CIA, any of this stuff.
[03:11:56.860 --> 03:12:02.860]  In fact, I took a lot of flak for coming on your show back in January and was called a shill.
[03:12:02.860 --> 03:12:04.860]  I did not sell out to you. You've paid me nothing.
[03:12:04.860 --> 03:12:09.860]  You simply gave me a platform to reach a wider audience, which I appreciate.
[03:12:09.860 --> 03:12:14.860]  Yeah, they run around like the Thought Police saying who can talk to who, and that's what I'm sick of.
[03:12:14.860 --> 03:12:16.860]  It's all made up.
[03:12:16.860 --> 03:12:18.860]  Yeah, exactly it is.
[03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:23.860]  So we started going through and exposing these Talmud quotes as false.
[03:12:23.860 --> 03:12:34.860]  And we were descended on by clearly orchestrated and organized shills by the many dozens, hundreds who were...
[03:12:34.860 --> 03:12:39.860]  And let's go further. You then lost your live streaming. You got banned, just like we get banned.
[03:12:39.860 --> 03:12:43.860]  And I'm not saying take away David Duke's thing or Owen Benjamin, but Owen Benjamin has said,
[03:12:43.860 --> 03:12:46.860]  Hitler was a great leader in Germany.
[03:12:46.860 --> 03:12:48.860]  Okay, he has a right to say that. I disagree with it.
[03:12:48.860 --> 03:12:50.860]  I'm banned on YouTube.
[03:12:50.860 --> 03:12:57.860]  Well, they shut down my live stream just for coming on your show.
[03:12:57.860 --> 03:13:02.860]  I managed to get it back on after a month and a half, but that impacted me.
[03:13:02.860 --> 03:13:06.860]  In fact, if there's any angels in your audience, please go to Logos Media and support the show,
[03:13:06.860 --> 03:13:09.860]  because we do run on donations and always have.
[03:13:09.860 --> 03:13:11.860]  You've gone through a lot of hell here.
[03:13:11.860 --> 03:13:17.860]  Why do you think leftist anti-Semitism and people have the right to free speech?
[03:13:17.860 --> 03:13:20.860]  Why is that all allowed to operate, but we aren't?
[03:13:20.860 --> 03:13:26.860]  Well, you know, here's the thing is we're starting to think that it's crypto Islamism.
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:28.860]  And, you know, we also look at...
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:31.860]  You can look it up on Wikipedia and the dictionary wherever.
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:34.860]  Baphomet actually means Muhammad.
[03:13:34.860 --> 03:13:37.860]  And we started making all of these connections and the research
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:40.860]  and realizing that there was a bait and switch going on here.
[03:13:40.860 --> 03:13:45.860]  And so, you know, there's the old saying, the enemy is your friend.
[03:13:45.860 --> 03:13:51.860]  And so if they can get the Christians to kill the Jews, who benefits by that?
[03:13:51.860 --> 03:13:58.860]  And, you know, all of the things that we're told are true about the Talmud
[03:13:58.860 --> 03:14:03.860]  and this whole quote-unquote Talmudic conspiracy, we found true in Islam
[03:14:03.860 --> 03:14:06.860]  and we didn't find in the Talmud.
[03:14:06.860 --> 03:14:11.860]  And we were going through the primary citations showing them on screen
[03:14:11.860 --> 03:14:14.860]  and no one would believe it.
[03:14:14.860 --> 03:14:18.860]  And I've lost more friends and more people that I thought were allies
[03:14:18.860 --> 03:14:22.860]  for daring to speak the truth on this than anything I've ever covered
[03:14:22.860 --> 03:14:25.860]  since I started my show almost 11 years ago.
[03:14:25.860 --> 03:14:27.860]  Well, let's talk about that when we come back
[03:14:27.860 --> 03:14:29.860]  because it doesn't mean Israel hasn't done bad things.
[03:14:29.860 --> 03:14:31.860]  It doesn't mean there aren't some bad things out there.
[03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:32.860]  Absolutely right.
[03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:35.860]  And I'm not defending Israel carte blanche either.
[03:14:35.860 --> 03:14:41.860]  What we're focused on is the primary religious documents and texts and what they say.
[03:14:41.860 --> 03:14:43.860]  But I mean, here's the thing.
[03:14:43.860 --> 03:14:48.860]  And we're not criticizing Israel to curry favor with the mentally ill Israel bachelors
[03:14:48.860 --> 03:14:50.860]  that believe whatever bull they're told either.
[03:14:50.860 --> 03:14:56.860]  We're trying to really be truthful here on air to really decide and figure out what's happened.
[03:14:56.860 --> 03:15:00.860]  It doesn't mean we both totally agree either because it depends on which side of the bed I get up.
[03:15:00.860 --> 03:15:02.860]  I'm trying to figure all this out.
[03:15:02.860 --> 03:15:07.860]  All I know is that people bashing Israel are left alone now.
[03:15:07.860 --> 03:15:11.860]  And those of us that are neutral on it or pro-Israel are being censored.
[03:15:11.860 --> 03:15:13.860]  I just want to explain as we come back.
[03:15:13.860 --> 03:15:16.860]  It came out in the WikiLeaks that George Soros wants to get rid of Israel.
[03:15:16.860 --> 03:15:19.860]  The Rothschilds are wanting to broker this big deal.
[03:15:19.860 --> 03:15:21.860]  People say, well, hey, they helped set up Israel.
[03:15:21.860 --> 03:15:22.860]  That's the dialectic.
[03:15:22.860 --> 03:15:25.860]  It was put there to create this explosion.
[03:15:25.860 --> 03:15:27.860]  And then I said, well, look at Netanyahu.
[03:15:27.860 --> 03:15:29.860]  The economists is home of the Rothschilds.
[03:15:29.860 --> 03:15:30.860]  They want him out.
[03:15:30.860 --> 03:15:31.860]  Oh, yeah, right.
[03:15:31.860 --> 03:15:32.860]  Netanyahu's a Rothschild agent.
[03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:33.860]  No, he's not.
[03:15:33.860 --> 03:15:36.860]  I'm not defending Netanyahu, but he's different.
[03:15:36.860 --> 03:15:37.860]  He's a nationalist.
[03:15:37.860 --> 03:15:41.860]  We're going to talk about this with Jan Irvin on the other side.
[03:15:41.860 --> 03:15:42.860]  Lovelace Media.com.
[03:15:42.860 --> 03:15:45.860]  Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:15:45.860 --> 03:15:51.860]  This is real open discussion, not ideology, but figuring out what's really going on.
[03:15:51.860 --> 03:15:54.860]  OK, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[03:15:54.860 --> 03:15:55.860]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:15:55.860 --> 03:15:56.860]  Hey, what you doing?
[03:15:56.860 --> 03:15:57.860]  Mother's Day, remember?
[03:15:57.860 --> 03:15:58.860]  Oh, yeah.

[03:15:59.860 --> 03:16:00.860]  Got to plan a trip to the store.
[03:16:00.860 --> 03:16:02.860]  Then need to save all the receipts in case she wants to return.
[03:16:02.860 --> 03:16:04.860]  You know there's an easier way, right?
[03:16:04.860 --> 03:16:05.860]  I'm guessing you do.

[03:19:56.860 --> 03:20:04.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:04.860 --> 03:20:22.860]  Live uncensored and raw.
[03:20:22.860 --> 03:20:35.860]  All right, Jan Urban is a researcher, author, successful podcaster, and I love how he adds a proviso. I didn't meet with Alex before this, and I'm not on his payroll.
[03:20:35.860 --> 03:20:46.860]  Saying all that only intensifies the schizophrenics out there. I don't care what the Nazis or people think about me. Everything I cover is on the record.
[03:20:46.860 --> 03:20:56.860]  People know what I stand for. Let's just cover the facts here, okay? And I'm not getting on to you, Jan, but I've told people that respond to critics. It just makes it worse.
[03:20:56.860 --> 03:21:03.860]  So just who cares? I only raise things sometimes about critics if, which I know you're doing, if it doesn't make sense.
[03:21:03.860 --> 03:21:14.860]  Like you're saying you went and looked into these supposed Jewish holy books that say Christ is bathing in feces and in hell and all this, and you didn't find it.
[03:21:14.860 --> 03:21:19.860]  Could you find some crazy rabbi a thousand years later in Russia saying something like that? Yes.
[03:21:19.860 --> 03:21:27.860]  But it's being attributed to books that aren't there, and I'm not even defending, you know, Judaism.
[03:21:27.860 --> 03:21:34.860]  I was in D.C. last week, and I had some groups of Orthodox or Hasidic Jews coming up.
[03:21:34.860 --> 03:21:45.860]  And Jimmy Huggs had others on video running up and saying, why don't you like Trump? You know, you're a bad person. And I think we're even part of the same group. And I was saying to the guy, you know, you're not stupid, are you?
[03:21:45.860 --> 03:21:54.860]  You know, I'm boring him to get something done, right? And again, it's like saying, I'm not for Baptist or I'm against him. There's all sorts of people in there.
[03:21:54.860 --> 03:22:02.860]  So here's my bottom line, your bottom line, and we'll get into the latest shooting at the synagogue and the rest of it in the media response.
[03:22:02.860 --> 03:22:16.860]  It's it's smalling the ADL has been caught before, but the Southern probably lost it particularly funding white supremacist groups, funding the leaders to go out and find low IQ people to go do martyrs and things to get more funding to their groups.
[03:22:16.860 --> 03:22:27.860]  OK, so it's just a small thing on a bigger scale. And that's why they're bringing him back to the show. And he's been called a hero now, like Ryan Williams got brought back to NBC after being caught lying about being shot down in a helicopter.
[03:22:27.860 --> 03:22:41.860]  And so small activity was supposed to. And so, you know, if you can say there's a Sephardic Jewish look, this has come out in the news before, you know, kind of like Seinfeld looks like an Ashkenazi Jew.
[03:22:41.860 --> 03:22:49.860]  I've gone and protested the KKK in Austin, and I made the point years ago and we can find the video, you'd see it, the leaders looked like it was a Seinfeld reunion.
[03:22:49.860 --> 03:23:08.860]  And then, of course, they were leftist, you know, doing that. And we know that goes on. So there are leftist Jews, but other leftist, clearly exacerbating through bots and things, this anti Semitic garbage to then try to tie it to any nationalism or conservatism to discredit it while also creating a giant field of racist.
[03:23:08.860 --> 03:23:15.860]  They can then use against the nationalists, who would be like Martin Luther King or myself would try to unify people around shared values.
[03:23:15.860 --> 03:23:25.860]  And so I just think it's classic divide and conquer like Hillary talks about in the wiki lesson. I think that's why true people that want unification around freedom, but still having individual liberty.
[03:23:25.860 --> 03:23:28.860]  I think that's why we're target number one. What do you think?
[03:23:28.860 --> 03:23:40.860]  I think you're exactly right. And what they do is they have this group online called the GDL or Goyim Defense League who goes around calling for death to Jews, death to gays, etc.
[03:23:40.860 --> 03:23:51.860]  And then, you know, they spread all of these, this hate and they inundate your chats on your on your live streams, they inundate the comments on your videos, etc.
[03:23:51.860 --> 03:24:08.860]  And then, you know, in my opinion, it looks like they're trying to get free speech shut down so that when, you know, if somebody says why should we shut down free speech, they can point at this GDL group who spreads all of this hate everywhere,
[03:24:08.860 --> 03:24:22.860]  and then blame people like myself or, you know, anyone else who happens to be Christian or whatever for this hate being spread around by this by this GDL group, which, you know, is very coordinated.
[03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:28.860]  They appear very well funded and they just came out of the woodwork last July.
[03:24:28.860 --> 03:24:34.860]  And I know you're involved in deep research and you do your are you ready to put out the findings of who's funding them?
[03:24:34.860 --> 03:24:45.860]  Well, you know, it's up to you if you, you know, it appears, and I did a show with Halsey English last week, but if, you know, if you want to mention it, you know, you're free to do so.
[03:24:45.860 --> 03:24:52.860]  I mean, when are you ready to publish the proof of the big famous billionaire who does all this stuff against me?
[03:24:52.860 --> 03:25:00.860]  I'm not ready to publish that. I don't have the proof yet. I got a lead from another journalist that I need to follow up on to get proof of that.
[03:25:00.860 --> 03:25:05.860]  Here's what we know. The left is funding hate groups and they've been caught doing it.
[03:25:05.860 --> 03:25:29.860]  Yes. And they've also, you know, Halsey English has found, you know, a friend of his who's co-hosted on his show has found that they even, you know, hired his friend to put an actor in makeup and act like the governor of Virginia to go around and try to get to the, you know, the government, the governor accused of BS before he was voted out.
[03:25:29.860 --> 03:25:41.860]  Well, I remember with Rand Paul, they had some of the Democrat employees, the guy running against him in the Senate dressed up in hay seat outfits saying, we hate Mexicans.
[03:25:41.860 --> 03:25:49.860]  I'm going to say it because I'll edit it and say I said it. That's how deceptive they are that Trump can say a lot of good people on both sides in, in Virginia, but not the white supremacist.
[03:25:49.860 --> 03:25:57.860]  And then they edited it and say he said, white supremacists are good. I mean, they're so deceptive now that we really can't even talk on air or they'll edit it out of context.
[03:25:57.860 --> 03:26:00.860]  But at a certain point, you've got to let them edit it, you know, they're going to do it.
[03:26:00.860 --> 03:26:05.860]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of that too, where they just take what I say completely out of context.
[03:26:05.860 --> 03:26:10.860]  Yeah, you'll say like, this white supremacist leader said this and then they'll say that you said that.
[03:26:10.860 --> 03:26:23.860]  Right. And then, you know, what they're trying to do is get, they're spreading all of this hate so that they get normal people that are low IQ to go out and do like the shooting in Poe San Diego this weekend at the synagogue.
[03:26:23.860 --> 03:26:35.860]  And then they'll turn and they'll blame Christians for that. And then when you ask who benefits of this, you know, getting Christianity accused of Nazism only benefits one group and that's the Islamists.
[03:26:35.860 --> 03:26:48.860]  You know, so, you know, if, if, you know, I mean, all of these things that we said something fascinating though, I noticed that when I criticized radical expansionist Islam, that's when the Nazis come out of the woodwork.
[03:26:48.860 --> 03:26:56.860]  And I guess a lot of these are probably also Islamists just posing as white supremacists. You were saying a lot of this is crypto Islamists.
[03:26:56.860 --> 03:27:00.860]  Absolutely correct. I 100%. Yeah, perfect.
[03:27:00.860 --> 03:27:03.860]  Start breaking down crypto Islam.
[03:27:03.860 --> 03:27:06.860]  Well, you know, I mean, you really just said it well.
[03:27:06.860 --> 03:27:18.860]  Crypto Islam is these people that are going around hiding behind this going defense league or GDL pretending that they are Christian, spreading all of this hate spreading all of these lies.
[03:27:18.860 --> 03:27:23.860]  And all of their behavior is totally antithetical to anything that the New Testament says.
[03:27:23.860 --> 03:27:38.860]  You know, you're supposed to love your brother. You're not supposed to go around and scream hate and demand Jews get kicked out of the United States by 2020 or 2022 and, you know, go around killing homosexuals.
[03:27:38.860 --> 03:27:46.860]  You're supposed to bring them to Christ to live in truth and natural law. You're not supposed to go around and bash people over the head and threaten to kill them.
[03:27:46.860 --> 03:28:00.860]  But, you know, when you look in the Islamic texts, that's exactly what these books say, kill the kafir, you know, you can have slaves, you can beat women, you can rape women, all of these things we've actually found in those texts.
[03:28:00.860 --> 03:28:13.860]  And so, you know, when you start looking at the rhetoric of these groups, it matches what Islam is saying while they're blaming it on Christianity and pretending that they're Christians, they're hiding behind this veneer of Christianity.
[03:28:13.860 --> 03:28:24.860]  And, you know, some of them may be just dupes that are really Christian and bought into this, but the majority of them actually appear to be crypto Islamists.
[03:28:24.860 --> 03:28:35.860]  Oh, it's even been tracked back to that because I know anytime I criticize radical Islam, the Nazis come out of the woodwork to defend it. And so it's them. It's radicalism.
[03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:49.860]  Just, just really quickly, when you look at it, we're going to break that music. Stay right there info wars dot com news wars dot com tomorrow's news today, whatever you do, spread those live links info wars dot com forward slash show.

[03:32:07.860 --> 03:32:12.860]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that problem?

[03:33:04.860 --> 03:33:28.860]  I want to jam a few calls in from James, Paul, Leonard and Jaren. We'll get to you next segment. You've been real troopers. Everybody holding gets a $19.95 value t-shirt of your choice.

[03:33:38.860 --> 03:33:51.860]  You know, just hit me. The mental illness of saying that Israel runs everything. It's like saying the Russians run everything and Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[03:33:51.860 --> 03:34:00.860]  And there's all these camps. Alex Jones is a Vatican agent. Alex Jones is a Russian agent. Alex Jones is a Masonic agent.
[03:34:00.860 --> 03:34:09.860]  And then I saw Larry King suffers another heart attack. He goes into cardiac arrest. He might die. Remember that guy had 10 million viewers on CNN before they got rid of him.
[03:34:09.860 --> 03:34:21.860]  And it's like, see, I'm only saying this because he's Jewish. I'm worshiping him. I'm showing him my bosses are. No, the poor guy had a heart attack. He's a talented broadcaster and doesn't interrupt like I do. And so I hope he pulls through. He's just a staple.
[03:34:21.860 --> 03:34:32.860]  How many wants a restaurant in Los Angeles? He's a pretty nice guy. I talked to him like five minutes. The point is, is that the old Larry King, but a lot fairer in the news than the modern media, hasn't he?
[03:34:32.860 --> 03:34:44.860]  It's like a picture. But but. Yon Irvin Logos media dot com talk show host looking into all this. I agree with you that it's crypto Islam.
[03:34:44.860 --> 03:34:58.860]  And that the way Islam is about to be 3 billion people. It's 1.8 billion right now. The globalist are allied with it and the entire Jew bashing right wing can't organize to even criticize Islam because they're too busy following over
[03:34:58.860 --> 03:35:08.860]  themselves running around saying how much they hate Jews and how much they love Hitler and proving themselves to each other. It's all like a boys club of butt sniffing each other and none of them can form groups.
[03:35:08.860 --> 03:35:19.860]  They all backstab each other. They just run around hiling Hitler in circle jerks. Then of course, most of them are led by leftist groups. That's been proven just like the whole Charlottesville thing was clearly led by a bunch of leftist.
[03:35:19.860 --> 03:35:32.860]  Yeah, I agree. And, you know, we started looking at him before the break. I was going to mention that Carl Jung when he, you know, back then he didn't have Hitler to compare Hitler to.
[03:35:32.860 --> 03:35:41.860]  So he compared Hitler to Islam. And we see, you know, there's there's plenty of evidence that Hitler was heavily allied with Islamists.
[03:35:41.860 --> 03:35:51.860]  And why is that is because both Hitler and Islam wanted to get rid of the Jews. Both Hitler and Islam wanted to stone the gaze to death, etc. So Hitler wanted to get rid of Christianity.
[03:35:51.860 --> 03:36:05.860]  Right. Exactly. And the enemy of, you know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So he was allied with Islam. And then when you start getting into these occult organizations, the OTO Alistar Crowley, these sort of things.
[03:36:05.860 --> 03:36:23.860]  It strongly appears that it was a lie that these groups were allied with with Islam. And like I said in the in the last segment, when you look up Baphomet, you can look it up on Wikipedia in the Oxford English Dictionary, wherever it says that it's an old spelling of Muhammad.
[03:36:23.860 --> 03:36:32.860]  So, you know, when we get that these satanic groups are allied with Islam. And, you know, here's the thing is Napoleon joined Islam.
[03:36:32.860 --> 03:36:45.860]  Well, let me just say this. Christianity is we follow Logos or truth. You know, I'm allied with truth. You know, I follow the truth wherever it goes. And all these people are saying, I'm loyal to the Jews, whatever. No, I'm loyal to the truth.
[03:36:45.860 --> 03:37:00.860]  But when we when we get into Islam, we see that a law is will. And then we see Alistar Crowley going around saying, do what thou wilt is the whole of the law. And so, you know, it's about will do what you will not about what is true.
[03:37:00.860 --> 03:37:14.860]  Hitler was all about the power of the will. Right. So all of these things when we when we get this, we begin to see the agenda and the bait and switch why everybody wants us looking at Israel and a Judaism.
[03:37:14.860 --> 03:37:25.860]  Meanwhile, Europe is being overrun. We're seeing Sharia, you know, I was about to say there aren't 1.8 million Jews, you know, literally trying to make me go under a law.
[03:37:25.860 --> 03:37:40.860]  There's what 16 million rather, you know, and then there's 1.2 1.8 billion Islamist. So what is the obsession with Jews? Because quite frankly, it gives me a headache. I mean, I try to not look at a black guy and go, that's a black guy or look at a Jew.
[03:37:40.860 --> 03:37:56.860]  And I felt I felt for those quotes for a long time, too. And then, you know, and I wish, you know, I kept telling myself years ago that I needed to go through and start fact checking all the Talmud quotes, etc. And I put it off for five or six years. And then I start going through them. And I even did shows about these fake quotes in the past.
[03:37:56.860 --> 03:38:14.860]  And then I find myself eating crow, you know, and scroll down so people can see some of that stuff on that document on screen there, you know, and, you know, they can, you know, people can read these on screen. And, you know, but if you scroll down a little further there, that's the, you know, we go through the
[03:38:14.860 --> 03:38:26.860]  Do you remember 90% of our audiences and FM stations, everybody gets caught up and I'm not putting down here. It's the fact that we're on TV too. But it's just tell folks to read your paper. Just tell people how to read your paper.
[03:38:26.860 --> 03:38:40.860]  And, and, and I'll, yeah, exactly. Go to my website and read it. I will get that out. I'm going to do my best to get that out by midweek this week. I'll dedicate some serious time to it this week to getting it up on my website.
[03:38:40.860 --> 03:38:53.860]  You know, and again, I work on donations that I've been hit hard by this crap. So, you know, I appreciate anybody, any angels out there who, you know, care to support my website, go to logos media.com and donate hit the contribute button up there.
[03:38:53.860 --> 03:39:02.860]  I was going to say, we can't get banned when you aren't anti Israel, but you get loved if you are because, you know, they don't bother banning Nazis. They're not really doing that.
[03:39:02.860 --> 03:39:16.860]  There's some token stuff. They get protected. All the Nazis have their website. Islam is the religion of peace, we're told. Meanwhile, it's pro-slavery. You know, 300 Christians are getting killed at least every single month around the world.
[03:39:16.860 --> 03:39:25.860]  You know, we saw that last Sunday for Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka. But, you know, this is the regular thing, but we're fed this nonsense that it's religion of peace.
[03:39:25.860 --> 03:39:36.860]  And what that means is that when everybody is either killed off or forced into Islam, then the world will be peaceful. You know, so that's what they mean by peace.
[03:39:36.860 --> 03:39:46.860]  This is what their jihad is. Their jihad is a war against everyone who is not Islamist. And, you know, they have this spiritual jihad that they put up front.
[03:39:46.860 --> 03:39:56.860]  But, you know, when you go through the Quran, 51% of the Quran talks about how to deal with non-Muslim communities.
[03:39:56.860 --> 03:40:05.860]  So why is that? Why is over half of their religion dedicated to dealing with killing off, raping, murdering other groups?
[03:40:05.860 --> 03:40:13.860]  And then we're sold this, you know, religion of peace stuff. And then when you go through, like, the English translations of the Quran, they're heavily watered down.
[03:40:13.860 --> 03:40:24.860]  Sentences where it's clearly talking about beating women, etc., beating your wife, raping your recent converts or slaves, etc.
[03:40:24.860 --> 03:40:31.860]  All of this stuff is watered down. And then you can find these things literally in the Quran, in the Hadith, in the Sharia law, etc.
[03:40:31.860 --> 03:40:40.860]  So everything is being bait and switched. And we're told to look the wrong direction and, you know, only focus on the Jews.
[03:40:40.860 --> 03:40:49.860]  In fact, I've had other show hosts contact me and say, do not look at any other group other than Judaism or you are the enemy.
[03:40:49.860 --> 03:40:57.860]  I was told, don't dare swim upstream on this and look at the facts. Go with the flow. And so, you know, and these were really odd statements.
[03:40:57.860 --> 03:41:02.860]  And then I start looking into what the actual citations say. And none of these claims are...
[03:41:02.860 --> 03:41:12.860]  I want to be clear. I want to be clear. Hold on. Just let me make one more point here. And I'm not saying that I'm, you know, defending Israel or who controls the media,
[03:41:12.860 --> 03:41:19.860]  or what happened with the USS Liberty, etc. All I'm saying is when we look at the primary citations, who is doing this stuff.
[03:41:19.860 --> 03:41:25.860]  And, you know, we look in Revelation 3.9, it says, those who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie and are of the synagogue of Satan.
[03:41:25.860 --> 03:41:32.860]  Well, then who are these people who are not the Jews, but are pretending to be? And why are we blaming all Jews if there's fake ones out there?
[03:41:32.860 --> 03:41:34.860]  That's another big question.
[03:41:34.860 --> 03:41:41.860]  Well, that's exactly where I've been going with all this. And obviously you get attacked when you discuss what's going on.
[03:41:41.860 --> 03:41:46.860]  We're just simply sitting back saying, what's the larger manipulation here?
[03:41:46.860 --> 03:41:53.860]  And who are these groups constantly pushing Israel, Israel, Israel and saying everything comes out of Israel?
[03:41:53.860 --> 03:42:05.860]  Well, that's a distraction because I've personally experienced all of the weirdness and just the blind insanity that Israel is running everything.
[03:42:05.860 --> 03:42:07.860]  And it's just not the truth.
[03:42:07.860 --> 03:42:11.860]  All right. I appreciate you joining me, Jan Irvin, LogosMedia.com.
[03:42:11.860 --> 03:42:18.860]  We'll have you back up when you get your paper out and get into some of the DMT news and get into some of the marijuana-causing schizophrenia,
[03:42:18.860 --> 03:42:23.860]  which you've been talking about, which I talked about a few years ago, and now I was even talking to Joe Rogan on there.
[03:42:23.860 --> 03:42:27.860]  And he's now realizing a lot of that and probably he's starting to talk about it. So that's certainly some good news.
[03:42:27.860 --> 03:42:31.860]  I'm going to come back as I promised and talk to Paul and James and Leonard and Jaren.
[03:42:31.860 --> 03:42:40.860]  And then the war room with Owen Schreuer loaded for bear already coming up on AM and FM stations, TV stations and infowars.com for its last show.
[03:42:40.860 --> 03:42:48.860]  Only you supporting the broadcast, only you spreading the links, only you telling people about the local stations gets the word out.
[03:42:48.860 --> 03:42:52.860]  You are the info war. Please, please lend your power.
[03:42:52.860 --> 03:42:58.860]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:42:58.860 --> 03:43:03.860]  That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my children. Now I can make them strong.
[03:43:03.860 --> 03:43:08.860]  Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[03:43:08.860 --> 03:43:12.860]  As of the age, your words gone forever, but now they're even better getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:43:12.860 --> 03:43:18.860]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:43:18.860 --> 03:43:23.860]  But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now.
[03:43:23.860 --> 03:43:28.860]  As long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either.
[03:43:28.860 --> 03:43:37.860]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time.
[03:43:37.860 --> 03:43:45.860]  When you commit the award of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy is doing.
[03:43:45.860 --> 03:43:52.860]  So please now commit to support InfoWars however you can and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:43:52.860 --> 03:43:58.860]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:43:58.860 --> 03:44:01.860]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:44:01.860 --> 03:44:08.860]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply on the top, most respected companies out there.
[03:44:08.860 --> 03:44:16.860]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:44:16.860 --> 03:44:21.860]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.

[03:44:35.860 --> 03:44:36.860]  Maybe you got a three-year supply.
[03:44:36.860 --> 03:44:38.860]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[03:44:38.860 --> 03:44:41.860]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:44:41.860 --> 03:44:44.860]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together.

[03:44:53.860 --> 03:44:55.860]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:44:55.860 --> 03:44:56.860]  Go ahead.
[03:44:56.860 --> 03:44:58.860]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[03:44:58.860 --> 03:45:02.860]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:45:02.860 --> 03:45:03.860]  It just gets old, man.
[03:45:03.860 --> 03:45:06.860]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:45:06.860 --> 03:45:08.860]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:45:08.860 --> 03:45:12.860]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:45:12.860 --> 03:45:15.860]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:45:15.860 --> 03:45:18.860]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:45:18.860 --> 03:45:19.860]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[03:45:19.860 --> 03:45:20.860]  Us being shut down?
[03:45:20.860 --> 03:45:22.860]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:45:22.860 --> 03:45:23.860]  Yeah, you know what, Alex?
[03:45:23.860 --> 03:45:24.860]  I'm going to pause again.
[03:45:24.860 --> 03:45:25.860]  Hey, Frank!
[03:45:25.860 --> 03:45:29.860]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[03:45:29.860 --> 03:45:30.860]  We're under attack.
[03:45:30.860 --> 03:45:31.860]  We need your help.
[03:45:31.860 --> 03:45:35.860]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:45:35.860 --> 03:45:38.860]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:45:38.860 --> 03:45:40.860]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[03:45:40.860 --> 03:45:42.860]  I need your help, Frank?
[03:45:42.860 --> 03:45:48.860]  Go to InfoWarsTour.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:45:48.860 --> 03:45:50.860]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[03:45:50.860 --> 03:45:57.860]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:46:21.860 --> 03:46:28.860]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[03:46:28.860 --> 03:46:30.860]  and beyond system in the world.
[03:46:30.860 --> 03:46:32.860]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:46:32.860 --> 03:46:33.860]  You must experience it.
[03:46:33.860 --> 03:46:35.860]  It is a total game changer.
[03:46:35.860 --> 03:46:40.860]  It comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you like.
[03:46:40.860 --> 03:46:41.860]  Warning, though.
[03:46:41.860 --> 03:46:42.860]  It's very, very strong.
[03:46:42.860 --> 03:46:43.860]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:46:43.860 --> 03:46:47.860]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[03:46:47.860 --> 03:46:50.860]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:50.860 --> 03:47:19.860]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.860 --> 03:47:32.860]  We're shifting gears right now.
[03:47:32.860 --> 03:47:33.860]  Back to your calls.
[03:47:33.860 --> 03:47:37.860]  I appreciate James and Paul and Leonard and Jaren holding.
[03:47:37.860 --> 03:47:44.860]  So let's go ahead and talk to James in California about the force vaccinations and all this propaganda that's unfolding.
[03:47:44.860 --> 03:47:45.860]  Go ahead.
[03:47:45.860 --> 03:47:46.860]  Thanks for holding.
[03:47:46.860 --> 03:47:47.860]  Hi, Alex.
[03:47:47.860 --> 03:47:48.860]  This is James again.
[03:47:48.860 --> 03:47:51.860]  I'm trying to hold you over so you can finish your point.
[03:47:51.860 --> 03:47:54.860]  So you're critical of me saying, don't California my Texas?
[03:47:54.860 --> 03:47:56.860]  Now, I stand by that.
[03:47:56.860 --> 03:47:59.860]  I don't want to turn Texas into California.
[03:47:59.860 --> 03:48:00.860]  That's the Democrats' goal.
[03:48:00.860 --> 03:48:01.860]  So I'm doing that to be illustrative.
[03:48:01.860 --> 03:48:03.860]  It doesn't insult good people in California.
[03:48:03.860 --> 03:48:04.860]  It is, yeah.
[03:48:04.860 --> 03:48:09.860]  Because people like me have been here our whole lives and generationally.
[03:48:09.860 --> 03:48:16.860]  And the people that we noticed that came here came from the East Coast or different places in the United States,
[03:48:16.860 --> 03:48:20.860]  mostly from Ivy League kind of colleges.
[03:48:20.860 --> 03:48:23.860]  And they came out here and they took over academia.
[03:48:23.860 --> 03:48:27.860]  They've taken over, I live in a university town, University of California.
[03:48:27.860 --> 03:48:32.860]  And they use that as a means to indoctrinate people and take over the local government.
[03:48:32.860 --> 03:48:34.860]  Well, I think this is a form of projection.
[03:48:34.860 --> 03:48:36.860]  You know, I didn't ruin California.
[03:48:36.860 --> 03:48:41.860]  So I don't know what your, the Democrats want to turn Texas into California.
[03:48:41.860 --> 03:48:42.860]  We've pointed that out.
[03:48:42.860 --> 03:48:45.860]  We have shirts that say, don't California my Texas?
[03:48:45.860 --> 03:48:50.860]  And instead we have California with LA and Hollywood crapping all over us.
[03:48:50.860 --> 03:48:53.860]  And so I want to identify that that's enemy held territory.
[03:48:53.860 --> 03:48:54.860]  You know what?
[03:48:54.860 --> 03:48:56.860]  The scourge is not California.
[03:48:56.860 --> 03:49:02.860]  The scourge is the type of people that the, the ideology behind.
[03:49:02.860 --> 03:49:03.860]  No, I get it.
[03:49:03.860 --> 03:49:04.860]  I get it.
[03:49:04.860 --> 03:49:05.860]  All the locals of the country have come there.
[03:49:05.860 --> 03:49:07.860]  Look, I can't debate this all day with you, okay?
[03:49:07.860 --> 03:49:10.860]  So I just, I'm sorry for what happened to the state of California.
[03:49:10.860 --> 03:49:11.860]  I don't think there's any hope for it.
[03:49:11.860 --> 03:49:13.860]  I appreciate your call.
[03:49:13.860 --> 03:49:15.860]  Paul in Vegas, you're on the air.
[03:49:15.860 --> 03:49:17.860]  Paul, go ahead.
[03:49:17.860 --> 03:49:18.860]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:49:18.860 --> 03:49:23.860]  I wanted to thank you personally for the vaccination coverage that you guys have
[03:49:23.860 --> 03:49:28.860]  done because I listened to your interview with Dr. 10 penny and I decided not to
[03:49:28.860 --> 03:49:29.860]  vaccinate my eight year old.
[03:49:29.860 --> 03:49:32.860]  That's the one that did the protein bar.
[03:49:32.860 --> 03:49:34.860]  Little program thing for you, whatever.
[03:49:34.860 --> 03:49:39.860]  When you compare him to other children, he's taller, he's bigger, he's smarter.
[03:49:39.860 --> 03:49:41.860]  Everything about him has improved.
[03:49:41.860 --> 03:49:44.860]  Oh, let's just say you look at old videos and old photos.
[03:49:44.860 --> 03:49:46.860]  Kids look healthy and smart where they're black, white and matter.
[03:49:46.860 --> 03:49:48.860]  Now people look like they're retarded.
[03:49:48.860 --> 03:49:50.860]  I mean, the public is lower IQ.
[03:49:50.860 --> 03:49:51.860]  They're dumb.
[03:49:51.860 --> 03:49:55.860]  It's the vaccines and how he treats his parents too.
[03:49:55.860 --> 03:50:00.860]  I believe the vaccinations, they target the empathy within the development of the
[03:50:00.860 --> 03:50:03.860]  brain and they treat their parents differently.
[03:50:03.860 --> 03:50:05.860]  My, my child is a prince.
[03:50:05.860 --> 03:50:06.860]  He treats me like a king.
[03:50:06.860 --> 03:50:10.860]  You know, I mean, like it's a great relationship and it's because I think he
[03:50:10.860 --> 03:50:12.860]  wasn't vaccinated.
[03:50:12.860 --> 03:50:13.860]  Absolutely.
[03:50:13.860 --> 03:50:14.860]  God bless you, brother.
[03:50:14.860 --> 03:50:16.860]  Just look, the left says it's your body.
[03:50:16.860 --> 03:50:17.860]  If he's getting, it's been vaccinated.
[03:50:17.860 --> 03:50:18.860]  They're protected.
[03:50:18.860 --> 03:50:20.860]  Why are you supposed to take the vaccine then?
[03:50:20.860 --> 03:50:21.860]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:50:21.860 --> 03:50:22.860]  Leonard in Maine.
[03:50:22.860 --> 03:50:23.860]  Leonard, you're on the air.
[03:50:23.860 --> 03:50:28.860]  Go ahead.
[03:50:28.860 --> 03:50:30.860]  I Leonard, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:50:30.860 --> 03:50:32.860]  Thanks for joining us from Maine.
[03:50:32.860 --> 03:50:34.860]  Kate Leonard's gone.
[03:50:34.860 --> 03:50:41.860]  Jared in Texas, FEMA region six, Jared, you're on the air.
[03:50:41.860 --> 03:50:43.860]  Hey, can you hear me man?
[03:50:43.860 --> 03:50:44.860]  Yes, sir.
[03:50:44.860 --> 03:50:45.860]  I can.
[03:50:45.860 --> 03:50:46.860]  Go ahead.
[03:50:46.860 --> 03:50:47.860]  My word right now.
[03:50:47.860 --> 03:50:52.860]  Um, I just want to say, uh, to the open borders and stuff then as part of, as all
[03:50:52.860 --> 03:50:57.860]  the part of agenda 21, uh, agenda, the, the United Nations, when they established
[03:50:57.860 --> 03:51:03.860]  it in Rio de Janeiro, they made it out to where they wanted to flood the EU full of migrants
[03:51:03.860 --> 03:51:04.860]  and refugees and stuff.
[03:51:04.860 --> 03:51:06.860]  And look what they're doing now to Texas.
[03:51:06.860 --> 03:51:08.860]  You know, you, you see it.
[03:51:08.860 --> 03:51:10.860]  Oh, they said no borders, no wall.
[03:51:10.860 --> 03:51:14.860]  No, no countries at all that they would, they would organize these groups and flood
[03:51:14.860 --> 03:51:15.860]  us and do this.
[03:51:15.860 --> 03:51:16.860]  You're absolutely right.
[03:51:16.860 --> 03:51:17.860]  That's what's happened.
[03:51:17.860 --> 03:51:21.860]  And if, and if, if Trump don't stop it now, as he don't do it now, we're going to cave
[03:51:21.860 --> 03:51:24.860]  into the New World Order and we got to beat the New World Order.
[03:51:24.860 --> 03:51:25.860]  We're against the New World Order.
[03:51:25.860 --> 03:51:29.860]  You know, I believe, I believe Trump is against the New World Order too, man.
[03:51:29.860 --> 03:51:32.860]  That's why he, that's why he goes on your, he went on your show before the election.
[03:51:32.860 --> 03:51:34.860]  And, and talked to all of us.
[03:51:34.860 --> 03:51:37.860]  Um, my uncle, he, he, he got me into it, man.
[03:51:37.860 --> 03:51:38.860]  Into y'all.
[03:51:38.860 --> 03:51:41.860]  Alex Joseph and my cousin, she just graduated from the US Marine.
[03:51:41.860 --> 03:51:46.860]  I just wanted to say a shout out to her and shout out to y'all and President Trump.
[03:51:46.860 --> 03:51:48.860]  God bless y'all and God bless America.
[03:51:48.860 --> 03:51:49.860]  God bless you, chair.
[03:51:49.860 --> 03:51:50.860]  Let me ask this question.
[03:51:50.860 --> 03:51:55.860]  If they bring in all these illegals that have the diseases and don't test them, how did
[03:51:55.860 --> 03:51:58.860]  it then pointed us that aren't vaccinated and say it's our problem when the government
[03:51:58.860 --> 03:52:00.860]  let him in to begin with?
[03:52:00.860 --> 03:52:02.860]  Oh, man, I'm sorry.
[03:52:02.860 --> 03:52:04.860]  Alex, you're, you cut off a bit, man.
[03:52:04.860 --> 03:52:06.860]  I'm working right now.
[03:52:06.860 --> 03:52:07.860]  No, I understand.
[03:52:07.860 --> 03:52:08.860]  God bless you.
[03:52:08.860 --> 03:52:09.860]  I appreciate your call.
[03:52:09.860 --> 03:52:10.860]  All right.
[03:52:10.860 --> 03:52:14.860]  Listen, the war rooms coming up with Owen shroyer here in just a few minutes in full wars.com
[03:52:14.860 --> 03:52:15.860]  ports last show.
[03:52:15.860 --> 03:52:17.860]  And I would ask her radio stations to pick him up as well.
[03:52:17.860 --> 03:52:19.860]  He has a show that's just as informative.
[03:52:19.860 --> 03:52:20.860]  I think in many areas is mine.
[03:52:20.860 --> 03:52:21.860]  I mentioned this.
[03:52:21.860 --> 03:52:22.860]  I never got to it.
[03:52:22.860 --> 03:52:28.860]  But I think I'm going to shoot a special report on this because it's so illustrative.
[03:52:28.860 --> 03:52:35.860]  Knowledge biology courses compares fetus to cancer in parasite slide from university lecture
[03:52:35.860 --> 03:52:41.860]  claims fetus a legitimate parasite on upper level biological course.
[03:52:41.860 --> 03:52:45.860]  California University is teaching students that human fetuses are comparable to cancers
[03:52:45.860 --> 03:52:46.860]  and parasites.
[03:52:46.860 --> 03:52:48.860]  A photo from the lecture shows.
[03:52:48.860 --> 03:52:50.860]  We can pull the article up.
[03:52:50.860 --> 03:52:54.860]  The disturbing image circulated on Twitter features a slide from PowerPoint presentation
[03:52:54.860 --> 03:52:57.860]  titled parallels between fetuses and cancers.
[03:52:57.860 --> 03:53:00.860]  According to slide, a fetus is a legitimate parasite.
[03:53:00.860 --> 03:53:03.860]  Behave like a cancer because it rapidly grows.
[03:53:03.860 --> 03:53:08.860]  I know a cancer kills you invades manipulates the immunity of mother and reshapes blood
[03:53:08.860 --> 03:53:09.860]  vessels.
[03:53:09.860 --> 03:53:12.860]  No, it's a symbiotic relationship with the mother and the baby.
[03:53:12.860 --> 03:53:17.860]  The image was taken during a UC San Diego class according to Twitter user who uploaded
[03:53:17.860 --> 03:53:22.860]  the photo aspiring neurosurgeon Dylan Griswold.
[03:53:22.860 --> 03:53:26.860]  Griswold says the speechless after being sent the photo by a friend.
[03:53:26.860 --> 03:53:27.860]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[03:53:27.860 --> 03:53:32.860]  That story is up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:53:32.860 --> 03:53:36.860]  And again, this information will not get out unless you get it out.
[03:53:36.860 --> 03:53:37.860]  Here's another important thing.
[03:53:37.860 --> 03:53:41.860]  I don't want to just bash Ben Shapiro here, but Jake Tapper admits Trump never called
[03:53:41.860 --> 03:53:43.860]  neo-Nazis very fine people.
[03:53:43.860 --> 03:53:48.860]  He's been forced now with the full quote with Conway on there to admit it.
[03:53:48.860 --> 03:53:50.860]  Never got to that clip today, but it's up there.
[03:53:50.860 --> 03:53:56.860]  Ben Shapiro still insists that Trump did.
[03:53:56.860 --> 03:54:00.860]  So again, that's all these folks have is fake quotes.
[03:54:00.860 --> 03:54:02.860]  That's all they've got about me.
[03:54:02.860 --> 03:54:04.860]  That's all they've got about you.
[03:54:04.860 --> 03:54:10.860]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
[03:54:10.860 --> 03:54:17.860]  And now we've got Oliver North out as NRA president after leadership dispute with the
[03:54:17.860 --> 03:54:22.860]  Southern District of New York investigating them for Russia gate ties because some woman
[03:54:22.860 --> 03:54:27.860]  that tried to get a job as a Russian spy also tried to get a job at the NRA and failed.
[03:54:27.860 --> 03:54:30.860]  I mean, this is the evidence.
[03:54:30.860 --> 03:54:32.860]  We can't trust the NRA now.
[03:54:32.860 --> 03:54:40.860]  They're Russians because a quasi Russian spy tried to get a job at the NRA.
[03:54:40.860 --> 03:54:47.860]  So that she could try to influence politicians.
[03:54:47.860 --> 03:54:50.860]  This is what we've come to as a nation.
[03:54:50.860 --> 03:54:51.860]  It's incredible.
[03:54:51.860 --> 03:54:54.860]  There's so many stories we haven't gotten to, but Owen will be covering the latest ones
[03:54:54.860 --> 03:54:58.860]  that are breaking again at inforwars.com for us show and on TV and radio stations across
[03:54:58.860 --> 03:54:59.860]  the country.
[03:54:59.860 --> 03:55:01.860]  The war room is really powerful and I hope we'll tune into it.
[03:55:01.860 --> 03:55:02.860]  We do have some new shows.
[03:55:02.860 --> 03:55:03.860]  We'll be launching soon.
[03:55:03.860 --> 03:55:06.860]  We're working diligently on all of that.
[03:55:06.860 --> 03:55:11.860]  I barely plug today and listen, I always say support the broadcast.
[03:55:11.860 --> 03:55:12.860]  We're doing important work.
[03:55:12.860 --> 03:55:15.860]  That's not the real reason to get these products.
[03:55:15.860 --> 03:55:17.860]  We have the best gravity fed water filters.
[03:55:17.860 --> 03:55:18.860]  We have the best supplements.
[03:55:18.860 --> 03:55:19.860]  We have great teachers.
[03:55:19.860 --> 03:55:20.860]  We have great books.
[03:55:20.860 --> 03:55:25.860]  We have a lot of great material at inforwars.com and we've got some huge specials.
[03:55:25.860 --> 03:55:30.860]  Ultimate bone broth formula with the chaga mushroom and the bee pollen and the turmeric
[03:55:30.860 --> 03:55:32.860]  and the incredible bone broth.
[03:55:32.860 --> 03:55:36.860]  1995, the competitors are like $60.
[03:55:36.860 --> 03:55:38.860]  We normally sell it for $39.95.
[03:55:38.860 --> 03:55:39.860]  It's $19.95.
[03:55:39.860 --> 03:55:41.860]  That's our new big special, Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:55:41.860 --> 03:55:47.860]  50% off all supplies last at inforwars.com and your purchase obviously finances the broadcast
[03:55:47.860 --> 03:55:48.860]  and then the new special.
[03:55:48.860 --> 03:55:52.860]  They have under a thousand units to do this, okay?
[03:55:52.860 --> 03:55:58.860]  But they're selling them to us at cost and then we're adding like $30 to these.
[03:55:58.860 --> 03:56:03.860]  This is the Alexa pure highest quality stainless steel gravity fed filter that does over 10,000
[03:56:03.860 --> 03:56:04.860]  gallons with the filters.
[03:56:04.860 --> 03:56:06.860]  We have replacement filters you can buy as well.
[03:56:06.860 --> 03:56:10.860]  The Alexa pure pro water filtration system is finally back in stock and they're giving
[03:56:10.860 --> 03:56:12.860]  them to us at their cost.
[03:56:12.860 --> 03:56:15.860]  So that's $50 off.
[03:56:15.860 --> 03:56:19.860]  That's $199 for their biggest best unit.
[03:56:19.860 --> 03:56:21.860]  It's an amazing deal.
[03:56:21.860 --> 03:56:23.860]  So Alexa pure pro, that's their biggest unit.
[03:56:23.860 --> 03:56:29.860]  Water filtration system normally 300 bucks for $199.95.
[03:56:29.860 --> 03:56:31.860]  So that is a great deal.
[03:56:31.860 --> 03:56:34.860]  That's 50% off their already discounted price.
[03:56:34.860 --> 03:56:38.860]  And so we get a little bit of support but the manufacturer produced a whole bunch of these
[03:56:38.860 --> 03:56:42.860]  and they give us in a contractual agreement the glut when they get them.
[03:56:42.860 --> 03:56:45.860]  And so they just basically let us discount everything.
[03:56:45.860 --> 03:56:49.860]  Alexa pure pro water filtration system, your children and you deserve it.
[03:56:49.860 --> 03:56:54.860]  So go to infowarfstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:56:54.860 --> 03:56:57.860]  And the survival shield X2 is back in stock.
[03:56:57.860 --> 03:56:59.860]  The pure deep earth crystal iodine.
[03:56:59.860 --> 03:57:04.860]  And we have it, of course, ladies and gentlemen, for 25% off, get a free bottle of X3 and experience
[03:57:04.860 --> 03:57:08.860]  how good X3 is with all three types of iodine, including the deep earth crystal source.

[03:57:14.860 --> 03:57:18.860]  The old special ends today, a free bottle of knockout and you get a bottle of brain force plus 25% off.
[03:57:18.860 --> 03:57:21.860]  Okay, great job to the crew today.

[03:57:26.860 --> 03:57:28.860]  Oh, and Shroyer just minutes away.
[03:57:28.860 --> 03:57:30.860]  Hope your local stations carry him.
[03:57:30.860 --> 03:57:35.860]  But regardless, please support those local AM and FM stations and spread the word.
[03:57:35.860 --> 03:57:39.860]  You again are helping get the word out in this information warfare fight.
[03:57:39.860 --> 03:57:40.860]  You're not just essential.

[03:58:03.860 --> 03:58:05.860]  We aren't able to continue on.
[03:58:05.860 --> 03:58:08.860]  So remember, you are the info war.
[03:58:08.860 --> 03:58:09.860]  I'm not the leader.
[03:58:09.860 --> 03:58:10.860]  You are the leader.
[03:58:10.860 --> 03:58:12.860]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
