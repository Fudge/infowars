[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  We're live, it's Friday, the 26th day of August 2016, we'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:08.000 --> 00:09.900]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09.900 --> 00:14.600]  Our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, but if you're a TV viewer, you can see this
[00:14.600 --> 00:15.600]  right now.
[00:15.600 --> 00:17.200]  Radio Lessers, go to drudgerport.com.
[00:17.200 --> 00:23.560]  The entire top left-hand corner of drudgerport.com is Clinton targets Alex Jones.
[00:23.560 --> 00:28.200]  He responds, I'm not scared of you, bully, Kimmel's pickle caper.
[00:28.200 --> 00:31.440]  Now it's the vast alternative right-wing conspiracy.
[00:31.440 --> 00:36.520]  And Paul Joseph Watson blows it out of the water with this report he just filed minutes
[00:36.520 --> 00:39.520]  ago.
[00:39.520 --> 00:45.280]  Hillary Clinton interrupted her coughing fits, seizures, and three-day naps to attack the
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.400]  alt-right Clinton-savage Trump for weaving dark conspiracy theories.
[00:50.400 --> 00:56.280]  Oh, you mean dark conspiracy theories like a YouTube video being responsible for Benghazi?
[00:56.280 --> 00:58.880]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:58.880 --> 01:04.320]  She then proceeded to weave her own gigantic dark conspiracy theory, namely that Vladimir
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.000]  Putin controls info wars, Breitbart, and the entire alt-right.
[01:09.000 --> 01:17.000]  And the grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is Russian President
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  Vladimir Putin.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.360]  That's funny because I don't recall receiving my paycheck in the mail from the Kremlin.
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.680]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:30.680 --> 01:35.360]  Right, so Trump is the conspiracy theorist for listening to Alex Jones, yet you just
[01:35.360 --> 01:41.440]  asserted that a former KGB officer under the communist government of the Soviet Union is
[01:41.440 --> 01:44.400]  now the leader of conservatives in America.
[01:44.400 --> 01:45.400]  What does that mean?
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.680]  Of course, Hillary failed to identify the real leader of the alt-right.
[01:49.680 --> 01:55.640]  Oh, yeah, and according to another one of Hillary's dark conspiracy theories, Trump
[01:55.640 --> 01:58.680]  is responsible for bullying in schools.
[01:58.680 --> 02:00.360]  The Trump effect.
[02:00.360 --> 02:02.960]  Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools.
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.480]  Right, because it's not like Trump supporters have been viciously attacked and harassed
[02:07.480 --> 02:13.080]  by leftists for the last six months solid, but wait, it gets even funnier.
[02:13.080 --> 02:20.400]  Hillary began reading out headlines written by Milo Yenopoulis.
[02:20.400 --> 02:23.320]  Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy.
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.640]  Nobody wants to fuck you.
[02:24.640 --> 02:31.800]  Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?
[02:31.800 --> 02:38.600]  He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over.
[02:38.600 --> 02:43.240]  Oh, you mean like you and Obama have been doing for the last two years by mainstreaming
[02:43.240 --> 02:49.200]  Black Lives Matter, a group that has inspired cop killers and whose ideological inspiration
[02:49.200 --> 02:52.240]  is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[02:52.240 --> 02:59.080]  These are racist ideas, race-baiting ideas, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women,
[02:59.080 --> 03:05.640]  all key tenants making up the emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right.
[03:05.640 --> 03:11.440]  So posting dank memes makes you an evil racist, but openly praising and describing as your
[03:11.440 --> 03:18.080]  mentor a man who founded a KKK chapter called Black People Mongrels and campaigned against
[03:18.080 --> 03:23.320]  the Civil Rights Act, my friend and mentor, Robert Seabird, that's just fine.
[03:23.320 --> 03:29.000]  Hillary also said that the alt-right is anti-women, this from the so-called feminist who takes
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.680]  hundreds of millions of dollars from a country that treats women little better than cattle.
[03:34.680 --> 03:41.480]  Nigel Farage, who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have Britain leave
[03:41.480 --> 03:44.680]  the European Union campaign with Donald Trump in Mississippi.
[03:44.680 --> 03:47.360]  Yeah, the key word there, Hillary, is win.
[03:47.360 --> 03:55.400]  He won because the tactic of constantly calling him a racist failed, just like your speech.
[03:55.400 --> 04:00.800]  But seriously, if the alt-right atroels, who inside Hillary's campaign thought it was
[04:00.800 --> 04:07.360]  a bright idea to do the one thing you're not supposed to do with trolls, which is feed
[04:07.360 --> 04:08.360]  the trolls.
[04:08.360 --> 04:11.680]  The alt-right only succeeds if you respond.
[04:11.680 --> 04:15.800]  You just walk straight into a trap.
[04:15.800 --> 04:22.040]  The people running your campaign are complete idiots who don't understand how the internet
[04:22.040 --> 04:23.040]  works.
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.000]  This has backfired more than any of us could ever dream of.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.680]  Hundreds of thousands of new people are now coming to our websites, where we'll continue
[04:31.680 --> 04:38.000]  to educate them about your failing health, rampant corruption, and sneering arrogant
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  elitism.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  Thanks, Hillary.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  Racist.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  Racist.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  Racist.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Racist.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  Racist.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  Racist.
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  Racist.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  Racist.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  Racist.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  Racist.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  Racist.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000]  Racist.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  Racist.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  Racist.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Racist.
[04:56.000 --> 05:03.000]  Get ready, because we're taking the fight to the next level.
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.000]  A hornet's nest.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.920]  Now everybody is looking at N4s.
[05:29.920 --> 05:32.560]  Now everybody is going to be fact-checking.
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.000]  And what they're going to find out is that every single claim that she made today is
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.760]  complete and total BS.
[05:37.760 --> 05:40.120]  Alex Jones never said that about Sandy Hook.
[05:40.120 --> 05:42.600]  Alex Jones didn't say that about 9-Eleven.
[05:42.600 --> 05:43.600]  Negative.
[05:43.600 --> 05:47.160]  He said that people on his show had talked about Sandy Hook and saying that they believed
[05:47.160 --> 05:48.440]  that the child were actress.
[05:48.440 --> 05:51.600]  He said that 9-Eleven was funded by Saudi Arabia.
[05:51.600 --> 05:55.920]  If it wasn't a conspiracy, why can't we see the 28 pages, Hillary?
[05:55.920 --> 05:58.560]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.

[06:57.840 --> 06:59.840]  Check it out for yourself today.
[07:00.840 --> 07:02.840]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[07:02.840 --> 07:03.840]  It took you over a year to do it.
[07:03.840 --> 07:05.840]  Why is this so good?
[07:05.840 --> 07:10.840]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[07:10.840 --> 07:15.840]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[07:15.840 --> 07:23.840]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[07:23.840 --> 07:29.840]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[07:29.840 --> 07:31.840]  These are all parasites.
[07:31.840 --> 07:33.840]  Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things that are in it.
[07:33.840 --> 07:34.840]  You have the neem in there.
[07:34.840 --> 07:37.840]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[07:37.840 --> 07:41.840]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[07:41.840 --> 07:42.840]  All right.
[07:42.840 --> 07:44.840]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[07:44.840 --> 07:47.840]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[07:47.840 --> 07:48.840]  And folks, you can't lose.
[07:48.840 --> 07:50.840]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[07:50.840 --> 07:54.840]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[07:54.840 --> 07:56.840]  Thank you, Dr. Grip, from the Global Healing Center.
[07:56.840 --> 08:00.840]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[08:00.840 --> 08:02.840]  We've got it.
[08:02.840 --> 08:07.840]  Thank you, Spaces, for coming to you.
[08:07.840 --> 08:10.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:10.840 --> 08:12.840]  All right, you want to go?
[08:12.840 --> 08:19.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[08:19.840 --> 08:28.840]  I've studied history, and any historian will tell you it's worth their salt,
[08:28.840 --> 08:32.840]  that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[08:32.840 --> 08:40.840]  There's another historical maxim from Lord Acton
[08:40.840 --> 08:48.840]  that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[08:48.840 --> 08:54.840]  The quote is normally cut down to power corrupts.
[08:54.840 --> 08:58.840]  And the power structure is betting that you don't know history.
[08:58.840 --> 09:04.840]  The power structure of the Anglo-American technocratic global combine,
[09:04.840 --> 09:07.840]  as they describe themselves, that's their term for themselves,
[09:07.840 --> 09:15.840]  are establishing a authoritarian, autocratic, centralized world government.
[09:15.840 --> 09:19.840]  And for over 130 years, major banking associations,
[09:19.840 --> 09:23.840]  in their own corporate monthly letters, there's been books written on this,
[09:23.840 --> 09:27.840]  talked about taking over education in the West and dumbing people down
[09:27.840 --> 09:34.840]  and reversing the 400 year old, at that time, Renaissance, now 500 plus.
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.840]  And they've done a pretty darn good job on average.
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.840]  The problem is intellectual true understanding, true liberty,
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.840]  is like fire in the description of Thomas Jefferson.
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.840]  And so unless you extinguish it all,
[09:52.840 --> 09:57.840]  tyrannical, autocratic, plutocratic,
[09:57.840 --> 10:10.840]  waste that centralized status create are like giant tender boxes for liberty to consume.
[10:10.840 --> 10:13.840]  And that's why tyrants are trying to dumb down the human spirit,
[10:13.840 --> 10:17.840]  domesticate us, break up our families, kill the human life force,
[10:17.840 --> 10:20.840]  because to tyrants, to psychopaths, to control freaks,
[10:20.840 --> 10:31.840]  good, strong, vibrant, awake, electrified humans are absolutely, totally horrifying.
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.840]  Globalist, interbred, psychopathic families, even mainline psychiatrists will tell you,
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.840]  represent genetic bloodlines of psychopathic behavior.
[10:42.840 --> 10:44.840]  And just look at history.
[10:44.840 --> 10:47.840]  But the Renaissance represents the end of that system,
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.840]  and we're still in the Renaissance today, and I believe are about to enter the golden age of the Renaissance.
[10:53.840 --> 11:02.840]  Now continuing, mainstream media, particularly mainstream news,
[11:02.840 --> 11:06.840]  depending on the university study or the Associated Press study just from this year,
[11:06.840 --> 11:16.840]  there's four or five studies that are scientific that I've looked at the research papers on
[11:16.840 --> 11:23.840]  how they conducted it, find that the general public trusts the media
[11:23.840 --> 11:26.840]  between a six and a 10% level.
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.840]  So let's just give them 10%.
[11:28.840 --> 11:31.840]  10% of the public trusts the media.
[11:31.840 --> 11:34.840]  And in scientific polls, that's what it's been born out for about 20 years now,
[11:34.840 --> 11:51.840]  that 90% plus percent of Americans in the average poll believe that there were more than one shooter at JFK
[11:51.840 --> 11:53.840]  and believe the government's covering up what really happened.
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.840]  So you can have mainstream media set up there like parrots and repeat for decades that we're all cooks,
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.840]  we're all crazy, as on average over 90%, it's around 92% in poll after poll.
[12:04.840 --> 12:08.840]  Say there's a cover-up, and no matter how many books they put out,
[12:08.840 --> 12:12.840]  and no matter how many times they have Hollywood stars come out and tell us we're wrong,
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.840]  it doesn't work anymore. You people are discredited.
[12:17.840 --> 12:25.840]  And that's only one bellwether of what I'm talking about.
[12:25.840 --> 12:28.840]  Now, there is an area they're still winning.
[12:28.840 --> 12:36.840]  We are defeating the dinosaur decepticon news media, CNN, MSNBC,
[12:36.840 --> 12:41.840]  the compromise in overrun and taken over Fox, and other platforms.
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.840]  This broadcast has, quote, radicalized in Hillary's own statements, talk radio.
[12:46.840 --> 12:49.840]  No, we've just helped them take the blinders off.
[12:49.840 --> 12:53.840]  Our listeners have educated them. That's really what's happened.
[12:53.840 --> 12:55.840]  And so they're in panic mode.
[12:55.840 --> 13:03.840]  Now, in the last six, seven years, they've shifted most of their propaganda focus into entertainment.
[13:03.840 --> 13:11.840]  The late shows, the Jimmy Kimmel Lives,
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.840]  the propaganda placement that is put into TV shows and movies and fiction,
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.840]  they admit this is going on when they have Obama on Jimmy Fallon
[13:21.840 --> 13:27.840]  pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a secretive world government combine
[13:27.840 --> 13:31.840]  that even the left says is completely authoritarian and a nightmare,
[13:31.840 --> 13:40.840]  legalizing slavery, slave labor, restricting free speech, destroying sovereignty.
[13:40.840 --> 13:43.840]  But then Obama goes on and makes it part of a cute song and saying,
[13:43.840 --> 13:51.840]  yeah, you know me, I'm down with TPP, but no amount of fancy suits and perfect lighting and beautiful music
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.840]  can spice up the rotten dead possum you're trying to serve.
[13:56.840 --> 13:59.840]  You can put delicious gravy on it. You can put perfume in the air.
[13:59.840 --> 14:08.840]  You can light it perfectly. It tastes like Bravo Sierra, because it is.
[14:08.840 --> 14:16.840]  And that's why now on a weekly basis, Stephen Colbert or Fallon or Kimmel or any of these people
[14:16.840 --> 14:24.840]  misrepresent what we say and what we do here on air in an attempt, as alchemists often do politically,
[14:24.840 --> 14:29.840]  to take something that's really dangerous to them and to turn it into a joke.
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.840]  And look, I don't think that people like Jimmy Kimmel are even bad people.
[14:34.840 --> 14:39.840]  In fact, I've had mutual friends that are friends with Kimmel and decades ago and they say he's a great guy.
[14:39.840 --> 14:46.840]  I'm sure he is. People like Joe Rogan and others who's hosted shows with him.
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.840]  But the writers at those networks that are putting together the propaganda that they then stand up there
[14:52.840 --> 14:56.840]  and read off a teleprompter and look smart, and they are smart,
[14:56.840 --> 15:00.840]  but the point is they're reading what was written for them. Sometimes they write it.
[15:00.840 --> 15:08.840]  To make me look stupid, you have to understand that I saw a few days ago a Mark Dice video on Picklegate,
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.840]  which he started, on infowars.com. He's a correspondent for us from markdice.com.
[15:14.840 --> 15:21.840]  And I thought, yeah, the Pickle top doesn't pop of the Pickle jar.
[15:21.840 --> 15:26.840]  And so I'm going to go and illustrate how she's even lying about this.
[15:26.840 --> 15:29.840]  He doesn't really take her pulse. She doesn't really open that Pickle jar.
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.840]  I opened four jars and got a tight one and it was kind of tough for me.
[15:33.840 --> 15:41.840]  And I'll guarantee you, I'm a lot stronger than Hillary. I'm not bragging, but I'm a lot stronger than her.
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.840]  So we're being lied to. And then Kimmel comes out.
[15:45.840 --> 15:48.840]  And is it about Kimmel talking about me? That's not our top story.
[15:48.840 --> 15:54.840]  It's about how this is an illustration or an exhibit to show us how this system is operating,
[15:54.840 --> 16:01.840]  that he says, okay, big deal if we did stage it. And basically admits they did because then they make a joke
[16:01.840 --> 16:05.840]  where they show the security guard behind the scenes, opening it to eat one of the pickles.
[16:05.840 --> 16:10.840]  So that's why it was actually open when Hillary opens it. And when he opens it, it's a real video.
[16:10.840 --> 16:14.840]  It pops. It doesn't pop when Hillary opens it.
[16:14.840 --> 16:19.840]  Everyone knows that the point is that she's lying and staging something there.
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.840]  And by the way, almost everyone agrees with me on YouTube and even on leftist sites because they go,
[16:24.840 --> 16:32.840]  of course they're not going to have her PR people put her on national live television and not be able to open something.
[16:32.840 --> 16:41.840]  One out of 30, 40 jars, nobody can open. You got to beat the lid off, you know, with basically a back of a spoon or a knife.
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.840]  Everybody knows that slam it down the table. Of course they scripted it.
[16:45.840 --> 16:49.840]  Of course he didn't really take her pulse. Of course, but it gets worse.
[16:49.840 --> 16:54.840]  You guys don't even understand. I'm going to explain this to you just because I always like to show people the hat trick.
[16:54.840 --> 16:58.840]  I told Pat Riley when I got into work, I said, go get pickle jars. I'm going to troll.
[16:58.840 --> 17:05.840]  Kimmel watch it'll be on in the next few days. And I went on air and played caddy shot clips and said I was joking
[17:05.840 --> 17:12.840]  and said I was having fun and that this wasn't really that serious and I just wanted to be lighthearted.
[17:12.840 --> 17:19.840]  He goes, this guy is crazy. Look at a grown man spending seven minutes on a pickle jar. This guy's crazy.
[17:19.840 --> 17:27.840]  Then he cuts to a gun, a BB gun. In fact, I went and dug one out of my safe this morning.
[17:27.840 --> 17:32.840]  I even locked those up at the gun safe and I forgot to bring it to work or maybe Pat Riley did.
[17:32.840 --> 17:41.840]  But the point is that he then shoots the pickle jar to get rid of the evidence with his pellet gunner as BB gun.
[17:41.840 --> 17:48.840]  That looks like a Glock handgun and says, Alex, you better watch it.
[17:48.840 --> 17:53.840]  You know, the new world order is basically coming after you. Now, Kimmel, I don't think you want to hurt anybody,
[17:53.840 --> 18:00.840]  but you understand Hillary brags about being in combat. She wasn't in. She talks about, I came, I saw Gaddafi died.
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.840]  It's a failed state. Hundreds of thousands died. It's admitted this woman has a death trail.
[18:06.840 --> 18:13.840]  CNN Fox News last night had stories about the four dead staffers and the guy shot four times in the back
[18:13.840 --> 18:21.840]  that WikiLeaks basically says is their source of the DNC emails where Hillary's sending her people dressed like Bernie Sanders supporters
[18:21.840 --> 18:29.840]  to attack Trump supporters so that both Trump and the Sanders people, her enemies look bad. She's a bad lady, bro.
[18:29.840 --> 18:35.840]  And I understand you wouldn't have your job if you didn't have people like her on.
[18:35.840 --> 18:42.840]  But the misrepresentation that that was all serious is a joke.
[18:42.840 --> 18:50.840]  I mean, they show clips all the time when we bought the creature Zorg or whatever that Captain Kirk fights back in the 60s.
[18:50.840 --> 18:54.840]  I mean, the greatest comedy ever. We were going to reenact that. Never did.
[18:54.840 --> 18:59.840]  So I wore the lizard head and then they say, oh, Alex Jones really thinks lizard people are real.
[18:59.840 --> 19:05.840]  No, that's David Ike, not me. But I think psychopaths basically operate like a lizard.
[19:05.840 --> 19:12.840]  I mean, they have absolutely no gumption about, you know, treating fellow humans like like animals, whether it's Mao Zedong or Adolf Hitler.
[19:12.840 --> 19:18.840]  So you guys need to learn what satire is. 90% of that was satire.
[19:18.840 --> 19:23.840]  Like when I was playing caddyshack clips of where he opens the Perrier, but it's already open.
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.840]  And it was to have some fun because I some of my listeners, I'm going to skip this network break. This is so important.
[19:29.840 --> 19:37.840]  Some of my listeners send me emails. I see the comments going, Alex, the world's in a very serious situation right now.
[19:37.840 --> 19:39.840]  You know, why are you criticizing her with a pickle jar?
[19:39.840 --> 19:41.840]  Sure, it's obviously fake, but there's bigger issues.
[19:41.840 --> 19:47.840]  I can't sit here four hours a day just talking about her emails, which everyone knows she lied about.
[19:47.840 --> 19:58.840]  I can't just sit here looking at images of dead kids that ISIS has cut their heads off and point out how the head of defense intelligence says Hillary and Obama ordered them to put ISIS in command.
[19:58.840 --> 20:05.840]  I've covered it. We broke it. We know it. We hammer it. But I've got to have some fun sometimes.
[20:05.840 --> 20:11.840]  And quite frankly, I never did any of this on purpose. I've been kind of a natural in that.
[20:11.840 --> 20:18.840]  And I don't say that on a power trip. I mean, I'm a natural at having train wrecks. I'm a natural at stammering, but I'm real and people resonate with it.
[20:18.840 --> 20:30.840]  And sometimes, you know, when I get into this comedy mode, I just intentionally, like an idiot, survive, start doing really goofy, funny stuff like I said, can of pickles 30 times.
[20:30.840 --> 20:37.840]  I didn't know. I just thought just in a quick one second, just stalled. I'm going to go on air. I'm going to do this just as an example.
[20:37.840 --> 20:44.840]  And I'm going to take over Jimmy Kimmel and they're going to respond and they're going to attack me. And if I say pickle can a bunch, they're going to freak out on that.
[20:44.840 --> 20:57.840]  I kind of know how those writers operate. I kind of get that, that, that, you know, Woody Allen, you know, style, style, Monty Python humor.
[20:57.840 --> 21:06.840]  And so that's what happened. That's what goes on. And so just, just, just think about that because, you know, I told more than two people in the office.
[21:06.840 --> 21:13.840]  I said, watch, I'm going to troll Jimmy Kimmel. And that's what we did. And it felt like I have something over you.
[21:13.840 --> 21:23.840]  It's that I never intentionally tried to bait those guys in in the past. I noticed that when I would have fun, it would do it.
[21:23.840 --> 21:33.840]  So basically now I've just learned to customize it a little bit more where anytime I actually sit down and try, I can have the mainstream media saying and doing whatever I want.
[21:33.840 --> 21:40.840]  Because you guys have been hired and trained and manipulated to be programmable.
[21:40.840 --> 21:45.840]  And so I can sit here and program you on air if I want to.
[21:45.840 --> 21:56.840]  But instead I just get up here and try to just be completely open with everybody as a fellow human and talk to you about the state of the world, the state of history and what's happening on this planet.
[21:56.840 --> 22:05.840]  They've had national TV shows in the last 20 years, many times, make fun of me and go, he's the crazy person that thinks they're merging humans with animals.
[22:05.840 --> 22:12.840]  No, I read it in MIT magazine and the BBC 20 years ago. I covered it on air.
[22:12.840 --> 22:28.840]  Research scientists sent me letters and papers about how they were creating dozens and dozens of different species of part human, part animal clones, so they could grow human tissue inside those clones and not have rejection.
[22:28.840 --> 22:42.840]  Now that's science you're being given. That's a fact. Now it's AP Reuters, hey, it's great. We're going to be able to have organs now grown in cows. And the cow is part human so that it doesn't reject the humanoid that is grown inside of it.
[22:42.840 --> 22:49.840]  And the humanoid grows up larger, doesn't have rights. It's not an animal and it's not a human, according to the government.
[22:49.840 --> 22:56.840]  They're talking about robot rights. How about chimera rights?
[22:56.840 --> 23:07.840]  These are the big issues, folks. These are the big ones. We are already in science fiction land and you're making jokes.
[23:07.840 --> 23:14.840]  And lying to your viewers, because I said this is a joke. I played caddyshack clips.
[23:14.840 --> 23:19.840]  And you know, and they say, look at this crazy guy. He's so serious about a thing of pickles.
[23:19.840 --> 23:33.840]  And I get you have license to make it funny. Okay, fine. But when you tell us that it's no big deal, that you staged it.
[23:33.840 --> 23:40.840]  Okay, if we did stage it, what's the big deal? You're there implying she doesn't have health problems and saying we're conspiracy theorists.
[23:40.840 --> 23:59.840]  Dr. Drew, who'd been on CNN with some of the highest ratings on that channel, headline news, for five years, was let go one week after he came out and said, look, I'm nonpartisan, she looks ill.
[23:59.840 --> 24:04.840]  I've got a stack of news today of more staffers and more dead around Hillary.
[24:04.840 --> 24:11.840]  And then WikiLeaks says we never go up our sources. But yes, he is a source.
[24:11.840 --> 24:17.840]  That's Julian Assange, who's never lied to anybody with these leaks. He's been proven to be impeccable.
[24:17.840 --> 24:23.840]  I said time would tell about him six, seven years ago. I'm here to tell you impeccable goes after Bush for what's wrong.
[24:23.840 --> 24:30.840]  Goes after Clinton for what's wrong. How can you dispute that? And he says, well, we have a source in the DNC.
[24:30.840 --> 24:38.840]  He was probably the source. I can't tell you he's the source, but I'll say he's the alleged source to get around their pledge of saying we'll never tell you if somebody's a source.
[24:38.840 --> 24:48.840]  They offered $20,000 reward. The police have offered a $25,000 reward. He was shot four times in the back after being tortured and made to get on his knees.
[24:48.840 --> 24:53.840]  And now Assange is back on Fox News and they're like, why are you so obsessed with this guy? Here's the clip.
[24:53.840 --> 25:06.840]  WikiLeaks in fact offered $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of Seth Rich's killer. Why are you so interested in Seth Rich's killer?
[25:06.840 --> 25:18.840]  We're very interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged WikiLeaks sources. The police have offered $25,000. We have offered $20,000.
[25:18.840 --> 25:26.840]  We're not saying that Seth Rich's death necessarily is connected to our publications. That's something that has to be established.
[25:26.840 --> 25:43.840]  But if there's any question about a source of WikiLeaks being threatened, then people can be assured that this organization will go after anyone who may have been involved in some kind of attempt to coerce
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.840]  or possibly, in this case, kill their potential source.
[25:48.840 --> 25:54.840]  Do you have any suspicions on who may have been behind his murder?
[25:54.840 --> 26:05.840]  We have received a variety of information. We will be reporting that information to the police. I don't think the information so far is enough to start pointing any direct fingers.
[26:05.840 --> 26:08.840]  We don't want to compromise the police investigation.
[26:08.840 --> 26:20.840]  I'm trying to read you, Julianne, and whether you... Yeah, I know you don't want to reveal your source, but it certainly sounds like you're suggesting a man who leaked information to WikiLeaks was then murdered.
[26:20.840 --> 26:23.840]  Oh, yeah, because the government never murders anybody.
[26:23.840 --> 26:29.840]  It's connected to our publications, and that person is then murdered in suspicious circumstances because it doesn't necessarily mean...
[26:29.840 --> 26:43.840]  All Megan Kelly and the rest of the control press has is, you're a conspiracy theorist. You want to tell us that one of the chief internet operatives over-email for the DNC who was killed days after the leak came out,
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.840]  shot four times in the back after he was tortured.
[26:46.840 --> 26:48.840]  You mean to tell me that...
[26:48.840 --> 26:55.840]  And meanwhile, again, their intel is that he's probably the leaker. He said that in an earlier interview, but he's not liberty to say.
[26:55.840 --> 27:00.840]  The police obviously think it's suspicious. He's dead.
[27:00.840 --> 27:09.840]  And then she's like, how ridiculous. And then you've got all these other people that were DNC folks that were filing lawsuits because Bernie got robbed.
[27:09.840 --> 27:11.840]  They've been ending up dead.
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.840]  And then Stanford Research Institute comes out with a big paper saying, yes, Bernie Sanders won the election.
[27:16.840 --> 27:19.840]  Hillary Clinton stole 11 states.
[27:19.840 --> 27:27.840]  I had been saying 10. I was just, again, humating it from reading the articles and going from my, you know, gut analysis.
[27:27.840 --> 27:31.840]  That's what I do. I'm sorry I was wrong. It was 11.
[27:31.840 --> 27:34.840]  By the way, I made another mistake yesterday in my response to Hillary Clinton.
[27:34.840 --> 27:38.840]  I said, in her press conference, she still hasn't had a press conference. I'm sorry.
[27:38.840 --> 27:55.840]  In a renown about a speech that had 15 people in attendance and one of them yells, info wars, yell, shones. They can't even get 15 people in the room and not have one of them know that they're fighting the New World Order and it's time to just say the truth.
[27:55.840 --> 28:03.840]  I mean, you people are surrounded. The globalists are surrounded. I'm only one little head on this hydro.
[28:03.840 --> 28:12.840]  And you know what happens when you cut off ahead of a hydra, two more come back and I don't mean that in comparison to the mythical hydra of comic books.
[28:12.840 --> 28:21.840]  But to the truly mythical one of Greek mythology as a analogy before the New York Times and Jimmy Kimmel said that I believe in hydras.
[28:21.840 --> 28:32.840]  Now, continuing with this, I cover the Jimmy Kimmel first, not because, I mean, usually when they attack me or do a funny piece, which is on national comedy TV almost every day.
[28:32.840 --> 28:40.840]  I mean, stuff's going on. I don't respond to it. But I did there because that's an analysis and later I'm going to play some clips of what he did, what he said.
[28:40.840 --> 28:51.840]  They're up on info wars dot com and show you how they debunk themselves in the video where they show the security guard had opened the pickles and it pops.
[28:51.840 --> 28:58.840]  That's all I'm saying. It's a big deal. You staged it and you do this confidence game where you act like we're crazy.
[28:58.840 --> 29:09.840]  You act like we're nuts because we see you taking your pulse. We see you saying you can open pickles. Open. It's a joke. You jump back and forth. It's a joke.
[29:09.840 --> 29:16.840]  But she's a political candidate. She's a war criminal. She's got this trail of death behind her. She brags about having people killed.
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.840]  And then at the end of the piece, you say, Alex Jones, you better watch it. This is a message from the New World Order.
[29:22.840 --> 29:30.840]  Well, you've got a gun in your hand and simulated killing a witness while real witnesses and whistleblowers are getting killed and locked up in prison.
[29:30.840 --> 29:36.840]  And under Obama, we've seen the biggest war on the press and whistleblowers in US history.
[29:36.840 --> 29:46.840]  And we live in a big giant police state with the borders wide open, but it's funny to laugh at Alex Jones because he's eccentric and he's upset about pickles.
[29:46.840 --> 29:49.840]  No, you got trolled. We'll be back.
[29:49.840 --> 29:56.840]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:19.840 --> 30:26.840]  It has to be on K ABC's McIntyre in the morning show to debunk questions about the 68 year old Clinton's health.
[30:26.840 --> 30:36.840]  But instead, Pinsky said he's become concerned about Clinton's health and the medical care she has received after reviewing the records that have been made public.
[30:36.840 --> 30:40.840]  And now, New York Post headline news drops Dr. Drew.
[30:40.840 --> 30:47.840]  Now here at infowars.com, we've gone into great detail talking about the many issues surrounding this presidential candidate's health.
[30:47.840 --> 30:54.840]  Why is it bad for Dr. Drew to be concerned about that? But guess what happened? His concerns have gotten his show dropped.
[30:54.840 --> 31:22.840]  Question, Hillary, die or lose your job. You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[31:22.840 --> 31:29.840]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:29.840 --> 31:38.840]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:38.840 --> 31:40.840]  The general public doesn't.
[31:40.840 --> 31:44.840]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:44.840 --> 31:54.840]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:54.840 --> 32:18.840]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowars.com.
[32:25.840 --> 32:36.840]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back. Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades old scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[32:36.840 --> 32:43.840]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary spike-GRX herbal processing technique.

[33:22.840 --> 33:31.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[33:31.840 --> 33:37.840]  In the heat of the night, like blocking my eyes.
[33:37.840 --> 33:47.840]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Got the crew bringing us in.
[33:47.840 --> 33:52.840]  All right, now I'm going to get into Hillary Clinton and her attack on the alt-press.
[33:52.840 --> 34:07.840]  If you go to drudgerport.com, drudgerport.com, the mothership of the alt-right, no, the mothership of true libertarian, patriotic, common-sense, classical liberal, don't kill the nation-state, don't destroy the family,
[34:07.840 --> 34:17.840]  don't allow the West to be invaded by radical Islam, the true rise of paleoconservatism, constitutionalism, that's what drudge is.
[34:17.840 --> 34:26.840]  I mean, drudge is the original. Then you've got people like Trump and others that are quite frankly on the bandwagon, and that's fine.
[34:26.840 --> 34:35.840]  And she says, again, in fundraiser emails that went out last week, the alternative right does not have a right to exist.
[34:35.840 --> 34:44.840]  The Ted Cruz is a dude, and the Fox News is, they actually say Ted Cruz and Fox News and Glenn Beck, who's a fake apologist,
[34:44.840 --> 34:52.840]  and goes on all these shows and says, yes, conservatives are racist and bad, I'm sorry, and they go good Glenn Beck.
[34:52.840 --> 35:02.840]  Now you'll get some corporate sponsors. He goes on Meet the Press, Face the Nation, and goes on with Democratic party operatives who are the host,
[35:02.840 --> 35:10.840]  and the party operatives have written op-eds saying they thought they were in the twilight zone to watch Glenn Beck doing this.
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.840]  So there's the headline from last week, Hillary campaign vows to destroy opposition website Breitbart.
[35:16.840 --> 35:25.840]  That's kind of the lead elephant now because that scares them because Bannon, the head of Breitbart, is heading up the Trump campaign.
[35:25.840 --> 35:32.840]  And it's so horrifying, you know, that things like this are going on.
[35:32.840 --> 35:36.840]  What are they going to do? Because this is a group of multinational globalists.
[35:36.840 --> 35:40.840]  These are front people for a corporate takeover of the world.
[35:40.840 --> 35:45.840]  Under TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the Pope's calling for world government, global carbon taxes.
[35:45.840 --> 35:56.840]  Davos has come out and says they want $100 trillion a decade in carbon taxes. Everything we've been saying for decades and that Ron Paul was saying,
[35:56.840 --> 36:05.840]  and Barry Goldwater 60 years ago was saying, and Ronald Reagan was saying when he was governor of California, it's all come true.
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.840]  And our credibility goes up, their credibility goes down.
[36:10.840 --> 36:17.840]  And this is how they do it. They do it over and over and over again. And they think you're stupid.
[36:17.840 --> 36:24.840]  But Drudge has the headlines. Clinton targets Alex Jones. He responds, I'm not scared of you bully.
[36:24.840 --> 36:29.840]  Live, they have a link to the show right there. Kimmel's Pickle Caper, we already covered.
[36:29.840 --> 36:37.840]  Now it's the vast alt-right conspiracy. See, the establishment Republicans, they've always been the placeholder in the last few decades,
[36:37.840 --> 36:43.840]  at least since Reagan left, for the controlled left taking over, with the controlled right.
[36:43.840 --> 36:53.840]  Now that the Republican Party to a great extent has been recaptured by populists, I'd be happy if the Democratic Party was captured by populists.
[36:53.840 --> 36:58.840]  You could have kind of leftist populists, but still they don't want to be conquered by foreign TPP,
[36:58.840 --> 37:04.840]  and you could have nationalist right-wingers and libertarians, and we'd all work together, and we need two different sides to have debates.
[37:04.840 --> 37:11.840]  But we've got synthetic, fake choices, just as Carol quickly wrote in Tragedy and Hope, in 1968, for the State Department.
[37:11.840 --> 37:21.840]  A 1,100-page book that they only printed a few thousand copies of, and he writes in the forward that he had been authorized by the ruling elite
[37:21.840 --> 37:28.840]  to put this out, by Bilderberg, because their own State Department people and CIA folks couldn't understand
[37:28.840 --> 37:35.840]  how they were going to control the left and the right, but really have no differences, and why they were putting dictators in all over the world.
[37:35.840 --> 37:42.840]  And he explains it to them, we've got a plan for the world, we want dictatorships, our centralized systems, and this is what we're going to do,
[37:42.840 --> 37:47.840]  and we're going to domesticate everybody, and you can go read 1,100 pages, and you're reading the battle plan.
[37:47.840 --> 37:50.840]  And all I do here is tell you the battle plan.
[37:50.840 --> 37:57.840]  And right after that battle plan came out, they published None Dare Call a Conspiracy in 1972.
[37:57.840 --> 38:05.840]  Republished in 1974. 200 pages that lays out what's in Tragedy and Hope, and what Barry Goldwater and others.
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.840]  Barry Goldwater was in the senatorial, he was the head, the chairman of major committees.
[38:09.840 --> 38:14.840]  He was in the meetings where they said, we're going to take all the guns and have the U.N. on the streets,
[38:14.840 --> 38:23.840]  and have peacekeeper forces globally, and we give up all our nukes, and we put U.S. troops in Russia, and Russian troops here under 7277 memorandum.
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.840]  I mean, I'm giving you the document numbers, these are public, he said, we're not doing that.
[38:28.840 --> 38:30.840]  And Goldwater came out and fought it.
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.840]  So they put out TV ads saying he was a war monger that wanted war with Russia, the opposite.
[38:35.840 --> 38:41.840]  This is how these people operate, and you're like, it sounds like deja vu, yeah, they're doing the same thing to Trump right now.
[38:41.840 --> 38:44.840]  Trump is like the return of Barry Goldwater, okay?
[38:44.840 --> 38:51.840]  But even better, because he's got, Goldwater had a lot of stamina, but I mean, Trump is slick.
[38:51.840 --> 38:58.840]  And let me tell you, there's no way Trump's fake, because he's doing irrevocable damage to them.
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.840]  Even if he fell on his sword later, it doesn't matter.
[39:01.840 --> 39:08.840]  Because the fact that all these decades of work to expose the globalist plan, right as they're trying to launch it worldwide,
[39:08.840 --> 39:16.840]  it's failing everywhere, and nationalist movements have sprung up in every EU country with polls saying they're all going to leave.
[39:16.840 --> 39:25.840]  Then the big banks try to hold people hostage, and the countries just start arresting the foreign bankers that are running their countries.
[39:25.840 --> 39:32.840]  It's not a coup against the corrupt government, it's counter-couch by governments against the globalist.
[39:32.840 --> 39:44.840]  And once the globalists are identified, once we're winning the Info War, which Hillary admits we are, to Congress four years ago, it's game over.
[39:44.840 --> 39:53.840]  You know, people like entertainers and people, hey, you live in big houses, you got fancy cars, you sit there and breathe the L.A. smog, good for you.
[39:53.840 --> 40:07.840]  But you see, I have a website and launched a movement 20 years ago that was just a continuation of the same movement for sovereignty and common sense and true liberalism.
[40:07.840 --> 40:17.840]  And see, Hillary goes into the congressional hearings and warns how they're losing the Info War against the alt-media.
[40:17.840 --> 40:23.840]  See, we're winning a war. When she goes and talks to senators, she's like, we're in deep trouble, we're losing the war.
[40:23.840 --> 40:29.840]  We've got to clamp down on the Internet. Four years later, they're getting ready to do it.
[40:29.840 --> 40:38.840]  While you're on TV doing your late shows and making jokes and having your butts kissed by your interns, that sounds like hell on Earth to me.
[40:38.840 --> 40:53.840]  So thank God I'm living in the real world. And my listeners are living in the real world, no matter how many times people go and get some joke I do or, you know, something I'm involved in, and try to misrepresent it.
[40:53.840 --> 41:04.840]  And I don't want to make this whole show about DrudgeReport.com or about InfoWars.com, but you understand it's two months until the Internet is handed over to the United Nations.
[41:04.840 --> 41:12.840]  The United Nations is sending 10 times the observers they've ever sent to our elections this year.
[41:12.840 --> 41:19.840]  But they're not here to stop fraud. They're here to make sure it takes place.
[41:19.840 --> 41:24.840]  They've actually said that. They're here to make sure people don't have to have IDs to vote and all the rest of it.
[41:24.840 --> 41:41.840]  Since when did the UN become God? Since when did they set up the Strong Cities Initiative that's run by the UN as the power of the Justice Department behind it to enforce these edicts against local governments and to take over the police?
[41:41.840 --> 41:56.840]  This is fantastical. If you were the UN backed by big megabanks and the Rockefellers had donated the land to set up this world government 60-something years ago and you were almost there, what's the first group you've got to take over in a covert takeover?
[41:56.840 --> 42:01.840]  Local governments and police departments when you've already got the federal government.
[42:01.840 --> 42:12.840]  Then there's a desperate insurrection by the Army mainly. Oh, it's the Army. We're not being directed by the Army. We're not in bed with the Army. I don't even really talk to the Army.
[42:12.840 --> 42:29.840]  It's just the doors go open up. The surveillance comes in. The overwatch, all of it, as the U.S. Army more than any other group is fighting globalism, fighting our government's alliance with Islamists.
[42:29.840 --> 42:42.840]  I told you three years before Sy Hirsch, Pulitzer Prize winner, came on and I said the entire battle plan of shipping the missiles out of Libya into Syria.
[42:42.840 --> 42:52.840]  I had all the gaston that laid it out, all the information, how they were funding a proxy army, how they were making deals with Islamists, how they would then invade Europe in the next stage of destabilization.
[42:52.840 --> 43:12.840]  We laid it all out and then Sy Hirsch came on a year ago or less and said, yes, you're absolutely right. Here's the whole battle plan and published a huge article in the London Review of Books and in the New Yorker where the U.S. Army refused four years ago to arm Al Qaeda,
[43:12.840 --> 43:24.840]  which they then turned into ISIS to confuse the public names and to get the public off the trail that Obama and Hillary and NATO and the globalists and at that time, Sarkozy and the rest of them were funding Al Qaeda.
[43:24.840 --> 43:38.840]  That's why the British voted in their parliament to not be part of it three years ago because even they were like, this is too much, turning a Jihad Army loose on Europe after they take down Syria, which is the front door into Turkey and into Europe.
[43:38.840 --> 43:48.840]  You understand, Sy Hirsch came on and said, yes, what you covered, what your guest covered is it. It's all true. And we had Steve Puchenek on.
[43:48.840 --> 44:05.840]  We had Colonel Schaefer. We had Tosh Plumlee. We had him from the CIA pilots to the colonels that formerly headed up the operations against Al Qaeda for the army to the entire structure.
[44:05.840 --> 44:15.840]  And then we told you first, General Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, went and told Obama on the eve of bombing of Syria, the military is going to stand down and not going to follow your orders.
[44:15.840 --> 44:24.840]  A soft coup. Oh, but Jimmy Kimmel makes fun of me how my head's in the clouds in Cloud Cuckoo Land.
[44:24.840 --> 44:35.840]  And I'm not attacking Jimmy Kimmel. I understand the job he's got as a jester, a court jester for the establishment like Salacious Crumb to laugh and make fun of what I say and what I do.
[44:35.840 --> 44:48.840]  But I'm not risking my life to be famous, Mr. Kimmel. I'm risking my life to pay back debts to my ancestors and to pay for my progeny's future.
[44:48.840 --> 44:55.840]  And they're going to pay for their progeny's future. And that's something modern people don't know about, but I do.
[44:55.840 --> 45:06.840]  And I'm very happy to pay whatever the bill is. That's called being a man. And they've done everything they can to eradicate that in this culture.
[45:06.840 --> 45:11.840]  And in my own simple way, I'm trying to bring that back. And there are a lot of other people who want to bring that back as well.
[45:11.840 --> 45:19.840]  So let me give a message to Hillary and the globalists and all the rest of you. We know there's been a foreign globalist coup in this country.
[45:19.840 --> 45:32.840]  And large sections of the armed services are aware of what you're up to, and no amount of false flags are going to trick the public into going along with your martial law scenarios and internet kill switches they admit they've put in place.
[45:32.840 --> 45:50.840]  So understand, you need to stand down, you need to back off, you need to go like Napoleon to some island, and you can just leave and you can even take your money and sword sorrows and just get the hell out of Europe and get the hell out of the United States and stop it.
[45:50.840 --> 45:54.840]  But you're not going to. And I understand that.
[45:54.840 --> 46:05.840]  Because your entire will has been given over to evil and all you want to do is bring down what's good. I get it. I get it. I'm committed to my mission. You're committed to yours.
[46:05.840 --> 46:16.840]  And that's all the intel I ever needed. And that's all the intel you ever need about me. But when you do these threats and you have these threats on TV with the darkening room and Alex, this is your message from the New World Order.
[46:16.840 --> 46:29.840]  Oh, I know you just had Hillary on doing fake stunts, how she's got good health. And I know that people are getting killed all the place. I mean, I was on the air 20 years ago talking about the Clinton death list and Fami Malik, the Arkansas medical examiner.
[46:29.840 --> 46:37.840]  They find arms and legs and heads chopped off bodies. He ruled their suicides. I always love how they threaten you. And then, you know, we can kill you.
[46:37.840 --> 46:52.840]  Really? You came? We saw he died. You go and make failed states. You go turn loose hundreds of thousands of jihadis to kill over 200,000 Christians in Syria alone to chop their heads off and to rape little girls and boys.
[46:52.840 --> 47:05.840]  You mean, you mean you might do. Oh my gosh. I see they just don't compute. You look at Hillary when somebody just asked a question in an audience and she starts freaking out like a mental patient and the guy with the EpiPens right there going, it's okay, baby.
[47:05.840 --> 47:16.840]  It's okay, sweetie. We're going to play that clip in a minute. But first, let's play her saying, I came. We saw he died. It's so funny. You came and set Gaddafi up. He came in out of the dark. He invested all his money in the West.
[47:16.840 --> 47:26.840]  He brought Western companies in and you set him up and killed him and put al-Qaeda in. And then you bragged about it. I mean, it was a tough guy bragging about killing people. It's like kind of creepy.
[47:26.840 --> 47:39.840]  But she didn't ever do it herself. She can't even see in front of her. She can't even walk upstairs. But she's an evil vessel. She'll do bad things.
[47:39.840 --> 47:46.840]  And so she's in charge. Let's play that clip of Hillary bragging about how she came. We saw he died.
[47:46.840 --> 48:03.840]  We came, we saw he died. We came, we saw he died. We came, we saw he died. We came, we saw he died.
[48:03.840 --> 48:11.780]  I love it's a bunch of weird harpy women and this you know group of weirdo women
[48:11.780 --> 48:15.820]  that follow her around and Samantha Powers they go for these like $2,000
[48:15.820 --> 48:19.500]  power suits and just like $100,000 jewelry on their hands and the women
[48:19.500 --> 48:23.460]  are all acting like they're at a ball trying to be sexy and they're getting
[48:23.460 --> 48:27.580]  off all narcissistically like yeah I'm gonna fight Russia yeah we spent five
[48:27.580 --> 48:32.180]  billion dollars for the country they want to fight for you to get it yeah it's real
[48:32.180 --> 48:38.560]  sick and it smells of nuclear war it smells of calamity weird soft demon
[48:38.560 --> 48:46.000]  women in fancy suits with big diamond broaches I kill people I mean oh oh you
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.640]  might hurt me oh my gosh oh oh my gosh see they want to take that away from us
[48:51.640 --> 48:58.120]  that we're willing to do whatever it takes I'm not scared I would be scared
[48:58.120 --> 49:03.920]  of serving you I would be scared of selling out to somebody like you that's
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.920]  what I'm scared of I'm scared of anything you will do to me personally or I
[49:08.920 --> 49:17.200]  mean I'm all in all in everything hold ill my family's all in so I just want
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.000]  you to know that once you understand that and the battle lines are getting
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.280]  drawn and you're gonna notice energetically the more you push the
[49:25.280 --> 49:29.720]  stronger we get and I'm just emblematic I'm just one little blip here on the
[49:29.720 --> 49:33.280]  radar screen we're gonna come back and more into Hilary place some clips of her
[49:33.280 --> 49:40.040]  speech where she calls me dark heart we've launched a special today operation
[49:40.040 --> 49:47.360]  dark heart in celebration of Hilary saying I have such a horrible dark heart
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.360]  and just the worst person in the world they just be looking in the mirror and

[54:05.480 --> 54:12.640]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
[54:12.640 --> 54:18.640]  sword and pistol by my side what you're seeing is the facade that is the
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.760]  establishment collapsing you've got foreign multinational corporations that
[54:23.760 --> 54:28.080]  own the mainstream media that have gotten away with creating thousands of
[54:28.080 --> 54:31.320]  trillions of dollars in fake money they've bought up the planet with it and
[54:31.320 --> 54:35.360]  now they want to basically mop up what's left of the nations and get rid of
[54:35.360 --> 54:40.320]  due process and absolutely social engineer to a level never before seen and
[54:40.320 --> 54:45.720]  engage in total race baiting and balkanization and Hillary is as I've
[54:45.720 --> 54:51.080]  said emblematic of the sickness and the decay and the decrepitude and the rot of
[54:51.080 --> 54:54.600]  the power structure if you're a radio listener I'll narrate this but this is
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.880]  just her again in a Nevada last week she's back now yesterday and she's up
[54:59.880 --> 55:04.120]  there and some protesters just says something and she freezes up and freaks
[55:04.120 --> 55:08.200]  out even though you can't even hear what the protestors saying and and just
[55:08.200 --> 55:13.000]  start shaking and her doctor or whoever it is jumps up there it's the guy that
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.400]  has the tranquilizer dart and says it's okay it's okay let's play that clip one
[55:19.400 --> 55:21.640]  more time
[55:28.200 --> 55:36.280]  completely and say okay here we are here we are
[55:38.960 --> 55:44.640]  okay we'll keep talking it's like she's a robot I've talked to multiple people
[55:44.640 --> 55:47.880]  that have done security details for Hillary Clinton and I'm not talking about
[55:47.880 --> 55:51.320]  secret service moment State Department you know military stuff and they said
[55:51.320 --> 55:56.120]  that she'll be riding in a car or she'll just be waiting in a annex building
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.240]  or wherever and she'll just look down bend her head down and then just robot
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.720]  out sometimes for 30 40 minutes and she's not even sleeping and then she'll
[56:05.720 --> 56:10.520]  just look up and start chewing everyone out and you see her look totally psycho
[56:10.520 --> 56:19.200]  there and go who dare protest me she's on such an insane power trip and then
[56:19.200 --> 56:22.760]  she said I want Parkinson's medication in an email that's come out this week
[56:22.760 --> 56:29.240]  from these big leaks that have been happening and said I'm so angry all the
[56:29.240 --> 56:33.520]  time now I keep blowing up at everyone I need tranquil I need Parkinson's
[56:33.520 --> 56:43.040]  medication is this the one for me I have executive decision fatigue it's
[56:43.040 --> 56:48.560]  crazy but it's a conspiracy that she's sick ladies and gentlemen oh and I've
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.120]  told you false flags are coming assassination attempt on Angela Merkel
[56:52.120 --> 56:56.360]  foiled as our man arrested trying to infiltrate German Chancellor's
[56:56.360 --> 57:00.520]  motorcade and Prague miles away they find some guy probably a police
[57:00.520 --> 57:03.280]  operative or something just to create hysteria the Germans are famous for
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.640]  that and now there's all this fear watch him try some stuff on her Austria the
[57:08.640 --> 57:12.520]  the the nationalist party had like 15 points ahead and polls but still
[57:12.520 --> 57:15.040]  magically lost and they're gonna do the same thing in Germany this is a
[57:15.040 --> 57:21.040]  permanent government they're going to a dictatorial model they think we're
[57:21.040 --> 57:27.280]  stupid when we start the next hour I'm going to get into the clips from
[57:27.280 --> 57:30.560]  Hillary speech yesterday a bunch of other geopolitical news and then I'm
[57:30.560 --> 57:34.520]  gonna spend a five minutes on the Jimmy Kimmel thing and just actually play it
[57:34.520 --> 57:37.680]  and you know show help network propaganda works now they've shifted a lot
[57:37.680 --> 57:40.920]  of their propaganda from news because that doesn't have any viewers anymore to
[57:40.920 --> 57:44.080]  entertainment that still has viewers I mean Jimmy Kimmel's got like five ten
[57:44.080 --> 57:46.720]  million viewers depending on the night that's a big show so I mean I'm I
[57:46.720 --> 57:50.440]  appreciate the plugs and everything it'll just send us more viewers listeners
[57:50.440 --> 57:53.320]  they'll actually come find out what we really do and not what they misrepresented
[57:53.320 --> 57:56.360]  there and that's really the big trick to all this it's why they never want to
[57:56.360 --> 58:00.120]  say my name but we already have a giant audience it's been giant for a decade it
[58:00.120 --> 58:04.920]  just gets bigger I love how you pretend I don't exist so I don't exist or anybody
[58:04.920 --> 58:08.320]  else does or drudges failing as he's the number one internet website in the
[58:08.320 --> 58:12.400]  world and only growing it's all just fantasy land by these people like
[58:12.400 --> 58:19.160]  Hitler and his bunker speaking of that Hillary is more and more becoming
[58:19.160 --> 58:22.560]  paranoid we're gonna get to that next hour Paul Watson's filed his best report
[58:22.560 --> 58:26.840]  ever it's up on info wars.com I'm gonna add it to some of the articles that I
[58:26.840 --> 58:31.080]  see are linked on drudge so you can find it easier but it's the truth about
[58:31.080 --> 58:35.920]  Hillary's alt-right speech I never air something twice I aired at the start of
[58:35.920 --> 58:39.320]  the last hour I'm gonna air it again coming up for new listeners has just
[58:39.320 --> 58:43.760]  tuned in it's so powerful stay with us Hillary for present shirts at cost

[59:02.800 --> 59:07.000]  a long time Alex because I think it's very very important what the aging
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.280]  process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[59:12.280 --> 59:16.480]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out
[59:16.480 --> 59:20.240]  you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over a hundred and seventy five

[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.880]  Globalism now strip bearer before the world they wanted to bring in their
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:46.560]  world government of debt slavery and vulcanization and dehumanization without
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:53.520]  having a debate they wanted to have a world government without ever even
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.120]  having a discussion that it was unelected and nobody asked to enter it
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.960]  kind of like the EU only what two countries out of 25 plus ever got to
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.840]  vote to enter it now they're telling the British well you voted to leave but
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.640]  you can't that'll only make them more angry you can always steal one or two
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:15.560]  more times but then you run out of gas boys and I think you know that so you
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.200]  want to have a big world war you're so full of arrogance bravada
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.760]  hootspa those of us that aren't megalomaniacs and don't want to destroy
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:30.440]  the planet are going to stand up and put you in check and I I watched the whole
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.080]  Hillary speech was like 45 minutes long last night I'm gonna play some of it
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.720]  coming up in the next segment where she said Putin runs the alt right and she
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:49.960]  runs Donald Trump that is the most insane bizarre over-the-top true
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.440]  conspiracy theory with no proof I think I've ever heard of in my life I've never
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.080]  been to Russia I've never been to Eastern Europe I I don't have any
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:06.280]  Slavic bloodlines my family I might ever get into this because everybody says
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.880]  oh my family's background this or that but I mean it's ridiculous okay I mean
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:15.720]  it's hard to find somebody that's got a longer you know Mayflower both sides of
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:22.600]  the family right through the colonies in the north and in the south super
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.200]  prominent people I'm not even gonna get into it because it's just it sounds
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.760]  ridiculous and then right through to the founding of Texas and and just so much
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:39.480]  more and inventing things and everything from basically Dr. Pepper to the
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:46.960]  stock exchange in England that was the Greshams and that's on the maternal line
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:52.080]  in my family the family crest symbol was a grasshopper and I mean that's just a
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:58.160]  few of the highlights there was also some infamous people I never mentioned and
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.320]  I'm not talking about just kind of related to I mean it's just like it wasn't
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.280]  like there was a breeding program in my family but these families kind of kept
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.200]  running into each other throughout time out of England and even out of France
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.400]  and Germany because we've had our lineage done way back I mean here's an
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.800]  example my parents I really told the story had two different major religious
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.880]  groups come to them at UT when they were going to the University of Texas and
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.960]  offer to basically pay for their tuition everything if they would join their
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.680]  churches and everything and my dad after like a year of trying to do this was
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.920]  like why is it well we've done your genealogy and and again that's what the
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.400]  globalists are all into ladies and gentlemen and there are evil genealogies
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.720]  there are good genealogies there are families that tend to express good
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.480]  things families that tend to express bad things and the globalists know this and
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.080]  that's why they've got a very very tight lid on things and they're trying to
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.760]  manipulate and control and you've got good bloodlines that you find in every
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.920]  race, color and creed you've got bad ones and an expression of this is again
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.800]  many families are known to have psychopathic tendencies in them and
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.800]  royalty and inner breeding actually does that we look at dogs overbreeding of
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.320]  dogs makes them act mentally ill snapping biting doing weird stuff they
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.560]  might be really really smart but they you know crap in your shoe or you know
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.080]  climbing the baby's crib and bite the baby for no reason you know they just
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:30.120]  they're nuts and that goes on and then there's lines of dogs you say that are
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.240]  true and kill themselves to help you and would always be faithful that's just a
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.400]  paradigm of dogs well it's the same with men and we're dealing with true
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.160]  abject evil here I don't know how I went down some bloodline discussion but
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.480]  when we come back I'm going to get directly into a bunch of Trump clips
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.640]  then Hillary's clips and a lot more and we're gonna open the phones up today as
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.800]  well on this Friday edition and then we've got Mark Moreno from climate depot
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.440]  joining us as well with big developments on that front info wars dot com stay
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.680]  with us Jovings here with info wars dot com headline news quietly confirmed

[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.760]  contributor for CNN worldwide back on August 18th Dr. Drew dropped a bombshell
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.160]  that he was gravely concerned about Hillary's health the famous TV doctor was
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:23.840]  actually asked to be on K ABC's McIntyre in the morning show to debunk
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.400]  questions about the 68-year-old Clinton's health but instead Pinsky said he's
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.480]  become concerned about Clinton's health and the medical care she has received
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:37.760]  after reviewing the records that have been made public and now New York Post
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.480]  headline news drops Dr. Drew now here at info wars dot com we've gone into great

[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.880]  much scares me the most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.920]  food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with

[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.040]  disinformation it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.240]  Trump came out yesterday we played the club we're gonna play it again in a
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.560]  moment and said that Hillary Clinton is a bigot then he tweeted more and has made
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.880]  other statements pointing out that she's a race baiter that's the true form of
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.640]  bigotry is to be so psychopathic you hate everybody but you're just playing
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.880]  groups off against each other using that and that's one of the most frustrating
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.240]  things of having to cover all this racial and cultural and class warfare
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.800]  stuff is you emotionally and genetically start actually finding yourself
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.680]  halfway getting into it because you're designed that way even though you know
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.960]  it's a manipulation and then it really makes you mad that they're doing that
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.280]  because even though you're not racist there are people being racist to you
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:57.920]  whether you'd be black white whatever and so you then have that response and
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.120]  then we'll get into a bunch of other clips from Trump but he's absolutely
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:08.080]  right they are invoking hardcore division and teaching in public schools
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.000]  mainly white teachers are that the biggest pushers that whites are
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.400]  inherently bad and how to fix the problem of whiteness I mean I was taught
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.360]  just in my few years in community college before I decided to get out of
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.320]  there and not you know follow any more education almost every class they called
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:28.960]  us in and they were all white professors and we're saying that whiteness was
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.000]  inherently bad and thank God whiteness a recessive gene would be bred out soon
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.960]  I mean that's a recurring theme for decades except for one black professor I
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.240]  had she was a lady who said I used to be a big liberal and she was just telling
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.360]  the class this after I've been in there about six months she goes until I went
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:51.240]  to Africa until I saw how bad it was and I realized the problems are a lot deeper
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.960]  than what's actually being said and then she got a little bit more into it but
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.680]  it's just funny that most of the people you see really pushing this you're an
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.200]  effing white male thing you don't have a right to speak or white like AIDS
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.440]  trelix of the famous internet meme so let's go ahead and go to that clip because
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.600]  it's important and then I'm gonna get the other clips here is Trump on Hillary
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:17.120]  the bigot and then we will get to the other clips straight ahead after that
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:24.280]  and then we're going to also today be having Mark Moreno on from climate depot
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.800]  here's that clip of Trump Secretary Clinton you haven't done a press
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:36.480]  conference in more than 260 days Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:48.200]  color only his votes not as human beings worthy of a better future she's going to
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:55.280]  do nothing for African Americans she's going to do nothing for the Hispanics
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:02.240]  she's only gonna take care of herself her husband her consultants her donors
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:08.240]  absolutely and then he can go further black unemployment has doubled they had
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.440]  like some newspaper last week go Alex Jones fact-checked he says unemployment
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.960]  is doubled no I said black unemployment's doubled and that's with cook numbers
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.520]  it's probably more than doubled if you look at all the other unemployment it's
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:24.040]  up to and that's with them taking 35 million people and growing out of the
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.000]  full business roles a full-time employment and moving them down to less
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.840]  than 25 hours so they're exempt from Obamacare so then those people have two
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.960]  jobs that's counted as more jobs in the economy and new jobs because you're
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.240]  working two three jobs now let's go ahead and go to the next clip this is a
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:47.040]  Donald Trump compares Clinton emails to Watergate well it's far worse than
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.760]  Watergate because she said she didn't alter those and then we're classified
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.760]  she's been caught lying but we've reached that moment where she's now above the law
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:01.200]  but not above the laws of nature as the Associated Press documented more than
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.360]  half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as Secretary of State with people
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:13.080]  outside government were Clinton Foundation donors
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:20.480]  Hillary's Chief of Staff received more messages from the Clinton Foundation's
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:28.440]  Chief Operating Officer than just about anybody else 85 donors alone that she
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:38.640]  met with as secretary gave the Foundation 156 million dollars and I know
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.160]  many of these people I know many of these people these are not people that
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:48.280]  are going up to pay their respects and say Madam Secretary how are you feeling
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:54.560]  isn't it a beautiful day the weather is so beautiful these are people that want
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.840]  things for their donation these are people that expect things for their
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.240]  donation and when you follow it out and you see the people that left her
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.520]  office you take a look at what those people those companies and those
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:15.160]  countries got believe me you will find out it is plenty and it's come out
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:21.320]  email so far and Assange says work related emails she failed to turn over
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:30.520]  including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work related emails she
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.720]  did not disclose
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:42.880]  why does being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:54.720]  political history it's Watergate all over again it's Watergate now let's
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:01.560]  expand on that a little bit Chelsea got six million dollars a year six million
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.040]  she lives in a ten and a half million dollar penthouse free jets cars
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.720]  everything's paid for the Foundation their whole life is paid for the
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.600]  Foundation they use the Foundation's billions as a weapon system their global
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:17.560]  initiative has raised 69 billion in the last decade but she says she doesn't get
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.680]  anything out of it when she went into the governorship she had nothing she was
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.560]  worth millions when she left that and then when she left the White House the
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.000]  first time she was worth more than 30 million now she personally is worth
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.120]  hundreds of millions that they admit and she admits she has secret bank accounts
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.600]  all over the world but that's okay if I set up a secret bank account and put
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.280]  $100,000 in Switzerland I'd be investigated but not her because again
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.880]  she's above the law now let's go ahead and go to the next clip here Trump's
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:53.760]  campaign manager not the overall chairman but the the manager she has come
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.440]  out and said well we're not completely clear yet on our immigration stance and
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:03.880]  then Trump comes out and says no I am there could be five million there could
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.600]  be eight million there could be 10 million there could be 20 million there could be 30 million it's
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.120]  more like 35 million illegals in this country the truth is they just go back
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:15.120]  and forth now people are coming in from China all over to have their babies for
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.120]  free this is crazy and they spend it like oh you flip-flop you're gonna get
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.840]  easy on the immigrants now he said the felons the people that are here that
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.400]  have long list of felonies that have been deported before you're gonna be sent
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:34.800]  back to your country of origin first then there's gonna be a national program
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.800]  this is what he's talked about previously a year ago where you basically go sign up
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.320]  and then if you're not a criminal you just go and in a week whatever then you
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.960]  get processed right back in because he talks about how it's impossible right
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.480]  now it's super hard to be a legal citizen if you're a lot of hoops because
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.880]  they want you illegal to be an underclass they control who they can then skim off
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.160]  of and control that's the Democratic Party the Republicans want cheap labor so
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.800]  they're in on as well and they don't care if you know the Democrats set up a
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.720]  some race-based political system a decade down the road because they just want
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.640]  money and don't care they're gonna have bodyguards anyways no matter what happens
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:15.000]  in the Second Amendment so they spin this like Trump is flip-flopping no
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.160]  Trump always said there are a lot of great people here from around the world
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.520]  and we're gonna give you a path to come here legally but if you are here
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:28.640]  illegally just like if I fly into Mexico and I'm giving a visa to be there
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:34.080]  for a week and they and they stamp on your card okay you came in this day
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.560]  you're leaving that day if you try to leave two days late after that many
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.440]  times they'll arrest you or find you they have some of the most stringent rules
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:45.800]  in the world Mexico makes Southwest Airlines when it lands in Cancun take
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.760]  off the minute the tower says no other country does this and land within a
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:56.440]  certain time or they will send the plane back to the United States
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.160]  China has tens of thousands of women a month landing to have their babies for
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:08.200]  free Chinese women now outnumbered the Mexicans coming in we are a joke people
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.400]  of having to pay for all this and he simply says you're not gonna do it and
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.120]  we're gonna build a wall and he's the biggest demon and everybody's hurt like
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:20.200]  we're two years old oh he took our sucker away he's so mean he hates us we're not a
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.920]  country if we don't have a border everybody else does this and it's okay
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:30.520]  when everybody else does it from Russia to Mexico but not us because we've been
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.960]  captured by globalist they used our open society to do it and they're using a
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.160]  bunch of desperate immigrants as their cannon fodder so I don't dislike the
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.360]  immigrants many of them victims of globalism I dislike the larger program
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.640]  here is Trump on no path legalization unless they leave the country and come
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.640]  back we'll see what happens and Anderson Cooper won't shut up the CIA operative
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.680]  admittedly CIA in disinformation this is a psyops officer won't let Trump talk
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.760]  but Trump still runs over and here it is first I want to see what's going to
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.400]  happen we're going to deport many people many many people the vast majority
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.440]  of 11 million are not but we don't know they're gonna find out who they are we
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.480]  have crime all over the state if they haven't committed crime is there gonna
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:22.840]  be a path there is no path to legalize people leave the country let what
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.040]  when they come back in if they come back in then they can start paying taxes so
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.320]  there's no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back so
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.640]  that means of the 11 million who are here even if they haven't committed a
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.440]  crime you don't know again you keep saying 11 million you don't know what
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.600]  the numbers you know millions of people that's the s and using the existing laws
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:49.700]  of our country using the existing laws millions of people are deported every
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:53.120]  year right you know that you know people don't talk about that it's Obama they
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.320]  don't talk about that a lot of people being deported we're going to do that
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.520]  vigorously we're gonna go with the laws that are existing but we're gonna have a
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.440]  very strong border and we're not gonna have people pouring back in and when
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.840]  these people the drug lords and all of these guys that are thrown out they're
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.440]  not coming back into the country so if you haven't committed a crime and you've
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.680]  been here for 15 years and you have a family here you have a job here will
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.320]  you be deported we're going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.840]  we're gonna have a strong border as strong as any border there is anywhere
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.640]  in the world we're gonna have a real wall we're gonna have tremendous
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.960]  protection both technological protection and everything else and then we're
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.440]  gonna see what happens but there is a very good chance the answer could be yes
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.480]  we're gonna see what happens before I do anything I want to get rid of the bad
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.600]  ones there are a lot of them I want to get rid of all of the bad ones and we're
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.360]  gonna do that that'll be the single first order I signed we're gonna stop
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.800]  right now I'm in New Hampshire that is beautiful okay so he's not flip-flop it's
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.920]  not true another hoax he never dropped out they're faking the polls it's all

[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:10.800]  a right to exist simply amazing you know Hillary you failed back in the early
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.640]  90s to strangle the Western Journalism Center that I think really is the
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.760]  vanguard of patriotic libertarian conservative media that became world
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:25.280]  net daily and even was before drudge and it's not about stealing people out for
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.160]  credit people you know that they you know their own foundation their own
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.320]  library I keep going back this all the time the documents have been released
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.960]  via lawsuits said we've got to shut this down this is dangerous well look like
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:43.360]  looks like you fail so the good news is you've tried and tried and tried and
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.080]  tried and tried and tried and you keep failing and failing and failing and the
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:52.200]  audits and the harassment and the death threats and the PIs and all of it hasn't
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.400]  helped you and look more leaks are coming out even though the whistleblowers
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:06.160]  are getting shot four times in the back you've taken our restraint and the fact
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.080]  that a lot of folks have been in a trance for weakness but tyrants always
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.760]  find out when they start killing people openly it's the beginning of the end if
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:19.360]  you would have gone with soft power you'd still be in control but you're
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:25.640]  losing control very very fast speaking of drudge report comm for TV viewers
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.840]  radio listeners should just go there you can see it how is the empire going to
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.400]  strike back well right there headless uber I love how drudge does that because
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.680]  I would just come out and say look ubers admits their plan is to have driverless
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.520]  cars they admit they want to have a monopoly it's hooked in to ron emmanuel's
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.640]  brother with billions of investment that's why they're allowed to operate in
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.440]  all these liberal cities even though they undercut the unions and screw
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.800]  everybody I mean I'm all for having competition and being picked up but uber
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:57.640]  wants a monopoly themselves and wants to work with the state to create one I
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:02.000]  mean it's even worse it's taking innovation but controlled innovation so
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.720]  it takes over the market just like Google's doing so they can control
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:11.200]  information now and you know d-list stories about Hillary's health headless
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.080]  uber their goal they said this three years ago but now they admit it openly
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.840]  that's a gizmodo spotted a self-driving uber in Pittsburgh that's right they're
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.800]  actually putting self-drivers on the road they've got the insurance they're
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.240]  willing to pay statistically they've been a lot of crashes a lot of problem
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.080]  driverless cars that Ford's testing Google's testing ubers testing and now
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.520]  they drive around with these big antennas on just like Google grabbing
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.680]  your info tracking what you're doing we have to make a decision to not be
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.920]  displaced by these because they admit I told people this 20 years ago but now
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:50.960]  it's admitted I could just see it common sense they're going to come out and
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.320]  they're now doing it and say humans just aren't as safe as computers well you
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.400]  could pay a lot more on insurance but your insurance will be 10% of what it
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.480]  will be if you just go with driverless and you'll still drive it Toyota and
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.760]  Mercedes are already like this you already pay more for their luxury
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:10.680]  models like Lexus where oh it has all these smart things that beep and it'll
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.840]  stop if you don't stop and it'll keep you from swerving you're already in a
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.120]  robot car and they're killing people all the time with them like Michael Hayes
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.640]  thinks I talked 20 years ago about people being killed how they could
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.960]  program cars all ready to be driverless and kill you and some of the leaks that
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.080]  are going to be coming out a little birdie told me are going to be dealing
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:38.480]  with different agency programs and protocols to use the commandeering and
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.800]  hijacking of vehicles that are remote control to kill you well of course if in
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.920]  the old days it was how to cut brake lines and how to take the bolts off the
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.600]  wheels so that once you spent up to 70 miles an hour you know just how to set
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.240]  it where the wheels have come off like happen the Nigel Farage the leader of
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:29:00.280]  UKIP like happened to his airplane pilot can't talk very well but he's all right
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:03.720]  as long as you don't unplug him God bless him but Farage climbed out of
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.440]  there bleeding face half torn off and was back in the saddle a few months
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:13.840]  later and quite frankly I don't blame him wanting to kind of back off now and
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.240]  right off in the sunset at least for a while because it's not even that I'm
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.160]  tired or not even that I'm scared of him killing me at a certain point it
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.000]  it's it's it's kind of embarrassing even though I'm doing it for the right
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.960]  reasons to always be hopping around you know in front of the dragon spitting on
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.080]  it kicking it in the nose pointing it out to everybody I'm even though I want
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.880]  this mission parts of me at a certain point we're like man I wish other
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.000]  people step forward so they can have their time to roll the dice over and
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.500]  over again I just thank God that I'm still alive thank you God and thank you
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:50.560]  listeners for your prayers I'll get to the Hillary clip and Paul Watson's

[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.200]  the 68 year old Clinton's health but instead Pinsky said he's become concerned
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.480]  about Clinton's health and the medical care she has received after reviewing
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:38.640]  the records that have been made public and now New York Post headline news

[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:31.800]  against the technotronic technocracy takeover you're listening to alex
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:42.040]  Jones all right Hillary Clinton is now the biggest conspiracy theorist on the
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.720]  planet they call us a conspiracy theorist when we see billions given to
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.240]  their foundation and then the people that give the money are given even
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.040]  better concessions by the State Department that's two plus two four years
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:02.400]  ago everybody talked about how the foundation was a fraud now we have the
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:07.560]  emails proving it so it's not a conspiracy theory if you say heat up
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:14.240]  water to 250 degrees on your stovetop and put three or four eggs in there
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:18.440]  because you're going to make deviled eggs that that's going to boil those eggs
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:26.240]  no it's two plus two equals four so much what we do is just common sense she
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.120]  says it's a conspiracy theory that she ever had stolen glory and lied in the
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.760]  Balkans and said that she was under sniper fire we have the CBS and NBC video
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:40.960]  of her not being attacked and and war wasn't going on for 50 miles around her
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:46.400]  total lie then she said oh the plane was shot up coming in on landing that wasn't
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.040]  true either but she just says conspiracy theory and David not at a great
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.440]  point he came in today to talk to me he said listen I'm gonna respond all these
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.120]  attacks today but how about we just move forward and all the corruption she's
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:02.000]  engaged in because she never responds when she's caught red-handed she just
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.640]  moves on with the attack and he's got a good point but my broadcast overall and
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.760]  so the different hosts have different angles and things they're strong in my
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:16.560]  broadcast isn't even so much about defending info wars or attacking the
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.480]  system it's about getting people to realize how the system works because
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.520]  once you know how they operate their tricks you will understand it all on
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:27.760]  your own and what do you need to tune into Alex Jones to know what's going on
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.920]  and that's even kind of a condescending statement I only have my perspective on
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:37.160]  things it's very truthful it's still from my perspective it's not perfect we
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.800]  need to get a culture going again of thinking and understanding and knowing
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.760]  dirty tricks I talked to people in radio and TV and networks and they can't
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.360]  believe that I can sit there and watch what they're doing and see little
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.280]  tricks and stuff and they tell me well even our hosts don't know the tricks
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.080]  they just do what we say how do you know all these tricks this is stuff top
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.880]  consultants you know come in and we pay millions for and by the way I don't have
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.960]  the energy the stamina to sit there and do the tricks I just know what I'm
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:11.360]  seeing here's one a super good-looking woman looking at you at a teleprompter
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.720]  like she is in love with you across the table at an Italian food restaurant and
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.920]  you know in 30 minutes you're gonna be at her house with her and this is really
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:24.400]  exciting they sit there with those women and train them how to just
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:37.320]  I mean this that's just one level but they stack on so much fakeness that the
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:43.680]  true secret weapon of genuineness is gone and then you get Hillary who's like a
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.200]  stuffed mannequin that they roll out there except when she gets on a power
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.520]  trip and looks all crazy like a borderline personality disorder meets a
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.640]  psychopath and you know like when the Secret Service runs up and the doctor
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.920]  runs up with the epi-pin and you know they see a woman you know jump up and
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.460]  say something the crowd and Hillary kind of flips out it says weird look in her
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:10.720]  face and he goes it's okay baby it's okay I mean this she looks like I'm sorry
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:16.600]  she looks like what I've seen in movies which is reenactments of real things I
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.760]  occasionally seen we've all been walking out of a hotel or walking out of a
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.280]  restaurant and you see a pimp with two good-looking women you know he's a pimp
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.800]  and and one of the girls is drugged out and she's kind of flipping out he goes
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.720]  it's okay baby it's all right it's all right sweetie and they just kind of
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:38.000]  it's all right baby it's all right baby I mean this was literally this is the
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.080]  handler that goes around behind her wherever this black doctor is we find
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.520]  his name with this tranquilizer pin behind her can we play that again I
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.560]  know I'm springing this on you and then we're going to Hillary attacking me but
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.320]  here's the deal she released right after the speech the quote speech and I
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.160]  looked at it last night and went back and watched the speech only two other
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.440]  times did she go off the speech she went off the speech on me and gets this
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:09.480]  crazy look in her eye and then leans back like she's Emperor Palpatine and
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:16.400]  you know just being attacked by Mace Windu and just goes oh his heart his heart
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:23.080]  well we have a special let me get the video it costs us five dollars roughly
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.320]  to buy the shirts then to print them and then to ship them here right here in the
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.240]  U.S. printed in the U.S. I think they were made in Mexico or they'd be ten
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.920]  dollars a piece we do shell certs made in the U.S. for doing twenty something
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:36.400]  bucks because ten bucks is the shirt before printing but the point is we have
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:41.400]  the Hiller for present shirts and this is called Operation Darkheart to
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:47.960]  celebrate how ridiculous she is 995 shipping included so you don't pay
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:54.320]  shipping 995 that is cost for a Hiller for present shirt we've never never gone
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.120]  this low except when I did it for $5.95 and you had to pay for shipping so I
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.120]  guess that was a little bit more get your shirt today no excuses you see the huge
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:07.080]  effect it's having as we realize how strong we are as you meet like-minded

[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:01.080]  jokes about the pickle and then they said I'm all serious about the pickle I
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:04.320]  mean clearly she did not open the pickle jar we're gonna prove that in a moment
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:09.800]  but it's all part of the fraud we made a joke of you and the pickle can that is

[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.400]  militarily Turkey's been moving tanks and troops into Syria just basically
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:55.240]  invading all this craziness is going on we've got Assad saying most interesting
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:43:01.120]  and Syria's Hillary info yet to come US second quarter growth trimmed to 1.1
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:06.040]  percent that's depression level just takes you know all because that even fake
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.480]  numbers I mean probably 4% negative growth and it's according to shadow
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:17.320]  stats and John Williams this is heavily cooked we're gonna also get into some of
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.680]  the other programs going on some of the fake assassination attempts other things
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:26.280]  do you prefer man or sir new DOJ video shows cops and if you don't they're
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:32.040]  gonna sue you how to treat transgender people you can't profile anybody else
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.600]  but you better ask a man if he's really a woman I mean this is how you bring down
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:43.680]  a society but first Hillary Clinton I'm doing overdrive in the fourth hour with
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.920]  Joe Biggs and Anthony Uchiarty and I'm sitting here and they run in they say
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:52.400]  here's the transcript Hillary Clinton just attacked you so I read the
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.120]  transcript then actually see the video they play a few minutes later and it's
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:01.920]  much more than what was in the transcript where she starts talking about my dark
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.400]  heart couldn't say black heart because that'd be racist they've been saying
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.600]  don't kids are getting in trouble for saying brownies you know all the brownies
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:13.200]  all you're insulting me I call the police police were called you know this is the
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:20.360]  mental illness that's being pushed but Hillary gets up there and she gets real
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.440]  emotional when she talks about me and that's the thing about Hillary she's
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:27.000]  constantly in a rage she takes everything personal she's basically
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.920]  schizoid she has psychotic breaks constantly and everyone must be
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.240]  persecuted dr. Drew fired even though he had a hit show for five years one week
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:41.440]  after he said she does look sick you know staffers that reportedly are the
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.680]  maybe the leaker to you know shot in the back four times two days after it
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:50.640]  happens beating Bill Clinton over the head with an ashtray a lot of folks are
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.840]  going the angle that paranoid Hillary Smith's Alex Jones during conspiracy
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:57.840]  obsessed rent and I agree I mean I work for Putin or have contact with the
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:06.680]  Russians like I have contact with Santa Claus I mean it's not going on she
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.320]  talked about this horrible evil nationalism rising in America that's
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:16.120]  pushed by Trump or pushed by Putin nationalism just means our bill of
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.840]  rights are constitution due process private property low taxes the Second
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.760]  Amendment religious rights again which are being trampled lady they always go
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.920]  oh the new thing is global government it's so new and cool oh new like cancer
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.920]  like I've never had cancer but it's a new so it must be you've got cancer yay
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.200]  it's something new in my body it must be good no it's not good
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.680]  unelected foreign globalist groups running us nationalism is it coming from
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:46.080]  Putin it's coming from the breast of the average person worldwide regardless of
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.840]  race color creed who are all human race wanting basic self-determination and
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:57.360]  freedom and they know that but they've had the politico and they've had the
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:02.480]  economists and all of them come out and say globalist organs of disinformation
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.920]  but orders to their own people we are the liberal world government to counter
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:11.160]  the racist nation and whatever your nation is yeah you're pretty much
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.280]  Brazilian or this or that and you're like outside groups are coming in to take
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.120]  you over and bringing immigrants in to be client groups they control because
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.520]  they're control of the state who blame you can't blame them they're basically
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:24.480]  prisoners underclass permanent underclass I'm not saying they're bad underclass
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.680]  I'm saying they're being kept as an underclass truly exploited as modern
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.120]  sharecroppers that's what Mexicans are used for other people being brought into
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.400]  the country they are victims in many respects but the point is the globalist
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.400]  of the ones that architected and then use it and then they bring these people in
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.160]  they do all this and Hillary says it's this horrible nationalism where people
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.520]  kind of finally wake up and go there's some foreign thing that's sacred that's
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.600]  gonna run all our trade and England voted to get out of this thing but can't
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.720]  get out but never voted to get in I mean common sense is happening they don't
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:01.400]  want you to look at the man behind the curtain but Toto Matt Drudge and you and
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:08.120]  me and all of us pulled the curtain back we did it we're hurting them but it
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:12.600]  shouldn't be hard what they're doing is outrageous all we have to do is when
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.960]  they tell us these aren't the droids you're looking for and there are the
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.400]  droids we're looking for in the back of the speeder no those of the droids we're
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.240]  looking for I mean they play this game well there is a world government but
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:30.480]  it's different from what you said I mean the games the games the games so let's
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:38.320]  go ahead and go to this clip of Hillary and she's talking about my dark heart you
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.160]  mean my heart of courage I mean I'm not claiming I'm the greatest guy around but
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.200]  I have serious guilt issues when I do things that most people say why are you
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:54.560]  guilty about that I feel guilty when I'm forced to defeat an enemy because I don't
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:59.040]  like to dominate people Hillary is the monster who doesn't give tips hates
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.360]  everybody preach everybody like crap I've talked to Secret Service I've talked
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.640]  to State Department Blackwater people I've talked to them all and they say
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:11.600]  Hillary is crazy she blows up hours a day she's a psycho on a power trip she
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:16.080]  shouldn't have power she's dangerous she's falling apart physically has all
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:22.080]  these crimes coming out and still thinks she'll survive as president let's go to
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:28.120]  the club hurt us what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:36.200]  claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs he even said
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:43.120]  and this really just is so disgusting he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:49.200]  massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there I don't know
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:57.920]  what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:03.880]  like that but Trump doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on Jones's
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:09.840]  show and said your reputation is amazing I will not let you down
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.440]  from the man who wants to be president of the United States but that's enough
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.080]  it's amazing for taking you on lady and have encouraged like Trump has he gets
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.800]  it he's all in he's standing up against globalism he believes he believes we're
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.040]  smart he believes he can have a complex message and that will listen to it
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.720]  understand it and decide to have a referendum against you he's making his
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.520]  move now do I totally trust him I'm gonna totally trust myself at the end of
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:40.200]  the day but but I know who you are I know you're bad we're gonna put lots of
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:45.520]  clips together of you going imagine the dark heart that kills 200,000 Christians
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.280]  they admit that you're behind in Syria and tens of thousands and tens of
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.680]  thousands more just because they're black in Libya

[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:27.280]  with Hillary Clinton's bizarre alt-conservative speech what she means is
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:33.080]  real patriots Americans that are fighting globalist takeover and treason
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:39.440]  here is Paul Watson's devastating report from info wars.com
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:45.480]  Hillary Clinton interrupted her coughing fits seizures and three-day naps to attack
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:51.360]  the alt-right Clinton savage Trump for weaving dark conspiracy theories oh you
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:55.920]  mean dark conspiracy theories like a YouTube video being responsible for
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:01.400]  Benghazi what difference at this point does it make she then proceeded to weave
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.880]  her own gigantic dark conspiracy theory namely that Vladimir Putin controls
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:12.040]  info wars Breitbart and the entire alt-right and the grand godfather of
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:21.720]  this global brand of extreme nationalism is Russian president Vladimir Putin
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:25.760]  that's funny because I don't recall receiving my paycheck in the mail from
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.560]  the Kremlin it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.960]  right so Trump is the conspiracy theorist for listening to Alex Jones yet
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:39.400]  you just asserted that a former KGB officer under the communist government
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:44.440]  of the Soviet Union is now the leader of conservatives in America what does that
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:50.200]  mean of course Hillary failed to identify the real leader of the alt-right oh
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.440]  yeah and according to another one of Hillary's dark conspiracy theories
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:59.920]  Trump is responsible for bullying in schools the Trump effect bullying and
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:03.600]  harassment are on the rise in our schools right because it's not like Trump
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.160]  supporters have been viciously attacked and harassed by leftists for the last
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:13.040]  six months solid but wait it gets even funnier Hillary began reading out
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:21.240]  headlines written by Milo Yenopoulos birth control makes women unattractive and
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:30.400]  crazy nobody wants you would you rather your child had feminism or cancer he is
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:36.920]  taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over oh
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:40.600]  you mean like you and Obama have been doing for the last two years by
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.800]  mainstreaming black lives matter a group that has inspired cop killers and
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:50.040]  whose ideological inspiration is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list these
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:55.960]  are racist ideas race-baiting ideas anti-Muslim anti-immigrant anti-women
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:02.760]  all key tenants making up the emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:07.560]  so posting dank memes makes you an evil racist but openly praising and
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:12.960]  describing as your mentor a man who founded a KKK chapter called black
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.400]  people Mongrels and campaigned against the Civil Rights Act my friend and
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:22.080]  mentor Robert Seabird that's just fine Hillary also said that the alt-right is
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.920]  anti-women this from the so-called feminist who takes hundreds of millions
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.680]  of dollars from a country that treats women little better than cattle Nigel
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:37.240]  Farage who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:40.840]  Britain leave the European Union campaign with Donald Trump in Mississippi
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:45.960]  yeah the key word there Hillary is win he won because the tactic of constantly
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:52.800]  calling him a racist failed just like your speech but seriously if the alt-right
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.560]  are trolls who inside Hillary's campaign thought it was a bright idea to do the
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:03.760]  one thing you're not supposed to do with trolls which is feed the trolls the
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:11.240]  alt-right only succeeds if you respond you just walked straight into a trap the
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:16.560]  people running your campaign are complete idiots who don't understand how
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:21.560]  the internet works this has backfired more than any of us could ever dream of
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:26.080]  hundreds of thousands of new people are now coming to our websites where we'll

[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:36.280]  and sneering arrogant elitism thanks Hillary racists race races races races

[01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:58.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:16.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:40.560]  Hollywood. I haven't seen this yet. We're going to play it right now in the Marmaranos
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:44.480]  coming up. The climate depot with a bunch of big geopolitical developments we need to
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:55.480]  get into. We're not Gonzo journalism. I don't set out to make the story about myself, but
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:04.480]  when Infowars and DrudgeReport.com and Breitbart and World Net Daily and Daily Caller and you,
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:12.320]  you are leading the way globally and nationalism is rising. Hey, we shouldn't have the foreign
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:19.440]  EU run our country when we never voted to be part of it. How the hell does that happen?
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:26.760]  You're racist. It doesn't work. The West has been the most untribal groups after we stopped
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:32.200]  killing each other 600 years ago in the feudal wars that went on forever. I mean, wars continued,
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.740]  but they cut back a little bit. It has been basically the most untribal groups out there
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:41.600]  because of Christianity. Christianity has been what has really knocked tribalism in
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:47.800]  the head so that we can actually try to build a global society and it's innovated. That's
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:51.400]  why it's under attack because the globalists see it as a competing system. They ought to
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:54.800]  leave it alone. It creates incredible prosperity, but they're threatened by prosperity that
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:02:00.960]  they don't control. And even really smart atheists like Stefan Malinu, I'm going to get him back
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:07.440]  on next week, admit. They go, no, I get it. Christianity is an operating system. The Christianity
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:16.720]  of Jesus, the reformer, God, is a great operating system compared to atheism, globalism, statism,
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:22.240]  Islam, all these other groups. It does create good societies. There's been some bad Christians
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:27.520]  and people that twist it and do bad things, but overall, the globalists don't like Christianity
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:33.080]  because it doesn't fit into their system. So when we start the next segment, I haven't
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:39.240]  seen it yet. We're going to roll this piece that was put together by Josh today. I just
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.960]  walked in like 10 this morning and I said, Hillary's saying, I have a dark heart. She
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.480]  says, I'm this evil, horrible person. She's the one always bragging about killing people
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:55.920]  and threatening Obama that he could end up like RFK in 2008. She's made all these other
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.600]  arrogant statements, throw something together to illustrate that. So it just came into the
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:03.680]  computer and he just sent it over to the control room. We're going to premiere that
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.920]  when we come back and then go to Mark Moreno at about 40 after, and then we're going to
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:11.840]  take your phone calls. If you want to start holding now, you're welcome. You know what?
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:15.480]  I'll just give the number out in like 24 after, so you're not holding too long. And then
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:21.080]  we'll take some phone calls a little bit of the next hour and then David Knight and Mark
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:27.840]  Hall are hosting the fourth hour of the worldwide transmission. And then I will return this
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:34.000]  Sunday, four to six PM for the Sunday live original edition. So that's all coming up
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.920]  today. We're also going to get into Russia. U.S. must separate Syrian rebels, terrorists
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:46.760]  before condemning Assad. Russia keeps saying, and our Pentagon has come out. It's been proven.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:49.560]  I remember talking to Colonel Shaffer and it was classified and he couldn't tell me,
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:52.320]  but I'd already talked to other people and they said that 90 plus percent was in the
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:57.800]  congressional briefing. I'd interviewed a congressman. I interviewed Jones, actually.
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:03.320]  Years ago, Walter Jones. And he'd said, well, we were giving briefings. I can't get into
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:08.440]  it, but the vast majority are jihadist Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia or Saudi Arabian funded
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:13.360]  out of, you know, the different stands. So I asked Colonel Shaffer, I go, I heard there
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:20.840]  was a briefing a few days ago. This is years ago, but the time a few days ago where 90
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:26.640]  plus percent are Wahhabist jihadi Sunnis. And he starts laughing. He goes, well, it's
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:30.480]  way more than that. And I said, well, what is it? And I went, is it 91? No. Is it 92?
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:35.000]  Is it 93? He just said, well, and I said 98. He goes, well, just stop right there. He wouldn't
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.720]  even say because he was actually turned out in those briefings with Congress closed door
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:46.200]  briefings. 98% are al-Qaeda. And so that was a big problem for Obama. So they spun it in
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:51.320]  Hillary that, oh, there's a new group ISIS, you know, that's who popped up. No, it's al-Qaeda.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:56.440]  They brought him there. They did it. And Russia's saying, look, stop saying it rid of Assad.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:02.440]  They'll get recital step down as soon as you pull al-Qaeda back. Bill Clinton rape accuser
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:07.680]  Juanita Broderick has said that she now fears for her life. But what does Juanita Broderick
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:12.200]  have to be concerned about? It's not like there's a body count behind the Clintons. No one
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:17.040]  has ever turned up dead after dealing with the Clintons. Paula Grober, Jerry Parks, Barry
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:22.240]  Seal, never, ever has anyone died after calling out the Clintons for scandalous behavior.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:26.920]  James McDougal. There haven't been women in the past turn up dead who were accusing Bill
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:32.000]  Clinton of sexual misconduct. Mary Mahoney. It's just a coincidence. All the suicides
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.760]  that have followed the Clintons, Vince Foster, Ed Willie, James Bunch, James Winston, Kathy
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:42.440]  Ferguson, Gandy Ball, Suzanne Coleman, Danny Caspararo. There haven't been any strange
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:47.760]  deaths that can be tied to the Clintons that have happened lately, Seth Rich, John Ash.
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:52.280]  So, since there's no evidence that the Clintons might have a hit team out to silence people
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:57.160]  who are a threat to their political empire, I think Juanita Broderick's fears are unfounded.

[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.840]  Next time you're mad at me to stand up in the Infowar and say, I don't know what's
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:23.880]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:30.440]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months. It's also what happens when you listen to
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:38.880]  the radio host Alex Jones. I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:48.160]  heart must be to say things like that. We came, we saw, we died. The intervention led
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:59.160]  by NATO to topple Qaddafi has led to a failed state. Maybe Livia was not perfect under Qaddafi,
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:04.560]  but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government. One unified country, it was a
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:11.440]  sovereign state. Livia now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:19.160]  dead and its cities are in ruin. I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:24.680]  their heart must be. Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries you took money
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:30.680]  against. Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely. They're mistreated.
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:37.560]  She claims to be their champion. We let ISIS take this position. It was Hillary Clinton
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:42.920]  that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS. We had this brilliant
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:49.040]  idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Lujahideen, equip them
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:54.320]  with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.880]  And we were successful. And this really just is so disgusting. When Vince Foster left his
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:05.040]  White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:09.400]  But the deputy White House counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned. There
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:16.880]  has been this urgency to end this. And, you know, historically that makes no sense. We
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:22.840]  all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California. Google is being accused
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:28.160]  of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:33.480]  marry stories like the Clinton body count story. That's according to website Infowars.
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:38.920]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.960]  that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:47.680]  circumstances over the last three decades. Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:52.880]  get us material and often very significant risks. We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:58.480]  Clinton. You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:05.920]  about my personal situation. As a 27 year old, I worked for the DNC. We shot in the back murdered
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:11.480]  just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:18.200]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:26.120]  And of course, he's talking about my dark heart after misrepresenting what I say.
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.240]  We're going to our guests in a moment, but let's be clear. There were FBI agents in the
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:35.880]  newspapers at the time and translators like Sabelle Edmonds and you name it, who I had on
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:40.920]  that said the Saudis brought in 15 people. They were protected. The FBI was ordered to not go
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:45.480]  after them. They were allowed to go to the flight schools. The flight schools called in Minnesota
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:51.320]  and Arizona and Texas and Florida were told stand down. And then I talked about how the
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:55.800]  congressional report back in 2002 said there was 28 pages that showed Saudi involvement
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:00.520]  and a stand down. So I said it's an inside job, bipartisan Lee covering up the Saudi
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:05.080]  connection, the car law group. I've been proven right, but I didn't say that the whole government
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:09.560]  blew up the towers or any of that they misrepresent. And then they go on to say that I say nobody
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:15.480]  died as handy hook. The children were actors. No, I didn't say that. Some people said that we had
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.040]  debates on air, but between groups, I got criticized by the real conspiracy theorists for
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:24.360]  saying no, I mean, I don't think they can pull off something like that. But Anderson Cooper did say
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:27.880]  he was there and he turns, he's on a blue screen. He disappears. I mean, I just said that he's to
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:34.200]  be investigated and I don't trust them because they got caught hiding the decline of temperature data
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:39.960]  in climate gates six years ago. They've been caught lying about so many things. Gruber saying,
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:44.600]  thank God the American people are dumb and don't have attention spans. You know, Obama hired me to
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:51.560]  screw them. I mean, he's on C-span saying this. These people are disconnected and they're getting
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:56.200]  crazier and crazier. And what does Hillary think she's doing coming out and attacking me by name
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:01.480]  and then creating straw man? It's crazy. Mark Moreno is one of the leading fighters against
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:06.040]  the global carbon tax, which is the world government program. The Pope now admits they want.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:12.360]  It's incredible. ClimateDepot.com, climatehustle.org. He is the producer of the award-winning
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:17.480]  climate hustle. When he was in Paris, they wanted him arrested and publisher of Climate Depot.
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:21.880]  Now we learn that there are a bunch of governors and legislatures meeting about arresting Mark
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:28.440]  Moreno. This has come out in the Associated Press for denying climate change that's man-made.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:32.760]  Mark Moreno currently serves as communications director for the committee for conservative
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:37.640]  tomorrow and executive editor and chief correspondent for the award-winning ClimateDepot.com,
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:42.840]  the number one website in the world fighting this takeover. A global warming and eco news center
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:49.240]  founded in 2009. He formerly was congressional advisor to the Republicans and Senator Inhofe's
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:54.360]  top guy. I'm not going to go over all of it. Moreno releases A to Z climate reality check report
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:14:01.000]  at the UN COP17 conference in South Africa and it just goes on from there. Thank you for joining us,
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:07.720]  Mr. Moreno, with the latest developments with these fraudsters. Am I wrong or does it seem like
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:12.360]  they're kind of on their heels right now doubling down with their propaganda? Even if they steal
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:18.120]  the election, I just have a just an overall view that these people, the wheels are coming off,
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:23.800]  they're falling apart. Well, this election is very important. And first of all, Alex, congratulations
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:30.760]  to you to draw a tax from Hillary Clinton. That is a great honor that shows that they recognize
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:36.680]  your power and your influence and your history here to be named by a presidential candidate,
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:40.920]  Hillary Clinton. So I just want to say congratulations to you from the alt-right
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:45.160]  out here in America. I don't know. I don't even know that term until they started.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:51.640]  Well, what she means is we're not the establishment, you know, Republicans
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:55.640]  that are in so much trouble politically. And I think this signifies, again, the huge realignment
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:15:00.520]  that's happening, my friend. Yeah. And answer your question. I interviewed the Weather Channel
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:04.200]  founder, John Coleman, the meteorologist who's called global warming a scam from the almost
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:09.320]  the very beginning. And his concern, and I'm seeing this a lot, is, yes, here's the deal,
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:15.000]  to skeptics have won every aspect of the climate debate up until now. And that means
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:20.120]  political opinion, the scientific battle, the political battle. Gallup polling shows there's
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:25.000]  no more concern about global warming now than there was in the 1980s. They failed.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:30.840]  And in terms of the science, we have in my film, Climate Hustle, you can actually out on DVD this
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:35.960]  week, climatehustle.com, details the politically less scientists, French socialist scientists,
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:41.000]  scientists who endorsed Obama and scientists who voted for Al Gore coming out skeptical on global
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.880]  warming. So the scientific battle has been won. And as you mentioned to A to Z, on every metric,
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:51.800]  including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, they're actually less storminess by on the climate
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:56.760]  time scales, according to the data, no matter what Al Gore says, no matter what NPR and all these
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:01.400]  other news, you know, ridiculous sites are claiming. So to answer your question in a real
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:07.720]  simple term, the problem is, because of President Obama's, and I'll use the word cunning, he has
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:13.480]  bypassed democracy. So even though skeptics stopped climate bill after climate bill, half a dozen
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:20.760]  in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, from going through, President Obama decided, I'll go to executive
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:25.720]  order. He split them right in. We essentially have a de facto climate bill imposed on us without a
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:30.760]  vote of Congress. And now we have a UN climate treaty the U.S. is adhering to without Senate
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:35.160]  ratification. They claim they don't need Senate ratification. They're bypassing the Constitution
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:41.800]  now on an international agreement. So if the next president, i.e. Hillary, continues these policies,
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:46.600]  John Coleman, the weather channel founder, is now openly saying he thinks Al Gore may have won the
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:51.480]  climate debate and a whole host of other issues. Because keep in mind, the global warming issue
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:56.760]  is about U.S. sovereignty. And you mentioned before, their phrase is global governance
[02:16:56.760 --> 02:17:00.440]  with the United Nations. That's what they're seeking. And that's what they're achieving.
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:04.360]  If the next president is Hillary Clinton, and she continues Barack Obama's policies,
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:10.360]  and she said she will, skeptics and Americans have lost the climate debate. Well, even though
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:16.040]  even though we won every single battle of the debate, we may lose the war because of Obama's
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:20.360]  willingness to bypass democracy. And because it's below the radar, and it's because Republican
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:26.360]  Party has done squat about it. And to translate this in to the bottom line,
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:31.320]  multinational select corporations that aren't free market are creating a monopoly on energy,
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:37.400]  exempting their own companies like we've seen with General Electric, and really putting a global
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:41.640]  tax on human activity. I mean, this is the final takeover.
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:47.080]  Yes. I mean, what they're trying to do now, and here's the bottom line. The reason this is the
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:54.440]  tipping point is if it's another four to eight years now of domestic climate legislation now
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:58.600]  through the EPA and international by adhering to a UN treaty that was never ratified.
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:02.920]  Just think of every Republican president beginning with Ronald Reagan on who said that we're going
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:07.960]  to dismantle the Department of Education. And guess what? It never happened. Once these become
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:13.560]  codified and solidified in the next four to eight years of the next president, we are going to be
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:18.200]  stuck. They're dug in. So how do we stop them? I mean, you and Lord Monkton have gotten so many
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:25.000]  other documents, all on WikiLeaks, top operations and stopped them. More and more of this is coming
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.480]  out. Soros is in a lot of trouble right now is his memos are coming out. I mean, is there a silver
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:34.040]  lining to stop this fraud? Well, the silver lining, first of all, is awareness. And let's talk
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:39.720]  about Donald Trump for a moment. He is the first Republican nominee in the history to be a strong
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:45.320]  global warming skeptic who actually gets the climate scam. And here's why. If you go back,
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:50.120]  first of all, it wasn't an issue in Ronald Reagan, but the first George Bush, George HW Bush,
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:55.400]  was a disaster. He signed on the Rio Earth Summit and signed up a treaty that got ratified,
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:00.200]  which then led to all these UN climate treaties. He was a globalist and the first George Bush
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:04.920]  laid the groundwork to stripping away U.S. sovereignty followed by Bill Clinton, who then
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:10.520]  signed the Kyoto Protocol and started pushing all these climate regulations. And then George W.
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:16.680]  Bush comes in, he rubber stamps the UN reports. He accepts all the science. He actually ran on
[02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:20.520]  climate bills and then he stopped them when he was president, but that's because Democrats
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:25.480]  didn't support it. And then you had Mitt Romney, who was a disaster when it came to climate and
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:30.360]  basically it sounded like Al Gore. You had John McCain, who was actually a sponsor.
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:36.360]  Every previous Republican nominee, at least since George HW Bush was a disaster on this issue.
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:39.640]  Donald Trump offers the best hope for one simple reason.
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:44.840]  Donald Trump has said he will withdraw. We're calling it Clexit. The Brexit was the British
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:50.520]  exit from the EU. Well, Clexit is the climate exit from the UN climate treaty. Donald Trump
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:56.040]  will lead the Clexit of the United States from the UN climate treaty. He's already said he's
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:20:01.880]  going to defund the United Nations climate panel and he will get rid of and rescind the executive
[02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:07.160]  orders from the EPA climate bill. Those three things are simple. I just wish Donald Trump would
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:12.200]  hammer it at every speech because the American people aren't aware of what's at stake,
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:16.040]  certainly when it comes to the climate and the global warming, how they literally
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:19.000]  may win the debate without the public being aware that they're winning.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:27.160]  Mark Moreno is our guest. Separately, paralleling what's happening with global governance and
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:31.560]  the rest of this, you obviously a few months ago interviewed Bill Nye, the science guy.
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:35.000]  He looked at your straight face and said, well, yeah, we might need to arrest you.
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:41.160]  And he had this power trip look on his face. It's weird to see all these little politicos and
[02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:48.280]  media hacks who are such wimps physically getting off on talking about the apparatus of political
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:54.600]  oppression of speech, which is obviously the bane of any free society. And to have all these major
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:58.280]  newspapers now, we talked about this years ago when the UK was talking about, you know,
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:02.520]  arresting Lord Moncton or signs up saying arrest you and people calling for it in Paris.
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:09.000]  We premiered your film earlier this year. But, but now it's in major newspapers going, yeah,
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:14.040]  we're, we're looking at arresting people who, you know, deny this. And they claim, oh, it's like
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:18.520]  tobacco companies, you know, saying cigarettes aren't bad for you. No, it's not. It's, it's,
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:23.480]  it's scientists, people across the board saying it's the sun. It's not carbon dioxide.
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:28.680]  Absolutely. Yeah. First of all, I interviewed Bill Nye and I asked him and in the film climate
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:32.280]  hustle, we feature Robert F. Kennedy Jr., someone else who doesn't seem physically well. I don't
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:36.360]  know what he's got, but he's got a very halting manner of speaking and seems doesn't seem very
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:42.040]  well physically. But he's openly calling for jailing global warming skeptics, Robert F. Kennedy
[02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:46.920]  Jr., calling it saying we belong at the Hague with three square meals and a cot with all the other
[02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:52.200]  war criminals. I asked Bill Nye about this and Bill Nye's answer was, well, we'll see, you know,
[02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:55.960]  tobacco people misrepresented and they're misrepresenting, you're committing fraud.
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:59.960]  Bill Nye is open to the idea and you're right. He had a little grin on his face like he was
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:05.720]  intrigued by the idea of jailing his dissenting opponents because they don't agree with him.
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:09.960]  And this is continuing. The California legislators talked about this. By the way,
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:13.320]  California Governor Jerry Brown, this is the absurdity of how far we've come.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:18.680]  He is now a new climate bill. California, I don't know how anyone can live in California,
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:24.360]  number one. Moon beam. But number two, he extended his climate bill another 10 years.
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:29.160]  And the local media in Sacramento was reporting this as Governor Brown is going to cool the
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:33.800]  earth one to two degrees if his legislation goes into effect. As though Governor Jerry Brown now
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:39.560]  in California has turned into some kind of magical wizard that can command the temperature of the
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:46.360]  earth. Well, in Venezuela, they have the kids before they get the school lunch program pray
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:51.160]  to Hugo Chavez for five years. It started five years ago. Now they've suspended that program
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:55.320]  as the country collapses. So I guess praying to Chavez doesn't get you the school lunch.
[02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:00.600]  That's right. It doesn't. And here's the thing. We're talking about all his intimidation and
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:06.280]  Hillary's bringing up this race issue in my film climate hustle. We have Al Gore talking about
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:10.920]  how the population of Africa is out of control and there's going to be too many Africans,
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:17.160]  a white, wealthy Western politician Al Gore lamenting too many Africans. Guess what Al Gore
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:23.400]  solution is? Quote fertility management. That's what we need in Africa. We have a white politician
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:27.880]  calling for managing Africans so that we'll have less black people. That's right. Your film is now
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:34.280]  available at the climate hustle dot o r g coming out this week. We also have the new film America
[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:38.280]  getting dealing with the EMP and other things available in four store dot com. And all these
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:42.040]  films are great to wake up, but particularly if I want to carry your film as soon as you're ready,
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:45.640]  I like to get some of these and carry these online at our store mark because
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:51.000]  this is something everybody should show their church teachers should go and get authorized,
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.200]  you know, to counter Al Gore's polar bears can't swim and penguins can't swim diatribe and actually
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:24:02.280]  see this film and actually see Al Gore say this because we have something similar. We have Obama
[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:05.960]  going to Africa and saying you can't have cars. You can't have air conditioning. Here's that club.
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:11.480]  Ultimately, if you think about all the youth that everybody's mentioned here in Africa,
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:15.320]  if everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:18.840]  and everybody's got air conditioning, everybody's got a big house,
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:26.840]  well, the planet will boil over. So again, obviously, folks, this is this is the permanent
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:33.000]  class state where he flies in on jumbo jets with 10 jets behind him, billions of dollars a year
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:38.120]  flying him around all this carbon footprint. Thank God, because they're a star for carbon dioxide
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:43.000]  right now. So it's a great thing. All this and he tells him you can't have a car or air conditioning.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:49.560]  This is how you sell true racism, telling Africans you can't have anything nice. Not,
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:53.800]  we're cleaning up technologies and innovating. And once the country industrializes population
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:59.880]  growth slows and stagnates, which they know, no, just sorry, you can't have a car or air conditioning
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:04.120]  and they're teaching them now not to have anything. This is an attack on prosperity.
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:09.240]  And the Obama administration has actually openly stopped major energy plants
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:13.160]  in modern energy from coming to Africa due to global warming concerns,
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:16.360]  which by the way, the Africans mainly are heating things. As you know, he pulled the
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:21.080]  studies cutting down plants. That's causing desertification, deforestation. The answer
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:27.800]  is bring the coal plants in, but no, no, no. Once you bring in modern energy, they stop using
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:33.560]  their local rivers as sewage plants. They stop burning dung and they don't live in huts made
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:38.040]  of dung. They stop burning the dung in the local wood. They actually have higher breathing in all
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:43.880]  this. By the way, we used to do, I mean, they're telling Africa under globalism and you can't
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:49.000]  have industrialization. It's a new form of colonialism. One of the scientists I interviewed
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.240]  said, what it is, is it's the white, wealthy Western world. Now, President Obama is actually not,
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:59.480]  you know, white, but it's a wealthy Western world imposing their view saying, hey, you can develop
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:05.320]  as we see fit. It's a new form of colonialism, but this colonialism is telling people they can't
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:09.400]  have what we have, what we've achieved. In other words, they have to have managed poverty. And the
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:15.560]  UN climate fund, which I call the climate slush fund, $100 billion a year, which the US is now
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:20.680]  participating, part of the UN Paris Agreement, they are going to be giving corrupt third world
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:25.320]  dictators, and by the way, third world's now politically incorrect term relegated to the
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:27.080]  alt-right, apparently. You're not supposed to say it.
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.400]  Let's say, let's say hellhole areas.
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:35.800]  Well, what they're going to do, the UN, is give this money to politicians who are best able to
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.840]  keep their citizens locked in poverty. And that means the politicians are going to get it,
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:44.280]  they're going to be able to build monuments and stadiums to themselves, name it, and they're
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.640]  going to be able to ensure their reelection. And meanwhile, they're going to keep economic
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:51.640]  growth down. Why? Well, I mean, that's the Royal Commission in 49. The British government funded
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.960]  it. It's on record. It's online. You can read it. They said, if we industrialize the third world,
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:00.200]  they'll become first world within 20 years. Their population will actually start dropping
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:03.720]  after that point. They'll have, you know, less than two kids, which is whether it's Japan or the
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:09.080]  US or Italy, it's the same paradigm. And, but they'll be independent and we won't control them.
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:14.760]  So we recommend we block it, let their population balloon, and then exploit those populations
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:19.720]  to basically create a new colonialism where we use that slave labor to leverage the West
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:23.960]  and lower standards here, thus controlling the entire population of the world. And hence,
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:29.800]  the new world order. And that's essentially what they're achieving, because by, by, by
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:34.040]  paying these, these corrupt governments and, and you know, some of them aren't even corrupt.
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:38.280]  They're just the typical self-interested politician. You can try to govern and bring in
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:42.680]  all this development, or you can take loads of cash come your way to not develop. What are you
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:46.120]  going to, what are they going to choose? And then they also pick the scientists that go to the
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:49.480]  UN and then they say, these are the world's top scientists. It's an entire scheme. And there's
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:54.360]  one more step than the IMF and World Bank with our tax money on record. It's all been, you know,
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:59.240]  released in, in leaks and things 2002. They dictate where the dictators can spend it.
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:03.960]  And it's always with little sweetheart deals with the very same multinationals.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:07.560]  And then they build wind milled farms and things. I mean, this is amazing.
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:11.800]  Well, here's the new, the new development here. This just happened in the past week.
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:18.360]  Alex NPR, National Public Radio has come out with this new, has a climate philosopher,
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:22.040]  I believe from John Hopkins University, a man named Patrick Ryder,
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:28.200]  believes his name, he's come out now and he wants to have a carbon tax for children.
[02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:32.520]  And he wants government policy now to discourage childbearing in the name of climate.
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:37.800]  He's going around telling everyone this and the Sierra Club has come on record now as saying
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:43.160]  it is having children should be a punishable crime unless you apply to the government for
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:48.200]  essentially a permit. So what this is, is they are implementing a one-job policy. They are now
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:53.080]  selling a one-child policy for the US. China, as China is abandoning their one-child policy.
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:57.720]  And by the way, one of the global warming scientists has praised China's one-child policy
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:03.560]  and actually done a calculation about how much carbon dioxide reductions change.
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:07.080]  Let's go further. I have repeatedly, I have three children, repeatedly,
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:11.800]  if I go to trendy Whole Foods or whatever, had women, it's always women come over and say,
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:15.640]  you shouldn't have three kids, it's bad for the earth. And I say to them, oh, I'm sorry,
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:19.720]  you decided to not have kids or can or no men want you. I mean, I'm sorry, they get really mad.
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:23.800]  I mean, it's a death cult, brother. These people are out of their minds.
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:28.680]  And they're saying we need to protect children by not having them. Well, that's like saying,
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:33.560]  I want to protect my house from fire by not building it. And this is, it's an anti-human
[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:37.240]  agenda. Patrick Moore, the co-founder. Let's talk about those numbers when we come back,
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:41.960]  because they're well known. If we don't have 2.1 children, global collapse is what we're going
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:48.280]  towards. And we have to stabilize world population. That means clean industrialization. But that then
[02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:53.560]  proliferates freedom to everybody in the new order they want it. The empires on the run. New

[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:06.120]  Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broderick has said that she now fears for her life.
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:10.600]  But what does Juanita Broderick have to be concerned about? It's not like there's a body
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:15.240]  count behind the Clintons. No one has ever turned up dead after dealing with the Clintons. Paula
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:20.840]  Grober, Jerry Parks, Barry Seal. Never, ever has anyone died after calling out the Clintons for
[02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:26.280]  scandalous behavior. James McDougal. There haven't been women in the past turned up dead who were
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:32.040]  accusing Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Mary Mahoney. It's just a coincidence all the suicides
[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:37.480]  that have followed the Clintons. Vince Foster, Ed Willie, James Bunch, James Winston, Cathy Ferguson,
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:43.480]  Ghandi Baugh, Suzanne Coleman, Danny Caspararo. There haven't been any strange deaths that can
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:49.320]  be tied to the Clintons that have happened lately, Seth Rich, John Ash. So, since there's no evidence
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:53.800]  that the Clintons might have a hit team out to silence people who are a threat to their political
[02:30:53.800 --> 02:31:11.160]  empire, I think Juanita Broderick's fears are unfounded. Not! This is Owen Schreuer from infowars.com.
[02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:15.880]  Thank you brother. Thank you guys for putting those out there. I am a relatively short-time
[02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:21.720]  listener and I'm a quite a supporter of your fine, fine products. Welcome to the info war.
[02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:26.680]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the
[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:31.720]  same time. I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, FQFX, Mason, all of that.
[02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:35.400]  All right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you? They're the most unbelievable
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:41.160]  products I've ever had in my life. What products are you taking? Everything from SuperMail to
[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:48.120]  BrainForce to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA force. So, when I just re-upped everything
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:53.800]  and I just went to auto-fill. Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see

[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:05.320]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:10.600]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:15.800]  mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[02:32:15.800 --> 02:32:22.600]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that
[02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:27.880]  lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:32.600]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all this
[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:36.360]  episode. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic
[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:41.960]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:45.400]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came
[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:49.960]  back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's
[02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:55.400]  great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you,

[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:09.240]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:33.960]  We now take you live. We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence on the front line
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:40.600]  and the heart of the resistance of the old conservative movement to Alex Jones. Hillary
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:46.920]  Clinton, as I've said, is emblematic of the rotting, corrupt, disconnected Washington system.
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:51.240]  It's Republican and Democrat. The entire Republican and Democratic Party establishment
[02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:57.560]  was left. The Republicans is trying to organize against Trump, the American people spewing incredible
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:03.080]  race baiting out of the clear blue sky, teaching that white people are inherently bad at the middle
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:08.840]  schools and high schools, elementary, colleges everywhere saying men can be on the women's
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:13.880]  teams. So it'll just all be weirdo men that want to go beat the women. I mean, you know,
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:18.680]  it's like, I'm on a women's football team. I'm on a, it's like some 400 pound, you know, guy.
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:26.600]  They're using insanity to control people, but it's true. These parasites are mentally ill
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:30.440]  themselves. They had a big Canadian study a few years ago, British study as well, that found the
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:35.480]  same numbers. If you're a liberal, a self-described liberal, modern liberal, you're six times more
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:41.640]  unlikely to steal, many more times likely to commit crimes and you don't give to charity.
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:47.160]  In some cases, 10 times less often than people that self-identify as conservatives or libertarians.
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:54.840]  You're a bunch of posers. And I look at Hillary, this facade, like a shaking in the wind,
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:35:00.520]  old barn and there comes a tornado and she's freaking out with fundraiser letters saying,
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:07.320]  shut down the alt media, alt conservative has no right to exist. And her moron followers,
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:12.680]  there's articles out today, don't even know what it means. So as bad as the news is that we're
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:16.520]  winning politically, but they just move forward because they're in control. I mean, there is
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:20.440]  light at the end of the tunnel because they're so disconnected. I mean, what did Hillary think
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.240]  was going to happen when she comes out and attacks all of us by name? They've been ignoring us
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:30.120]  forever. We're growing faster than ever. So what have you ignored? They still think they're in
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:34.600]  control. I mean, I know they're in control, the actual levers of the government, but not much
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:39.000]  more. I mean, nationalism is growing, the Brexit. Do you disagree with me, Mark Moreno of Climate
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:47.160]  Depot? Of course, your new film is out this week on DVD available at the website, theclimatehustle.org.
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:50.360]  What is your view on the state of the world right now?
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:58.440]  Well, I mean, it's essentially, it's moving toward what Al Gore has called the global governance
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:05.000]  movement. I chaired the UK Brexit move, but I will predict this. There's no chance in hell the UK
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:10.120]  will actually follow through with that. I think what they're going to do is force a recession
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:15.240]  if they have to scare the people enough, hold another vote until they keep holding votes,
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:20.200]  until they get the vote they want, which will not allow England to exit from the EU.
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:24.280]  The forces are very powerful that are against that. I think there was a lot of premature
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:29.560]  celebration with what England did. But I don't agree. We haven't won the war, but we're having,
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:33.960]  I mean, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, there's a thousand times more activity against globalism
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:38.520]  now than ever before. There is, I guess. And I'm looking at it from United States perspective,
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:44.040]  if Donald Trump fails to knock out Hillary here, I think what's happened is with the presidency
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:51.160]  of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the power of the executive branch has grown so out of proportion,
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:55.000]  so without checks and balances. The Hillary's going to be stepping into a dictatorial position.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:02.440]  Yes. And the Congress has become so weak that as much as there's so much more voices out there
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:07.160]  and so much more activity, they are also accumulating much more power. So I don't know,
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:12.840]  it's hard for me to be optimistic as I look, because when you look at the evolution of governments,
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:17.160]  you don't find governments that sort of evolve smaller and toward more liberty.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:22.040]  You get them a constant encroachment growing and a more centralized command and control,
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:26.600]  more central power, and then it's either a collapse or it continues. You don't get this
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:33.160]  slow evolution. Maybe Ronald Reagan's first term, we had a slight blip in terms of the freedom meter,
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:40.360]  but by Ronald Reagan's second term, it sort of went back up and we've been the slow, inexorable
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:45.560]  rides to more government. So I understand there's a lot of excitement, but I just think the power
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:51.160]  is so great on that side right now of globalism and on, you know, essential planning and global
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:57.080]  governance, whatever word you want to use, that maybe I'm more pessimistic. I mean, obviously,
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:03.320]  we're in a pickle pun intended right now, but, but with Jimmy Kimmel. Don't put that jar,
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:08.520]  she's strong. She's fit to be president. She opened the jar. Exactly. I mean, we're in a pickle
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:14.120]  right now, but at the same time, all I'm saying is I was on there 20 years ago, almost no one
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:17.720]  knew the Federal Reserve was private. Almost no one knew the stock market was rigged. Now,
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.800]  everybody knows that. And it just seems like, yeah, they can block Brexit for a while. We said
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.600]  that would happen, but they never voted to enter it in the beginning and people know they're going
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:31.960]  to be held hostage. And I mean, how long can Goldman Sachs fund the carbon tax movement while
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:36.120]  they appoint presidents in Europe? I mean, it just, this can't go on forever.
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:44.760]  It can't, but the, the, the problem right now is if Hillary Clinton's elected, this becomes
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:49.960]  imposed upon us. This, you can just start with the UN climate tree. That'll be imposed upon us.
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:54.760]  And we're going to go four to eight years into the future. It becomes harder and harder to
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:58.760]  withdraw. I get it. I get it. We're waking up, but they already beat us to the finish line
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:02.280]  and are building the stockade, building the prison that we show up. They're like,
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:07.640]  by the way, step right in. It's already done. Go back to Ronald Reagan's 1964 speech for Barry
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:13.160]  Goldwater. In it, he railed against Medicaid, social security, what Republican would ever even
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:18.280]  talk about that. Now these things become part of our laws and our system. I mentioned the
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:25.560]  Department of Education. We adapt to the slavery. Let alone lead a worldwide movement to do this.
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:31.800]  The US is luckily the most free because we're behind Western Europe. But most of the only reason
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:34.840]  we're doing better than the other sinking economies, we're not doing great, but we're still doing
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:40.120]  the best because our leaders haven't implemented their plan yet. And that way we're getting there.
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:44.360]  You know, the eight years, again, I don't want to, it's really a bipartisan issue. George W.
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:49.480]  Bush and the first Bush were probably as much of a vocalist as President Obama. They, you know,
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.120]  they, they understood it. I mean, you had the first Bush came up with the new world order,
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:40:01.400]  if you recall back in 1988, 1990, he tied us into all this entanglements. And I think the,
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:05.480]  the Bush family itself has done as much or more.
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:09.480]  I agree. And that's who the Clintons vacation with. I mean, we better repudiate this lady
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:12.920]  and all these leftists that hate the TPP and how they stole that from Sanders.
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:15.480]  They are crazy if they don't vote for Trump.
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:21.720]  I agree. And here's the other thing that the second term of Bill Clinton was probably the best in
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:26.360]  terms of, you know, liberty and freedom because you had total gridlock in Washington. You had,
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:30.440]  you had the media and politicians focusing on a monoclonal sex.
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:33.240]  Exactly. We had prosperity for a few years because everything was gridlocked.
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:38.920]  Yes. And we, I remember gas was 75 cents a gallon in the DC area when President,
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:43.080]  during President Clinton's second term. And you had the Republicans keeping him in check,
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:46.200]  Republicans had the. And the founder said, we want gridlock.
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:49.240]  He's always like, there's gridlock. It's horrible. Americans want gridlock to stop.
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:51.480]  No, no, they built it to tie government's hands.
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:55.240]  And the other key thing here is that Hillary Clinton is no Bill Clinton.
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:58.200]  Bill Clinton in his own way was a pragmatist in many ways,
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:03.400]  but Hillary Clinton is not. And Hillary Clinton is poised to, again,
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:08.040]  secure this legacy of President Obama and the legacy of George W. Bush of the executive order.
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:11.320]  What do you make of her openly saying she wants to come after the independent press? I mean,
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:14.440]  they're already in the news saying they want to arrest you. They have attorney generals
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.880]  investigating you. I mean, this is in the news investigating everybody. I mean,
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.120]  this is getting surreal. I mean, these people really would sit back and watch us put in a
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:27.080]  gulag. I mean, they are flaming tyrants. Yeah, Hillary officials, I know they're going to come
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:31.160]  after you. They've already mentioned Breitbart and they're looking for all ways to shut down
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:36.680]  this media. And they've been trying that for years. That's going to be harder to do because
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:40.040]  of just the explosion. I mean, you think of what's happened. You mentioned you came on,
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:44.360]  I guess, 20 years ago. Well, back 20 years ago, you didn't even have, let's say, you didn't have,
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:47.960]  I don't think you had the Drudge Report. You didn't have Fox News. You didn't have the whole
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:53.320]  proliferation of cable. You didn't have all the internet. You didn't have a whole host of all
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:58.280]  this new media. It's going to be very difficult for them to shut down this in a sec, but it's
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:02.280]  going to be even more difficult for us to actually slow the global trend.
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:05.640]  Well, I agree. It's like whack-a-mole. They've infiltrated and taken Fox down. That's an admitted
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:10.120]  code with the whole fake sex scandals. We knew that was going on. And Media Matters said we're
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:13.880]  going to infiltrate organizations and take them down. Politico said they would. They did it.
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:17.800]  And they've got Megan and others doing a great job for them. But if you expand,
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:21.800]  it's like whack-a-mole. You take Fox News down. It wasn't perfect. Anyways, it just spreads
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:26.360]  everywhere else. It's like you smash it. It just splatters over here. And they're really getting
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:33.000]  upset. Mark Moreno, the new film is out. I'm going to have my folks in shipping call you and get
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.080]  that for our video and bookstore as well. But right now, it is exclusively available at climate
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:42.120]  hustle.org. It just came out. We're in an info war, folks. Get it. Show it to everybody you know.
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:47.320]  Thank you so much, Mark. Thank you, Alex. Appreciate it. Wow. I just can't believe that we've
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:51.960]  actually gotten to this point where they're having hearings with, what is it, 14 different
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:56.760]  attorney generals and governors, secret meetings on how to arrest climate change deniers.
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:00.920]  And that they're in the news saying, yeah, we're going to shut down Breitbart. And
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:05.560]  you know, the Supreme Court justice comes to drudge and says, look out. They're going to
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:10.120]  start trying to shut things down next year. And the internet gets handed over in two months.
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:17.000]  I mean, this is crazy. But I tell you, I look at how doddering and tottering, and I don't mean
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:22.040]  as like an old person was just doddering around. Hillary is, it's just again, it's a symbol. It's
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:26.840]  a logo. It's emblematic of these dinosaurs and they may have the power and the control, but they
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:32.760]  just are disconnected and they can't deal with people that are so committed to what they're doing
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:39.160]  that they're never going to stop. I mean, I cannot stop. I compulsively tell the truth.
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:47.640]  Compulsively, compulsively. And I just cannot shut up. I cannot stop. And it's the opposite.
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:51.160]  When they make threats and stuff, it just makes me have more energy. I can't stand it actually.
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:56.840]  When do I get a break? Okay.
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:03.560]  Top trending Google story. It's up on info wars.com right now. It just ties into everything. I said
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:08.440]  last week, how long until Dr. Drew has kicked off CNN? I actually asked that question. How
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:12.600]  long until Julian Assange is dead? James Woods asked that two weeks ago, and then somebody
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:16.360]  tried to assassinate him, you know, scaling the building, climbing over the barbed wire,
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.520]  being chased by security, trying to climb to his window because he's about to leak a bunch
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:26.200]  more of this data on on Hillary. But here it is top Google search. Oh, the people want to know
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:32.120]  what did Dr. Drew say about Hillary? Adan Salazar writes, Dr. Drew
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:38.840]  showed drop days after discussing Hillary's health after five successful years. They didn't even wait
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:45.880]  a month or anything. They just, how dare you? So let's play what got him canned. Let's play
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:51.160]  what got him shut off. You know, we have the famous tape of what got judge Andrew Napolitano,
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:56.360]  his own show that was popular. It's canceled. And I can't give you the inside baseball on
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:00.520]  that, but let me let me assure you they're in there telling other hosts right now,
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:03.960]  stop it or you're fired. We're not going to renew your contract. We may cancel it.
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.040]  And those hosts are driving across town at night to meet and talk about a new network.
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:12.440]  And then people say, Oh, see, Trump just wants to do networking. Trump's not going to give up.
[02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:17.080]  It's not like he planned all this to get a network. He's not giving up. Understand comprende.
[02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:22.360]  So let's go ahead and go to what got Dr. Drew fired. Here it is.
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:27.880]  But the fact is she released her medical record some time ago. And if you listen to my show last
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:32.280]  week, I just I just called a friend of mine, Dr. Robert Heising, who is an excellent internist
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:37.400]  pulmonologist. And we just dispassionately sat and evaluated the medical record that she had
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:42.520]  released. And based on the information that she is providing her doctors have provided,
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:47.480]  we were gravely concerned not just about her health care, not about her health, but her health care.
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:53.560]  Why? Well, it's hard for people to understand. Both of us concluded that if we were providing
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:58.440]  the care that she was receiving, we'd be ashamed to show up in the doctor's lounge. We'd be laughed
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:05.080]  out. It's she's receiving sort of 1950 level sort of care by our evaluation. So we took a look at
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:11.080]  her record. And here are the basic facts. She had two episodes of what's called deep venous thrombosis,
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:16.840]  common problem, blood clots in the leg. She also has hypothyroidism. And she'd been treated for
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:21.800]  hypothyroidism with something called armor thyroid, which is very unconventional and something that
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:27.160]  we used to use back in the 60s. And both he and I went, hmm, that's weird. And by the way, wow,
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:32.840]  armor thyroid sometimes has some weird side effects. Oh, well, okay, so she goes on Coumadin.
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:37.640]  That's weird. Because Coumadin really isn't even used anymore. Now we use eloquence or
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:41.800]  serralto, things like this, certainly the somebody, the presidential candidate would get one of the
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:47.160]  newer anticoagulants, then she falls, hits her head. And as a complication of that has something
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:53.080]  called a transverse sinus thrombosis. This is an exceedingly rare clot. I've only seen one of
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:59.240]  these in my career, which is a clot in the collecting system for the cerebral spinal fluid.
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:04.600]  And it essentially guarantees that somebody has something wrong with their coagulation system.
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:09.480]  Well, she's had two clots, a transverse sinus thrombosis. What's wrong with her coagulation
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:16.360]  system? And oh, by the way, armor thyroid associated rarely with hypercoagulability.
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:21.000]  So the very medicine that doctors are using may be causing this problem. And they're using an
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:26.120]  old fashioned medicine to treat it. What is going on with her health care? It's bizarre. I got to
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:30.280]  say it. Look, maybe they have reasons, but at a distance, it's enough. And you hear the rest of
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:34.360]  the interview that got him fired. But but that's the interview that got Dr. Drew fired. It's up
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:40.120]  on info wars.com. I put it back up and give people the headline. These are very, very, very, very
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:44.360]  serious times we live in. And this guy is not a conservative, he's not a liberal. By the way,
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:49.000]  that LA radio station, he was on talking about that and several others, they took the interview
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.960]  down and got rid of the transcript the next day. So they are scared of this as more doctors come
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:59.240]  out, prestigious doctors and say something's wrong with her. Hillary has had brain surgeries.
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:06.680]  She's been in a hospital for a year in 2012, 2013. She's got problems. But doesn't matter.
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:13.400]  Jimmy Kimmel makes a joke that I'm concerned about pickles. And I said it was a joke that I was
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:17.560]  showing caddyshack clips and stuff. They cut those out. I said it was a joke illustrating,
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:22.920]  though, that they were staging, taking your pulse and having her open a jar. When you pop a jar of
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:33.320]  pickles, it pops and he makes fun of that. But then when he goes to his sidekick, who I call
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:36.360]  a security guard, he was dressed up like a security guard later on show, you know, when he goes to
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:43.320]  his Ed McMahon, when he opens the jar, it pops on camera. That's what they do. You don't
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:49.080]  open them like a can of peanut butter. You open them like a jar of pickles. And so I trolled them.
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:52.760]  I knew they'd pick up on this. I mean, I had a good, you know, I was like desperate to get on
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:58.760]  Jimmy Kimmel. I troll people all the time. And I know, you know, what they pick up on. Bro, you
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:03.400]  say, I'm going to skip this break because I have to have the time constraints. Bro, when you say,
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:07.720]  okay, so what if we did stage it? What's the big deal? You're making it look like she's in great
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:13.080]  health. You call it entertainment. And then you threaten me at the end and say, the new world
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:18.920]  order is going to come after me when you're waving this, you know, this gun around. So let's go ahead
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:23.560]  and go to the Jimmy Kimmel clip, which we are analyzing under fair use. And it's about me.
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:27.000]  So I'm allowed to play it because they hit you with copyright all the time. Let's go to it.
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:32.680]  Thanks for supporting me and my time of need, because I'll tell you something on Monday night,
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:37.880]  Hillary Clinton was here. She's right over there. And since then, I found myself smack dab in the
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:42.520]  middle of an online conspiracy theory. As you may know, many of Hillary Clinton's opponents
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:46.680]  have been questioning whether she's healthy enough to be president. So when she was here,
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:51.000]  I challenged her to open a jar of pickles to see if she was strong enough to do it.
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:56.360]  And she did it. And all hell broke loose. Thousands of people, maybe even millions of
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:01.640]  people are convinced that I somehow rigged the pickle jar. For real. I'm not kidding. One of
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:05.560]  those people is a guy named Alex Jones, who I happen to find very entertaining. He's one of
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:11.560]  those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 911. He believes everything. But I saw this
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:17.720]  last night, Alex applied his investigative powers to a pickle jar that he believes was loosened.
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:24.520]  There's no pop when she opens it and she acts like she has to turn it all the way around like she's
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:34.280]  opening a can of peanut butter. But anyone who's opened a sealed can of pickled vegetables,
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:41.720]  whether it be tomatoes, whether it be garlic, whether it be olives, whether it be pickled fruit,
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:47.160]  knows there is a pop. You don't turn around it. You can't open a can of pickles that way. You
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:53.480]  pressure down and pop it open and then unscrew it. There's no pop. She acts like it pops at the end.
[02:50:54.040 --> 02:51:01.800]  This is completely and totally fake. I agree. This is a conspiracy. This video is about seven
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:06.520]  minutes long. During that seven minutes, he calls it a pickle can like 30 times. This is part of
[02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:13.080]  the joke. Like I said, Kanye West. And that wasn't the end of this. It went on. First, let's show it
[02:51:13.080 --> 02:51:24.600]  blown up and then we'll show it in slow motion. Here it is. No pop. Listen, he's got a microphone
[02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:32.040]  around his chest. Total acting. No pop. And then she just lifts it off the top. That's not how you
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:40.040]  open a can of pickles. Right. Only a maniac would open a can of pickles. If you're ever feeling bad
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:44.360]  about your job, just remember there's a grown man who spent a full seven minutes yelling about me
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:49.960]  in a pickle jar on television. And by the way, let's say we did loosen the jar. What is opening
[02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:54.680]  pickles even prove? I mean, I have to imagine that one of the perks of being president is you never
[02:51:54.680 --> 02:51:59.640]  have to open pickles yourself again. Probably not even allowed to open pickles. So then after
[02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:06.040]  studying the video evidence, the tape, the Alex moved to the physical part of his investigation.
[02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:11.320]  I'm going to show you again. If I zoom in on this to show people what Hillary did. She claims she
[02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:15.240]  went around and then it just comes right off like that. She does this whole fake like she's
[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:20.760]  training effect. Let me copy Hillary Clinton real quick. Give me a wide shot.
[02:52:23.880 --> 02:52:28.360]  This obviously means you're out here. I'm making a Bernie Sanders sound. Killing in a big circle.
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:31.880]  And then it comes off. They don't come off like,
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:41.000]  mostly they're ready. Like that. They come off like pressure. Just open. What the hell is going on here?
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:44.120]  Well, what are you doing, Jonah, opening a can of pickles?
[02:52:45.720 --> 02:52:47.960]  To say work is fair as he does. I mean, we're countering you.
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:56.200]  There are people in the pickle industry who devote this much time and energy. Well, we notice
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:01.160]  there's no pop. I mean, you're full of it. Before the pickle jar gets subpoenaed. And if it does come
[02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:06.920]  to that, I asked our billing security if they had any footage of the jar backstage before it wound
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:11.720]  up in the hands of Hillary Clinton. And we did find some, and this might shed some light on this situation.
[02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:24.120]  Hillary Clinton is going to be here in a little while. Tonight on the show, I'm going to ask her
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:29.560]  to open this pickle jar to see if she's strong enough to be president and need you to guard this.
[02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:34.440]  Make sure nobody loosens it. Make sure nobody taps it. None of that stuff. Okay. Okay. It's
[02:53:34.440 --> 02:53:40.360]  very important. It must not be tampered with in any way. I'm counting on you. Okay. The future
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:44.760]  of this country could depend on this jar. Okay, Jimmy. Thank you.
[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:54.840]  You're going to pop?
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:00.680]  Did you just eat a pickle out of that jar?
[02:54:00.680 --> 02:54:12.200]  I love pickles.
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:26.280]  But I don't want to make a joke out of this. The stakes obviously are very high and clearly Alex
[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:31.800]  Jones has put a great deal of thought into this subject. So Alex, if you are watching, and I know
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:36.200]  that you are always watching over us, I have something to say. Let's get in. Can you get in
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:43.480]  real close here and give me a light? You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex? The plan was
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:48.520]  so simple. All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles and the White House would be all ours,
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:53.800]  mine and hers. We had it all worked out. This went all the way up to Vlasik.
[02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:59.960]  I like Jimmy Kimmel best of any of those guys. I like Colbert too, but
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:06.840]  look, expanding on this and we're going to play the rest of it. The implication that he's not working
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:10.280]  for a major network that's pro-Hillary, the implication that he wasn't trying to make her
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:14.280]  look good and make fun of people, the implication that he's going to be at the White House and
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:19.560]  become president if she wins. They're building this straw man. Just like they said that I say
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:24.200]  nobody died at Sandy Hook and they were all actors. No, I said the whole thing's very, very
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:28.040]  suspicious and should be looked at. Some people, other people did say that. So again, this is how
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:33.080]  they misrepresent, but then he gets into the threatening part. I mean, imagine if I had this
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:36.600]  little Hillary doll, somebody sent us that says all these true Hillary statements.
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:44.520]  Imagine if I, which I wouldn't do it because even the image of her is holy,
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:50.200]  shot this with a BB gun. They would send a secret service implying that I won't harm against Hillary.
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:54.440]  I don't. I don't want her to be a martyr. I want her to get a jury trial for what she's done.
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:59.960]  But imagine, they basically threatened me next and they say, oh, it's all a big joke,
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:02.840]  but Hillary has this whole string of death behind her.
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:12.680]  I came, I saw, he died. That's why this isn't funny, Mr. Kimmel. But let's go ahead and see
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:20.040]  and it says worship this woman. We can play that club. Worship this adult creature that is supposedly
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:25.560]  our savior, but let's go back to Kimmel. He just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:31.560]  The plan was so simple. All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles and the White House would
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:37.720]  be all ours, mine and hers. We had it all worked out. This went all the way up to Vlasik.
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:42.760]  Vlasik. But you couldn't leave it alone, could you? With your twisting and your
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:47.640]  popping and your poking your nose where it shouldn't be poked, you brutal it right off our pickle can.
[02:56:48.440 --> 02:56:53.160]  You just couldn't stop, couldn't, but it stops now because I'm afraid this little game is over,
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:59.720]  Alex. Now that you had to go and open your big mouth, I have no choice but to kill these pickles.
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:05.880]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:19.320]  They have insurance to be shooting BB guns in our oldest studio. New World Order sends its regards.
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:25.720]  Yeah, they send it to Libya and Syria. They're starting a war on Iraq again and
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:29.720]  starting a war with Russia and they send their regards all over the place. Millions of dead
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:34.280]  Iraqis and George Bush says it's a good price to pay. So does Manuel Albright. I know you're a
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.520]  comedian, but see, you've gotten political now and you're delving into waters you don't know about.
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:43.160]  They were eating pizza and, you know, drinking beer on the man's show. That is your arena.
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:48.200]  But ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to go ahead now. I'm told this is the same BB gun.
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:52.200]  I was looking around and I had it in my safe. I never even used it and Buckley loaded it up for
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:55.560]  me and so this is not scripted. Kind of like I couldn't open one of the pickle jars right at
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:01.080]  first. We'll see if this thing even works. It's loaded. It's ready and I guess that symbolizes
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:05.720]  some other poor witness. Maybe the latest wiki leaker, you know, who got shot four times in the
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:10.200]  back and people get mad at me making a joke out of, well, it's okay. Jimmy Kimmel did with a known
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:14.840]  murderer that overthrows all these different countries. Oh yes, it's very powerful. There you
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:19.400]  go. I asked Buckley what would work on air and that's an even better joke because nothing ever
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:24.520]  does work. He says, oh yes, that's all you do. It works. See, see, that's powerful. That was not
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:29.960]  even rig comedy, but I transmute the fact that nothing works right around here into pure comedy.
[02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:39.000]  The genius level is unbelievable. I can't open pickles. I can't shoot BB guns, but you can,
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:48.040]  Kimmel. That's the conspiracy. Kimmel's a robot. I told him it would work. I knew it. I mean, what
[02:58:48.040 --> 02:58:54.760]  is the deal around here? Brain force. It's completely different. Cry a bottle of it. Rob do
[02:58:54.760 --> 02:59:00.520]  joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force did. I've been working all
[02:59:00.520 --> 02:59:06.520]  day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of run down.
[02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:09.800]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good job on
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:14.040]  the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them and about 20
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:19.000]  minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of clears up. Got four and a half stars.
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:22.520]  People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party
[02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:27.320]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[02:59:27.320 --> 02:59:31.480]  based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a
[02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:35.800]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this
[02:59:35.800 --> 02:59:41.080]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in. You will find
[02:59:41.080 --> 02:59:49.160]  brain force and other game changing products at info wars life.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:52.760 --> 02:59:55.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:04.200 --> 03:00:05.880]  Well, if you just tuned in, you missed it.
[03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:11.560]  He simulated Hillary executing a wiki liquor and
[03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:15.880]  before America can be great again, the bullets into slow motion,
[03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:22.680]  watching lightness of the sky flow down. We've seen magic here today, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:00:22.680 --> 03:00:27.800]  just earlier. We'll have to sniff that into the club, but getting serious here with everybody.
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:35.880]  A lot of folks that they're and say, Alex, you shouldn't ever joke around on the show. They
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:40.680]  can take it out of context. We've gotten in this position by being a bunch of stuffed shirts and
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:45.000]  caring what people think about us. And then men just go around all acting real executive and
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:49.400]  acting real serious and acting like everything's perfect. And they've got all the answers
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:54.920]  instead of actually getting out there and being real. And so I do engage in comedy and humor and
[03:00:54.920 --> 03:00:59.880]  they do take it out of context. But then we get huge publicity out of it. I only do it every once
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:03.320]  in a while. And then everybody tunes in to hear what the show is really about.
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:12.200]  I got to say though, Drudge has had his link since yesterday evening. Clinton targets Alex Jones.
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:16.360]  He responds, I'm not scared of you, bully. Thank you, Matt Drudge, for doing that.
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:21.240]  And I'll tell you what I'm getting at. Basically, multinational governments, multinational
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:27.000]  corporations, multinational organizations, multinational systems, media, you name it.
[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:36.280]  Drudge is like the bulletin board in the global commons. And I don't want to get killed.
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:40.600]  I don't want to get audited attacked. But I mean, stuff's happened before.
[03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:44.920]  And I understand there's no future if I don't do what I'm doing now, even though quite frankly,
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:52.920]  it carries its risk. It's dangerous. But to have Drudge force Bilderberg out in the open
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:57.640]  with our stories and to focus on how we're standing up against Hillary, when he's certainly a target
[03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:05.080]  as well, is a great thing. And Drudge has really led, as an example for others, not just giving
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:10.360]  him praise, the movement to have the libertarian patriot movement, the new media movement,
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:14.920]  the new Enlightenment, the true liberal movement, they call it the alt-conservative movement,
[03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:22.840]  to work together and not all be territorial. I tell you, all those major sites out there
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:31.800]  that are true alt-conservative sites have become anti-globalists and have gotten on board and
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:36.040]  have woken up and have taken action and are not backbiting and not backstabbing and not
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:40.120]  freaking out over who gets a scoop or who covers what first, because we're going to lose everything
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:44.920]  and we don't beat the New World Order. And Drudge, I know behind the scenes, but also with his work,
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:49.240]  has brought folks together and I've tried that too. I've really worked as hard as I can to do that
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:54.280]  because it isn't about having the biggest website, it isn't about being number one, even though Drudge
[03:02:54.280 --> 03:03:00.680]  is number one, it's about the responsibility of that. And so the listeners are always thinking,
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:04.440]  me, for what I've done, I want to thank you, the listeners, you come number one after God.
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:10.280]  But then when it comes to support and overall really helping our stories punch through,
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:14.040]  Matt Drudge, he's taken a lot of risks supporting us, it's paid off, I mean we've changed the world
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:19.400]  together and it's a very, very special thing that all of us together, kind of that triangle
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:24.360]  of Drudge, Info Wars and you, the population, all of us together, there's no point of that
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:30.040]  triangle that is more important than the other. It's all very, very synergistic.
[03:03:30.040 --> 03:03:34.360]  And the New World Order just doesn't know what to do. I mean, they're not going to kill me,
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:39.000]  tomorrow, or shut my sight down tomorrow and that fixes their problems. That'd just make it worse,
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:43.720]  be like pouring gasoline on a fire. And so we're in a very, very exciting time. David Knight's
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:48.920]  about to take over, I didn't even plug last hour, we've got Hillary shirts at cost of $9.95, that
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:52.280]  includes shipping, that's why it's at cost, so shipping's like five bucks, the shirt's like five
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:56.600]  bucks for us. Hillary for prison, she calls me Darkheart and all this, it's called the Darkheart
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:04:02.600]  Special, $9.95. And then we've also got the new Selenium in, the key missing link out there for

[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:16.600]  What's coming up? Alex, we're going to talk about some new things that have surfaced about Hillary
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:21.800]  Clinton, of course. She's got her own conspiracy theories that she doesn't want to talk about,
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:26.120]  but she's also been involved with actual conspiracies. And of course, we're going to
[03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:30.600]  go back a little bit and refresh people's memories, but there's some new stuff that's come out.
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:35.800]  Breitbart is talking about revelations that were in Clinton Cash about how there are multiple
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:41.720]  donors and board members on the Clinton Foundation convicted of fraud and other criminal charges
[03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:45.480]  that are now walking as well as everybody else connected with Clinton. You either walk
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:50.280]  or you get killed. All right, that's David Knight. Folks, we need your support, your prayers,
[03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:58.200]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLives.com for the incredible, bioabsorbable Selenium and your
[03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:04.200]  Hillary for President shirts at cost. Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broderick has said that she
[03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:09.480]  now fears for her life. But what does Juanita Broderick have to be concerned about? It's not
[03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:14.040]  like there's a body count behind the Clintons. No one has ever turned up dead after dealing with
[03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:19.800]  the Clintons. Paula Grober, Jerry Parks, Barry Seal, never, ever has anyone died after calling
[03:05:19.800 --> 03:05:24.920]  out the Clintons for scandalous behavior. James McDougal. There haven't been women in the past
[03:05:24.920 --> 03:05:30.280]  turn up dead who were accusing Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Mary Mahoney. It's just a
[03:05:30.280 --> 03:05:35.480]  coincidence all the suicides that have followed the Clintons. Vince Foster, Ed Willie, James Bunch,
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:41.160]  James Winston, Kathy Ferguson, Gandy Baugh, Suzanne Coleman, Danny Caspararo. There haven't
[03:05:41.160 --> 03:05:46.840]  been any strange deaths that can be tied to the Clintons that have happened lately. Seth Rich,
[03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:51.880]  John Ash. So, since there's no evidence that the Clintons might have a hit team out to silence
[03:05:51.880 --> 03:05:57.080]  people who are a threat to their political empire, I think Juanita Broderick's fears are unfounded.
[03:05:57.080 --> 03:06:03.640]  Not! This is Owen Schreuer from Infowars.com. A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true

[03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:05.720]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been called
[03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:10.440]  the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:16.360]  deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[03:07:16.360 --> 03:07:21.560]  and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They took the good halogen
[03:07:21.560 --> 03:07:27.080]  out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening
[03:07:27.080 --> 03:07:33.400]  today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more
[03:07:33.400 --> 03:07:38.680]  information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many
[03:07:38.680 --> 03:07:44.200]  experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull
[03:07:44.200 --> 03:07:49.160]  these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential
[03:07:49.160 --> 03:07:56.120]  in my view to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com

[03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:23.240]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:31.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host this last hour. We're going to
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:36.360]  be joined at the bottom of the hour by filmmaker Mark Hall, who's done a very good documentary
[03:08:36.360 --> 03:08:41.560]  called Killing Ed. We've had him on before. We're having him on again because like us,
[03:08:41.560 --> 03:08:45.240]  when you get over the target, you start taking flak and he's getting a lot of flak.
[03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:50.440]  And it's coming to a head this weekend. He's going to be having some screenings of his film,
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:55.320]  Killing Ed, talking about the worst case scenario for charter schools. And of course,
[03:08:55.320 --> 03:09:03.000]  there's always potential for crony capitalism for crime and corruption and graft, as we've seen with
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:09.240]  the Hillary Clinton Foundation and other pay for play types of government involvement with
[03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:13.800]  private corporations, especially the large private corporations. Anytime you've got large
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:19.720]  corporations who are going to come in and get government money, government contracts directly,
[03:09:19.720 --> 03:09:24.760]  it's going to invite corruption and other issues. Now one of the worst cases of what's going on
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:31.000]  with charter schools is the network of Fatala Gulen schools. And you may recognize that name,
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:35.560]  maybe you want. We'll talk about that coming up. But as the New York Times pointed out earlier,
[03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:42.040]  they said charter schools are tied to Turkey that are growing in Texas. Yeah, they're very large. We
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:48.920]  have the most of these charter schools here in Texas. We've got about 45 at the last count I saw,
[03:09:48.920 --> 03:09:54.200]  maybe 46 here in Texas alone. He's going to talk about that. He's going to talk about the screenings
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:58.680]  that are coming up here in Texas. They were shut out of the South by Southwest Festival,
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:04.360]  even though this has a lot of content here in Texas. But this is something that is nationwide.
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:10.200]  And we hear the pay to play of the Clinton Foundation. Fatala Gulen is a big contributor
[03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:17.800]  to Hillary Clinton. And the question is, is this a pay to stay? Erdogan is saying that he believes
[03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:22.040]  that the Gulenists in Turkey, and these are the two different power bases, and we're not saying
[03:10:22.040 --> 03:10:27.800]  either one of them are good guys. They're both Islamists who want to set up an international
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:35.960]  Sharia law, but Caliphate. But this is a competition that is going on within Turkey. And of course,
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:42.520]  Gulen is wanted by Erdogan, trying to extradite him. And you've heard a lot of that back and
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:47.720]  forth in terms of the Turkey coup. But I want to talk before he comes on, of course, about Hillary
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:53.800]  Clinton. It was interesting yesterday. She came out of her prepared speech, her teleprompter speech,
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:11:02.200]  and she hasn't had a press conference in 265 days now. Now, if you look at the fact that she
[03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:08.680]  had her last press conference before any of the voting and the primaries began, think about the
[03:11:08.680 --> 03:11:13.960]  fact that it's not going to go a full year. The last press conference was December 5th of last year.
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:19.320]  No voting had taken place at that time. And of course, she's not going to go a full year without a
[03:11:19.320 --> 03:11:24.600]  press conference before the election on November the 8th. So if you want to take a look at that and
[03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:29.240]  take off about a month, you know, you've got 335 days. It's been 265 days. In other words, she's
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:35.800]  gone 80% of the time that she's going to be before the electorate. 80% of the time has now already
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:40.520]  passed without a single press conference from Hillary Clinton. And I thought it was kind of
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:45.480]  underscored yesterday when she came out of her prepared speech. And she was eating some chocolates
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:49.720]  and the press is kind of standing around and they're kind of afraid to engage with her,
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:55.320]  even ask her a question. And somebody does ask her something about a press conference and she
[03:11:55.320 --> 03:12:01.320]  just comes back and says, why don't you have some chocolates? You know, because press conferences
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:06.840]  are like a box of chocolates, aren't they? You never really know what you're going to get asked.
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:14.440]  And that's why Hillary doesn't do them, okay? She is the forest gump of politics, okay? It's also
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:20.920]  the Al Capone of politics as well. When we look at her conspiracy theories, okay? She wants to
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:24.760]  talk about conspiracy theories. And that was what the whole speech yesterday was about.
[03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:29.480]  Understand, it is Hillary Clinton, as many of us have pointed out, and you've got Paul Joseph
[03:12:29.480 --> 03:12:34.440]  Watson's video of her with the tinfoil hat on. Yeah, she thinks of Putin hacked the DNC.
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:39.240]  She thinks the Associated Press is out to get her cherry-picking information,
[03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:43.880]  even though she stonewalled them for three years, they had to sue her. She did everything to keep
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:49.480]  them from seeing her schedule. She put her schedule, her daily schedule, in the burn bag
[03:12:49.480 --> 03:12:53.880]  at the State Department. And I talked about that yesterday on a one minute. The fact that
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:12:58.120]  she said, you know, there's a lot of smoke, but there's no fire. No, there really is.
[03:12:58.760 --> 03:13:03.400]  She's got her metaphors mixed up. There is, when you get that much smoke, there are fires.
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:07.400]  There are a lot of fires, and she is on fire. I would say, you know,
[03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:12.920]  liar, liar, pantsuit on fire. But this is in violation of the law to burn your schedule.
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:17.320]  Because the schedule, by law, is supposed to be open to the public. It's supposed to be
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:23.160]  transparent. She talks about Alex having a dark heart, and she talks about the dark
[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:27.560]  corners of the Internet. No, there's not dark corners in the Internet. What the Internet is
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:33.480]  doing is shining light on her darkness. She has done everything to shut down transparency.
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:41.800]  She set up a private network of email servers to subvert the law of national security. Okay,
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:47.240]  and as she's caught doing this, now we're starting to learn that it wasn't just, you know, a mistake
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:50.440]  when they deleted all of these different emails, and we're supposed to believe
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:56.440]  that she had 30,000 emails about Chelsea's wedding and yoga positions, okay, or routines,
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:14:02.600]  or whatever. Nonsense, nonsense. I mean, how foolish do you have to be to believe that?
[03:14:02.600 --> 03:14:08.200]  I know, because I talked to people at the Democrat National Convention who were foolish enough
[03:14:08.200 --> 03:14:13.880]  to just shut off that part of their brain, engage in the Orwellian double-think, and just
[03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:20.120]  dismiss anything that doesn't, the contradicts that Hillary is the greatest person ever lived,
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:24.520]  and the first woman who has to become president. They don't want to hear anything about that.
[03:14:24.520 --> 03:14:29.160]  They don't want to hear about her other conspiracies, you know, about the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi,
[03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:34.680]  the fact that it was all caused by some poor filmmaker that nobody had ever heard of. I mean,
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:40.680]  the nonsense film that got shut down, but of course, he was jailed, actually, okay?
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:45.640]  And as Donald Trump and Politico, no friend of Donald Trump, Politico, pointed out,
[03:14:46.520 --> 03:14:52.600]  the original birther is Hillary Clinton, okay? This is, we can see this, and they've got multiple
[03:14:52.600 --> 03:14:58.200]  reports about it going back to her desperate supporters as she was losing to Obama. Even to
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:03.400]  the point, we've got the Daily Cause talking about how she was asked about whether or not
[03:15:03.400 --> 03:15:08.200]  Obama was a Muslim, and she goes, well, I'll just have to take his word on that. We'll see what
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:14.040]  happens. You know, a very kind of pushing back, you know, not really saying, no, no, no, no,
[03:15:14.040 --> 03:15:18.360]  absolutely not. Now, she leaves that out there as a possibility. But what I want to talk about,
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:23.480]  and what we talked about when I interviewed Roger Stone, we talked about, yeah, Vince Foster,
[03:15:23.480 --> 03:15:29.720]  he's gone missing again. We need to remember that, you know, conspiracy is actually a crime.
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:37.160]  It's a crime that is committed and charged against people quite often. And Hillary really is
[03:15:37.160 --> 03:15:41.400]  a criminal conspirator, okay? As Alex was pointing out earlier today, she talks about,
[03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:46.520]  you know, we came, we saw, he died. These emails have now shown why they went there,
[03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:53.560]  why they killed him, why they created chaos in Libya and an arms bazaar for ISIS. Yeah,
[03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:58.600]  you really did create ISIS, okay? You just renamed Al Qaeda, but you really did create
[03:15:58.600 --> 03:16:03.560]  this civil war in Syria and arm it out of Libya after you overthrew Qaddafi. And we look at the
[03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:11.400]  emails and we understand why they did this. This was a war for profit. This is the way they operate,
[03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:17.720]  okay? A war for profit. They passed emails back and forth, Sidney Blumenthal and Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:17.720 --> 03:16:22.840]  This is how we get the French in on this because he is pushing back Qaddafi, is pushing back
[03:16:22.840 --> 03:16:27.640]  against our fiat currencies that are put out there by our central banks. They're pushing back
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:32.120]  against our fiat currency here in the United States that's backed by the Saudis, you know,
[03:16:32.120 --> 03:16:39.480]  our petrodollar. Qaddafi's a bad guy. He's putting out a currency backed in gold that could destroy
[03:16:39.480 --> 03:16:46.840]  us, okay? That could destroy us. And he wants to denominate oil in that currency. He wants to
[03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:54.520]  help the people of sub-Saharan Africa, you know, the black people. And they sent her emails. And
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:17:00.840]  again, you can see the emails that have been leaked showing that they had people, the army,
[03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:06.840]  the rebels who were overthrowing Qaddafi were shooting foreigners on site. How did they shoot
[03:17:06.840 --> 03:17:12.040]  them on site? How did they identify them as foreigners and enemies on site? Well, it's because
[03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:18.520]  they're black, sub-Saharan Africans. That's how they identify them. They said they're his allies
[03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:23.960]  if they're black. So what she did was she took a powder on that genocide and we see her doing
[03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:30.040]  that everywhere. Remember, remember that the first Gulf War was under George H. W. Bush.
[03:17:30.040 --> 03:17:36.280]  But under Bill Clinton, they bombed Saddam a couple of times. We've got a story out of
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:42.760]  the Daily Mail that's up on Info Wars today. Bill Clinton bombed Saddam to distract from
[03:17:42.760 --> 03:17:47.640]  the Monica Lewinsky scandal. And this is something that all of us, you know, that vast
[03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:53.480]  right-wing conspiracy that is now the alt-right conspiracy. We were all talking about this back
[03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:59.080]  in the 90s. It was pretty clear. And this is something that came out of this Muslim journal
[03:17:59.080 --> 03:18:06.840]  that was run by Huma Abedin's mother as they call her an academic in Saudi Arabia. She's a Sharia
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:12.200]  law academic, just like the guy that Hillary Clinton had behind her. When is Hillary Clinton
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:20.280]  going to denounce Sharia law? Okay. Not as long as she's taking cash from the Saudis. No,
[03:18:20.280 --> 03:18:24.440]  but this is an article in the Muslim Journal where Huma Abedin was an assistant editor.
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:29.880]  They claim Bill Clinton bombed Saddam Hussein to deflect from his Monica Lewinsky affair.
[03:18:30.520 --> 03:18:35.320]  And this is an article that talked in the aftermath as early 2000s. They say it was bombed
[03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:42.840]  twice in 96 and 98. Being said in the article, the crisis with Iraq has also probably benefited
[03:18:42.840 --> 03:18:47.640]  Bill Clinton serving as a good deterrent of attention from personal crises like his campaign
[03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:53.560]  funding scandals, pay for play again, legislative failures, or the Monica Lewinsky affair.
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:58.200]  By occasionally bombing Iraq in the name of humanity, at least he has been able to look
[03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:07.320]  strong and presidential. Now, this is the two times, okay? In 1996, the strikes were known as
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:13.080]  Operation Desert Fox, okay? Ordered the day after the House of Representatives issued a report
[03:19:13.080 --> 03:19:17.800]  accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors. And of course, having an affair
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:23.240]  with Monica Lewinsky isn't a high crime or misdemeanor. Committing perjury is, and we've
[03:19:23.240 --> 03:19:30.760]  seen Hillary Clinton publicly do that before the Congress. This is one of the reasons why I think
[03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:37.400]  she was meeting on the tarmac with the Attorney General schooling her on what the FBI raid
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:42.680]  knew so that she wouldn't commit perjury with the FBI. But of course, she could be given a pass
[03:19:42.680 --> 03:19:50.280]  by Comey, just as Comey gave their buddy, their partner, Sandy Berger, a pass when he stole and
[03:19:50.280 --> 03:19:56.120]  shredded documents. But of course, the previous strike that they had in 1996 was ordered during
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:20:01.560]  a campaign finance scandal. Campaign finance, Monica Lewinsky, go kick somebody. So you gotta

[03:24:12.200 --> 03:24:28.600]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're going to be joined
[03:24:28.600 --> 03:24:34.520]  by Mark Hall and talk to him about his film Killing Ed in the next segment. It is at the
[03:24:34.520 --> 03:24:39.880]  juncture of a lot of geopolitics, a lot of crony capitalism, a lot of the things that we see
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:45.960]  continuing to happen. And of course, as long as we have a lot of power and money in Washington,
[03:24:45.960 --> 03:24:49.720]  it is going to be like a black hole pulling in corruption. That's one of the things that
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:55.240]  we need to be concerned about with charter schools. And we look at the worst case example
[03:24:55.240 --> 03:25:00.360]  of charter schools in this documentary. He'll be joining us in the next segment before we get
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:05.720]  back to the news. I want to remind you that we have a new special that we put out in honor of
[03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:12.040]  Hillary Clinton saying that Alex has a dark heart. We have a black t-shirt that says Hillary for
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:19.960]  Prison. And we have put it on a huge discount, $9.95 a shirt. That's equivalent of more than 50%
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:24.920]  off. This is the popular Hillary for Prison t-shirt that you see everywhere now. I think it's one
[03:25:24.920 --> 03:25:31.800]  of the reasons that she called out Alex Jones. It's Hillary for the big house, okay? Hillary
[03:25:31.800 --> 03:25:38.760]  for Prison. And that's a very, very popular design. Now, discounted to $9.95 at our cost.
[03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:46.360]  Also, we have introduced this week, selenium, a good bio-true source of selenium. And when I saw
[03:25:46.360 --> 03:25:51.000]  this was coming up, I talked to Anthony Guccio, already in Dr. Group, and I said, I am really
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:58.200]  happy to see you selling selenium. I know how important this is. I have family members who
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:04.200]  alerted me to the ties with selenium and the studies that Dr. Group was going in talking about
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:11.000]  how all these different types of cancers when they had studies, people supplementing on selenium,
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:15.880]  how they saw reduced cancer rates, reduced rates of other diseases. Cancer rates are different
[03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:21.480]  types of cancers anywhere from 40%, 50%, 60% reduction when people get rid of their selenium
[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:27.960]  deficiency. I know about that firsthand in my family as well. You can get that now. 1995,
[03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:31.320]  when you visit infowarslife.com. And the thing that got me excited about this
[03:26:31.320 --> 03:26:34.680]  is whenever you look at a supplement and you see people do these studies and you know that
[03:26:34.680 --> 03:26:39.960]  there's very effective in reducing risks of certain types of diseases, and they can go back
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:45.240]  and talk about the mechanisms of it. But I'm just impressed with the results that they get.
[03:26:45.240 --> 03:26:50.680]  But I want to make sure that I'm getting something that is potent, that is pure. And that's what
[03:26:50.680 --> 03:26:56.840]  I liked about this selenium. This is an organic selenium because they press it out of organic
[03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:00.200]  mustard seed. And that's something that's hard to get when you're getting minerals. A lot of
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:04.920]  times you get minerals, you get trace elements of other things that you don't want alongside of it,
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:11.640]  or you get fillers. So this is a high potency selenium that is organic. This is a very, very
[03:27:11.640 --> 03:27:17.080]  important product. Now, before we go to the break, I want to talk a little bit about what Hillary
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:23.160]  Clinton said yesterday in terms of how she characterized Donald Trump. And this is Joseph
[03:27:23.160 --> 03:27:27.720]  Fair from W&D. He says, here's how she distorted Trump's effective outreach to black voters.
[03:27:27.720 --> 03:27:31.240]  She said, Trump has stood up in front of a largely white audiences and described black
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:37.560]  communities in insulting and ignorant terms. Not like, you know, kind of a way Obama referred
[03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:43.080]  to us as bitter clingers with guns and bibles, you know, that type of thing. Was it that inflammatory?
[03:27:43.080 --> 03:27:48.280]  No. What he said was this, poverty, rejection, horrible education, no housing, no homes,
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:52.840]  no ownership, crime at levels nobody has seen. Right now you walk down the street,
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:58.760]  you get shot. And Hillary Clinton said, those are Trump's words. Are they, are they false?
[03:27:58.760 --> 03:28:04.760]  Is it racist to say that as Joseph Fair points out, Trump wasn't blaming the black communities.
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:10.760]  He was pointing out to them that democratic policies of the last 50 so years have failed.
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:14.760]  I talked about this on Monday. I talked about how over the weekend in Chicago,
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:19.400]  where you see the black policies, here's one of them, gun control, okay? How does gun control
[03:28:19.400 --> 03:28:24.680]  work out for Chicago? Looks like they have some kind of a mass shooting event every weekend there,
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:31.400]  okay? 35 people shot. An additional four people killed just last weekend. And just a 14-hour
[03:28:31.400 --> 03:28:37.640]  period, 25 people shot in Chicago, a gun-free zone. A gun-free zone. That's how gun control,
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:41.640]  how Democrat policies work out for you. Here's another way how that works out. Of course,
[03:28:41.640 --> 03:28:45.560]  they like to say, you know, distance yourself from the Ku Klux Klan when he doesn't seek the
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:49.960]  Ku Klux Klan. He doesn't have them stand up behind him in the speeches like Hillary has
[03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:57.240]  Sharia lawyers stand up behind her. Or the way they've got a La Raza, the racist judge,
[03:28:57.240 --> 03:29:03.240]  attacking Donald Trump and attacking him for saying, hey, this guy is biased. Yeah, he is
[03:29:03.240 --> 03:29:08.040]  biased. He's biased because he belongs to a group that says everything for the race,
[03:29:08.040 --> 03:29:13.000]  for those outside of the race, nothing. I think that sounds pretty racist by my definition.
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:18.600]  But let's talk about what she did to actually encourage Black Lives Matter. Does she distance
[03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:24.280]  herself from them? No. She honors them, okay? And this is what a guy who is Asian, who wrote for
[03:29:24.280 --> 03:29:28.200]  Politico. Again, not a Trump organization said, what I learned when I was attacked and spared
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:34.120]  because of my race at Black Lives Matters, okay? Talks about this fellow photographer who has to
[03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:38.040]  run for it because he's white. He throws the cameras down. He tries to pick it up. They jump
[03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:43.320]  on him and start beating him and say, wait a minute. He's not white. Leave him alone, okay? That's
[03:29:43.320 --> 03:29:49.800]  the hatred. That's the hatred and the racism that Hillary Clinton has supported and encouraged. We'll
[03:29:49.800 --> 03:29:56.760]  be right back with Mark Hall. The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:00.920 --> 03:30:05.960]  Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broderick has said that she now fears for her life.
[03:30:05.960 --> 03:30:10.040]  But what does Juanita Broderick have to be concerned about? It's not like there's a
[03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:14.760]  body count behind the Clintons. No one has ever turned up dead after dealing with the Clintons.
[03:30:14.760 --> 03:30:20.040]  Paula Grober, Jerry Parks, Barry Seal. Never, ever has anyone died after calling out the
[03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:25.480]  Clintons for scandalous behavior. James McDougal. There haven't been women in the past turn up
[03:30:25.480 --> 03:30:31.080]  dead who were accusing Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Mary Mahoney. It's just a coincidence
[03:30:31.080 --> 03:30:36.360]  all the suicides that have followed the Clintons. Vince Foster, Ed Willie, James Bunch, James Winston,
[03:30:36.360 --> 03:30:42.920]  Kathy Ferguson, Gandy Ball, Suzanne Coleman, Danny Caspararo. There haven't been any strange deaths
[03:30:42.920 --> 03:30:47.960]  that can be tied to the Clintons that have happened lately, Seth Rich, John Ash. So,
[03:30:47.960 --> 03:30:52.600]  since there's no evidence that the Clintons might have a hit team out to silence people who are a
[03:30:52.600 --> 03:30:58.040]  threat to their political empire, I think Juanita Broderick's fears are unfounded. Not! This is
[03:30:58.040 --> 03:31:04.120]  Owen Schreuer from Infowars.com. Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it.
[03:31:04.120 --> 03:31:09.880]  Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:31:09.880 --> 03:31:15.240]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30.
[03:31:15.240 --> 03:31:19.000]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really
[03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:23.000]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of
[03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:28.280]  them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up. Got four and a
[03:31:28.280 --> 03:31:33.880]  half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give

[03:31:39.480 --> 03:31:43.160]  your socks off. I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[03:31:43.160 --> 03:31:48.520]  done it without Brainforce. I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up,
[03:31:48.520 --> 03:31:54.120]  took two more Brainforce and came in. You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products

[03:33:19.800 --> 03:33:28.920]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:28.920 --> 03:33:33.080]  I'm David Knight, your host and joining me now is filmmaker Mark Hall and we're going to talk about
[03:33:33.080 --> 03:33:39.160]  his film, Killing Ed. I've got a DVD of it here and the subtitle is Charter Schools, Corruption
[03:33:39.160 --> 03:33:44.440]  and the Ghoulin Movement in America. There are a lot of things in this important documentary,
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:33:48.120]  very well done, very entertaining to watch. You can get the soundtrack on Amazon. You can also
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:54.760]  pick up the DVD as well and we're going to talk to him about what he uncovered about the Ghoulin
[03:33:54.760 --> 03:34:01.160]  Movement. I think it is a very important story, this documentary, not even so much about education
[03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:09.400]  as it is about crony capitalism and corruption and buying influence here in this country from
[03:34:09.400 --> 03:34:15.000]  political officials, people who are coming here with an agenda. And of course, Hillary Clinton
[03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:18.680]  has a tie to this as well that we've learned since this documentary. I don't think you really
[03:34:18.680 --> 03:34:24.760]  address it in here. She has gotten a lot of money from the Ghoulinist movement. This is a
[03:34:24.760 --> 03:34:30.680]  movement that has a great deal of money that has been involved in the coup in Turkey. The Turkish
[03:34:30.680 --> 03:34:37.080]  government is trying to extradite Fatala Ghoulin rightly or wrongly. I don't really want to get
[03:34:37.080 --> 03:34:42.360]  so much in the fight as there's not a good guy in here. I get people sending me stuff, who should
[03:34:42.360 --> 03:34:49.320]  we be supporting there? It's like, I don't think any one of them there. But we do have a base there
[03:34:49.320 --> 03:34:55.160]  that was surrounded. They had the power cut off for over a week, a nuclear base in Sirlich.
[03:34:55.160 --> 03:35:00.440]  And this is reopened in kind of a geopolitical way. This coup that's happened there is reopened
[03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:06.520]  talks between Turkey and Putin. So there's a lot of geopolitical aspects of this. But we're
[03:35:06.520 --> 03:35:12.600]  really kind of going to focus on the corruption that's going on here. Give us a bit of an overview.
[03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:17.880]  Tell us about the screeners that are coming up, screenings that are coming up in Texas and other
[03:35:17.880 --> 03:35:23.400]  places, and kind of the pushback that you've gotten in media. Start first with the overview.
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:26.440]  Tell us a little bit about the documentary for those people who don't know about it.
[03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:31.240]  Sure, David. Thanks for having me on. Killing It is a film that took about five years to produce.
[03:35:31.240 --> 03:35:37.480]  And it's really focused on the charter schools that Fetula Gulen and the Gulen movement operate
[03:35:37.480 --> 03:35:43.480]  here in the United States. So there's an excess of 150 schools operated here in the United States.
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:49.320]  51 of those now are here in Texas. Yeah, it's interesting because when we first started shooting
[03:35:49.320 --> 03:35:55.160]  this film in 2011, there were only 35 or 36 schools. Wow. I remember the first time we talked,
[03:35:55.160 --> 03:35:59.880]  it was on the 40s. Yeah, 40s. Now it's over 50. And you'll see in this film, people say at 35 and
[03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:05.640]  then later in the film, it'll be 44 here in Texas. Now they're up to 51. They're opening three new
[03:36:05.640 --> 03:36:11.720]  schools here in Texas. These are all taxpayer finance schools. And they're operated by Turkish
[03:36:11.720 --> 03:36:16.760]  administrators who are followers of Imam Fetula Gulen, who operates this very large,
[03:36:16.760 --> 03:36:22.920]  global Islamist group. A lot of Turks that are secular Turks believe the Gulen movement is a
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:31.080]  cult that is very similar in certain ways to Scientology. Yeah, there's a mysticism mixed in
[03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:36.120]  with Islamic religion. That's right. A lot of Sunni Muslims don't believe that this is truly
[03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:41.640]  an authentic version of Islam. But whatever it is, they're operating their schools here in the
[03:36:41.640 --> 03:36:47.320]  United States. They're generating an excess of $500 million a year in taxpayer dollars.
[03:36:47.320 --> 03:36:53.640]  Let's repeat that. That's taxpayer money. Absolutely. Half a billion dollars that is going directly to
[03:36:53.640 --> 03:36:58.280]  this organization. Yes. And people have to look at this. Look, if this is going to work for them,
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:02.280]  if we're going to have this kind of system set up for education, there's nothing that's going to
[03:37:02.280 --> 03:37:06.120]  stop the Scientologists from taking over the schools and starting to teach your kids. I mean,
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:10.440]  we laugh about it. But I mean, in principle, it's the same thing. You pointed that out.
[03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:14.760]  Yeah. And the Gulen movement has focused on education around the world. So they have in
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:22.280]  excess of 1200 schools worldwide, 150 or so are here in the United States. But this is the only
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:28.200]  nation. Our country is the only nation that pays for these schools to operate and gives them in
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:34.040]  excess of $500 million a year. Yeah. And we know, as you see in the film, the interviews in the film
[03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:38.440]  with former Gulenists, former followers of Fatullah Gulen, that a certain amount of that
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:43.560]  money is being kicked back for non-educational purposes. And given what we know now about the
[03:37:43.560 --> 03:37:49.320]  coup in Turkey last month on July 15th, and the fact that there's been a lot of allegations that
[03:37:49.320 --> 03:37:54.680]  Fatullah Gulen and his followers were the ones that instigated this coup to overthrow the government,
[03:37:55.800 --> 03:38:01.160]  it makes me wonder, did our tax dollars go in part to trying to overthrow a
[03:38:01.960 --> 03:38:06.520]  supposed ally of ours in the Middle East? Yeah. There has been a civil war, as you pointed out,
[03:38:06.520 --> 03:38:10.200]  before we've been on this. There's an ongoing civil war in Turkey between these two
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:16.360]  Poles, the Polar Forces. And it just turned hot at that moment. Exactly. I mean,
[03:38:16.360 --> 03:38:21.960]  there had been a soft civil war in Turkey between these two Islamist groups. Erdogan and Gulen
[03:38:22.520 --> 03:38:30.360]  are both Islamists. They'd like to take Turkey away from its Kenalist, more secular government,
[03:38:30.360 --> 03:38:35.080]  style of government. And just to say, who should we support? Well, we haven't been supporting the
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:40.360]  people we should be supporting. We haven't been supporting those people that are secular Turks,
[03:38:40.360 --> 03:38:46.360]  those people that do not want a political style of Islam installed in this huge geopolitical
[03:38:47.560 --> 03:38:52.760]  partner of ours in NATO. It's always the false dichotomy, isn't it? Oh, yeah. They offer us
[03:38:52.760 --> 03:38:58.120]  a choice of Erdogan and Gulen as if, like, which one would you like to have run the Worldwide Caliphate?
[03:38:59.320 --> 03:39:03.160]  Well, it's like, well, I don't think I want either one. Yeah. And I don't know if it's
[03:39:03.160 --> 03:39:07.880]  just our mentality as Westerners, but we always see things binary. We see things left, right.
[03:39:07.880 --> 03:39:12.920]  And it's the way they offer it to us. They always offer us a choice of two things, okay?
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:16.760]  Yeah, exactly. The crony capitalist or whatever will come in and they'll
[03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:22.920]  put everybody else out of business and you wind up with Coke or Pepsi, Gulen or Erdogan. Which
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:26.920]  one do you want to run the Worldwide Caliphate? Well, I don't want a Worldwide Caliphate.
[03:39:26.920 --> 03:39:31.080]  And, you know, David, it's much more complex than that, as we know. And it's much more complex
[03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:35.800]  than that in Turkey. And I'm afraid that over the years, our government has been supporting
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:41.880]  Fatula Gulen. As you say rightly, the Turks have requested that Fatula Gulen be extradited
[03:39:42.680 --> 03:39:51.960]  back to Turkey to stand trial for his crimes in partaking in this coup. And as of now,
[03:39:51.960 --> 03:39:57.000]  where about a month after the coup, it doesn't look like anything has been done to move that
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:02.680]  forward very much. There have been some exchanges of papers between our governments. The US
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:07.480]  government says they're not seeing any evidence that links him to the coup. I guess this will
[03:40:07.480 --> 03:40:15.800]  play out over time, but it has led to a very angry populace in Turkey because they're comparing this.
[03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:20.120]  I just got off the phone before I came over here to talk to you today. I was talking with a friend
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:25.320]  in Turkey and he said, you know, this is our 9-11. Many people in Turkey are viewing this as a 9-11
[03:40:25.320 --> 03:40:33.560]  event. And what if it had been, the Sama bin Laden staying in Turkey after 9-11,
[03:40:33.560 --> 03:40:40.200]  wouldn't you want to at least have him under some sort of watch or in jail until this
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:45.880]  issue had been declared? And our extradition treaty allows for that. It allows for detention
[03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:50.040]  for up to 60 days of people that haven't been involved in these types of coup attempts.
[03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:55.080]  So it's led to tremendous strain between our two governments. As you say,
[03:40:55.080 --> 03:41:01.880]  Incirlik was a nuclear airbase run by NATO. I have a good authority that our nuclear weapons
[03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:08.520]  have been removed from Incirlik and have gone to either Bulgaria or Romania. And I don't think our
[03:41:08.520 --> 03:41:13.880]  foreign policy in this regard, US foreign policy has done us very well. They're telling you that
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:20.760]  they're removed by who by the US government. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thankfully. Yeah. Okay. So
[03:41:20.760 --> 03:41:25.960]  we look at this and you're talking about the extradition requests. There was a formal request
[03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:30.840]  finally made two days ago by Turkey to the State Department. We had Joe Biden talk about it and
[03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:34.440]  say, well, you know, we don't really see anything there. So I don't think they're going to do that
[03:41:34.440 --> 03:41:41.000]  because you've got not only the pay to play corruption that we see just rampant in Washington
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:45.800]  with Hillary Clinton being the poster child for that. But you also have essentially pay to stay.
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:41:52.600]  I mean, this is a guy you had when he first came into the country. He had people who opposed him
[03:41:52.600 --> 03:41:59.000]  being here who were concerned about his connections to radical Islam. And yet you had people within
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:03.320]  the CIA who wrote him letters who got him to stay here. But let's talk about what's going on
[03:42:03.320 --> 03:42:07.960]  with the schools. And let's talk about what's happening with your film first. Let's talk
[03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:11.080]  about that. And then let's talk about what's going on with the schools. Tell us about the
[03:42:11.080 --> 03:42:14.600]  screenings that you've got coming up. I think starting this weekend or is it? Sure. We've
[03:42:15.240 --> 03:42:20.360]  started having what we call the Texas screenings because a lot of this film takes place in Texas.
[03:42:20.360 --> 03:42:26.520]  The largest chain of these school and schools are here in Texas. We have 50. But it is a national
[03:42:26.520 --> 03:42:30.760]  problem. It is a national problem all across the country. They're in 26 states in our country.
[03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:36.920]  They just opened. I think this happened just in the past month. They've opened a new school on
[03:42:36.920 --> 03:42:43.400]  Nellis Air Force Base, which I just don't understand at all. Given what we know about this group now,
[03:42:43.400 --> 03:42:48.520]  why would the Air Force allow a ghoul and run charter school on an Air Force Base? Very strange.
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:52.920]  And they operate as explicitly religious schools elsewhere in the world, but not here so they
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:58.920]  can get the money here. Exactly. And I understand why people... Look, I want to see parents making
[03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:03.480]  choices in education. I want to see them taking over the children's education. It's becoming
[03:43:03.480 --> 03:43:09.320]  essentially impossible within the government school system because the control of education has
[03:43:09.320 --> 03:43:14.280]  transferred up the chain of command from local schools to state control to federal control
[03:43:14.280 --> 03:43:19.080]  so that you don't really have any control of what's going on within the school structure. So they're
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:23.720]  looking for other alternatives. But I think we're jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.
[03:43:23.720 --> 03:43:27.160]  Many conservatives are looking at the government school system and saying,
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:31.320]  I don't want my kids being taught by secular humanists who hate Christianity.
[03:43:31.320 --> 03:43:35.480]  Then we're going to have them taught by people who want to establish a worldwide caliphate
[03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:40.680]  based out of Turkey. I mean, this is the situation. We have to look at this. Again,
[03:43:40.680 --> 03:43:45.320]  going back to the dichotomy that we have, it's not always the solutions that are offered to us
[03:43:45.320 --> 03:43:49.960]  are really the ones that we really ought to be seriously considering. Well, and you're right.
[03:43:49.960 --> 03:43:55.000]  Parents are looking for alternatives and there has been this charter movement in our country for the
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:44:00.040]  20 years or so. What we're seeing and what we've seen in the research that we did for this film
[03:44:00.040 --> 03:44:05.640]  is there is a trend line away from the parent involved single charters that used to exist to
[03:44:05.640 --> 03:44:13.080]  these large corporate managed charter school networks both statewide and nationally. Whereas
[03:44:13.080 --> 03:44:18.600]  it might have worked one off with very parent involved charter locations, you're seeing like
[03:44:18.600 --> 03:44:24.360]  the Gulen movement operating 155 locations with 72,000 children around here.
[03:44:24.360 --> 03:44:28.120]  It starts out like a small business. It starts out with some parents coming in and saying,
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:32.920]  let's create a charter school and then they get tax payer money for that. But then the rules are
[03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:39.000]  established and the wise guys and the crony capitalists will come in or the foreign influences
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:43.960]  will come in and say, oh, here's the rules. And here's how we can take this over just like we
[03:44:43.960 --> 03:44:48.200]  would come in with a big box retailer and drive out all the mom and pops that are there. And
[03:44:48.200 --> 03:44:51.720]  that's essentially what we're seeing. And whenever you've got that kind of concentration
[03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:55.480]  and government subsidization of something, you're always going to invite corruption.
[03:44:55.480 --> 03:44:59.080]  It's going to be hard to keep that out of there. Exactly. And that's what the film goes into.
[03:44:59.080 --> 03:45:04.360]  Killing it really looks at the worst case scenario of a very lightly regulated system.
[03:45:04.360 --> 03:45:07.960]  And it also looks at the political corruption. You say, you know, you mentioned that the
[03:45:07.960 --> 03:45:12.440]  Clinton Foundation, not only the Clinton Foundation, but Hillary Clinton's campaign
[03:45:12.440 --> 03:45:16.440]  and a PAC set up by Hillary Clinton have all received money from the Gulen movement.
[03:45:17.560 --> 03:45:22.280]  I don't think they're supposed to, but nobody's really looking after our laws in that regard.
[03:45:22.280 --> 03:45:26.840]  Nobody enforces the law. But we also see in the film many, many trips that have been
[03:45:26.840 --> 03:45:33.240]  taken by politicians, senators all the way down to local sheriffs, state officials.
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:37.480]  And they've hundreds and hundreds of these trips and politicians have gone on these
[03:45:37.480 --> 03:45:42.520]  trips funded by Gulen nonprofits. Not only do they operate charter schools,
[03:45:42.520 --> 03:45:47.720]  they operate many hundreds of nonprofit organizations throughout our state,
[03:45:47.720 --> 03:45:52.360]  throughout our country. And those have been very corrosive in our political process. And
[03:45:52.360 --> 03:45:57.480]  they have led to campaign donations to all types of people. And you'll see a list of them in the
[03:45:57.480 --> 03:46:02.440]  film. It's quite remarkable. Of course, they're also involved in kickbacks to construction
[03:46:02.440 --> 03:46:08.200]  companies and other things like kickbacks to teachers who come in abusing the H1B visa program.
[03:46:08.200 --> 03:46:13.640]  Supposedly, we can't find teachers in this country. So we have to import them from Turkey.
[03:46:13.640 --> 03:46:19.080]  And they, as we've seen as your documentary shows, they're getting considerably more money
[03:46:19.080 --> 03:46:23.560]  than domestic teachers are. Well, that's right. One of the scams of the Gulen movement is to bring
[03:46:23.560 --> 03:46:30.920]  in many hundreds, if not thousands of followers of Imam Gulen on H1B visas from Turkey and Central
[03:46:30.920 --> 03:46:37.320]  Asia. These teachers are paid a prevailing wage under our immigration law. But what happens,
[03:46:37.320 --> 03:46:41.880]  and we have it documented in the film, all of those people that are followers of Gulen that
[03:46:41.880 --> 03:46:47.000]  are coming in to teach at these schools are made to swear that they're going to follow something
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:52.440]  called a tuzuk, which is essentially their bylaws. And what that means is they get paid only a certain
[03:46:52.440 --> 03:46:58.600]  fraction of what they're required by our law to get. And the rest of that money goes back
[03:46:58.600 --> 03:47:03.480]  to the non-educational purposes of the Gulen movement. So it's really a scam in a lot of
[03:47:03.480 --> 03:47:07.640]  different ways. And I don't think many people know this story. It's been quite underreported.
[03:47:07.640 --> 03:47:11.320]  Let's talk a little bit about the pushback that you're starting to get here in this area
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:16.840]  because we've got an attorney. You sent me his Facebook post, Jim Harrington. Talk about that
[03:47:16.840 --> 03:47:20.760]  post that he put out and who he is and why he would oppose you on a film.
[03:47:20.760 --> 03:47:25.480]  Well, we've noticed that we've had a tremendous amount of difficulty in Texas getting anything
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:32.760]  about this film published. We started releasing this film in February this year. And my marketing
[03:47:32.760 --> 03:47:38.280]  guys and PR people have worked since February just to get a paragraph in the press in large
[03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:43.240]  media markets here. And we have had no luck whatsoever. It's been quite amazing. We'd
[03:47:43.240 --> 03:47:49.960]  heard that there were people making statements that the film was Islamophobic or that I was
[03:47:49.960 --> 03:47:55.880]  paid by the Gulen or excuse me, the Erdogan government to make this film. And so there's
[03:47:55.880 --> 03:48:01.080]  an example here by this gentleman, Jim Harrington, who is a well-known civil rights lawyer here in
[03:48:01.080 --> 03:48:08.680]  Texas, who is a very strong adherent and believer in the Gulen movement. As far as I know, he's
[03:48:08.680 --> 03:48:14.760]  been to Turkey with them. He's lectured at many of the Gulen sponsored conferences that they hold
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:20.680]  around the country. He's even published a book about Gulen's trial in Turkey for sedition
[03:48:20.680 --> 03:48:26.040]  when Gulen was trying to overthrow the Turkish government, I believe with the help and the
[03:48:26.040 --> 03:48:31.720]  assistance of the Gulen movement. So he's published something on our film's Facebook page saying
[03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:39.480]  that I was totally funded by the PR firm in London of Erdogan or the Erdogan government.
[03:48:39.480 --> 03:48:44.040]  I can tell you that's a total lie. That's something that is a Gulen talking point.
[03:48:44.040 --> 03:48:49.880]  And this is their motive. If you seek to criticize them, they're going to try to silence you.
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:54.440]  They have friends in the media. They have friends like Mr. Harrington, who I have a high regard for
[03:48:54.440 --> 03:48:59.320]  a lot of the things that he's done for the poor here in Texas. But on this situation, he is totally
[03:48:59.320 --> 03:49:03.880]  wrong. And in my opinion, he's sold out. Well, it's a tactic of the left. And we've seen this
[03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:09.480]  in other film festivals. Look at the film Vaxed. That was about the connection between
[03:49:11.080 --> 03:49:17.320]  autism and vaccines. And you've got filmmakers coming to Robert De Niro at the Tribeca Film
[03:49:17.320 --> 03:49:23.160]  Festival demanding filmmakers demand that other filmmakers' documentaries be shut down. They
[03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:27.800]  don't want a free and open discussion of what's going on. It's what we heard earlier when Alex
[03:49:27.800 --> 03:49:35.560]  was talking to Mark Marino about those who want to use RICO statutes against people who don't
[03:49:35.560 --> 03:49:41.800]  believe their climate models. So we can't have a discussion, whether it's about science or whether
[03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:46.360]  it's even about education. We can't have a discussion with these people. They want to
[03:49:46.360 --> 03:49:53.240]  censor their opponents. They want to criminalize free speech and literally put people in jail
[03:49:53.240 --> 03:49:59.080]  for disagreeing with them. It's very concerning that I may not agree with everything you might
[03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:03.400]  say, David, you may not agree with me, but we should have the forum to be able to discuss these
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:09.560]  things. Maybe we should have a Voltaire film maker festival, right? It's like we disagree with each
[03:50:09.560 --> 03:50:12.760]  other on all these films, but we're going to let each other. We're going to have this open
[03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:16.440]  discussion. We're going to show what we believe and openly talk about this.
[03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:23.080]  This film was called The Film that Texas Does Not Want You to See by a writer in the
[03:50:23.080 --> 03:50:28.680]  Huffington Post. I'm starting to really believe it. I see these posts. It's not only Mr. Harrington
[03:50:28.680 --> 03:50:34.520]  that is spreading these rumors and other things about me or the film, but it's also the GOP.
[03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:39.480]  It's also insiders in Houston that have been disparaging things and making it difficult to
[03:50:39.480 --> 03:50:45.400]  get the film out. It's a very well-researched film. It's very well-produced. And the fact that it was
[03:50:45.400 --> 03:50:52.200]  chosen, that they chose not to show it at South by Southwest, tells you how politicized that
[03:50:52.200 --> 03:50:56.760]  whole thing has become. We're going to be right back with Mark Hall talking about killing it. Stay with us.

[03:52:00.120 --> 03:52:03.800]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of my pillow. And like all of you out there,
[03:52:03.800 --> 03:52:07.880]  I had problems sleeping. Pillows would go flat, I would flip flop all night long,
[03:52:07.880 --> 03:52:11.560]  I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache or feel like I needed a nap even
[03:52:11.560 --> 03:52:15.640]  though I slept eight hours. When I invented my pillow, I wanted it to where you could move the
[03:52:15.640 --> 03:52:20.440]  patent and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual regardless of sleep
[03:52:20.440 --> 03:52:25.320]  position. My pillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[03:52:25.320 --> 03:52:29.720]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed, it's about how much of that quality sleep we get.

[03:53:03.160 --> 03:53:09.160]  this ad. Attention all women who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. In February and May 2016,
[03:53:09.160 --> 03:53:15.960]  Johnson & Johnson baby powder was ordered to pay $72 million and $55 million by two juries
[03:53:15.960 --> 03:53:21.320]  to two women who contracted ovarian cancer after years of using the talcum baby powder product.
[03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:25.960]  Multiple studies show that women who have long-term use of talcum powder in products such as baby
[03:53:25.960 --> 03:53:31.240]  powder for feminine hygiene can increase the risk of contracting ovarian cancer. If you or a family
[03:53:31.240 --> 03:53:36.120]  member have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and used talcum powder prior to the diagnosis,
[03:53:36.120 --> 03:53:41.240]  call talcum baby powder alert today. You may be entitled to substantial compensation. The
[03:53:41.240 --> 03:53:46.200]  consultation is free and you'll pay nothing unless you receive a settlement. So if you or a loved one
[03:53:46.200 --> 03:53:51.320]  used talcum baby powder products before being diagnosed with or died from ovarian cancer,
[03:53:51.320 --> 03:53:59.240]  make this important free call today. Call 1-800-588-7342. 1-800-588-7342.
[03:54:15.800 --> 03:54:19.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here with filmmaker Mark Hall
[03:54:19.480 --> 03:54:24.120]  and I want to tell you before we get back to Mark Hall's film and he's going to tell you
[03:54:24.120 --> 03:54:30.360]  where you can go to see it, how you can get the DVD if you're not in Texas to see the screenings
[03:54:30.360 --> 03:54:33.800]  that are going to be happening this weekend. Before we go back to Mark, I just want to let
[03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:40.840]  you know about our special, our Dark Heart Special. We have gotten under the skin of Hillary Clinton.
[03:54:40.840 --> 03:54:45.880]  She called out Alex by name and if you want to get under her skin, wear this t-shirt.
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:54.920]  Wear it everywhere. And we're putting it out here at cost $9.95, okay? That is more than 50%
[03:54:55.560 --> 03:55:01.640]  off the cost of our very popular classic Hillary for Prison t-shirt. And if anybody deserves to
[03:55:01.640 --> 03:55:07.080]  go to prison, it is very good. I don't know. I can't think of anybody. This is the most corrupt
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:11.960]  individual that we've had run for office, openly corrupt for the longest period of time. So you
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:18.840]  can get that at $9.95. Also, we have a new product, Biotrue Selenium at infowars.com,
[03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:23.960]  very important trace mineral that you need for your health. Look at the studies. This has been
[03:55:23.960 --> 03:55:30.920]  documented for decades, the important healthy effects of selenium. And this is a great,
[03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:37.080]  pure source, 100% organic because it comes as pressed out of 100% organic mustard seed,
[03:55:37.080 --> 03:55:42.920]  also a very high potency form of selenium. So take a look at this, look at the reviews,
[03:55:42.920 --> 03:55:47.480]  look at the studies, look at how it affects various health conditions. You can find that
[03:55:47.480 --> 03:55:52.600]  at infowarslife.com. Now, Mark, tell us a little bit about, we've been talking about this documentary
[03:55:52.600 --> 03:55:56.200]  and what is in it. If people want to see this documentary and they really should because
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:56:03.240]  there is nothing more important than the education of our children. That is the future of this nation.
[03:56:03.240 --> 03:56:08.040]  That's why people like Bill Ayers stopped bombing buildings and decided that he was going to
[03:56:08.760 --> 03:56:14.760]  use the educational system to push his agenda. And so everybody understands that. Give me a kid
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:19.800]  at an early age and their mind for life, okay? We've seen that from everybody, from Plato all
[03:56:19.800 --> 03:56:24.760]  the way up to Bill Ayers. We need to take control of our children. We need to understand what's
[03:56:24.760 --> 03:56:30.280]  happening in the schools and we need to find a structure. And charter schools had some good things
[03:56:30.280 --> 03:56:34.280]  there at the beginning, but as we're talking about it, it looks like that's been co-opted by the
[03:56:34.280 --> 03:56:40.120]  big, powerful, corrupt, special interests, as well as even foreign interests. People need to
[03:56:40.120 --> 03:56:44.840]  understand what's going on with this so that they can come up with a really good solution. Again,
[03:56:44.840 --> 03:56:49.480]  that documentary is killing Edward King. They get this. Yeah, we have several screenings
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:54.440]  scheduled for Texas this month and next. So our screening is Austin and Houston have sold out.
[03:56:54.440 --> 03:56:59.080]  There are no tickets left. We'll have a screening in Dallas on September 8th.
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:07.320]  Tickets are available on tug.com. You can register for tickets there. I will be at all
[03:57:07.320 --> 03:57:13.080]  these shows answering questions afterwards. We're working on a show in San Antonio, which will also
[03:57:13.080 --> 03:57:19.880]  be announced on our Facebook page. We also have shows coming up in Los Angeles and Northern
[03:57:19.880 --> 03:57:26.040]  California. Also, as you mentioned, the film is now out on DVD. It's available on Amazon,
[03:57:26.040 --> 03:57:32.120]  Barnes & Noble, Best Buy. You can find it that way. And we're working to get it up on iTunes
[03:57:32.120 --> 03:57:39.080]  and Netflix later this year. Oh, that's great, because that's the key thing. We need to understand,
[03:57:39.080 --> 03:57:43.480]  we need to have an open discussion. And the people who are trying to shut this down, just
[03:57:43.480 --> 03:57:47.960]  like they try to shut down everything for their own political agenda, we need to keep this out there.
[03:57:47.960 --> 03:57:53.320]  We need to look at what works with education and what doesn't. And we need to understand that
[03:57:53.320 --> 03:57:57.800]  maybe there's something here in the idea of charter schools that we can pull out. But unless we
[03:57:57.800 --> 03:58:05.000]  look at it closely, unless we can find a way to purge out these big corporate interests that come
[03:58:05.000 --> 03:58:09.080]  in and take this over, because that's where the money is, we're going to be jumping out of the
[03:58:09.080 --> 03:58:13.800]  frying pan end of the fire. That's the end of our broadcast. Join us tonight at 7 Central
[03:58:13.800 --> 03:58:29.720]  APM Eastern for the Info Wars Nightly News. Jakari Jackson will be hosting tonight.
