[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:27.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.920 --> 00:40.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, huge geopolitical movements on this Tuesday, the 19th day of March, 2013.
[00:40.400 --> 00:44.680]  The Syrian government is saying that chemical weapons have been launched by Al Qaeda forces
[00:44.680 --> 00:51.760]  against them. People are suffocating in the streets. The air smells strongly of chlorine.
[00:51.760 --> 00:57.760]  That shows some type of chemical gas. And of course, the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu
[00:57.760 --> 01:04.840]  have said that that would be a red line if that happened. And the public, as I've been
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.640]  saying last year, we need to get Syrian girl back on, as they hype the fact that Assad
[01:09.640 --> 01:15.200]  would use chemical weapons, they've segued into any use of chemical weapons as a reason
[01:15.200 --> 01:16.440]  to invade.
[01:16.440 --> 01:22.720]  And we just saw Israel and the United States in the press yesterday and the day before
[01:22.720 --> 01:31.280]  that on Sunday, calling for strikes in Syria on Al Qaeda before they use chemical weapons
[01:31.280 --> 01:39.240]  against Assad and then implying it's Assad's fault. Assad is the one being attacked. The
[01:39.240 --> 01:47.200]  Syrians are the ones being invaded out of Turkey, out of other NATO-backed areas like
[01:47.200 --> 01:54.040]  Jordan. And it's all on record, but they know the general public can't even find Syria on
[01:54.040 --> 01:59.520]  a map, much less even understand the different parties.
[01:59.520 --> 02:05.880]  And so the news this morning is calling for basically the bombardment or invasion of Syria
[02:05.880 --> 02:11.920]  because the West put Al Qaeda and other jihadis in there. They're now basically calling for
[02:11.920 --> 02:19.760]  some type of invasion to keep everyone safe from the chemical weapons that Al Qaeda has
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.240]  that clearly the West has given them.
[02:24.240 --> 02:29.360]  And of course, there's Russians inside the country guarding the legally owned chemical
[02:29.360 --> 02:32.520]  weapons. A lot of people think they have chemical weapons, that's a reason to be invaded. Well,
[02:32.520 --> 02:36.360]  then every Western country in the world would have to be invaded. Most nations have chemical
[02:36.360 --> 02:38.040]  and biological weapons.
[02:38.040 --> 02:43.120]  And my issue is Syria has never invaded anybody. Syria is not attacking anybody. I don't particularly
[02:43.120 --> 02:50.240]  wanna live under a Alawite minority rule. They claim they have a mid-level elections
[02:50.240 --> 02:54.520]  there, but it is a dictatorship for all intents and purposes. But they're not attacking anybody
[02:54.520 --> 03:01.200]  and we don't have a right to go attack them, much less use Al Qaeda.
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.720]  Much less use Al Qaeda to overtake the country to then put in something 10 times worse than
[03:05.720 --> 03:15.280]  Assad conservatively. So just unprecedented, bizarro, absurdist land now, where we've got
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.760]  a peace prize winning president launching attacks in 10 different African countries.
[03:19.760 --> 03:24.700]  Engage in all sorts of mass murder, injecting jihadis in to engage in ethnic cleansing in
[03:24.700 --> 03:32.120]  Libya and other areas, while being praised as a wonderful peacenik. And now the London
[03:32.120 --> 03:40.280]  Telegraph, CBS News, they're all reporting it looks very credible that some type of chemical
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.600]  weapon has been used and at least 25 people are dead right now.
[03:44.600 --> 03:50.220]  That number probably will unfortunately rise. Now when our troops got hit by chemical weapons
[03:50.220 --> 03:55.560]  from Saddam's chemical bases being blown up, and thousands of chemical detectors went off
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.440]  including chemical tape that just picks it up. You don't really get false positives with
[04:00.440 --> 04:03.400]  that. They told them, never mind, you didn't really get hit by nerve gas.
[04:03.400 --> 04:08.200]  And then of course, hundreds of thousands had neurological disorders, tens of thousands
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.480]  have died. And so you just pretend it isn't happening. And so you'll probably see that
[04:12.480 --> 04:24.200]  as well. So here's the article from yesterday. I actually had it here in my stack. Will you
[04:24.200 --> 04:30.880]  guys print me, just so I have it when we come back from break, Israel calls for strikes
[04:30.880 --> 04:34.620]  inside of Syria.
[04:34.620 --> 04:40.080]  And US calls for strikes against Al Qaeda in Syria. So I mean, everybody knows that
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.040]  was on the news the last few days, but I wanna have that. Syrian rebels regime blame each
[04:45.040 --> 04:52.440]  other for first alleged chemical weapons attack. So now it's gonna be, Assad probably did it.
[04:52.440 --> 05:00.560]  I mean, this is just too amazing. That is all coming up and a lot more, stay with us.
[05:00.560 --> 05:05.040]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[05:05.040 --> 05:10.120]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[05:10.120 --> 05:15.280]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[08:04.920 --> 08:22.200]  From enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones. All right, it is Tuesday, the 19th
[08:22.200 --> 08:30.200]  day of March, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones. Coming up, congressmen ask big sis to explain
[08:30.200 --> 08:37.080]  huge ammo purchases. This is on YouTube and C-SPAN, but it's not been picked up anywhere
[08:37.080 --> 08:45.200]  by the press until now by Paul Joseph Watson. It is up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[08:45.200 --> 08:55.440]  Continuing, we have a bunch of developments on the robbery going on where they've declared
[08:55.440 --> 09:02.080]  a bank holiday until at least Thursday, halted trading in the stock market in Cyprus as the
[09:02.080 --> 09:11.020]  Cyprian population panics. And we've got the former ex-checker, chancellor, the former
[09:11.020 --> 09:15.160]  finance minister, the former secretary of the treasury basically in England, warning
[09:15.160 --> 09:21.880]  of bank runs across Europe, saying this is total theft that is going on and will destroy
[09:21.880 --> 09:22.880]  confidence.
[09:22.880 --> 09:27.800]  Well, that's what it's designed to do. Bloomberg, of all people, his Bloomberg editorial board,
[09:27.800 --> 09:32.680]  not Bloomberg himself, has come out saying that the Cyprus bailout is the worst thing
[09:32.680 --> 09:38.320]  Europe has done in the entire crisis. Yeah, no kidding, it's a trial balloon. And so we're
[09:38.320 --> 09:48.240]  going to be breaking down also what the head of PIMCO has come out and said about this,
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.600]  saying it could lead to civil unrest and is robbery. So all of that is coming up today.
[09:54.600 --> 10:00.320]  Also, I haven't talked about this since it broke the last few days, but I did a little
[10:00.320 --> 10:04.880]  bit of research into it. And so I'll give you my take on the Bible show that's such
[10:04.880 --> 10:09.800]  a huge hit that we don't watch a lot of TV and my children watch it. We allow them to
[10:09.800 --> 10:10.800]  watch it.
[10:10.800 --> 10:14.800]  Just to give you an example, it has about five times the ratings of other top shows
[10:14.800 --> 10:20.180]  on cable and the establishments pulling their hair out because people are sick of all the
[10:20.180 --> 10:25.840]  destructive negativity, all the anti-family, anti-God garbage. But of course, it was pointed
[10:25.840 --> 10:31.800]  out as a meme online that even before Glenn Beck did it, I saw it last week. In fact,
[10:31.800 --> 10:36.960]  weeks ago, people were saying this guy looks like Obama, the guy that plays the devil.
[10:36.960 --> 10:43.060]  And so I have a point I'm going to make later in the hour about that. Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[10:43.060 --> 10:50.500]  Obama is the anti-Christ. Obama is the anti-Christ. But as the Bible says, there are many anti-Christ.
[10:50.500 --> 10:56.480]  So I'm going to go over those quotes and give you my perspective, not the anti-Christ, a
[10:56.480 --> 11:02.760]  anti-Christ. Of course, the television is the one-eyed eye of Sauron or the anti-Christ
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.520]  being pumped full of venom towards you and your family. And I guess the devil is the
[11:07.520 --> 11:14.960]  prince of the power of the air. So that is coming up today as well.
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.800]  We're also going to get into more on the global economy, not just what's happening in the
[11:19.800 --> 11:26.860]  euro. Also, the feds are now moving to make children take anthrax shots. They've tried
[11:26.860 --> 11:32.780]  three times to give the US military anthrax shots. And it killed so many people and doesn't
[11:32.780 --> 11:38.680]  even protect you that they suspended it. And now they're going to try to tell people it's
[11:38.680 --> 11:41.340]  the law to give their children that.
[11:41.340 --> 11:46.520]  Right now they're trying to approve it for newborn babies. I mean, you might as well
[11:46.520 --> 11:57.460]  just shoot them in the head right there on the spot. So that is coming up as well today.
[11:57.460 --> 12:03.720]  Now let me first get into the top story, obviously. And we saw this coming last week. We saw it
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.980]  this week. You notice last week, we can punch up my computer screen. I can show TV viewers
[12:07.980 --> 12:08.980]  this.
[12:08.980 --> 12:17.100]  There is March 15th, Los Angeles Times. That was over the weekend, or what, Friday or Saturday.
[12:17.100 --> 12:24.020]  What day was the 15th? I guess Friday. And it says right there, CIA begins sizing up
[12:24.020 --> 12:29.820]  Islamic extremists in Syria for drone strikes. Isn't that funny? And then on Sunday, Benjamin
[12:29.820 --> 12:39.180]  Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, calls for Obama to have strikes inside.
[12:39.180 --> 12:47.340]  Calls for strikes inside Syria to, quote, go after the chemical weapons. And they just
[12:47.340 --> 12:54.660]  leave it out there as a nebulous report. And that was in Israeli Channel 2 News carrying
[12:54.660 --> 13:00.240]  his press conference. Kurt Nemo wrote about it yesterday, Obama and Netanyahu to discuss
[13:00.240 --> 13:02.500]  attacks inside Syria.
[13:02.500 --> 13:07.360]  And a buffer zone to now take more of Syria and make it part of Israel, and then later
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.100]  take more of Syria and make it part of Israel, and then later take more until there is no
[13:12.100 --> 13:19.380]  Syria basically even left. And that's what's going on, and they're playing on the abject
[13:19.380 --> 13:28.080]  total and complete ignorance of the general public about geopolitical issues, about the
[13:28.080 --> 13:30.260]  factions in the region, about any of it.
[13:30.260 --> 13:36.420]  And I told you, two and a half, three years ago when they started the Libya liberation,
[13:36.420 --> 13:40.420]  the bombing campaign, and the lining up the black Libyans and shooting them, and the Al
[13:40.420 --> 13:46.020]  Qaeda forces being brought into Benghazi by NATO. I said that they'll later have drone
[13:46.020 --> 13:52.020]  strikes on the Al Qaeda forces and say they've got to keep US troops in Africa and use Libya
[13:52.020 --> 13:58.620]  as a base to project Al Qaeda all over Libya to then invade other countries.
[13:58.620 --> 14:03.140]  That's now all happened. That's all come out. They've had African leaders come out and say,
[14:03.140 --> 14:08.580]  there are blonde haired, blue eyed men leading Al Qaeda. They work for NATO and Afrikan as
[14:08.580 --> 14:12.980]  a pretext to take our country over. And the West will invade and take over the oil fields
[14:12.980 --> 14:14.340]  of countries and diamond fields.
[14:14.340 --> 14:19.500]  They've done this all over or they'll use the UN and the French as they did a few months
[14:19.500 --> 14:24.220]  ago in one African country. And they'll actually say, we're here to protect you from Al Qaeda.
[14:24.220 --> 14:27.300]  They're not even saying the governments are bad. They'll say, we're taking over to protect
[14:27.300 --> 14:28.300]  you from Al Qaeda.
[14:28.300 --> 14:32.220]  And the presidents and prime ministers will go, you are Al Qaeda. You did this, you blew
[14:32.220 --> 14:37.100]  up the chemical plant, you attacked the oil refineries. And they're like, doesn't matter,
[14:37.100 --> 14:42.180]  we're now controlling it. And so they'll put NATO and Afrikan troops just in the oil fields
[14:42.180 --> 14:45.320]  sitting there on the natural resources.
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.560]  And then it's in the back of the paper. America's fighting Al Qaeda. And it's Anglos, British
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.860]  special forces, US special forces. There's reports, photos, black US citizen special
[14:56.860 --> 15:02.700]  forces. Black guys, white guys with the white guys really stand out in Africa. And it's
[15:02.700 --> 15:10.380]  just back of the paper. Just back of the paper that somebody just put this in really boiled
[15:10.380 --> 15:11.940]  down terms.
[15:11.940 --> 15:17.100]  Our government two and a half years ago starts attacking Libya, almost three years ago. While
[15:17.100 --> 15:20.500]  their rocket attacking even had tanks and aircraft, they were calling them peaceful
[15:20.500 --> 15:26.180]  protesters being killed by Gaddafi. Gaddafi was raping women with brigades of troops fueled
[15:26.180 --> 15:32.540]  by Viagra. Wasn't true. But see, that's why the White House is so scared of this Obama
[15:32.540 --> 15:38.100]  is the devil, Obama is Satan meme, just like Obama deception has now become the major meme
[15:38.100 --> 15:39.100]  through my film.
[15:39.100 --> 15:43.020]  It's been seen over 40 million times free online, the Obama deception. Because they
[15:43.020 --> 15:50.400]  know the public's dumbed down to just Obama devil, Obama bad man. Of course, in his case,
[15:50.400 --> 15:57.180]  that's actually true. But with Gaddafi, it's Gaddafi is raping women. CNN's reporting fueled
[15:57.180 --> 16:06.380]  by Viagra. Turned out it was all made up, all fake. Libya, you get put in prison for
[16:06.380 --> 16:07.740]  that.
[16:07.740 --> 16:12.980]  But there's real raping going on by the jihadis they put in charge of areas of Syria they've
[16:12.980 --> 16:20.500]  taken. And now areas that they've taken control of since they kicked Mubarak out and put al-Qaeda
[16:20.500 --> 16:26.740]  light in control of Egypt. So it's very simple. The globalists are putting al-Qaeda and jihadis
[16:26.740 --> 16:34.500]  and Saudi Arabian and Qatari and all these other special forces in advised by Mossad,
[16:34.500 --> 16:42.540]  by Shin Bet, by MI6, by MI5, by CIA, by German special forces, French special forces that
[16:42.540 --> 16:47.980]  I mentioned British, NATO, and they just publicly operate.
[16:47.980 --> 16:55.380]  And they've invaded now in the last 22 months with over 100,000. Over 100,000 at any one
[16:55.380 --> 17:00.940]  time, it's about 50,000. Al-Qaeda Taliban, some even out of Pakistan and Afghanistan,
[17:00.940 --> 17:05.060]  and they are blowing up churches and synagogues. They are chopping Christians heads off on
[17:05.060 --> 17:11.660]  TV. When we posted it on our YouTube channel, they banned the video, and then we had to
[17:11.660 --> 17:17.940]  follow all sorts of stuff, even keep our websites up, our video sites up for the public.
[17:17.940 --> 17:21.860]  Chopping Christian heads off, blowing up churches, and they've got about half of Syria under
[17:21.860 --> 17:26.460]  their control. They've got about half of Syria under their control. And again, people go,
[17:26.460 --> 17:32.740]  well, Assad's a bad guy. Really, his dad did some butchering, did some massacres compared
[17:32.740 --> 17:37.580]  to Al-Qaeda. He was an angel as well. I certainly don't wanna live there. I'm not a Muslim.
[17:37.580 --> 17:43.660]  I'm not an Alawite. I'm an American, but I support the Bill of Rights Constitution, and
[17:43.660 --> 17:50.820]  I do not support preemptive, fraudulent, evil attacks, very evil, to inject Al-Qaeda into
[17:50.820 --> 17:56.340]  Libya and Syria, to overtake them, and then to wreck the infrastructure, to screw the
[17:56.340 --> 17:57.340]  countries up.
[17:57.340 --> 18:04.020]  And then now they're announcing they're getting ready to bomb Al-Qaeda in Syria. And I guarantee
[18:04.020 --> 18:07.580]  you when they do this, they're actually gonna bomb Syrian forces. Cuz the public doesn't
[18:07.580 --> 18:11.700]  know the difference between Syria and the Syrian army and Assad and Al-Qaeda. And the
[18:11.700 --> 18:21.180]  news is actually going along with this. And so Israel said that they were attacking chemical
[18:21.180 --> 18:27.420]  weapons and stuff. They were killing Iranian generals that are there advising with Hezbollah.
[18:27.420 --> 18:30.500]  And it doesn't matter, just lie to the public. And again, I'm not a fan of the mullahs and
[18:30.500 --> 18:34.140]  what Iran's doing either, but they're not attacking us. And the globalists are trying
[18:34.140 --> 18:38.620]  to start a fight with them too, because during that war, they can take our liberties at home.
[18:38.620 --> 18:43.040]  You see, it's the New World Order that is here taking control of my life and your life.
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.140]  It's the New World Order devaluing the dollar. It's the New World Order engaged in economic
[18:47.140 --> 18:49.220]  shutdowns of our economy.
[18:49.220 --> 18:54.140]  And so now, to go over the headlines here, you notice the red line. They said if any
[18:54.140 --> 18:59.180]  chemical weapons get used, and before this happened, we told you, they're shipping chemical
[18:59.180 --> 19:05.620]  weapons in. Wayne Madsen, Webster Tarpley, reporters that have been there, gone to Syria,
[19:05.620 --> 19:10.620]  we've had on. And we've had Syrians on via Skype, and they said the word is they're bringing
[19:10.620 --> 19:12.980]  chemicals in to use them and blame us.
[19:12.980 --> 19:17.860]  Of course, Syria would never do that, because it gives a pretext for an invasion. And it's
[19:17.860 --> 19:22.460]  not even a very good weapon against guerrilla forces you can't find, it's a weapon of terror.
[19:22.460 --> 19:28.140]  So it'll turn the population against them, they would never use it. So now Syrian rebels,
[19:28.140 --> 19:33.860]  regime blame each other for first alleged chemical weapon attack, at least 25 dead.
[19:33.860 --> 19:40.940]  This is all going on today. And just yesterday, Obama and Netanyahu and the rest were saying
[19:40.940 --> 19:45.660]  we've got to go attack or invade because of chemical weapons. And if Al Qaeda uses them,
[19:45.660 --> 19:51.100]  we'll go in too. So you put Al Qaeda in to overthrow a sovereign nation, and then you
[19:51.100 --> 19:55.220]  use Al Qaeda and then when they use chemical weapons, you invade and overthrow the government
[19:55.220 --> 20:00.980]  you're attacking. Incredible.

[23:57.100 --> 24:13.780]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here back live. We're going to get into a bunch of other geopolitical
[24:13.780 --> 24:21.740]  news and economic news and is Obama the Antichrist news coming up in the next segment. But for
[24:21.740 --> 24:26.580]  TV viewers, for radio listeners, you can just pull up these articles there at info wars.com
[24:26.580 --> 24:32.740]  and places like grudgereport.com and there's video as well. Syrian rebels fire chemical
[24:32.740 --> 24:39.540]  weapons in Aleppo or Aleppo, how they pronounce it, killing at least 25 the government is
[24:39.540 --> 24:44.580]  saying. And of course, Al Qaeda is denying responsibility. Now, I've been telling you
[24:44.580 --> 24:50.220]  for a year from our sources that they would stage a chemical attack and blame it on Syria.
[24:50.220 --> 24:55.660]  And that is now being done. In fact, here is an article right here on the London Telegraph.
[24:55.660 --> 25:00.380]  Syria's regime accused rebel fighters of firing chemical weapons at a town in the country's
[25:00.380 --> 25:04.980]  north. The regime has claimed that 25 people were killed in the attack, which the rebels
[25:04.980 --> 25:09.500]  have denied responsibility for. This afternoon, the White House said it was looking carefully
[25:09.500 --> 25:14.380]  at allegations that a chemical weapon attack had taken place with a spokesman saying there
[25:14.380 --> 25:18.700]  was no evidence yet to substantiate the claim that the rebels were responsible.
[25:18.700 --> 25:23.700]  Get ready for the White House to blame Syria. And this is just so amazing. Remember, it's
[25:23.700 --> 25:30.220]  the West that initiated this. Military attacks on the government, blowing up police stations,
[25:30.220 --> 25:35.180]  you name it, almost two years ago, about 23 months ago. And they have been running the
[25:35.180 --> 25:41.180]  whole thing, shipping armaments in. They gave Al Qaeda more than 10,000 missiles. Heat seekers,
[25:41.180 --> 25:44.180]  it's more like 20,000, but 10,000 of them are heat seekers.
[25:44.180 --> 25:47.700]  The Benghazi killing of the ambassador was to cover that up. Remember, they shipped guns
[25:47.700 --> 25:52.060]  into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment. This is a criminal group. These aren't just
[25:52.060 --> 25:57.260]  words I'm saying here. It's scary to get up and expose these people, but it's gotta be
[25:57.260 --> 26:01.500]  done. You realize it's revolutionary that this radio show is on the air all over the
[26:01.500 --> 26:06.500]  country. You realize it shows we haven't been fully taken over yet.
[26:06.500 --> 26:12.860]  You've just got criminals in government that sit up there engaging in giant hoaxes to sell
[26:12.860 --> 26:20.540]  the military, the police, the bureaucracy, the general public on tyranny. The truth is
[26:20.540 --> 26:23.900]  America always faced these threats before, but why didn't we get rid of the Bill of Rights
[26:23.900 --> 26:24.900]  then?
[26:24.900 --> 26:31.380]  Because you don't get rid of the Bill of Rights. You don't get rid of the Bill of Rights to
[26:31.380 --> 26:36.300]  protect yourself. The Bill of Rights protects you. One of our great graphics people, Janae
[26:36.300 --> 26:40.820]  Meadows, award-winning graphics person, she makes big Hollywood posters, you name it.
[26:40.820 --> 26:46.460]  She just won a diesel clothing award for her designs for diesel clothing, side issue. She
[26:46.460 --> 26:49.860]  came by the office, she lives in California. Her and her boyfriend came by the office a
[26:49.860 --> 26:56.780]  few days ago and gave me this US fighting man's code. This is not the first time I've
[26:56.780 --> 26:58.140]  been given a version of this.
[26:58.140 --> 27:02.420]  I've got a bunch of these and always forget to cover them. But I wanna do a TV piece where
[27:02.420 --> 27:07.540]  I show blow ups of this because if this was issued, this was issued by Dwight D. Eisenhower,
[27:07.540 --> 27:12.400]  it even has an executive order in there, and he even wrote some of this. This is the guy
[27:12.400 --> 27:15.140]  that warned us about the military industrial complex.
[27:15.140 --> 27:20.020]  If this was issued today by myself, the Southern Poverty Law Center would call it a terrorist
[27:20.020 --> 27:30.860]  document. This was issued in 1956 by Dwight D. Eisenhower during the Korean War. And then
[27:30.860 --> 27:35.620]  it was used also in Vietnam. And I was reading this this morning again, and I mean, it's
[27:35.620 --> 27:37.040]  like I wrote it.
[27:37.040 --> 27:45.460]  Look at the first page. The first page when you open it is resistance to tyrants is obedience
[27:45.460 --> 27:53.240]  to God. And it's all about how to resist torture, Americans don't torture, Americans don't spy
[27:53.240 --> 27:59.700]  without warrants, how communist operate, how they infiltrate society. And boy, you read
[27:59.700 --> 28:06.580]  this, you would think it was the Democratic Party and MSNBC.
[28:06.580 --> 28:11.020]  And you would think that the North Korean officers they describe are our government
[28:11.020 --> 28:16.860]  now, the ATF. And this is copyright open, this is the government, I ought to republish
[28:16.860 --> 28:21.300]  this, man, this is unbelievable. And then like have notes in it about how it compares
[28:21.300 --> 28:28.900]  to today, the fighting man's code.
[28:28.900 --> 28:33.360]  And my greatest frustration is there's hundreds of news pieces we've got on the shelf that
[28:33.360 --> 28:36.900]  haven't been finished cuz I've got to write the voiceover for them. And that's no exaggeration,
[28:36.900 --> 28:41.380]  we probably got over 100 incredible reports, where I've just bitten off more than I can
[28:41.380 --> 28:43.420]  chew and just can't get it all done.
[28:43.420 --> 28:48.740]  That's why I'm so frustrated. I wanna see other talk show hosts, other people really
[28:48.740 --> 28:54.700]  get with the program and realize that this is all real. And that we can save our society
[28:54.700 --> 28:59.980]  and our culture, I really wanna do that desperately. Look at this in the back, it says our reliance
[28:59.980 --> 29:08.060]  is in the love of liberty, which God has planted in us, Abraham Lincoln.
[29:08.060 --> 29:20.780]  I mean, you've got to love liberty to keep it. It just doesn't happen. And it's all about
[29:20.780 --> 29:25.980]  God. I mean, you would never see this, they're taking the crosses down to military bases
[29:25.980 --> 29:32.220]  and they're replacing it with deviltry. All right, we're gonna come right back. This country
[29:32.220 --> 29:37.020]  was founded by Christians who gave you the right, pointed out the right, that you can
[29:37.020 --> 29:38.700]  practice whatever religion you want.
[29:38.700 --> 29:44.060]  Now the people that use that right are trying to take our rights away. It's not separation
[29:44.060 --> 29:49.740]  of church and state, that doesn't mean, that means the state isn't involved in religion.
[29:49.740 --> 30:02.460]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:00.660 --> 32:05.020]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[32:05.020 --> 32:10.140]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[32:10.140 --> 32:15.660]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[32:15.660 --> 32:20.820]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at

[33:26.940 --> 33:44.940]  There has been a popular meme on the Internet in the last week and a half or so pointing
[33:44.940 --> 33:54.300]  out the hit cable television series, the Bible, pointing out that the devil who goes throughout
[33:54.300 --> 34:09.620]  the series looks like Obama. And the reason the White House fears this is because it's
[34:09.620 --> 34:21.820]  the type of simple minded meme that can actually get across to the population. That's why they
[34:21.820 --> 34:26.740]  said that Saddam had thrown babies out of incubators and stomped their brains out.
[34:26.740 --> 34:31.620]  They used a PR firm to put that out back in 1990, 1991. None of it was true. That was
[34:31.620 --> 34:38.440]  later admitted. That's why they said that Gaddafi had his troops raping women fueled
[34:38.440 --> 34:44.580]  by Viagra. It's just something saucy to demonize the people. And I'm not saying Saddam or Muammar
[34:44.580 --> 34:50.940]  Gaddafi were good guys either. It's just the globalist will demonize someone with an outlandish
[34:50.940 --> 35:03.780]  over the top charge right before they destroy them.
[35:03.780 --> 35:11.460]  And so it's the type of yellow journalistic, simplistic demonization that the establishment
[35:11.460 --> 35:18.220]  understands because they know it's effective. It's like a meme. The Obama deception, deception.
[35:18.220 --> 35:23.060]  I never meant that to even become a meme. I wanted to point out he was a liar. Now it's
[35:23.060 --> 35:30.700]  become a meme. And so Obama Satan, Obama the devil has become a meme, not just now.
[35:30.700 --> 35:36.600]  That's been going on for years. A lot of preachers and people like Pastor Manning saying they
[35:36.600 --> 35:46.580]  believe he is the Antichrist. Now let me just say this. Undoubtedly, Obama lies at a level
[35:46.580 --> 35:51.660]  way beyond anything I've ever seen. But more than it being about Obama, it's about the
[35:51.660 --> 35:57.580]  season that Obama is in today.
[35:57.580 --> 36:03.060]  We are in the throes of global tyranny. We are in the throes of global decadence. We
[36:03.060 --> 36:08.460]  are in the throes of not just an evil establishment, but a more and more corrupt and decadent world
[36:08.460 --> 36:16.740]  population disconnected from reality thanks to Hollywood and other culture destroying
[36:16.740 --> 36:18.620]  corrosive elements.
[36:18.620 --> 36:23.620]  We're following into a very decadent sector of the cycle. Now I don't like Obama. He's
[36:23.620 --> 36:28.900]  a horrible tyrant. He reads off a teleprompter. He is a globalist insider. He's obviously
[36:28.900 --> 36:35.680]  very intelligent, but still a puppet, just like George W. Bush, who obviously isn't the
[36:35.680 --> 36:37.220]  sharpest knife in the drawer.
[36:37.220 --> 36:42.940]  But he has been an effective evil, not a lesser of two evils from Mitt Romney or George W.
[36:42.940 --> 36:48.540]  Bush, but a more effective evil, as former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney has pointed
[36:48.540 --> 36:56.480]  out here on this broadcast. And so it's fun at a base level to demonize Obama, and it's
[36:56.480 --> 37:02.680]  also effective. But you need to understand that he is the figurehead. He is the masthead.
[37:02.680 --> 37:07.500]  He's the goddess they've got on the front of the boat. He's the gargoyle they've got
[37:07.500 --> 37:13.860]  guarding the entrance to the castle. But he still is the pitchman. Like so many corporate
[37:13.860 --> 37:19.360]  presidents, it's their job to go to all the events and go to the golf parties and go cut
[37:19.360 --> 37:20.360]  the red ribbons.
[37:20.360 --> 37:26.620]  He is a front man, but he represents the establishment, and he is light years more deceptive than
[37:26.620 --> 37:34.940]  even slick willing. He makes George W. Bush's fumbling lying look tame, and the lies are
[37:34.940 --> 37:42.660]  mega whoppers. There will be no pre-existing conditions that are not covered, massive expansion
[37:42.660 --> 37:46.820]  of pre-existing conditions under Obamacare.
[37:46.820 --> 37:50.820]  Doubling of premiums on average, written by the insurance companies, death panels to deny
[37:50.820 --> 37:59.420]  people brain surgery, eye surgery, knee surgery, hellish control. The collectivist trap, your
[37:59.420 --> 38:05.340]  supermarket purchasing records with smart cards uploaded to Homeland Security and then
[38:05.340 --> 38:08.820]  to the Department of Health and Human Services.
[38:08.820 --> 38:14.780]  I mean beyond 1984, insurance premiums going up if they see you're buying too much beer
[38:14.780 --> 38:22.580]  and Blue Bell Dutch chocolate ice cream. They know when you go and buy a knee bandage, it's
[38:22.580 --> 38:29.880]  all put into computer algorithms, everything, living in a glass house.
[38:29.880 --> 38:38.540]  The end of justice, Obama funding massive abortion worldwide. Obama funding forced abortion
[38:38.540 --> 38:43.020]  where they basically make you have an abortion if you want any government funding in India
[38:43.020 --> 38:49.820]  and areas of Africa. While saying he cares about the third world, my point is, is that
[38:49.820 --> 39:03.220]  Obama is the closest to the devil of any president we've ever had.
[39:03.220 --> 39:11.000]  If you look at the characteristics of the devil, if you look at the characteristics
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.900]  of the biblical devil or the devil and even other cultures, Hindu, you name it, it is
[39:17.900 --> 39:24.120]  very, very similar and very, very close to what Obama is doing because we do have a devilish
[39:24.120 --> 39:25.420]  power structure.
[39:25.420 --> 39:32.180]  We do have a power structure that is absolutely degenerated and gotten away with more and
[39:32.180 --> 39:37.340]  more and a public that has just accepted that they're going to lie to us. And so now the
[39:37.340 --> 39:42.020]  bottom has fallen out, the floor has fallen out and there's nothing there underpinning
[39:42.020 --> 39:49.480]  us. There's no rudder. And so the sky or the pit of hell is the limit.
[39:49.480 --> 39:54.160]  So that said, it's fun to call in the Antichrist. It's fun to make connections and allusions
[39:54.160 --> 39:59.820]  to it. But I wanted to explain to people here with some Bible verses. Here's one out of
[39:59.820 --> 40:18.100]  John 2.18, even now there are many Antichrist in the world, even now there are many Antichrist.
[40:18.100 --> 40:25.100]  Here's another Bible verse I want to get to before I break this down. John 8.44, you are
[40:25.100 --> 40:31.740]  of the father, the devil. You are of your father, the devil and you want to do the desires
[40:31.740 --> 40:36.980]  of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth
[40:36.980 --> 40:39.780]  because there is no truth in him.
[40:39.780 --> 40:45.340]  Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father
[40:45.340 --> 40:53.980]  of lies. I don't want the NDAA to pass. And then it turns out Obama and his lawyers wrote
[40:53.980 --> 41:02.660]  it. Then don't worry, I won't sign it and then does sign it. We've got to attack Syria
[41:02.660 --> 41:08.940]  because Al Qaeda is there and Assad is with Al Qaeda. Publicly knowing that they put Al
[41:08.940 --> 41:15.400]  Qaeda in and that they run Al Qaeda in Libya, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, worldwide.
[41:15.400 --> 41:21.220]  That is lies within lies. What is it when a global corporate government funds all sides
[41:21.220 --> 41:27.100]  of a conflict? That is a full spectrum lie. The whole thing is a artificial synthetic
[41:27.100 --> 41:33.180]  counterfeit of conflict. You want the oil, you want the opium? Fund a terror group, don't
[41:33.180 --> 41:35.300]  even really take out that terror group.
[41:35.300 --> 41:39.160]  Arrest innocent 12 year old kids, take them and torture them for seven years at Guantanamo
[41:39.160 --> 41:44.780]  Bay and then make them jihadi brigade commanders for your next war. That's why they admit,
[41:44.780 --> 41:48.440]  why are they releasing everyone from Guantanamo Bay after five, six, seven years and they
[41:48.440 --> 41:53.620]  all go become terrorists. And then they have, it's even in the news where the jihadi commander
[41:53.620 --> 41:58.140]  of Al Qaeda in Libya is allowed to travel to the United States.
[41:58.140 --> 42:02.780]  Everyone's like, why is that? Because he works for the globalists that have hijacked America.
[42:02.780 --> 42:10.500]  Is that not the father of lies? Is that not a system that gives birth to lies? So yes,
[42:10.500 --> 42:19.060]  Barack Obama is an Antichrist. In fact, he's the greatest modern expression of a slick,
[42:19.060 --> 42:25.900]  good looking liar who can tell lies on top of lies twisted within other lies with added
[42:25.900 --> 42:29.100]  spin and deception.
[42:29.100 --> 42:35.820]  So yes, it resonates that Obama is a devil. But so are the Republican leadership that
[42:35.820 --> 42:40.380]  work with him and act like they're opposing him when they actually aren't. And then they
[42:40.380 --> 42:46.440]  create that synthetic response, that dialectic where the two sides come together. But they're
[42:46.440 --> 42:52.640]  actually within the same spectrum and then agree on what the social engineers already
[42:52.640 --> 42:53.900]  wanted.
[42:53.900 --> 42:59.980]  Bush comes in, tyranny, oppression, all these new regulations. Obama comes in, tyranny,
[42:59.980 --> 43:04.560]  oppression, new regulations. And as soon as Obama leaves office, the dictatorship of the
[43:04.560 --> 43:10.500]  office will be there. The presidency is now dictatorial by every yardstick. But the president
[43:10.500 --> 43:17.600]  themselves leaves, I see another deception, and a new puppet, a new figurehead.
[43:17.600 --> 43:24.780]  The new prom king, the new prom queen, the new front, they step in to that position to
[43:24.780 --> 43:30.580]  play king for a day. So that you associate all the tyranny and all the hatred that you
[43:30.580 --> 43:35.760]  put into the system on them and so a new fresh face comes in. Like a knight who has a shield
[43:35.760 --> 43:41.300]  in combat, Obama is a shield, Bush is a shield or a shield, a foil.
[43:41.300 --> 43:45.160]  They take the heat, they are the surrogates of the globalist. And when the night is done
[43:45.160 --> 43:50.460]  with Obama, he'll throw the shield off and take on a new shield. And sure, the shield
[43:50.460 --> 43:57.260]  is disgusting, the shield has the enemy segment, the shield is a projection of the teleprompter.
[43:57.260 --> 44:03.020]  It is the propaganda of the globalist, it's like birdcage liner. I'm focusing on the parrot,
[44:03.020 --> 44:07.140]  the New World Order buzzard that sits there defecating on us.
[44:07.140 --> 44:12.340]  And that we have to feed and take care of and listen to squawking at us. And the media
[44:12.340 --> 44:19.240]  always focuses on Clinton or Bush or Obama, the birdcage liner. And the buck stops with
[44:19.240 --> 44:23.900]  them and red carpets and thousands of troops on the streets to protect them when they go
[44:23.900 --> 44:28.380]  to third world countries or America. So that it's all the pomp and circumstance, the great
[44:28.380 --> 44:36.500]  and magnificent eyes, I am the great and wondrous eyes, see me and tremble.
[44:36.500 --> 44:42.420]  And F-18s fly over him in his inauguration and a million people come out and red carpets
[44:42.420 --> 44:52.140]  and Hollywood stars and dinners and marveling at the president and the sycophantic salivation
[44:52.140 --> 44:58.100]  over everything he's doing. Is that not Satan? Is that not the power of the prince and of
[44:58.100 --> 45:02.180]  the air? Is that not the power of the prince and the principalities? Is that not what the
[45:02.180 --> 45:08.180]  Bible, please give me the verse, the evil in high places where Satan, the devil takes
[45:08.180 --> 45:10.900]  Christ upon the mountain and says all of this could be yours.
[45:10.900 --> 45:17.020]  I control every government out there, bow to me, kneel to me and I will make you the
[45:17.020 --> 45:25.340]  antichrist. I will give you dominion over this planet. The delusion of Satan who'd been
[45:25.340 --> 45:32.420]  given dominion to test, to be part of the test of God's elect, saying to the physical
[45:32.420 --> 45:39.060]  incarnation of the creator of the universe, I will give you this mote of dust, this nothing.
[45:39.060 --> 45:45.340]  What a joke. And God in the body of Christ had to bring himself down to the level of
[45:45.340 --> 45:53.340]  40 days with no food to put himself in a weakened position to fully conquer his flesh. I can't
[45:53.340 --> 45:58.060]  drive by a steakhouse without wanting to go in and eat that meat if I smell it, it's over.
[45:58.060 --> 46:02.860]  I can't stand to be at a party where alcohol is being drunk and not drink it. I am weak,
[46:02.860 --> 46:09.420]  my flesh is weak. But Christ went and conquered his flesh 40 days without food in the desert.
[46:09.420 --> 46:15.420]  And his body absolutely at its weakest to be offered food and drink and the whole world
[46:15.420 --> 46:21.460]  and all of it flashing through his mind because God had to desire and smell women and see
[46:21.460 --> 46:26.500]  their beautiful curves and their electric eyes and the flesh's desire. Christ had to
[46:26.500 --> 46:32.900]  have that first test, a shadow of his crucifixion, a shadow of the great test that was coming.
[46:32.900 --> 46:38.060]  That even though it was God in the flesh, God said, I will show you what I can do. God
[46:38.060 --> 46:43.860]  in the flesh, Jesus wept thinking about being beaten and tortured, all of it going through
[46:43.860 --> 46:49.660]  his mind and all the sins of everybody before him and currently and after to be piled on
[46:49.660 --> 46:55.100]  in a giant psychic experience of being fed all the child molesting, all the murder, all
[46:55.100 --> 47:00.940]  the death, all the torture, all the mothers crying, all the sorrow, all the degradation,
[47:00.940 --> 47:01.940]  all of it.
[47:01.940 --> 47:06.780]  All of it, the children with buzzards eating their bodies, all of it, trillions and trillions
[47:06.780 --> 47:13.400]  of experiences fed right through the eye of God, straight through Jesus Christ. The creator
[47:13.400 --> 47:18.220]  of the universe physically experiencing that in an earth suit on this planet. That's the
[47:18.220 --> 47:24.380]  opposite of the devil, the devil with the red carpets and the jumbo jets and all the
[47:24.380 --> 47:28.820]  soulless, unhappy Hollywood people.
[47:28.820 --> 47:37.700]  Yes, Obama is the antichrist. He is a antichrist. He is the spirit of the world. He is the spirit
[47:37.700 --> 47:46.900]  of Beelzebub, Baphomet, Leviathan, the devil. He is the devil. Barack Obama is the devil.
[47:46.900 --> 47:52.780]  And any of you that turn yourselves over willingly to deception and willingly to lies and willingly
[47:52.780 --> 47:59.420]  to hurt the innocent, you are of the devil and you are antichrist. All of us who have
[47:59.420 --> 48:04.860]  flesh, we are at one level, the antichrist, but our soul is different.
[48:04.860 --> 48:10.660]  But when you turn your soul over to evil, knowing God's truth, experiencing and tasting
[48:10.660 --> 48:17.740]  of the Holy Spirit and denying it and saying I go with Satan, that is the ultimate sin.
[48:17.740 --> 48:26.140]  And you are damned at that point because you have shut the door. I just feel sorry for
[48:26.140 --> 48:39.700]  people that have never even experienced the deathless waters of creation.
[48:39.700 --> 48:50.060]  So to expand on all this, yes, ladies and gentlemen, Obama is a antichrist. Obama is
[48:50.060 --> 48:56.740]  as wicked as the day is long, but he is only a pathetic puppet. He is only a pathetic agent
[48:56.740 --> 49:03.420]  of the great evil that is to manifest on this planet. He is only a precursor. He is only
[49:03.420 --> 49:21.300]  in the satanic evolution part of the system building towards what is to come.
[49:21.300 --> 49:24.300]  And so everybody jokes around, it's fun to call him the devil and fun to call him the
[49:24.300 --> 49:30.620]  antichrist and say, the guy on the Bible TV show, the hit show, he looks like Obama, on
[49:30.620 --> 49:38.040]  and on and on and on. It's something entertaining to do, to sit there and say, he's the devil.
[49:38.040 --> 49:44.180]  But if you look at the works of Obama, if you look at what Obama actually stands for,
[49:44.180 --> 49:49.780]  if you look at what Obama has become, if you look at what Obama really does versus what
[49:49.780 --> 49:52.660]  he says he's going to do, it's pure deception.
[49:52.660 --> 49:56.500]  Telling poor people, I'm gonna give you free health care and forcing them to buy double
[49:56.500 --> 50:01.900]  price care that is watered down and becomes a government death panel to control our lives,
[50:01.900 --> 50:09.340]  to collectivize everyone and put us all into a system where the general public can sit
[50:09.340 --> 50:15.940]  there and lecture all of us and say, I can tell you what to eat, I can tell you how much
[50:15.940 --> 50:20.200]  to sleep, I can tell you where you can go, cuz we're all in this together now.
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.980]  It's like making the whole country one giant weird homeowners association, but it's a homeowners
[50:25.980 --> 50:32.860]  association run by child molesting devil worshippers who now have access into your bank accounts.
[50:32.860 --> 50:37.480]  What you buy, what you do can take the money out of your account. Imagine the cashless
[50:37.480 --> 50:42.560]  society once it comes in, when they can turn your chip off and you can buy it or sell.
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.500]  And when you try to get food, that's the ultimate crime punishable by forced labor in one of
[50:47.500 --> 50:50.820]  these satanic FEMA death camps they've built.
[50:50.820 --> 50:57.940]  So yes, Obama is an antichrist, not the antichrist, and he is of his father, the devil. He is
[50:57.940 --> 51:01.140]  a liar. It is his nature.
[51:01.140 --> 51:04.900]  If you're listening, you'd know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If

[52:01.340 --> 52:06.720]  this neighborhood for years. We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[52:06.720 --> 52:10.980]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes. The police
[52:10.980 --> 52:16.480]  arrived in about 20 minutes but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns.
[52:16.480 --> 52:21.160]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home? The police officer said that more than
[52:21.160 --> 52:27.040]  85% of break-ins are through a door and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders. The
[52:27.040 --> 52:31.840]  officer told me to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop
[52:31.840 --> 52:37.500]  an intruder. Easy Armor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed

[54:19.320 --> 54:26.600]  Alex Jones here back live. Life is very, very short. That's why the globalists are obsessed
[54:26.600 --> 54:36.560]  with life extension technologies. They fear the afterlife and they should. If you expand
[54:36.560 --> 54:41.400]  on the things that are happening in our culture, you can just see how the lies, even though
[54:41.400 --> 54:45.440]  people don't trust the system, they still don't know what to do because the system never
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.400]  admits what it's doing, even when it's public, because they don't want to have a debate.
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.500]  It's a way of just stonewalling, saying I'm not going to talk about it. Because we're
[54:54.500 --> 55:00.480]  going into a dictatorial system. And here's an article up at InfoWars.com. Speaking of
[55:00.480 --> 55:05.000]  deception, for about a year, they've been stonewalling now what is 2 billion bullets,
[55:05.000 --> 55:12.120]  armored vehicles, paramilitary training, army times admitting, preparing for domestic operations,
[55:12.120 --> 55:16.480]  Homeland Security reports saying gun owners, conservatives, libertarians are the enemy.
[55:16.480 --> 55:23.700]  This is a domestic buildup. And now New Jersey Congressman, Leonard Lance, a Republican has
[55:23.700 --> 55:29.920]  demanded an explanation from Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano as to why
[55:29.920 --> 55:35.140]  the Department of Homeland Security is buying huge amounts of bullets. And we'll play his
[55:35.140 --> 55:41.620]  question and her response here in just a moment. But the issue here is that you notice they
[55:41.620 --> 55:46.720]  just still have Politico and Media Manners, both White House organs come out and say it
[55:46.720 --> 55:53.840]  doesn't exist, and then laugh. And then their commenters, who are mainly just bots, sit
[55:53.840 --> 55:56.440]  there and laugh and say, aren't they insane?
[55:56.440 --> 56:01.760]  To create a perception for other people that come and read that, this isn't true. Look,
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.200]  not only is the establishment saying it, not only is the snake saying eat of the fruit,
[56:06.200 --> 56:10.940]  it's good, but Eve is taking a bite and saying, look at them, it's good. See, they like to
[56:10.940 --> 56:16.160]  have the establishment lie and then have a big gallery. They could even be robots in
[56:16.160 --> 56:21.520]  the future that look like people as long as they laugh and go, see, that's how the psychology
[56:21.520 --> 56:22.520]  works.
[56:22.520 --> 56:29.160]  And they've got it down to make you feel like you're weird. Like I think Waco was horrible
[56:29.160 --> 56:33.400]  how they blew that place up and burned it up and used the military. Shut up, kook. I
[56:33.400 --> 56:37.600]  don't like the TSA grabbing my genitals. Shut up, kook. Well, first, it's we don't do that
[56:37.600 --> 56:43.060]  and then shut up. What's wrong with that? Again, it's about dominating you, but that
[56:43.060 --> 56:48.520]  isn't working anymore. The good news is they're having to admit that they're the Wizard of
[56:48.520 --> 56:51.200]  Oz, that it's all a big fraud now.
[56:51.200 --> 56:55.100]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip. It's up at infowars.com. We are breaking this. There
[56:55.100 --> 56:57.000]  has been no coverage of this. Here it is.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.360]  Recently, Forbes magazine published an article in which they voiced concern about the Department
[57:01.360 --> 57:07.580]  of Homeland Security and other non-military federal agencies purchasing over 1.5 billion
[57:07.580 --> 57:13.320]  rounds of ammunition. That far exceeds anything they've purchased in the past. In addition
[57:13.320 --> 57:19.120]  to that, recently they've acquired close to 3,000 heavily armed vehicles that are being
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.440]  used for, they say, domestic purposes. What's going on here?
[57:23.440 --> 57:29.000]  I think Congress should ask the department about both of those issues, and I would like
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.760]  a full explanation as to why that has been done. And I have every confidence that the
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.520]  Oversight Committee, or perhaps the Intelligence Committee, but I would imagine the Oversight
[57:39.520 --> 57:43.240]  Committee should ask those questions. And I do not tonight have an answer as to why
[57:43.240 --> 57:49.040]  they did what they did, but I certainly share a belief that Congress has a responsibility
[57:49.040 --> 57:55.760]  to ask Secretary Napolitano as to exactly why these purchases have occurred.
[57:55.760 --> 57:57.480]  How concerned are you about this?
[57:57.480 --> 58:04.280]  I am concerned, and I think that we have to make sure we continue to live in a country
[58:04.280 --> 58:10.960]  based on freedom, a country based upon individual rights, and I hope that we in Congress get
[58:10.960 --> 58:15.960]  the answers to these questions. And I'll give you another example. We're certainly in the
[58:15.960 --> 58:18.920]  House, we've been working hard, not the Congress.
[58:18.920 --> 58:23.360]  That's pretty much the end of it. But the issue is, he's officially also reportedly
[58:23.360 --> 58:27.760]  sent a letter asking for it. No answer yet, so that's her answer. He'll probably say it
[58:27.760 --> 58:34.280]  doesn't exist. Even though it publicly exists, like they said, there's no drone program,
[58:34.280 --> 58:43.120]  Wizard of Oz, lie to the population. Lyndon LaRouche is coming up.
[58:43.120 --> 58:51.200]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.200 --> 58:55.880]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[58:55.880 --> 59:01.480]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[59:01.480 --> 59:06.920]  a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are

[59:20.320 --> 59:25.120]  gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver
[59:25.120 --> 59:30.640]  at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing
[59:30.640 --> 59:35.720]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the
[59:35.720 --> 59:44.120]  silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

[59:53.200 --> 59:58.600]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.600 --> 01:00:12.160]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:21.120]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:32.000]  Here are some of the headlines up at infoawards.com. UT professors analyze Alex Jones and Rand
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.400]  Paul's following and find some of the most important pro-liberty followings in the country.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.480]  I'm sure that group of professionals will get in trouble. That's in the Daily Texan.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:49.040]  Chase customers see bank balance reduced to zero. Oh, yeah. Might want to see that article
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:55.120]  by Paul Joseph Watson. Congressman asked Big Sis to explain huge ammo purchases. No word
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:02.280]  yet from his letter. Ron Paul, the congressional budget debate is just a sideshow. Yeah, compared
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.720]  to the big derivatives issues and the rest of it. It's all a distraction. They're deciding
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.440]  what type of Chardonnay to have on the Titanic as it's listing.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.800]  Feinstein's gun bill crumbles, but they've got all their gun show ban stuff in there,
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:22.380]  which is a registration program. Ex-Chancellor warns of bank runs across Europe. The great
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:27.760]  Cyprus bank run shows that no bank account is safe. It's not called a haircut. It's theft
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.820]  when government loots your private bank accounts. Mike Adams, Gerald Cilente, Cyprus looting
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.000]  is only the beginning for the global elite.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.760]  Now, I wanted to get him on about a month ago, but he's been too busy. I understand
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:46.760]  why. Just about the financial meltdown, about all the tyranny Obama's pushing. But now,
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:52.080]  we like to have people on that are accurate. People that are right over and over again,
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:57.380]  and they get demonized. And so coming up the next segment for the rest of the hour, Lyndon
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.160]  LaRouche is gonna be joining us.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:06.800]  90 years old, has the brain of about a 30 year old. I tell you, he's certainly my model
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:13.080]  when it comes to what I wish I'd be like when I'm that old. He's gonna be joining us, and
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:18.560]  he really is a iconic individual when it comes to the American political landscape.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.080]  And that's why the media just demonizes him, but I'll talk about that as we officially
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.280]  introduce him in the next segment. But I know he's there listening right now, as I saw him
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.440]  on the line over there on video Skype. He's got the best video Skype I've ever seen, by
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.420]  the way, looks like he's in the room.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.960]  That's coming up. If you're a TV viewer, or if you're a radio listener, you should go

[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520]  well.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.920]  So if you're not a prisonplanet.tv member, now is the time. We're also gonna have Cody
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.000]  Wilson, we broke the story last year where the Don Salazar, since then it's been in hundreds
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.200]  of major publications. The inventor of the 3D printable gun and printable clips, who
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.440]  is a thought criminal and been listed as a major threat by The Globalist. He is gonna
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:42.480]  be joining us in studio as well today, and we'll open the phones up for that gentleman.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.340]  Perhaps even for Lyndon LaRouche, I wanna ask him if he wants to take calls. He may
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:49.480]  have a bunch of issues he wants to cover and not be interrupted by your questions. But
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.800]  questions also bring up good wild card elements.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.600]  But when we come back with Lyndon LaRouche, I wanna ask him about just the paramilitary
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.400]  build up domestically, what it means to have these Cyprus thefts going on with 10% of the
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.660]  account being grabbed. German bank head calling for grabbing Italian money. There's no way
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:13.360]  to prop it up. If it's 1,000 plus quadrillion, then what do you do?
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:20.540]  I mean, there's no way to prop it up. And again, he's the guy first. When I was first
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.480]  reading their writings, I mean, I knew about him in the 80s and 90s. But when I was in
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:31.280]  college in the early 90s, I first read their intelligence review magazine newspaper that
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.280]  comes out.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.300]  And it just really fit with my own research. And then over the years, it's just been proven
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:45.020]  to be incredibly accurate. You can disagree with their solutions or with their interpretation
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:50.740]  of solutions. But I don't think you can disagree with the analysis provided by the LaRouche
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:56.080]  pack and the LaRouche organization. And that's why they're so demonized. So he joins us on
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.060]  the other side of this quick break. Please stay with us.

[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:17.600]  cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:28.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Alex Jones here back live. Thank you for joining
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.960]  us here in the second hour today. There have been reported chemical attacks in northern
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:40.400]  Syria and the West is openly trying to blame it on Assad when they've been predicting that
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.800]  the Al Qaeda forces the West has put in there would use chemical weapons on them to overthrow
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.080]  the country and turn it over to the jihadis.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.240]  I'm no fan of Assad, but this is quite a war crime being committed by the globalists to
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.240]  put people, I don't know, 10, 20, 30 times worse in charge. I'm gonna get Lyndon LaRouge's
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:06.720]  take on that, the world economy, the bank holiday running for four or five days in Cyprus
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.800]  causing all sorts of panics and stock markets and bond markets around the world.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.680]  Now Lyndon LaRouge, I've got to say, really is a true visionary and trailblazer. And now
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.400]  that does not mean that I agree with all of his political solutions. But you've got to
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:33.960]  undoubtedly, undoubtedly say that he predicted the financial meltdown that would come out
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.920]  of the end of Glass-Steagall.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.680]  He predicted the derivatives crisis. He predicted the mega banks creating a global government
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:47.520]  that they control to carry out the implosion of society instead of the buildup of society.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.920]  He was the first that I really saw exposing eugenics. And of course, he'd been doing it
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.540]  for decades before I've ran into his writings.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:59.280]  And I had separately studied history on my own. So I read his writings in their executive
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.360]  intelligence briefing magazine that they put out. I knew that the history was accurate
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:10.920]  and I also learned a lot from it. But you notice they have these throwaway lines of
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.400]  you say mega banks are going to implode the world economy and bring in a global fascist
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400]  system.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.000]  That's Lyndon LaRouge. Or you're saying there's a plan to bankrupt the third world to commit
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.120]  genocide. That's Lyndon LaRouge. No, that's Lyndon LaRouge reporting on the Club of Rome,
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.840]  reporting on the UN, reporting on the British Empire, reporting on the globalist. And until
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.660]  he was demonized and set up, it was in the Washington Post that the CIA director under
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:41.920]  Reagan says he's got the best private intelligence group in the world.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:46.440]  And you know, weekly he'd land in his helicopter. He'd fly his helicopter over like George Jetson
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.800]  and landed at the CIA center in Langley and go advise them. And then they'd send him to
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.400]  talk to the Russians or talk to whoever, very important guy. And then now they just say,
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.320]  oh, the crazy man that said we'd have a banking meltdown.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:06.600]  Wow, he said the sun came up. He was a visionary. And it's an example of incredible spin. It's
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.340]  like there's no 2 billion bullets. There's no armored vehicles. We're not hopelessly
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:17.520]  in debt. agenda 21 isn't shutting down the economy. They just laugh at saying, hey, water
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.120]  is good for you.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:25.820]  That crazy man said water was good for you. They play these mind games, okay, and really
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:31.680]  tried to demonize anybody that's sitting on target. John Birch Society accurately predicted
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.160]  what was gonna happen. You'll hear these one line throwaway lines of John Birch Society
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.360]  crazy people.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:44.880]  I mean, just incredibly calm, focused, scholarly, breaking down from a right wing view, the
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.140]  global corporate fascist takeover. LaRouche, you could say, from a left wing view, but
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:55.280]  now he's called a right winger and extreme right wing by the Washington Post. The truth
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.880]  is he's a populist. And you can learn so much. I mean, he kept saying, we're in danger from
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.680]  asteroids hitting the Earth.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.320]  The last time he was on six months ago. Now look at what's been happening with all these
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.320]  asteroids and saying we're going through this asteroid, intergalactic belt, not just the
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:16.480]  smaller belt around us. Now they're admitting that's happening. So enough of introduction,
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.660]  I wanna get him on about the economy, all the things that are happening.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.320]  But first off, sir, joining us via video Skype for TV viewers, for radio listeners, you can
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.820]  go to prisonplanet.tv and watch us right now. What is front and center on your radar screen
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:34.360]  right now, sir? I wanna give you the floor for the next seven, eight minutes till we
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.360]  come back from break.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.180]  And then I've got some questions of my own. But I wanna cover the waterfront because you
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.920]  said we're gonna enter this global crisis. And now North Korea, the Middle East, the
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:51.680]  dollar, the world bond market. Where are we right now? What is most important in your
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.320]  view right now, sir?
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:59.200]  The most important thing right now is the danger of thermonuclear war. And as long as
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:06.840]  we have this president in position, we are at great risk. Now on these matters of this
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.640]  kind of warfare, you can't really predict because you don't know whether you're gonna
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:18.280]  get thermonuclear war, which means general human extinction, or not. In the meantime,
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.980]  we have a process going on like other processes which are important because they are turning
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.460]  points or potential turning points in the situation.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:33.240]  For example, we have the agreement by the Joint Chiefs of Staff who are now going to
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:40.540]  meet with Russians on the question of dealing with things like asteroids and other threats
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:48.880]  that are now becoming much more prevalent. We also have the need to build up systems
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:55.760]  to defend us against things that are flying around in nearby space. So we have a situation
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:02.160]  which we can identify things that should be discussed and decided. But there also we have
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:09.460]  no certainty that any of these things will be the outcome. This is a real war type situation
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:16.360]  broader than just warfare itself, in which the questions are more clear than the answers.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.660]  And that's the way I think we have to keep it. We cannot give you guaranteed answers.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:27.320]  We can say what the answers are to certain questions imposed the right way, just like
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.200]  this negotiation is going on with Russia and our Joint Chiefs of Staff now. We don't know
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.160]  what the outcome is, but we do understand the problem. And that's the way it is down
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:43.720]  the line. But the key thing that is certain, if this president remains in office, the United
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.620]  States is finished.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:53.720]  What are the power structures? What are the factions from your deep connections, Mr. LaRouche?
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:59.280]  Right now, in layman's terms for the audience, boil it down so we understand the parties
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:06.120]  involved and what we the people in the middle can do to tip the balance towards a less violent
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.120]  outcome.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.760]  Well, the first thing we have to always think about is we have to think about the United
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:17.680]  States, not because it is our United States as such, but because the creation of the United
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.920]  States, following what Christopher Columbus did, we had attempts to open up the Atlantic
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:32.520]  Ocean and to move out from Europe to new options in the other side of the Atlantic. Everything
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:37.280]  broke down eventually and suddenly it was our Massachusetts development and things like
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.720]  that which set the tone for what would be the new replacement for the problems of Europe.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:52.400]  So our United States, as corrupted as that has become, nonetheless represents the one
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:58.760]  major force on which the hope of the world actually depends. There are other nations
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:05.080]  which will cooperate with us, some certainly, others hopefully. But that's our situation.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:10.000]  So you're saying the world's future really does rise and fall on recapturing the republic
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.240]  that has been the laboratory of true renaissance in the last 300 years?
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:20.680]  Absolutely. If you look at the situation in the transatlantic region and elsewhere, there
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:26.920]  are many nations which have capabilities. Europe has generally lost its capabilities
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:34.360]  in the recent decades. We in the United States have been partly destroyed, especially since
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:41.240]  the young Bush administration and this current Obama administration. Those forces have almost
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:48.240]  destroyed the United States. But there is reason to be optimistic. I can't predict victory
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:55.440]  but I can tell you what I'm optimistic about. And I see what happened after the indoctrination
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:02.200]  and the installation of Obama, the second round, that I see things in our people, movements
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:10.360]  among our people, in groups of people, which for me are very optimistic things. And when
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:18.120]  the American people awaken from a long period of quasi-sleep or despair and so forth, and
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:24.160]  as you see in the political system now, a gradual moving in a new direction, searching
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.440]  for a new direction.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.480]  You see it in the members of Congress. You see it in the divisions that are occurring
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.040]  among Republicans. The Republicans are no longer fully agreed with each other on most
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:42.460]  positions. And Democrats, we don't know where they are, but we have ideas of where some
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:48.240]  people would like to go. So we're in a position of potential trans change.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.320]  I agree, but let's look at the geopolitical layout because you've been putting out some
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:59.000]  of your video press releases that are particularly powerful when you break down all the factions.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.200]  What are the Anglo-American British imperialists trying to do right now? What is their game
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.880]  plan around the world? Because they do seem to be particularly agitated right now.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.520]  Well, if you look at the history of the United States since the installation of Andrew Jackson,
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.920]  who really was nothing except a big noise. There were other people who were British directed,
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:29.080]  British banking terms actually took over the Andrew Jackson administration. So these are
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:35.960]  the kinds of things in history we have to look at. But our United States recently has
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:45.040]  begun to realize how bad the current two presidents, Young Bush and Obama are, and they want to
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:53.160]  change. And I think that's an option for it. There are the biggest things in that on the
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.160]  horizon.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.920]  Well, I want to cover what you think is most important and what's happening in the banking
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.560]  structure, how bad the global financial meltdown is. Because again, you called it when they
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.600]  got rid of Glass-Steagall back in the late 90s. And so I want to come back from break
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:13.100]  and ask you what you think. Well, briefly, what's happening with Cyprus and the grabbing
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.520]  of that money? Are they trying to cause a panic?
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:22.720]  That kind of thing is going on. The general situation is we are at the verge, especially
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.660]  in the transatlantic region. We are on the verge of a general breakdown crisis which
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:35.360]  can come on suddenly. We are already in a breakdown crisis. It has not disintegrated
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.640]  yet, but it's on the verge of disintegration.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.980]  Lyndon LaRouche is our guest. We'll give you his websites when we come back. But the most
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:46.320]  important thing is I want you to define breakdown crisis, define triggers for thermonuclear
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.400]  war. And while you've been saying last year we're entering the greatest danger zone of
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.940]  that in modern history, which is now manifesting, I want you to explain it to us all on the
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.940]  other side.
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:20:01.680]  This is important. Lyndon LaRouche is our guest. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.680]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:10.760]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:15.920]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:21.120]  your loved ones becomes ill? Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you

[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:06.180]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:12.080]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.680]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.720]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.200]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.240]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.600]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.

[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.160]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.120]  Is there such a thing as gluten-free emergency kits?

[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:33.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.600]  want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:43.280]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments,
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:50.000]  yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.840]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns. Call 800-686-2237. Secure
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:02.880]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237. Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.280]  one most valuable item in a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:15.360]  a gun, but the correct answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:21.720]  that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:26.120]  don't have this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought, and
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.440]  the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.520]  mob is right outside your door. What I have to tell you could literally make the difference
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.920]  between life and death for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:47.400]  the number one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.120]  that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go watch my video
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:59.080]  now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's crisis123.com.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:21.200]  And we are back live. Linda LaRouche is joining us. Again, we have guests on who've accurately
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.640]  predicted things. You notice the people that have done that are the ones that are demonized
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.720]  because the power structure does not want you knowing this. So you've got the Russian
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:36.720]  bloc, the Chinese bloc, the kind of US British bloc, the EU, all in the middle of that.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:43.240]  And it's all interconnected. But, Linda LaRouche, what is a breakdown crisis? Why are you saying
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:49.120]  we're in the danger of a nuclear war? Why did you say that a year ago and now we're
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.640]  seeing the sabers rattled and Russian fleets going to Cyprus and all of it?
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:02.520]  In fact, you even sent me a report, Cyprus, Glass-Steagall. So break that down for us.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:09.080]  Well, without Glass-Steagall, the United States economy is finished. We are already in a hyperinflationary
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:16.680]  explosion and unless we can cancel most of the banks which are not Glass-Steagall banks
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:22.200]  or don't conform to what Glass-Steagall banks would mean, this nation is finished and it
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:28.520]  can be finished on any day or any week in the near future. I've been pushing for Glass-Steagall
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:34.200]  as absolutely necessary. We also need something in addition to Glass-Steagall. We need the
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.440]  actual re-establishment of a credit system for the United States. That is where the federal
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:47.560]  government will create a pool of lendable currencies on approval for projects which
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:54.560]  are deemed responsible. We need those things. For example, we have a number of large projects
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:59.560]  for the United States. We've been losing everything. You take the central states of the United
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:06.400]  States. They've been destroyed over the past years. The worst things have happened since
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:13.080]  again Bush came in, young Bush came in and Obama and we've really destroyed the food
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:19.800]  producing section of the United States. We no longer have the ability to guarantee a
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:26.640]  food supply for the people of the United States. That is something which we have to deal with.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.240]  Why do the globalists, why do the eugenicists always obsess on making people dependent?
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.440]  I know the answer because that's the name of the game, total control. But expanding
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:42.900]  on this, when you talk about we could be finished any day financially, here's a headline, an
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:49.680]  info wars.com breaking only covered by a local ABC news channel. Chase customers see bank
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:57.000]  account balance reduced to zero, glitch Stokes panic on Twitter. Now that was just a glitch
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.120]  but describe what you're saying, sir. It could happen overnight, go ahead.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:08.960]  Well, first of all, what was done in terms of the hyperinflation done, which has gone
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:17.880]  on, we are absolutely bankrupt. And it's the banks, the big banks, which are the problem.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.920]  You essentially you have to put this thing through bankruptcy reorganization now as a
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:32.240]  preventive measures to enable us to start a program of economic growth. Without a radical
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.400]  change in economic growth, without the end to this so called green policy, the United
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:44.360]  States is doomed. The green policy is the greatest enemy inside the United States. It's
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:51.120]  also the enemy launched by Britain. It's Europe is full of it. So the very fact we are not
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.040]  producing the amount of food required to maintain our population.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.440]  And look at how Greece and Spain have adopted it and they admit it's wrecked them. And China
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.120]  can build three new plants a week. We can't even have one a year. For those that don't
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.960]  know, explain to them, sir, what the so-called green movement really is.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:17.560]  Well, the idea that we're very clear in the Denmark attempted to establish a world tyranny
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:25.080]  of on that basis of the Queen's idea, they came out with this idea of actually genocide
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:29.520]  over the Queen's policy. And it's not just her personal policy. It's the policy of the
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:36.000]  British Empire is to reduce the world's population from the present estimated level of society
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.400]  of 7 billion persons to the order of 1.2 billion people. That is the policy. And if you look
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:49.720]  around you, you look in Europe, you know, that is the policy in practice. It was under
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:57.200]  this influence that we shut down the food production in the central plains area. We
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:04.320]  do not presently produce enough food to take care of the entire US population. We are on
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.800]  a policy of reduction of population.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.520]  And when you talk about that, what the Queen is insisted upon and all of the people associated
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:22.080]  with it on this is to reduce the human population rapidly now from 7 million people level to
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.080]  1.2.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.840]  Sir, we got a long segment coming up. Let's expand on that, because if it's a new listener
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.480]  out there tuning in for the first time, maybe saying, what on earth are they talking about?
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.800]  The Queen doesn't run anything. We're gonna explain the fact that she does and break that
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:42.200]  down with Lyndon LaRouche. We'll also give you the websites. It's larouchepac.com, just
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:48.200]  larouchepac.com. We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break. This couldn't
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.100]  be more important.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:30:00.760]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:05.920]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:11.520]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.680]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:22.200]  the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarsshop.com. These are items

[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:20.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. Alex Jones here back live. Lennon LaRouche is
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:27.160]  our guest. Here's one of the headlines up at prisonplanet.com and infowarsk.com. Chase
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:32.920]  customers see bank balance reduced to zero. Millions of Chase bank customers were affected
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:41.720]  by unfortunately a time to glitch which resulted in their checking and savings accounts showing
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:48.960]  a zero balance for several hours yesterday prompting many to take to Twitter and express
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:54.040]  panic that their money had been stolen, probably another test.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.420]  Reaction of the glitch was undoubtedly made more intense by the fact that the top global
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:04.280]  news story yesterday was how residents of Cyprus were facing a mandatory tax that would
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:10.520]  see 10% of their savings plundered by the Baker bailout. And again, there is the problem
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.320]  and we have a link to ABC News 7 reporting it. This is not a national story. It's only
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.000]  on that local news station.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.360]  It should be a national story. It is now the infowarsk.com because it shows you that they
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:31.200]  can devalue your currency overnight, Lamar Republic or Zimbabwe style or they can just
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.900]  simply take the money out of your account, which is what Davos and the globalist are
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:36.900]  calling for more and more.
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:41.200]  And I'm gonna talk to Lennon LaRouche about that and continue with some of the solutions
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.800]  that he's developed from his deep historical understanding. But first off, during these
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:51.520]  dangerous times, it's important to support alternative media, real media that's nonpartisan,
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.500]  that has a constitutionalist, truly progressive view.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:35:01.320]  Not the fake socialist, eugenicist, agenda 21, post-industrial. We're talking about the
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.960]  post-industrial system where 30 years ago we could feed the whole world, now half our
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:11.540]  food's imported. They estimate within another five years it'll be 70%.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:17.840]  This is done by design with regulations and red tape and all the real environmental crises
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.660]  we've got. They're all ignored and they say it's carbon that humans exhale, carbon dioxide
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:29.240]  that plants engage in photosynthesis with, basically breathe. They list something that's
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:33.340]  life giving part of the carbon cycle and then ignore all the real things they're doing.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:40.260]  I mean, it's just amazing that it's a piratical system that seeks to go to even nation states.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:44.800]  They're gonna get away from nations and go to city states, which are exempt from their
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:52.160]  globalism. It's basically the Rome model, the British City of London model, the Israel
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:57.840]  model, the Vatican model, the Washington DC model with their own little insulated, almost
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.140]  floating fortresses of evil like the Legion of Doom.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:05.880]  And I'm ranting, we're gonna go back to London LaRouche here. But it is important, folks,
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.080]  while the Internet's still somewhat free, they're moving to block that now because we're
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.000]  effective. That quickening, that awakening is happening. They wanna use the quickening
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.640]  to collectivize and get everybody on corporate welfare, not to empower but to control.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:24.600]  We've got to use the quickening to re-energize the American system. So please go to mfallwarstore.com,
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:28.880]  get the magazine at cost, the big color glossy magazine showing how the globalists wanna
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.640]  cause a civil war. Get the March issue, it's almost sold out. It will sell out, get them
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:37.080]  in bulk or get a subscription and support the free press.

[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:17.240]  888-253-3139. Now, Lennon, I wanna move quicker with you through a bunch of subjects and get
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.720]  into some of the topics you think are most important.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:26.280]  But what do you say about supporting alternative press like what you're doing over there with
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:31.680]  LaRouche PAC, LaRouche Pub? I mean, how important is that? Because obviously, the New World
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:38.700]  Order globalist eugenics media, the post-industrial media, they're not gonna tell us the victories
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:44.680]  we're having. But that's not me putting perfume on a pig or putting out pro propaganda like
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.960]  a cheerleader.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.800]  As ham-fisted and primitive as I am at many levels, I've been very effective. You've been
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:56.880]  very effective in your 60 years of fighting. But now, when I go out on the street of Austin
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.680]  or even go to other cities, instead of every fifth person stopping me, it's every other
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.600]  person. Or sometimes everyone in a restaurant comes over.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:09.480]  Sometimes every person I see hiking on the greenbelt comes over. I mean, the popularity
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.600]  of our broadcast, let's not exaggerate, is growing fourfold every year right now and
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:19.280]  is extremely viral. What does that say towards your awakening and how important it is for
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.720]  people to support you and others?
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:29.340]  Well, there are several things to consider. First of all, people are frightened. They're
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:34.520]  disgusted as well as frightened. And that's a fact. But that doesn't give you the answer
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:40.800]  that does not give you the solution. More people are upset by these conditions. But
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:47.280]  that being upset does not solve the problem. You have to have measures which are concrete.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:54.000]  You have to mobilize people around such measures. You have to make the changes in policy, especially
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.520]  in economic policy, which are essential to save this nation from extinction. And not
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:05.120]  only our nation, but our nation has a very significant role that most Americans no longer
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.040]  recognize because we are a special creation.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:15.760]  We have a history. We want to go into that. But the point is, we were destroyed and corrupted
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:22.140]  from within. Many of our presidents have been corrupting agents. Some other presidents have
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:30.680]  saved us. But the United States has an inherent role in the history of mankind, in the entire
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:37.040]  history of mankind, which is absolutely unique. And it's something that started essentially
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.520]  with Columbus's travels across the Atlantic as a discoverer.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:47.400]  It came into Massachusetts. Massachusetts was crushed. Then Massachusetts people like
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:54.800]  Benjamin Franklin fought back and created a new kind of nation which had never existed
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:01.560]  to man's knowledge before. Now, we still have, through the way we handle immigration, we
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:06.420]  took people who were poor from all over the world. We brought them into the United States.
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:10.520]  They went through successive generations of rising in terms of their condition, their
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:17.640]  culture and so forth. We in the United States are actually the pivot of the possibility
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:24.200]  of maintaining this planet, really, for us, and that sort of thing.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:31.640]  But if we fail, if we drop the ball, if we no longer provide that kind of leadership,
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:37.840]  which was brought into Massachusetts and is part of this Columbus sequel, if we drop the
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:44.800]  ball, the world is doomed. They need us, and many parts of the world know they need us
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.560]  or they need us in some respect.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.000]  In China, there's a recognition in China today that the United States is needed. There's
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.800]  an acute sense of Russia. The United States is needed. You have people in Europe who are
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:04.200]  suffering, threatened by destruction of their whole nation. They need us, but we-
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.800]  Well, let's talk about the globalists that have hijacked America. You've talked about
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:15.000]  their exterminism, ultra-Hitlerian mindset, Hitler being one of their creations. But for
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.800]  many years, you've pointed out that the ruling class are insane. And I understand that they're
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:25.640]  very intelligent, have intelligent bureaucracies that know how to deceive.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:32.960]  But knowing their mindset or their tropism, what is the real state of the world right
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.400]  now? I mean, quantify that and where it's going.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.800]  I think my experience and my knowledge of history, this is not merely a matter of how
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:47.460]  many people are bad or so forth. It's a question, do we have a part of our population which
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:56.700]  is able to contribute leadership? Most people were born in history, modern history and even
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:42:02.240]  ancient history, were born as poor people, poorly educated, downtrodden, oppressed.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.400]  They didn't have good knowledge. And then once in a while, like with Shah Laban, you
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.960]  had somebody comes up and creates a whole new system, then he dies. And very soon after
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:17.880]  that, what he had accomplished disintegrated. So the idea of equality of leadership, of
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:21.800]  people who are dedicated and capable of understanding what leadership is.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.660]  That's why you see civilizations appear, grow and then collapse of their own corruption.
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:32.400]  We definitely have that same brain rot, but now we have nuclear weapons and we see all
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:37.840]  the armies lining up. And then we see the bankers looting people's private bank accounts
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.540]  when it's impossible to pay off the derivatives. What do they think they're going to do in
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:44.680]  the city of London?
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.120]  Well, you could say there's something satanic about the British monarchy and you go back
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.160]  and if you know the history and very few people do know the history, though it's available
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:59.760]  for them. Actually, the British Empire is a product of the Roman Empire and when the
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:00.760]  Roman Empire-
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.520]  The Venetian black nobility, so explain their game plan. Exactly, explain how the queen
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:05.520]  runs things.
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:12.040]  First of all, you had the Roman Empire disintegrated in a large degree. The leading families of
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:19.000]  the Roman Empire went up the Adriatic and became Venetians. And the Venetians went to
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.600]  a crisis and then you had a second Venetian. Then you had a Venetian called William of
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:30.100]  Orange. William of Orange invaded Britain and invaded and generally committed genocide
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:35.400]  against the Irish, which is one of the sports of the British monarchy these days still.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:45.320]  And therefore, we got into this kind of situation. We now have still the legacy of the Roman
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:52.280]  Empire in particular, which is a strong force culturally in Europe. And is in terms of,
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:44:00.360]  for example, take the case of our president and we found what happened is the British
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:08.520]  banks moved in, taking over presidency, moved in to the New York area and the Massachusetts
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:15.560]  area. The British bankers, British banking system, imperial banking system, took control
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:20.440]  of the United States up to the time of the Civil War. The Lincoln broke that off, but
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.000]  then the same thing came back again.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.960]  And this was in all our newspapers and then in 22, with Proud House and the CFR. This
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:32.040]  was the public battle. And what you're talking about was front page news for 100 plus years.
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:37.360]  Nowadays, it's conspiracy theory. Just like if you told an ancient that the moon really
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.800]  wasn't a man, that it was a rock satellite, they would think you were a conspiracy theorist.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.400]  The level of ignorance, but you're saying you're seeing a rediscovery of this.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.000]  Yeah, that's what we're seeing in the population now. They're disgusted. The hatred against
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:00.240]  Obama mixed with the fear of Obama is what is defining. It also what's happening, the
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:05.120]  political parties, which thought they were solid, Republican and Democrat, are no longer
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.760]  that. They still exist in terms of name, but if you look at the inside of the discussion-
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:11.760]  Same people.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.760]  Yeah.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:16.280]  So they're putting out a hoax that he's been endorsed, that he's loved, but all the real
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.840]  evidence shows total collapse of confidence. I hear our police chief on local radio saying
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:25.200]  there's been a collapse in confidence. I'm not bad, I'm not with the bad guys. And I
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.000]  hear other police chiefs and people talking like that.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.100]  And I hear other mainline hosts admitting across the board, we've got tyranny. I agree
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:38.900]  with you that there is an epiphany beginning to happen right now. Let me ask you this question.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:44.080]  The thousands of armored vehicles being deployed, the checkpoints, the 2 billion bullets, the
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:49.000]  urban warfare drills, the military admits they've been told to prepare for gun confiscation.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.360]  That's in the army manuals now, but then Obama's people Stonewall and say there are no drones,
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:57.780]  there are no bullets. What is this domestic buildup for?
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:05.360]  What you're talking about really is a situation which is going toward thermonuclear war. So
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:11.160]  the idea that there's some power more powerful than the issue of thermonuclear war is a piece
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:19.240]  of idiocy. The world is threatened by thermonuclear war. Now a thermonuclear war is not just war,
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:25.680]  it is not throwing missiles at something. This is a process which if undertaken with
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:34.760]  the capabilities which now exist, that thermonuclear war launched within one hour can result in
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.800]  the extinction of the human species.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:41.160]  Wow, so you're saying they're gearing up domestically because they're getting ready for nuclear
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.160]  war.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:46.360]  Not really, it goes together with that, but it's not a simple scheme.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:50.200]  How does the nuclear war start, on the Korean peninsula or in Europe?
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:59.400]  No, it starts from London, the British Empire. Look at what's happened in the British system
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:08.760]  recently. You see what happened, the unnecessary long Iraq war. Tony Blair did it. Tony Blair
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:14.560]  is the controller of the current president of the United States. He was the guy that
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:19.600]  put him in on behalf of the British queen.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.700]  We've been going toward hell, and we have the other side of the thing is at the same
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:31.600]  time we are faced with threats in the solar system. With threats of comets which come
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:35.120]  into the solar system and can kill a lot of people if they ever hit the area.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  Now you said that last year on my show and the media made fun of you about it, but now
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.100]  we're seeing record numbers of large asteroids coming in and blowing up. How did you know
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.880]  about that?
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.240]  Well that's my business, to know those kinds of things.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:54.840]  In fact, you were the presenter of the idea of a global space defense system.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:01.720]  No, I started that in the sense that I was on my own at a certain point in the late 1970s
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.960]  in Europe. And when I began to push this process, I found people who've been veterans of the
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:14.640]  OSS, who were still leading survivors of the OSS. And others who agreed with me and we
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:21.040]  came together. And I had some dealings with the Soviet system and also they were going
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.000]  to collapse and I told them so and they knew it.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.760]  And a large number of them are willing to come over and work with us on this whole project.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:33.000]  That's right, cuz there were two CIA directors that said you were one of the best analysts
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.920]  alive. Which one was it that told Reagan that he should adopt your policies? I have to pull
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.600]  the Washington Post back up.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.440]  There were a lot of them. There were a number of people, but they were also leading people.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.080]  We came from the OSS background. You had people who were still leading people whose background
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.080]  was essentially OSS.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:54.080]  And you were on record saying the Soviets were gonna collapse before other people were.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:57.040]  Why did they respect you so much? What were you telling them?
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.040]  I just told them what the truth was and they knew the truth, but they had to have somebody
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:12.360]  tell them that. We almost had the SDI success at the time that Reagan was leading in that
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:21.840]  charge. We almost had it, but the British put in a new stooge Soviet leader who mobilized
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.360]  all his British cronies.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:31.120]  And therefore, we were turned down on that basis. But Reagan always-
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.680]  Well, the media also turned it into a weapon system instead of a missile defense, but also
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:38.720]  asteroid defense, right?
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:45.640]  The idea was we all knew, including key people in the Soviet system and related systems,
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:52.040]  we knew that the Soviet Union was doomed. Now, rather than going out with a big flaming
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:59.360]  nonsense, can't we come to an agreement on policies, international policies, which avoid
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:06.680]  this threat of general warfare and undertake cooperation among nations to deal with our
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:07.680]  problems?
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.040]  There was never a liaison behind the scenes on what led to Perestroika, but they never
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:17.000]  got to that because their people got in. Who was Gorbachev?
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:24.800]  Gorbachev was an evil fellow. He's still around, I think. But he was the second man in this
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:32.360]  operation. But this was, if you find the cuter thing about the Soviet system and in Russia
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:38.000]  today, there's still that kind of problem. Most of these guys were called the Marxists,
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.160]  you know, the real Marxists, the British all created. Like Bertrand Russell's crowd. Bertrand
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:51.200]  Russell was one of the most significant penetrators of the Soviet system ever saw and continued
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.200]  to his-
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.920]  And he was really a eugenicist.
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:56.880]  He was everything. He's a human being hater.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:00.960]  Stay there. We're going to break that down on the other side. Amazing. Intriguing.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:05.320]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids have to be delivered to your body
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:09.160]  in the shape that nature gave them. If they are to be used to create new proteins in your
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:14.160]  body, just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall. So
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:18.540]  too, your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins. Giving
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:23.200]  your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health. One
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:28.480]  world way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other. You see, heating bends and
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:34.440]  twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you consume
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:39.360]  are heated. With our true cool process, you now have a choice with one world whey.
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:43.880]  My name is Daniel. I'm 34 years old. When I started using one world whey, I weighed
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:50.440]  228 pounds. Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds. This is my ideal weight.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:54.400]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.400]  in my potency.

[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:28.040]  I want to hold him a little bit, five minutes to the next hour if he can, if he's got to
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:34.080]  go, I understand. But when he boils it all down to thermonuclear war, that's where this
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.960]  is going. And the Russians, the US, they're building more bases, more weapons, while saying
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:44.680]  nothing's going on. But if you study geopolitical developments the last 100 years, more is going
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.780]  on than has ever gone on.
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:52.400]  And the establishment in Europe, England, the US is behaving in their actions, not their
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:58.840]  rhetoric like all Hades is about to break loose. And they're doing incredibly bold and
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:05.840]  criminal things, putting Al-Qaeda in all over the Middle East, demonizing patriot groups
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.800]  in America, clearly getting ready for false flags.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.720]  Lyndon LaRouge, I'll tell you what I see happening. I see him gearing up to stage terror events
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:20.760]  to blame on the American people, like Oklahoma City, to go after kind of libertarian populist.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.480]  And also they're demonizing any type of progressive populist that they don't control. I see a
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:31.600]  real move towards authoritarianism by Obama with his left cover, his invasion of Africa
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.600]  under Afrikan.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.680]  I mean, the globalists, it seems, are on the offense. Is that a form of defense? And what
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:43.400]  do they expect to get out of this? And how do we reverse them taking us on a path that
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.760]  you predicted will lead to thermonuclear war?
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:53.480]  This is a cult. The problem is a cult. The cult is that of the British monarchy. And
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:59.640]  if you look at the banking system, the key to this operation is you've got to go to the
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:05.040]  way the banking system was set up under Rome all the way through Britain.
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:13.200]  It is that international banking system which is the organizing center of all of these operations.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:20.120]  The answer is, how do you influence people? You buy them. And you find that many of our,
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:25.520]  for example, senators and so forth that I know, they have been bought. That's why they
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:35.600]  do what they do. Why are we controlled? Under Jackson, for example, we were bought. British
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:44.160]  bankers based in the New York region and in Boston set up the operation which really wrecked
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:47.640]  the United States for a long period of time.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:53.360]  And it's the same thing today. They also financed the Civil War. That's on record, but people
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.360]  don't know that.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:59.360]  Oh, sure. But the point is, that's always been the case. It is British controlled bankers.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:04.560]  But they're not just British. What they do is they represent the legacy of the Roman
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:05.560]  Empire.
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:06.560]  How did the Rothschilds tie in?
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:11.640]  The Rothschilds are just instruments of this process. They were picked up as skillful people
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.640]  to play a role for the British monarchy.
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.560]  Wow. And right now, we're in the world breakdown that you predicted. I've tried to get you
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.460]  to talk about it today, but you'll never talk about yourself in the past tense. But you
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:30.000]  have been screaming since the mid 90s that they were gonna create derivatives and do
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  this.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.720]  And now it's happening. How do we get out of that? Bring back Glass-Steagall?
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:41.280]  Glass-Steagall would work. If you take a measure of the United States population, I study it
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:47.220]  and look at it, deal with it. There is a movement right now. You'll find that the Democratic
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:52.400]  and Republican Party are no longer cohesive forces against each other. We are about to
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:56.280]  be freed from that kind of partisanship.
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:04.160]  What you have is you find people who are classified as new left or whatever, is all Republicans
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:10.280]  and so forth. They're all different because they have nothing that they can unite about
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:16.640]  as a united policy. And therefore, you saw that in the results of the recent election.
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:21.400]  And how is that a good thing? Now we can come into the vacuum with original constitutional
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:22.400]  ideas.
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:28.900]  That's right. We don't need a Congress which is a majority feature. We need a system of
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:35.800]  government which is our constitutional system, which is responsive to what our needs are.
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:39.720]  Sir, we're back in one minute. Give us those solutions on the other side briefly.

[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:17.200]  FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:22.160]  of government program has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state for chronicles

[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:28.320]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right, it's our final segment with Lyndon LaRouche
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:33.160]  and I wanted to go to calls. He was happy to do that. We never did because of time constraints.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:39.160]  LaRouchepac.com and he's got several other really top flight websites. You can see it
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:44.240]  there on screen if you're a TV viewer. Sir, finishing up with solutions here with you.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:50.920]  I mean, Dick Cheney is so arrogant and a globalist agent that he wrote in the PNAC document September
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:57.560]  20th. We should get the media to legitimize the use of race specific bioweapons. And there
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:01.840]  wasn't even a media outcry. Our local paper wrote about it, the Austin American Statesman.
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:08.800]  But that gives you a mindset into the exterminism, cult, death cult thing. I mean, you're not
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:13.720]  just saying that. That's who they are. And it transcends party. Obama is one of their
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:19.400]  great minions. So how do you counter such pure evil with logic? I guess you go to the
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:25.720]  people. That's precisely when the people are ready to listen to you. And what we're in
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:31.720]  a stage now is if you look at the results for the Democratic Party, the Tea Party and
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.120]  so forth, as a result of the last election campaign, you see that what came out of there
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:48.040]  was not a unified system of congressional rule under a presidency that is gone. The
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:54.160]  Republicans could not hold themselves together in the way they did before, nor could the
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:59.020]  Democrats. The Democrats are still trying in the Senate to do that, but it's not going
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:08.920]  to work. The citizens that we saw with Ron Paul, the citizens are now acting on the basis
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:15.360]  of their own conscience. Not everyone, but a significant number and the number is growing.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:18.400]  And as that happens, they're not going to be able to control the narrative anymore.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:21.900]  No, what you're going to do is you're going to go back to the Constitution in which the
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:28.920]  state constitution, the state government rules the state and which the states cooperate together
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:35.080]  as states. And they're not going to cooperate on the basis of partisanship as such. They're
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:40.080]  going to cooperate on the basis of what they think the interest of the nation is from the
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:45.080]  standpoint of their state. And once we get back to that, which is our original constitutional
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:53.140]  system, we can make it. We have a situation like right now with Russia and the United
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:03:02.080]  States, our leading military command is now in the meeting with Russia on cooperating
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.360]  against the threat.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.360]  And that's what Hagel said. He said the military's rebelling against Obama, but I see them firing
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.880]  all these people because they won't launch wars.
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:16.580]  Well, it's going to go in various directions. We are not going to end up with fighting wars
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:21.080]  because when you start talking about fighting wars, you're talking about the use of weapons
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:27.320]  systems which do not allow you to come out alive in a war. So therefore, now the time
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:32.600]  has come that we're going to have to really realize the intention of our constitution.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:39.040]  We're going to stop trying to dictate things, trying to take power. We're going to cooperate
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:44.280]  with other nations, what has sovereign nations in their own right. We're going to cooperate
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:53.440]  with the greatest thing that threatens us today is a threat from in space, from asteroids,
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.400]  from comets and so forth.
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:59.880]  That's right. We're always focusing on just the planet. What about the whole universe
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:01.720]  around us?
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:09.040]  Mankind has reached the point that we are actually now going to establish the inner
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:14.320]  planet system or part of the inner planet system, which is habitable and approachable.
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:20.640]  We are going to find ourselves running a certain part of the solar system, which is going to
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:27.580]  be the solar systems where man lives. Now, we're not going to go into Mars right away
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:34.740]  to live there as human beings, but we are in the process of two things. One, Mars is
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:42.560]  now an area in which mankind is going to build up systems and begin to work with that planet
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.960]  as a planet to deal with some of our problems.
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:51.320]  We're going to do the same thing in other cases. So we are now at a point where we're
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:56.640]  going to defend mankind in this section of the solar system. We're going to...
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:01.320]  Amazing. Lyndon LaRouge, amazing. Thank you for the time.

[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:20.880]  All right, we are now into hour number three, coming up later in the hour. In studio, the
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:26.920]  inventor of the printable gun and printable magazine, really Adan Salazar, last year began
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:30.520]  to cover what this guy was doing. And since then, it's been picked up all over the world
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:35.200]  and it's a big story because it is a big story. We love to take things that really are important
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:39.420]  and make them important out there with the general public. Speaking of those, here's
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:45.400]  one of them up in Infowars.com right now. Chase customers see bank balance reduced to
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:52.040]  zero. Millions of Chase bank customers are affected by an unfortunately timed glitch,
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:56.840]  which resulted in their checking and savings accounts showing a zero balance for several
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.880]  hours yesterday, prompting many to take to Twitter and express panic that their money
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:02.880]  had been stolen.
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.320]  All of this while the Cyprian crisis in Cyprus unfolded. They're now in today number two
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:13.000]  of their bank holiday, being told at least 10%. Now they're saying it can be higher,
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:18.760]  other money will be taken. British headed up banks and German banks are also talking
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:28.400]  about 15% just off the top, on top of all the other taxes from the folks there in Italy.
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:34.760]  And of course, the average person pays over 70% taxes in France and that's not enough.
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.440]  They want you to pay 75% on everything you keep after that. And then still there's not
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:43.880]  enough and then everybody works for the government and they don't live too well, but that's just
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:44.880]  the way it is.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:48.720]  And then you've got mega rich offshore who set this up, who get the lion's share of the
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:54.200]  money. And of course, it's always the ultra rich calling for more taxes, just because
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.840]  they get it siphoned off to them, they get it in derivatives being backed up. It's just
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:04.840]  incredible. So here's that ABC News 7 report. Again, this is not in the national news, the
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:11.240]  Chase glitch. It was in one local ABC News affiliate. And now it's up at info-wars.com.
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:12.240]  Here's that report.
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:17.000]  A nightmare tonight for Chase customers coast to coast. They go online to discover their
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.440]  checking account. Balances are showing zero. Efforts to correct the glitch began immediately
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:26.240]  and Eyewitness News reporter John Hartung is live in Burbank now to tell us how things
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:27.240]  have turned out. John?
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:32.440]  Well Michelle, this is the second time in less than a week that Chase Bank has had some
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:36.920]  problems with their online banking. But this time it caused momentary panic for some of
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.320]  their customers who actually thought that someone had gotten into their accounts and
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.220]  swiped all of their money. Chase ATMs brought a sense of relief to many people tonight as
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:50.040]  the bank's customers were able to get cash in hand. For a couple hours, millions of customers
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:55.120]  across the country who use online and mobile banking saw their checking and savings accounts
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:56.880]  all with zero balances.
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.800]  I just thought they were doing some kind of service on the accounts or something like
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:01.800]  that.
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.880]  Some of these tweets were set ablaze with comments of anger and frustration. One tweet
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:11.840]  reading, quote, Chase got hacked. Lost my 100K savings. I demand my money. Another tweet
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:16.660]  saying, quote, Why are all my accounts wiped out? What's going on? At Chase support at
[02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:21.600]  Chase News. The banking giant says the problem was an internal glitch. They issued a statement
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.940]  saying, quote, We have a technology problem regarding customers' balance information.
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:30.120]  It has nothing to do with cyber threats. It is an internal issue. We are very sorry to
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:34.640]  our customers for the inconvenience. This began earlier this evening. It is not confined
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:39.200]  to the West Coast. By around 730 tonight, Pacific time, the problem was fixed. Oh, it's
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.440]  a problem some Chase customers gladly didn't even know about. If I didn't have a heart
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:48.200]  attack immediately, I'd probably call Chase. My concern would be not having that money
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:53.760]  available if I needed it that particular day. But I would feel confident that the bank or
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:58.000]  the government would step in if it was like a widespread thing.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.680]  Now credit cards and mortgage accounts, they were not affected by tonight's glitch, which
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.120]  Chase Bank now says is completely fixed. They even went to Twitter tonight and said, quote,
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:11.360]  We're back to business as usual, end quote. Live in Burbank, John Hartung, ABC 7 Eyewitness
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.360]  News back to you.
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:14.060]  OK, John, thank you.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:22.480]  And that's ABC there in Southern California. Now, again, a glitch. You could lose all your
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:28.480]  money and they could also steal your money and call it a glitch and then say you never
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:35.160]  get it back. This is how they could run a scam or claim that hackers had done it. And
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:39.600]  oh, $100 trillion worldwide, all the money in the world's disappeared once they get us
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.500]  on a global cashless system.
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:46.800]  And don't worry, come to the government. We've got these new cards ready for you or this
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:51.360]  chip and we'll put the money back on there for you. But you've got to adopt this new
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:58.160]  system. That's exactly how the social engineers get you to accept a new system. Is to scare
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.120]  you into submission.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:04.300]  I specifically want to take some more phone calls now and open the phones up for people
[02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:10.240]  that want to talk about this glitch, other so-called glitches. Not a glitch when they
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:16.880]  take 10% out of your bank account in Cyprus that many Europeans used as a banking center.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:21.440]  This is a very, very dangerous time to be alive. And again, these are all trial balloons
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:26.520]  where, they were gonna take money out of all the Greeks bank accounts in Italy last year
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.520]  as well.
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:31.320]  But then there was such an uproar, they didn't do it. And then they said, we never proposed
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:35.600]  that. And then now they're doing it again. And they treat you like animals. They just
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:41.600]  are conditioning you that, you're gonna fight back? I wasn't trying to sneak in your house.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:45.080]  You caught me in your back door again? Never mind, I wasn't. And then pretty soon they're
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:46.920]  throwing you out of your house.
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:51.960]  They just incrementally get more, more, more, more, more. Toll-free number to join us on
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:14:00.440]  the economic front. I wanna get your take on this. 800-259-9231, 800-25-99231. There
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:07.520]  it is. CBS San Francisco, Chase Bank denies hacking in vanishing balances. See, I was
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:11.120]  saying they could claim a hack did it in the future and that your money disappeared.
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:15.640]  But don't worry, the government will take a small percentage out and fix it for you.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:19.600]  That's just how their brains work. But now, let's throw that article back up, cuz I hadn't
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:20.600]  seen that.
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:23.780]  Now they're actually talking about it being a hacker. Chase Bank experienced technical
[02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:28.600]  difficulties for about two hours last night, worrying customers in California and across
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:33.160]  the nation who logged into their accounts and saw their balances at zero or were unable
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:34.680]  to get access to them at all.
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:40.680]  A spokesman for the bank said it was strictly an internal technical issue, see? And again,
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:47.240]  money is just digits, and customers' accounts were never in danger. Your account is digits.
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:54.240]  There's less than 2%, depending on, it used to be 3%, now it's less than 2% physical cash
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:59.280]  out there. And it's not just that it could glitch and it could disappear.
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:05.440]  They could steal it from you. They could just take it from you, as is happening in Cyprus,
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:08.500]  and they're now proposing in other countries. And you're like, well, that'll destroy confidence.
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:14.720]  They want runs, they want confidence destroyed. That'll just make them more powerful to consolidate
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:15.720]  control.
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:18.640]  It's like government, you always read about most identity theft. Is government releasing
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:23.920]  millions of social security numbers? Or letting mainly illegal aliens use them and rip you
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:28.820]  off? And then they say, well, the answer is more identity control, which then tracks everything
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:29.820]  you do.
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:34.520]  I mean, it's amazing. They get more power out of the crisis. Ken in New Jersey, what's
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:39.160]  your take on this?
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:43.720]  Definitely attest the fact that they did that thing with Chase. And if you notice the guy
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:49.560]  in the clip said he had a face that the government would step in, in case it was something serious.
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:55.560]  You know, it's funny you said that. That guy looks exactly like an actor. And the way he
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:01.920]  does it and everything he does, when I played that clip just now, I was looking at it thinking
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.400]  the same thing.
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:09.800]  The point was, is that I've seen that guy somewhere. That guy is an actor I've seen
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:14.160]  on TV and movies. And I didn't wanna say anything cuz I wanted to try to go find it with you
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:19.500]  cuz they've got Google's got facial recognition picture searches that weren't pretty good
[02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:20.920]  on faces.
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:24.720]  And I was gonna tell my guys quietly and actually break it once it happened. I believe that
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:29.600]  guy's an actor. In fact, I believe that guy, or someone who looks just like him, is a Cass
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:35.640]  Sunstein cognitive infiltrator that actually attacks me online that I've seen. I'm sorry,
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:38.680]  just amazing what you just hit me with. I agree with you, go ahead.
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:44.360]  Yes, and my biggest worry, Alex, is that there would be enough sheep to go along with it
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:49.120]  in case that ever did happen. People would be lining up for this stupid car that they'd
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.280]  be issuing once the government promised-
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:58.640]  Listen, listen, they had actors on the ground on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox going, I didn't feel
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:02.200]  all in its own weight in a pancake caused by the jet fuel weakening steel. And then
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:08.560]  on every channel, guys sitting there sounding almost identical. And if I'm wrong, if he
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:13.520]  isn't an actor that I haven't seen doing political stuff, I'm wrong.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:18.680]  But I mean, I'm telling you, it is his twin brother then. In fact, let's take down the
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:24.760]  special report, see if it has a name up there, nope, no name. Kyle Ellis, I mean, maybe he's
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:29.320]  a real guy, maybe I'm wrong. The point is, is that he looks just like an actor I've seen.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:33.920]  And so maybe he's got one brother that's an actor. The point is, is it does, they can
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:38.280]  also get like 40 people there and ask him a question and get the one response they want
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:39.280]  to hear.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:43.360]  But I mean, you know there were a bunch of mad people out there, Twitter's like 99% angry,
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:47.960]  but then that's what they choose to show. But on building seven, they'd have actors
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.880]  going, yes, it fell from damage from the other building into its own footprint before it
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:54.840]  even fell on three different channels as well.
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:58.320]  So I mean, again, I've seen this before, but maybe we're wrong. Now, you're not saying
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:01.800]  he looks like an actor. I think you're saying it just sounds like they picked somebody or
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:03.360]  what are you saying?
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.160]  Well, I do agree with you. I am definitely saying that even if he wasn't an actor, they
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:15.120]  purposely chose to show someone with that kind of reaction to promote the idea that
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:19.640]  in case this ever did happen, there would be someone who was on board for the government
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:22.200]  solution to it.
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:29.560]  Very well said, do we have that queued up? Yeah, let's go ahead and play it.
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:34.220]  That particular day, but I would feel confident that the bank or the government would step
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:36.320]  in if it was like a widespread thing.
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:41.620]  We're going to come back from break and play that again as we miss the first of it. But
[02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:47.480]  again, ladies and gentlemen, we're seeing more and more like PR people. It's like that
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:52.520]  cab driver show. What's the cab driver show where he goes out and ask them questions,
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:58.320]  cash cab? And I don't watch a lot of TV, but I was on vacation a few weeks ago.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:01.400]  And so I was looking for something the kids could watch and I said, okay, this looks good.
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:05.840]  And I immediately could tell it was actors. I immediately could tell it was actors. And
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:10.580]  I went, sure enough, everybody else could tell that and they have actors show up to
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:13.480]  an open screening that they don't tell them what it's gonna be.
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:21.380]  And so it is real questions. It is real questions. So it is a real game, but the pool is from
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:26.440]  actors to make sure they can only shoot once and get well spoken people. But they don't
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:32.520]  tell you that on the show. So again, I could instantly look at that and I said, watch this
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:33.520]  kids.
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:38.600]  I got on my iPad, pulled it up and said, yep, actors. It was admitted that there'd been
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:44.400]  controversy. It was actors. And it's the same thing. I may be wrong. My first gut reaction
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:48.520]  was that's an actor, but then there's the extreme of that where everybody says I'm an
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:53.680]  actor and I'm Bill Hicks, which isn't true. Don't look into it. It's not true. I'm not,
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:57.120]  I'm not Bill Hicks. I'm not Sean Connery either. Oh, wait. And I'm not a, who's the three's
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:02.080]  company guy. They think I'm him. Jett Ritter Ritter. I'm not Ritter. I'm not ready to prepare
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:07.320]  by purchasing gold food and firearms, but if you don't have a home security system and

[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:05.640]  Hi, this is John O'Toole with Midas Resources, gold and silver company. We have all heard
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.760]  of Rand Paul warning of an imminent currency crisis as a result of reckless spending on
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:16.240]  Capitol Hill and endless wars overseas. But what are we doing to prepare for it? China,
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:21.320]  India and numerous other countries are buying up gold and silver by the ton because they
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:26.000]  know what's really going on. Don't you think it's time you do the same thing before it's

[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:10.880]  Yeah, the globalists have done a bad, bad thing. You know, I think if that guy is an
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:18.400]  actor or looks like an actor, I know in the Chase ABC, it is California. We know they've
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:26.680]  used actors before. If it is, and it's involved with Chase, this could all be a psyop to test
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:31.460]  and see what we'll do if our money disappears out of our bank accounts. And notice this
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:39.360]  happened why the whole Cyprus thing is going on. This is very, this is very, very, very,
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:45.800]  very suspicious. We call the guy and get him on. I know with the Batman deal, a bunch of
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:49.320]  the people were actors. See, the media is like, why are there theories that Sandy Hook
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:58.600]  is actors? Well, because Don Salazar himself found instances of movie actors being victims
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.000]  and then talking about how they survived, who just so happened to be in the Aurora shooting
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.280]  supposedly.
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:13.400]  And it was at least two moderate TV slash movie actors, both of them black, by the way.
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:16.720]  And I said, don't even do the news report. It's just too far out for people. Now, then
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:22.440]  everybody goes to the extreme of saying everybody's an actor. And again, when the government lies
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:27.360]  so much, people lose confidence in everything and don't believe anything. And then like
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:31.920]  schizophrenics are the new philosophers and just believe everything's a conspiracy when
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:32.920]  it's not.
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:38.480]  Cuz I can assure you, I'm not Bill Hicks. I'm not Ritter. I mean, they'll do these face
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:43.220]  things where they go, look, it's 100% face match. And all they are using is some paint
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:48.160]  program to say it's their face match. I mean, just amazing. But what do you expect? You're
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.360]  gonna have that end of things when the government is saying there's no drones or no bullets
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:53.360]  being bought.
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:58.720]  By the way, in the next segment in studio, the maker of the printable gun, the lower
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:03.200]  receiver, the receiver, the clips, all of it. They forgot to bring the clips since they're
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:07.200]  coming in right now. And I'm gonna ask them, could they come out with a printable Barrett?
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:12.040]  Now, it's kind of embarrassing. That barrel's dirty. It's time for me to clean this rifle.
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:15.360]  We were shooting it a few weeks ago, and I haven't even cleaned it. I normally do. That's
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:18.000]  how busy we've been. Can we cut to the wide shot here with the Barrett?
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.260]  You can just use that camera right there if you want, or that camera over there. Yeah,
[02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:30.660]  there you go. There you go, ladies and gentlemen. That's Marilyn and the other rifle's Betty
[02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:37.560]  Page. You can call them whatever you want. We got three new shooting shows we're gonna
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:38.560]  put out soon.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.240]  But speak of the devil, man, I was late at night when we got back. I didn't clean that
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:46.680]  thing. What a crime. Look at that carbon scoring there. Looks like you guys see a lot of action.
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:53.480]  What, with the rebellion at all? You know the rebellion? Anyways, total Star Wars nerddom
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:54.480]  now.
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:58.400]  Look at this. And there's the videos. We're gonna show you some of these for TV viewers.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:03.600]  And we come back with our guests where they fire with the lower receiver and the clip
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:07.240]  through this. And that's the beginning of very, very big things. And it's really scared
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:10.880]  the system. And I gotta, again, I give Don Salazar kudos.
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:15.320]  He was one of the first to really report on this and help get the dinosaur media onto
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:20.240]  it. Now it's a big story. And the ATF went and wanted the printer back that he had from
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.160]  the manufacturer he rented it from and just all this classic garbage. We're talking about
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:27.080]  an equalizing force against the tyrants.
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:30.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in New Jersey, another caller from New Jersey. You're on
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:31.720]  the air, welcome.
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:37.360]  Yeah, it's a beautiful day here. But you're talking about that. We've been taking over
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:44.720]  a long time ago. And the Federal Reserve and then he moved on in 1935 to set up the US
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:47.560]  corporation after the bankruptcy.
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:53.000]  And they want this manipulated when you get everybody on electronically and they can wipe
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  you out if you say anything.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.400]  No, that's it. Once you're electronic, they can take five bucks out of the transactions
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:01.920]  like Bank of America, track everything, control you. And now they're moving to ban cash all
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:06.160]  over the world. They got billboards up that cash is dirty and can't use it in secondhand
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:08.840]  transactions in New Orleans or in Louisiana.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:13.880]  And garage sales are illegal all over the country and in many areas. You're absolutely
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:14.880]  right, Paul.
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:20.160]  Right. And it's amazing what they're doing at some point. They want Social Security to
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:23.360]  go on debit cards now. They're gonna send you a debit card.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:27.920]  But pretty soon people won't even know how to get a check and go deposit it. And then
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:33.080]  soon it'll be, you have no money in the account. You're like, I have my printout. I had $1,000.
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:40.440]  No, that's a conspiracy theory. Officers remove him. And you're like, I have the printout.
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:45.840]  Shut up. Pretty soon if you say the sun comes up, you're a conspiracy theorist. It has to
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:48.640]  be said by mainstream television or it doesn't exist.
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:53.280]  God bless you. Here's that clip again of the guy going, I trust the government. I'm totally
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:59.800]  glad that they're there operating and will take care of me. Here's that clip.
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:04.600]  A nightmare tonight for Chase customers coast to coast. They go online to discover their
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:10.400]  checking account. Balances are showing zero. Efforts to correct the glitch began immediately.
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:13.840]  And Eyewitness News reporter John Hartung is live in Burbank now to tell us how things
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:15.080]  have turned out. John?
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:20.020]  Well, Michelle, this is the second time in less than a week that Chase Bank has had some
[02:29:20.020 --> 02:29:24.560]  problems with their online banking. But this time it caused momentary panic for some of
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:27.920]  their customers who actually thought that someone had gotten into their accounts and
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:29.120]  swiped all of their money.
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:33.440]  All right, again, folks. Again, I want you to hear the first clip. When we come back,
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:39.960]  I'll play the part with the local citizen who looks just like an actor I've seen telling
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:44.400]  us how great it all is and how much you totally trust Chase and the government to save us.
[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:50.320]  And then we'll have our guest here in studio straight ahead. Infowars.com, PrisonBlinded.com.
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:30:01.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:55.640 --> 02:33:20.160]  catalog.
[02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:27.280]  Alright folks, again, Chase customers see bank balance reduced to zero and you get this
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:32.240]  bizarre ABC Los Angeles report where they just say, don't worry, the government would
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:37.680]  take care of it if there was a problem. Just like New Orleans, just like Katrina, just
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:44.280]  like Sandy, the hurricane, just like all of this stuff. All they'll do is use it as an
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:49.080]  excuse to take your property. And I believe more and more with this coinciding with the
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:54.020]  money being taken out in Europe, that they're doing this on purpose.
[02:33:54.020 --> 02:34:00.080]  And I find the whole thing very, very suspicious. Chase is at the very top of the banking pyramid
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:05.200]  in the New World Order. And again, here's the local resident in California saying how
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:07.560]  much he trusts the government. Here it is.
[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:12.920]  My concern would be not having that money available.
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:16.800]  We had a little computer collection there. We're having a problem with the computer in
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:21.640]  there today. It's funny, once a clip starts messing up, you're never gonna get it. Guys,
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:29.320]  what do you make here? Daniel Bazel, the co-director with Cody R Wilson of Defense Distributed,
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:33.560]  that's come out with the printable firearms that's become such a big news story the last
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:34.560]  few months.
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:36.400]  What do you make of the deposit situation?
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:38.200]  Yeah, and what's happening in Europe?
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:42.160]  The Cypriot situation is so good, right? Because these are supposed to be guaranteed deposits
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:45.400]  by banks, right? Guaranteed you'll fucking lose them, you know what I'm saying?
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:49.480]  We can't, this is actually on AM and FM stations. We can't cuss in here.
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.600]  Okay, well, one mistake, right? We'll make it again.
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:54.800]  But one more, we gotta get you out of here cuz it's FCC stuff and we're under that.
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:55.800]  You bet, I understand.
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:56.800]  We're trying to defeat that though.
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:00.800]  Yeah, so the idea is that, yeah, so these institutions will totally control. You've
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:03.960]  lost all faith in institutional banking at this point. And this was supposed to be some
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:09.040]  guarantee of the credibility of banking institutions. And they did a stress test 18 months ago,
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:13.400]  and these banks were supposed to come back, great, great, super great, and what, 10%.
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:17.240]  And I think they're gonna make some concessions and not take some people's money under 100,000.
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:22.000]  But I mean, this is a guarantee of what the strategy is gonna be going forward. You're
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.320]  going to lose your deposits in traditional banks.
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:29.000]  And I guess they're just gonna do it over and over again with small ones till everybody
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:32.960]  says it's no big deal and you're bad if you don't want them to take all your money.
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:37.240]  Or they'll take it and say they didn't, even though they do, maybe it'll be an arrestable
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:39.080]  offense to say they took your money.
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:43.600]  Well, do you see how the Troika and the president of Cyprus are doing this? They don't actually
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:47.800]  have the will in their own Congress to pass this in Cyprus. So the Eurocrats are simply
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.640]  gonna have to come in at some point and say, well, we'll take all the foreigners' deposits.
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:56.000]  It's gonna get so ridiculous and it's gonna edge up from 15 to 20 to 30% of billionaire's
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.160]  money and it's gonna be this populist play on, well, we're gonna take their money, we're
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:01.460]  never gonna take your money.
[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:04.820]  The play's not over. It's gonna get more ridiculous before this is settled.
[02:36:04.820 --> 02:36:09.200]  What is the best website for people to visit, Defense Distributed, to see all the videos
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:10.280]  and info you guys have?
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:15.840]  Man, the very best website is still defenestdistributed.com. That's where all of our videos and our FAQs
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:20.440]  are and everything. But the place most people go is defcad.org because it has all of our
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:23.880]  files. You can download all the gun parts there.
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:27.680]  So you've publicly done this. And again, you guys really are trailblazers in what you're
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:31.440]  doing. And here we are with the archaic FCC system. I apologize that you can't use the
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:37.160]  language you want to. They'll just fine our stations if it starts. No, no, no. It's insane
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:40.040]  how it works. I'd like to see an end to that, Tyranny.
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:46.480]  But expanding on this, break down the history, both of you. Break down the history here of
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:52.280]  how this started and now why it's so important and why it sent shockwaves through the system,
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:53.280]  Cody.
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:54.840]  You mean the printable gun idea?
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:58.360]  The printable gun idea and the ATF getting involved and everything that's happened.
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:07.080]  Yeah, this is right now a symbol of the reversibility of institutional control of property, specifically
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:10.840]  dangerous property, right, like the firearm. And we know that there's been a multigenerational
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:14.280]  effort, especially in the 20th century, to take the battle rifle out of the hands of
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.280]  Americans, right?
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:18.920]  The battle rifle is the birthright of patriotic Americans out of their hands. This is a sign
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:21.720]  of the reversibility of the entire program.
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:26.440]  And we'll show people a document cam shot of that rifle right there watching on TV.
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:31.340]  Now, we're not going to be able to print, especially in these materials, an entire AR-15.
[02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:34.640]  But since we just got our FFL, our license to manufacture from the government, we are
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:37.320]  legally going to be able to make a printable handgun.
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:41.840]  Here you go. I mean, if you guys just cut to my camera and show people what it looks
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:45.640]  like right there, I think our try casters having a heart attack or something today.
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:49.920]  That lower receiver that you see in white, this is not an SLA printed piece and the distinction
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:54.120]  is important. This is actually very cheaply made, FDM printed piece. This is a kind of
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:59.420]  piece you could make yourself with an Ultimaker or MakerBot, machines that are less than $5,000,
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:01.160]  sometimes less than $2,000.
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:05.820]  And the piece itself costs less than $20, and that's an expensive way to make that piece.
[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:08.440]  Some of these pieces could be made for $15.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:13.000]  And you have the videos on defcad.org. Well, that's where the files are. But on your other
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.680]  side, you have the videos, we played clips of them here and on the Nightly News, where
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:23.200]  you're firing bullets through these. I mean, these are really working well, and this is
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:27.980]  just in its beginning stages, and you're just an individual with a few other people.
[02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:31.040]  That's the power, right? I'm just one guy in his garage, you know? And there's some
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:35.000]  people helping me. Sure, we've had some money, but you don't need to spend the money and
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:38.560]  spend all the time that we did to do something like this. It's very simple to do.
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:42.400]  Now, you've got some new magazines or clips here.
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:45.920]  The blue one is the one I want you to take a look at. That was printed in FDM for less
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:51.380]  than $15. It's a very simple and it's like the same material Lego is made out of. It's
[02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:55.040]  made out of one of these extruder printers. You can feel it. It almost feels, well, it
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:58.360]  probably feels flimsy to you, but it works in the air just fine. I fired hundreds of
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:01.760]  rounds out of that magazine, starting to show some wear because of how many times I've thrown
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:03.600]  it around and stuff.
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.880]  So cheap to make, so easy to make. You can download the file today. And just like some
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:11.880]  of these magazines are maybe still like 60, 70 bucks online, you can make that in your
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.960]  home for 15 bucks.
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:19.820]  Amazing. Now, go over the history of this because, I mean, the media has been saying,
[02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:24.720]  this is dangerous. This is revolutionary. I mean, the idea is really threatening the
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:28.400]  establishment. How many newspapers and TV reports have you guys now been in?
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:32.280]  It's countless. I mean, it's totally countless. There's no way for me to even. It's been ridiculous
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:36.340]  since October, at least, and we got started in earnest in August. But now they're really
[02:39:36.340 --> 02:39:39.680]  upset because we've got this license. So we have carte blanche basically to make whatever
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:40.680]  we want.
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:44.760]  For the longest, we had to do just parts that any individual could legally make. So receivers,
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:48.240]  magazines, these things. Now we can make handguns, short-belled rifles, automatics. We can do
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:49.240]  all kinds of things.
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:50.240]  Find the license.
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:54.320]  Yeah, so we applied for a federal firearms license to manufacture firearms. Manufacture
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:58.400]  is different from making. So there's a category, there's whole categories of weapons you can't
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:03.360]  make as a private individual unless you have license. And this is right, we don't believe
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:07.160]  in license as an idea, but we wanted to do this and do it in America, do it in the United
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:08.160]  States.
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:11.520]  One, just for the propaganda saying, look, I had an idea, I could have done it in a month,
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:16.600]  but because of the licensing regime and the laws, it took me $40,000 in eight months.
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:19.360]  This serves its own value. So we get a license to do it in America.
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:26.760]  Well, I just really appreciate you guys. Tell the listeners how this idea began, who's involved.
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.060]  And I know we were only set up for one interview, but I'm glad that your co-director came in
[02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:33.080]  as well. Maybe he should say some words, hand him that microphone.
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:36.520]  Yeah, if he'd like to. I mean, he wouldn't like to.
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:38.080]  I didn't know I was even gonna be on there.
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:42.760]  Okay, well, it's good to have you here. But who started the idea for this? How many guys
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:46.220]  are you? What's the game plan?
[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:51.360]  Once distributed directorship is only three individuals and it began mostly as three individuals.
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:54.440]  We thought, well, how interesting would it be not just to 3D print a gun, but to open
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:57.800]  source it and then allow anyone in the world to 3D print a gun, regardless of whatever
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:01.580]  their laws had to say. Perhaps that would be socially significant project, a politically
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:02.840]  significant project.
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:07.640]  And so it began, the questions really began, how do we take this from theory into reality?
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:11.960]  And we did the dirty work, right, of just getting down, getting some books, getting
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.240]  access to 3D printers and just trying to make things. And the biggest, go ahead.
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:19.880]  No, no, no, I was thinking now, now this really works great. Please continue.
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:23.760]  Well, in AR, sure, we've demonstrated that the pieces work just fine. But in fact, that
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.960]  wasn't really a surprise. You can buy commercial versions of polymer pieces like these already.
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:32.200]  We were just trying to show, especially post Sandy Hook, there's no meaningful way of regulating
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:36.400]  components of an AR-15 anymore, unless you build a massive superstructure.
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:39.680]  I'm sure there's idiot politicians who are willing to do that. But money doesn't grow
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:43.160]  on trees in the US anymore. You know what I mean? We're in a massive deficit situation.
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:47.400]  So it's really a pipe dream to think you can really regulate this rifle anymore. That serves
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  that function.
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:50.920]  But now that we have a license, we can do what we originally wanted to do, which is
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.160]  developed something like a single shot, completely printable plastic gun. Yes, it's undetectable,
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:01.040]  but more importantly, it's unobservable by institutions and countries and sovereigns.
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:04.060]  You can download it from the internet, print it on your home in the comfort of your own,
[02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:07.520]  you know what I mean? The privacy of your own home. And this might be a politically
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:08.520]  important object.
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:12.400]  Well, no kidding. You can send your operatives into a country, if you were a government,
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:17.100]  they can print their weapons in country in some place like North Korea and then go take
[02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:22.680]  out somebody that way. I mean, to use kind of a James Bond angle, but how much would
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:26.800]  it cost to get the printer if you have the know-how? Well, you have the plans online
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:31.160]  and in the future ballpark, you know, if you have the printer and if you got the plans
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:35.560]  off defcad.org, how much to print the entire AR-15?
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:40.080]  That's outside of our technological capability. The AR is such a high power rifle platform
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:43.480]  that the materials at least we're working with right now can't withstand the pressures
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:50.600]  of a high caliber rifle round like that. But we have proof that you can make handgun concepts.
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:56.600]  Now, maybe not multiple rounds, maybe like five or six, maybe 10. So we're coming to
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:59.640]  that, we're not there yet, so I can't answer that question. But right now in the materials
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.760]  we have, we were trying to see what guns can you make and what we have right now, if that
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:04.760]  makes sense.
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:09.960]  And it's, I mean, amazing is the word. And again, this is just, I mean, what is your
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:12.160]  engineering skill? How did you guys put this together?
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:15.360]  Oh, the learning curve was steep for me. I have a liberal arts background, man. So I
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:18.600]  just like learned how to do this on the fly. And now I could say I'm pretty good with putting
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.920]  guns together and talking about chamber pressures and tensile strengths and things.
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:25.800]  And I think that's what scares the system. Who are your political heroes? I mean, what
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:26.800]  woke you up?
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:33.680]  Well, I like, I like Camus, man. I like Michel Foucault. I like the French social theorists,
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:38.200]  people that aren't typically named by Americans, I guess. But I like people who just try to
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:41.680]  radicalize students and conservatives and say, you know what? Things are about liberty.
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:43.120]  They're not about politics, not about Democrats.
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:44.120]  I agree.
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:45.120]  Republican, it's about liberty.
[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.120]  It's about are you for freedom or are you not?
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:48.120]  Yes, are you going to resist?
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:50.600]  They want to make it left and right to confuse it and muddle it.
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:54.800]  Precisely. So I'm an anarchist and the anarchist tradition is something I read a lot about
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:58.720]  lately. So you could say anarchism is the school that I subscribe to. But I believe
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:03.120]  that that's a very rich school and a neglected school, especially post Marxist experience.
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:06.400]  There's a lot of cool things happening in the world on the Internet right now, but you're
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:10.560]  going to make Marxism, not irrelevant, but anarchism very relevant.
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:16.040]  Well, I mean, as you know, Marx and others actually talked about total manufacturing,
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:20.240]  you know, private factories and how that would empower everybody. But the globalists have
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:25.680]  actually used it as a way to control the means of production with the cheap production that
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:30.280]  have us sell our souls for baubles. And so they've kind of reversed that whole paradigm.
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:33.560]  This is the problem with progressivism, which tries to identify itself as leftist. And I
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:36.720]  don't think it is because all they love is monopoly capitalism. They say, well, we're
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:40.560]  about equality, but let's control it with corporations and the government. It's ridiculous
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:41.560]  to me.
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:44.880]  So I think in many meaningful ways, I'm a real leftist and these progressives aren't
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:48.480]  Indian. These liberals aren't. They're all neither party in America challenges. Well,
[02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:53.000]  a liberal would want the individual to be totally empowered. Instead, these people are
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.400]  the opposite. They're more like Borg or space aliens, right? They believe I can empower
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.360]  you the best by empowering you at the end of a barrel of some institutional gun.
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:04.880]  You know, you're going to be you're going to be equal or else, you know, but then they
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:10.940]  don't all they creates division will turn on MSNBC. Yeah, it's lazy. It's lazy moralisms
[02:45:10.940 --> 02:45:14.920]  disguised as meaningful politics. Exactly. They claim they're all these nice things when
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:18.980]  they're monsters. Yeah. And they believe, well, the most efficient way we can get things
[02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:24.680]  done is to centralize power and force you to do things because it's just it's just socialism
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.800]  from above, you know? Well, I don't want to just sit here and throw questions out at you.
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:34.000]  What do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners? Cody are Wilson of Defense
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:38.340]  Distributed is in here with us and he lives here in Austin, Texas.
[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:44.200]  And you know, we've been reporting on this since last year. Don Salazar was, hey, this
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:47.800]  guy can print a gun. This is interesting and hardly gotten any press. I'm not bragging
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:52.200]  that we kind of push it out there, but I'm glad that this idea, you know, has broken
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:56.280]  out there. And I wonder what other cool stuff's going on in the printable revolution we don't
[02:45:56.280 --> 02:46:00.960]  know about. Well, I want to tell you about and your listeners about Def Cad dot com.
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:04.220]  We're trying to raise money for Def Cad dot com as a search engine, an open source search
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:08.660]  engine for basically anything. We see that the resistance going forward is going to be
[02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:13.200]  about access to objects, period. Just like how music became software objects are now
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:17.300]  becoming software and there's going to be interested parties and institutions that don't
[02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:22.120]  want you to be able to have access to things. We think especially for the success of Liberty
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:24.720]  going forward, you're gonna have to be able to find something on the Internet and be able
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:25.720]  to print it.
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:28.880]  And this our site will be the first. We're the only site with gun files. We're the only
[02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:32.920]  site with medical device files. We think you should be able to have direct access to things.
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:37.880]  This is total revolution. And just like, quote, illegal downloading, it's so ubiquitous they
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:43.060]  can't stop it. Isn't the secret to this is to make it totally ubiquitous and get so many
[02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:47.140]  steps ahead of them that they never catch back up. The secret is to get it into the
[02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:50.360]  Internet and in such a way that you can find it anywhere and it can never be stopped.
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:53.360]  And that's what's happened, especially with the gun parts. And so we know as soon as we
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:57.280]  have a printable firearm and look for that in about a month, right? It will be on the
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:01.500]  Internet forever. And this is why the Internet is an anarchy and it's the most successful
[02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:03.460]  global anarchy in history.
[02:47:03.460 --> 02:47:06.560]  This is why we think these concepts are important. No one can take those things from you. They're
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:08.240]  online forever.
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:13.280]  Well, very well said. And I'm just extremely excited about everything that you guys are
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:18.460]  up to and what you're doing. Again, the pushback. I mean, at first, what was it last year we
[02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:23.040]  reported when the ATF put pressure on the company you rented the printer from to make
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:25.960]  them take it back. But that didn't stop you.
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:28.960]  You know, I think it happened in reverse. The company first decided they didn't want
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:31.920]  to participate and then tipped off the ATF about it.
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:35.120]  These industry people work hand in hand with the government. That's our problem. They're
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:37.900]  collusive. They believe that they're a political class and should keep the means of production
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:38.900]  out of your hands.
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:45.360]  I've noticed that people at the lowest level of groveling, it's a religion to hammer their
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:50.600]  fellow humans and things and they get off on it. It's like a reflected glory. The state
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:54.080]  is them. It's like some giant exoskeleton they're putting on.
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:55.080]  Yeah, there's this.
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:56.080]  But it's not.
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:58.740]  Well, I mean, it's this collective fiction. You're right. But there's also this no bless
[02:47:58.740 --> 02:48:02.400]  obliques. Well, we have the money and we have the factories and we should keep this out
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:05.520]  of the hands of the hoi polloi, you know, well, they might do something dangerous and
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:06.520]  hurt themselves.
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:09.880]  And I hate this attitude. And I think it's something we have to increasingly, well, I
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:13.600]  don't know, disintegrate going forward. So defcad.com is one of the things we're going
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:16.800]  to do to build up a place and software on the Internet where you're always going to
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:18.620]  be able to find access to things increasingly.
[02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:21.480]  If you want to, you'll be able to make it and no one's going to have anything to say
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:26.600]  about it. And again, people can just donate or can they invest? No, they can. They can
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:29.960]  invest. We don't have an equity structure right now, but we're trying to get off the
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.080]  ground version one. We're just trying to get off the ground. Well, I mean, this is investing
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:37.440]  in just pure original research and breaking paradigms.
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:41.820]  I mean, I agree with a lot of the analysts out there that have said, I think I've seen
[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:44.360]  some of the articles where they say you're one of the most dangerous people out there
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:48.880]  alive. Yeah, one of the most polarizing figures in technology. But this is from people who,
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:52.720]  of course, I'm dangerous to their world view. Right. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, welcome to the
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:55.520]  club. Southern Poverty Law Center says I'm incredibly dangerous.
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:00.800]  I mean, they say I'm a terrorist leader. That's a distinction. I'm a terrorist. I mean, you
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.920]  should be honored. I guess I terrorize tyrants. Well, exactly. Who do you terrorize? Who is
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:07.600]  terrorized? Dangerous to what? Dangerous to whom? And I think we said this before last
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:11.800]  time we were together. Fine, of course, I'm dangerous to that old way of thinking. Yeah,
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:17.160]  I don't need really to use cuss words to describe things, but sometimes, but I mean, I'm not
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:23.280]  being insulting, but sometimes you do need it as a verbal flourish to really describe
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:24.280]  something.
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:30.460]  But so what? We should be able to speak like we want. I mean, I love that line out of Apocalypse
[02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:36.120]  Now where he says, we dropped napalm death on villages of children, but then we court
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:41.520]  marshal the pilots if they write the F word on their airplane. It's like you're gonna
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:47.640]  burn up kids with napalm. That's okay, but don't say the F word. I mean, see how they
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:50.020]  morally quantitate things.
[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:53.000]  It's us versus them, right? And it's here versus there. So Diane Feinstein can get in
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.720]  front of Ted Cruz and say, well, I've seen the bodies, Senator. I've seen the body. Well,
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:59.960]  have you seen the bodies, Senator Feinstein, of the people you've droned, right? The many
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:04.080]  children that, right, that your foreign policy leads to, that burn to a crisp from hellfire
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:06.600]  missiles in many, what, countries all over the world?
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:12.960]  That she's killed. Yeah, she's on the committees. Of course, she has a hand in their deaths,
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:13.960]  right? But she can't-
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:18.240]  She sends robot Skynet to kill whole villages. No question.
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:22.660]  She's gonna tell us about we're collectively guilty for kids that we didn't kill.
[02:50:22.660 --> 02:50:26.840]  Our liberty is the problem. We have no connection to those dead kids, not one one billionth
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:33.200]  of any guilt. But then she has culpable guilt in death list, and she's telling us about
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:34.200]  murderers.
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:37.960]  That the disconnect couldn't be greater, right? She can't see it. I really believe she can't
[02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:38.960]  put it together.
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:42.080]  Ah, I think she lets her chops over it.
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:45.520]  Maybe she does. It just seems to me a massive dissonance, you know?
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:49.780]  Well, most of them can't see it. You're right. But Diane Feinstein, if there's a witch that
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:53.400]  turns green at night and flies around the brim with black smoke coming out the back,
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:54.400]  it's her.
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:55.400]  You know what? I'll give you that. I'll give you that.
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:58.880]  Hey, this is amazing. Stay there. We'll be right back on the other side. The printable
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:01.640]  3D gun revolution.
[02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:05.560]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If you're
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:11.240]  listening, you know the economy is not getting better. You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.

[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:03.200]  Life's getting better. Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:07.160]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor
[02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:11.600]  and as metal particles into your body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells
[02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:15.360]  from functioning normally. Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to
[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:20.680]  drop by 60%. Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop
[02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:24.520]  in function. The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is
[02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:29.280]  glutathione. The number one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells in your
[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:35.680]  body to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows. After investigating
[02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:40.520]  most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most
[02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:45.120]  active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally
[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:55.120]  put into the fresh raw whey. It is One World Whey. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:54:19.120]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com. That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:40.720]  Well, if you go to Defcad.org, you can download their printable lowers for an M4 and different
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:45.120]  designs for the magazines, clips, depending on what name you want to use. There's a big
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:49.600]  debate over whether you should call them magazine or clips. The point is you put cartridges
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:55.400]  in them that have little explosive powder in them that fires a projectile down the barrel.
[02:54:55.400 --> 02:55:03.440]  Now look at this 50-caliber Barrett. Is that not a beautiful thing? Cody, could you someday
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:07.920]  see us having a Barrett like this printable? Could the Barrett company come out with a
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:08.920]  printable design?
[02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:12.120]  There's no question it can be printed. The question is what's the material and what's
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:15.600]  the cost? And so I don't know how economical it will be, but I'll tell you, I do have one
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:19.400]  of these magazines sitting around in my apartment that we're going to try to print just to see
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:20.400]  if we can do it.
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:21.400]  Do you have a Barrett?
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:23.080]  No, I don't have one. I couldn't afford something.
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:25.000]  Hey, would you like to go out with us shooting?
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:26.920]  Of course, yeah. Or would you like to come with me?
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:27.920]  Yeah, but let's go.
[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:30.160]  I'm out every weekend, man. So yeah, let's do it.
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:31.440]  We've got a great place to go shooting here.
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:32.440]  Really?
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:33.440]  12,000 acres.
[02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:34.440]  No kidding.
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:35.440]  Yeah, but let's shoot these babies. We ought to have that.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:36.440]  I want to go, yeah.
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:40.620]  All right. You hear that, Shane Steiner listening? We're ready to take the printable. No, man,
[02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:42.880]  you were saying during the break, you know, I feel like I'm not connecting well with your
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:47.200]  audience. You always feel like that when you're on air, but you're doing it. I mean, I do
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.440]  personally. You guys are doing a killer job.
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:52.360]  I appreciate that, man. People email me all the time and say, well, what can we do to
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:55.720]  help? What can we do? And it's not just donations. No, no, no. We're launching a service right
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:59.560]  now called DefCAD.com. You can go there and see what we're planning, what we're going
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.080]  to launch. It'll be live in like 20 days. And we think it's going to be the first important
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:07.000]  search engine for 3D printing. And maybe that's not interesting right now. A lot of people
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:08.000]  don't 3D print.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.380]  Hey, I love that. The island of misfit objects.
[02:56:10.380 --> 02:56:14.560]  We named it that because all the other 3D printing repositories out there, the people
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:18.440]  that are supposed to be committed to openness and access take down the gun files. It's not
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:21.520]  illegal to make a gun in this country. It's not illegal at all. It's illegal to possess
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:26.100]  drug paraphernalia, but that stuff's on their databases, right? There's like this social
[02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:27.760]  problem with gun parts.
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:32.900]  Well, no, no. What did the attorney general say? He said, we need to make it like porn
[02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:37.440]  you put in a black bag. We need to demonize it so it's not seen as socially okay. Well,
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:42.120]  what about government having all the weapons? I mean, I see that as socially wrong.
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:46.000]  I'm completely with you. This is not a gun project so much as it is an equality project,
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:49.440]  right? We're saying you should have access to the firearm, right? Why shouldn't you?
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:52.880]  And so many people are, I think Eric called you the word brainwash back in the 90s.
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:54.120]  Okay, so let's brainwash people.
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:56.760]  So many people are brainwashed, especially the people in the UK and Australia, right?
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:00.200]  They're like, well, I don't want this. This is disgusting. Well, fine, but why shouldn't
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:02.200]  you have the freedom to possess it?
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:06.080]  Well, why are they demonizing cash and gold and silver? How many times has somebody been
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:12.520]  arrested for using cash or showing people silver coins? I had a friend down at UT arrested
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:15.040]  because they thought a silver coin was illegal.
[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:16.040]  Arrested?
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:21.280]  Yeah, this is about 10 years ago. Chris Athanas was down there showing people silver coins
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:26.000]  talking up silver and the police came and arrested him. It was in the news.
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.080]  I hope he went to court over it, got a false arrest.
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:32.640]  Well listen, he was on the edge of UT property, had a concealed carry, wasn't on it. They
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:36.680]  still successfully charged him. They came because people reported him for silver thinking
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:40.800]  it was illegal. Listen, I've had silver coins out and had people ask me at the park, is
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:41.800]  that legal?
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:42.800]  What?
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:46.280]  No, no, it's a religion of slavery. What do you call that where you love groveling and
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:47.280]  you love evil?
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:48.280]  I know what you're talking about, yeah.
[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:49.280]  Jellyfishism?
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:54.440]  Well, it's a masochism, right? It's like, no, I deserve to be under this boot. This
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:55.440]  is where I belong.
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:58:00.480]  Yeah, they've got all these movies where it's sexy to be tortured and 50 Shades of Grey.
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:01.480]  There's something to-
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:06.080]  I'm ready for it to be massaged on my shoulders. I don't want any pain here.
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:10.040]  There is a socio-political connection there between, yeah, I think I'm with you. These
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:14.680]  people I think love the getting rid of the pain of being human beings. They don't want
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:15.680]  to have to deal with their-
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:20.520]  Well, they just associate the state as power and they believe by worshiping it, they have
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:22.200]  gained Valhalla.
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:26.600]  Secular religion, right? Of course. I mean, why did Leninism take religious institutions
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:29.120]  as one of its primary enemies, yeah? There can be no competition.
[02:58:29.120 --> 02:58:30.120]  It was a competition.
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:31.880]  There can be no competition for Mother State, yeah.
[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:35.920]  No, that's it. The state is God, is the new world order. Gentlemen, stay there. I want

[03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:26.320]  Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Now, you recently traveled to
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:32.120]  Europe, Cody R. Wilson, one of the creators of the defense-distributed criminal gun revolution,
[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:34.960]  which we know they got big companies already doing this, but it's all been kept really
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:39.680]  quiet. You're distributing it. You're getting it down to the grassroots. You wanted to talk
[03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:44.400]  about Bitcoin, though. I did, especially after this Cyprus experience, and we had this anxiety
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:47.960]  about Chase Bank taking deposits. And of course, we all know they're going to nationalize our
[03:00:47.960 --> 03:00:50.880]  401Ks eventually, and they're going to have periphery capital controls, and you won't
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:54.640]  be able to trade the stock exchange, and they'll do bank holidays. This is all coming because
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:59.420]  the budget's wrecked, you know. But there are already politically impervious currencies
[03:00:59.420 --> 03:01:03.960]  that you can use. One of them is called Bitcoin. And it's not just e-gold, and it's not just
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:09.080]  baseball cards, all right? It is a pure currency in the Austrian sense. You can buy into it
[03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:14.480]  today through services like coinbase.org or coinbase.com or Mt. Gox, or there's global
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:18.480]  exchanges all over. Just Google Bitcoin. You can put your dollars into it. One Bitcoin
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:24.480]  is already worth over 50 US dollars. In August, they were worth 13. The values of these Bitcoin
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:25.480]  increased dramatically.
[03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:29.800]  Now, you just recently traveled to Austria to discuss some money issues.
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:30.800]  Yeah.
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:31.800]  That secret?
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:35.220]  I did. No, it's not so secret. No, I toured a bunch of hackerspaces and gave some presentations
[03:01:35.220 --> 03:01:39.440]  to Bitcoin people and met some Bitcoin developers. There's a lot of crossover between the Defense
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:40.640]  Distributed Project and Bitcoin.
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:41.640]  No, I know.
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:42.640]  Yeah.
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:45.280]  Well, how would you describe them? Kind of libertarian anarchist?
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:49.400]  Yeah, I think they mean the same things, which is that, you know, the technology, important
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:53.920]  technologies like currencies and implements of liberation like firearms should be distributed
[03:01:53.920 --> 03:01:55.740]  and should be software.
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:59.820]  This really is the ultimate revolution because they're going to try to do this with cybernetic
[03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:04.880]  technology and use it as back doors to control us. Everything is going to be hacked. They
[03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:06.640]  think they're going to hack us. We're going to hack them.
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:10.240]  Yeah. The front end is them hacking us with like Google Glass, for example. The back end
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:15.280]  is us hacking them completely with something like Bitcoin. When you crypto and archives,
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:20.120]  if I can use that as a verb, when you take currency away from them, what do they have?
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:22.840]  You know, what does the military industrial complex, what do they have when you're no
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:26.520]  longer holding their dollars? You know, you're no longer trading in their currencies. I don't
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:28.660]  have to buy oil in the market like they do.
[03:02:28.660 --> 03:02:32.680]  I can trade Bitcoin. I can send it instantly to anyone anywhere in the world. There aren't
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:36.680]  institutional controls. There aren't verification checks. No one can see it because it's behind
[03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:38.640]  crypto. The revolution is right now.
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:41.960]  You're telling me about friends in San Francisco that are about to launch something big.
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:46.160]  Oh, no, they've already launched it. It's called Coinbase. It's one of the fastest growing
[03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:48.720]  and most popular Bitcoin exchanges.
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:50.760]  Sure. But you're saying it's about to go to this new level.
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:53.600]  Oh, they're about to get a bunch of funding. Yeah. They've proven that their business model
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:56.640]  works. You can go on there right now. You can sell 100 Bitcoin a day. You can buy 10
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:00.920]  Bitcoin a day. You can do it easy and they can link it up to your bank accounts and everything.
[03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:06.240]  So it's just one of the easiest ways to buy and sell Bitcoin and one of the most accessible.
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:08.240]  Is Peter Thiel involved anywhere in this?
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:13.680]  Well, I don't know if he is publicly or not. I can't speak to that. But I know that people
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:17.360]  that think like him, people with that founders fund mentality and the idea that like libertarian
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:21.720]  corporations are the future are looking at companies like Coinbase and that they want
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:22.720]  to fund them.
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:26.080]  Yeah, but I mean, it's just like Rand Paul just won the CPAC deal and now the neocons
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:29.360]  love him. I think they're trying to adopt it to take it over.
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:31.120]  Well, you mean Bitcoin itself?
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:33.000]  Well, I mean, Peter Thiel.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:37.480]  Oh, well, yeah. So there's this adoption in these things. But look, you're getting into
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:41.200]  a technology where it doesn't matter who likes it and who doesn't. It works and it doesn't
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:46.000]  have politics in that sense. I don't have to convert you into some kind of crazy anarchist
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:50.880]  to get you to admit that one Bitcoin is worth 50 US dollars. You know, it's just economics,
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:51.880]  man.
[03:03:51.880 --> 03:03:59.800]  Well, you know, anarchy of ideas and the true withering away of the state. I mean, that's
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:03.760]  where they say Marx created this total state. But he was talking about actually the end
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:09.880]  of the state. But then it's just walking around in circles. But something like this is what
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:10.880]  really could do that.
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:16.040]  Yeah, to write it the easiest way. Marx imagined the end of the state through state mechanisms,
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:20.960]  right? And anarchists say, no, no, you just build up this freedom and these spheres of
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:24.280]  freedom inside the shell of the old order. And one day you look around, you realize,
[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:28.180]  oh, it was just a shell. You know, it could never get at what we were doing. You dissolve
[03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:32.840]  the shell precisely. And that's got to be true about something like Bitcoin. I mean,
[03:04:32.840 --> 03:04:37.080]  once the commercial transactions for our day to day things are mostly handled by us and
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:39.800]  peer to peer and over the Internet and on our computers.
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:43.720]  I'm not going to be going to Chase Bank to make a deposit. Let's talk more about that
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:47.840]  on the other side and see if we can get Daniel to talk to us. You want to go on air? How
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:55.120]  did you get involved in all this? I don't know. All right. Stay there. We're going to
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:58.560]  come back. You guys will keep doing some more. It's up to you, man. Let's do it. Let's come
[03:04:58.560 --> 03:05:00.520]  right back and talk more about Jeff Kidd.
[03:05:00.520 --> 03:05:07.020]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the info wars dot com team want to relay to
[03:05:07.020 --> 03:05:12.680]  you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every

[03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:49.760]  to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics, dehumanization and ultimate

[03:08:06.920 --> 03:08:19.920]  information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Well, chances are
[03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:24.480]  in the last three or four months you've seen him on every major news channel in the country
[03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:31.600]  and overseas. Defcad dot org. Cody R. Wilson right here in Austin, Texas. And again, in
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:35.120]  full wars dot com was one of the first media outlets to start paying attention to it because
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:41.120]  we realized it was important that individuals, not just big companies, could print the magazines,
[03:08:41.120 --> 03:08:46.000]  the clips, the lower receivers, that larger companies and then finally smaller companies
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:52.120]  and then individuals could print entire firearms. And across the board, this is beginning to
[03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:56.300]  happen. And there's a lot of, you know, high end defense companies that are doing this.
[03:08:56.300 --> 03:09:01.320]  But in the future, you'll have you'll have composite materials that individuals can get
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:07.400]  that will actually be able to handle the pressures of the actual firearm. Break down some more
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:12.760]  of the science, Cody, and other points that are important for people to be aware of when
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:16.840]  it comes to printing a gun. Yes, yeah, well, the biggest thing is we're moving into barrels
[03:09:16.840 --> 03:09:17.840]  right now.
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:21.200]  So we're trying to see like, okay, can you make a plastic barrel? And the conventionalism
[03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:26.000]  is no, of course you can't. But we're seeing that you can. The only problem is the plastic
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:31.680]  expands quite a bit and it's brittle. I don't want to be around while you're testing this.
[03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:36.400]  It's remote fire mechanisms. So we don't hold in our hand. No, I know I'm joking. Yeah.
[03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:41.680]  So right. We've explosions happen. But at the same time, there are some and I don't
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:46.800]  reveal too much. Right. But we we have found some ways of making printable guns work and
[03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:50.760]  they're going to work. And we're going to we haven't shown any of those videos yet.
[03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:55.640]  If people go to defense distributed, the official website, those videos are up there. We can
[03:09:55.640 --> 03:10:00.040]  show viewers where you're they're shooting hundreds and hundreds of rounds out of here.
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:04.280]  Okay. So on those videos, those are proving that certain components work. So these aren't
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:08.360]  that the magazine, the clip works exactly like the clip works and then and then lower
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:11.720]  receivers work in one of the videos that's blown up a lot lately. But these aren't whole
[03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:16.240]  printed guns, which is something we want to do and haven't really done for public consumption
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:19.920]  yet. I'm just kind of telling you it's about to happen. Sure. Shifting gears just into
[03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:24.320]  the overall why this threatens the establishment for people that don't understand why this
[03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:25.320]  is revolutionary.
[03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:28.920]  Why is the system so threatened? I mean, put it in layman's terms, man. I hope that it
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:33.160]  is threatened and maybe it's naive for me to think that it is. But this is a symbol
[03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:36.880]  that you can make something important for yourself, something they don't want you to
[03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:42.280]  have, especially after Sandy Hook. In a moment, they really don't want you to have it. That's
[03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:46.400]  important that people can people can say, oh, wow, you know, real politics is I can
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:49.520]  do whatever I want, regardless of what the state blares at me through the TV and on the
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:54.880]  radio all the time. It's just teaching contempt for the legislative process. Well, look at
[03:10:54.880 --> 03:11:05.400]  how the Congress exempts themselves from insider trading. Look at how how the banksters exempt
[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:09.560]  themselves. I mean, this cannot go on forever. And no amount of state force is going to protect
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:10.560]  them.
[03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:14.140]  Yeah. All the state understands, I think, is force. And what can you do when you just
[03:11:14.140 --> 03:11:17.440]  disappear withholding something like Bitcoin and you simply just choose not to pick up
[03:11:17.440 --> 03:11:21.560]  a dollar from the ATM? You know, the velocity of their money decreases. What can they do?
[03:11:21.560 --> 03:11:26.040]  They can't tax you into commerce. Oh, that's right. Yes, they can. Obamacare, you know,
[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:29.460]  so it'll be more programs like that.
[03:11:29.460 --> 03:11:34.280]  And that's why they want to go back to an old dark age and they romanticize a post industrial
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:37.720]  world for us while they're in the high tech reservations is because that's the only way
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:42.880]  they stay in power is stopping progress. Everything at this point seems to be about maintenance
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:48.000]  and centralization of power going forward. Not even like not even an elite necessarily.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:51.480]  Just the idea is that like there need to be different classes of people. Absolutely. And
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:55.280]  guys, if you punch up my computer for TV viewers, I can show them some of the videos that the
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:56.280]  students distributed.
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:12:00.400]  Don't show them that one. Why? Well, that's just me talking about Defcad. So it's not
[03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:04.000]  a gun video, but sure. Let's go over this together. You've got media here. Is that probably
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:08.320]  where we should go? I will go to the video area. Yeah, it's a good way to go. Yeah. Just
[03:12:08.320 --> 03:12:11.360]  go to YouTube and check out our videos. Sure. I'm just showing folks out there that are
[03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:16.240]  watching us on TV. You know, there you are in Glenn back. And that's a pretty good one
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:19.280]  where we shoot the air mag part two.
[03:12:19.280 --> 03:12:22.920]  I think that's where I said, how's that national conversation going? It was important time
[03:12:22.920 --> 03:12:30.040]  to ask that question, by the way. So again, folks, you can just go to defense distributed
[03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:36.800]  YouTube channel and see all of these. But there's the mag 223. I think that was right
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:41.560]  when New York was passing its law, arbitrarily banning magazines that could hold over seven
[03:12:41.560 --> 03:12:43.560]  rounds.
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:46.320]  And you know, Feinstein wanted them on the block too. And we're saying, look, it doesn't
[03:12:46.320 --> 03:12:49.960]  matter what you have to say about it. We can have this pantomime conversation. But look,
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:54.680]  one guy in a 3D printer just gave this to the internet. And is that one you printed
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:12:58.520]  right there? Yes. This piece is much like this one. So this is an FDM printed piece.
[03:12:58.520 --> 03:13:00.520]  The dimensions are somewhat different on this one.
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:05.400]  And that's a drum. That's a drum mag. Yeah, we didn't print that one. But the receiver,
[03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:09.120]  the point was to show the receiver holds up to fire indefinitely. So it's not gonna break
[03:13:09.120 --> 03:13:13.280]  from firing stresses or recoil or anything like that. This is a receiver that you can
[03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:17.520]  print out inexpensively that'll substitute a commercial receiver.
[03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:23.480]  Well, it's all very, very exciting. What about this? Defense distributed AR lower Christmas
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:24.480]  review.
[03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:28.840]  This is one of the one of the first times we got our lowers to do more than 30, 40 rounds.
[03:13:28.840 --> 03:13:32.040]  So the media kind of the media circus left us in December. They're like, well, yeah,
[03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:36.320]  you can print gun parts, but they break quickly. No, we had we had very quickly turned around.
[03:13:36.320 --> 03:13:39.440]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's like people that say the government's going to combat robots,
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:42.960]  but they're, you know, they fall over easily. Yeah, they're going to develop. You know,
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:46.640]  it's like when they were training Boy Scouts four years ago to confiscate guns and like,
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:48.160]  oh, I'll kill those 14 year olds.
[03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:51.020]  Well, number one, that's not true. Fourteen year olds make some of the best soldiers out
[03:13:51.020 --> 03:13:55.760]  there because they don't care about dying. But but I mean, you know, child soldiers historically,
[03:13:55.760 --> 03:13:59.880]  but in four years, they're going to be 18. Folks, the best age for soldiers. You know,
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:03.800]  the issue is it's this cop out, you know, that goes on.
[03:14:03.800 --> 03:14:08.360]  I'm with you. These are these are just different videos from media and parts we approve. And
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:13.480]  yeah, I think the big thing is we're launching a search engine that we think is is going
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:17.800]  to be a place for liberty. And if you want to call it an info war, yeah, because there's
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:21.560]  a war on for access to these files. There are people that simply and it's legal right
[03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:25.120]  now to have these, but they're people that won't supply them to you because they feel
[03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:28.540]  pressure from investors or society, the government, something.
[03:14:28.540 --> 03:14:32.840]  And we think there at least need to be open open software that allows you to access these
[03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:36.160]  things. And buddy, if you can watch that video later, I want you to that one right there.
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:41.680]  I want you to see that Jeff Cadd dot com. All right. Now, in the time we've got left
[03:14:41.680 --> 03:14:46.760]  in this segment, getting back into political models, I think it's so important that, yeah,
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:50.520]  I support more things that are supposedly on the right wing because they claim they
[03:14:50.520 --> 03:14:53.080]  support private property, Second Amendment, things like that.
[03:14:53.080 --> 03:14:58.400]  But still, it's mainly window dressing or talking points for them. And conservatives
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:15:01.880]  and constitutional are figuring that out. But the status are really demonizing them
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:07.640]  right now. So I see it awakening the libertarians and constitutionalist like never before to
[03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:11.580]  the fact that there really is no option in the political system and that we have to create
[03:15:11.580 --> 03:15:15.200]  a new political system to restore the republic.
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:19.720]  But when you talk about the so-called left again, I think that's pure camouflage. And
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:22.840]  that's why I'm trying to get people outside of those labels.
[03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:26.320]  I'm with you left left and right is no longer meaningful. After the French Revolution, they've
[03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:31.080]  just become excuses for one way or another of justifying monopoly capitalism. So I'm
[03:15:31.080 --> 03:15:34.560]  with you. Let's talk about freedom and liberty versus totalitarianism.
[03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:37.800]  All right. Well, this interview is going to have to end about five minutes because you've
[03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:41.840]  got to go and show why we're in overdrive right now. Other points are going to wish
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:45.280]  Cody R Wilson that you would have covered after you've left.
[03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:49.360]  I mean, we got Bitcoin, we got defcad.com. I want you listeners to please check out defcad.
[03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:51.840]  We've got a new project they're starting. It's going to have its own organizational
[03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:56.040]  structure. And I want people to download these files and pay attention in about a month.
[03:15:56.040 --> 03:15:59.800]  I think we're going to have a printable gun.
[03:15:59.800 --> 03:16:05.040]  And what do you expect to happen then? Because the ATF is going to try to claim that, well,
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:10.400]  you've got to have a I guess you have the firearms distributor license. You know, they're
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:14.920]  going to try some type of bureaucratic garbage on you. But then the question is, is it illegal
[03:16:14.920 --> 03:16:18.080]  to simply have designs that that are on a computer?
[03:16:18.080 --> 03:16:21.400]  I don't think so. I think there's a large body of First Amendment jurisprudence that
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:24.000]  will make that a very difficult argument. But you're right. The battle will move on
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:27.920]  to that that direction. I'm interested in seeing what will happen just like anyone else.
[03:16:27.920 --> 03:16:28.920]  Let's let's find out.
[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:33.160]  Yeah, there's a headline right there from the Daily Mail. U.S. grants first license
[03:16:33.160 --> 03:16:37.700]  to sell 3D printed guns. And you can already download the blueprints for free online and
[03:16:37.700 --> 03:16:40.680]  make your own. How many visitors you get to the site now a month?
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:44.640]  Oh, we've done five hundred thousand downloads, three point five terabytes of traffic. Just
[03:16:44.640 --> 03:16:47.280]  everyone from all over the world downloads their files. And they're not even important.
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:51.840]  But this this Daily Mail piece was a misrepresentation. The license wasn't to sell. The license was
[03:16:51.840 --> 03:16:55.720]  to manufacture a broad range of weapons. You can sell as well. But the point they probably
[03:16:55.720 --> 03:16:58.400]  didn't understand that they don't understand our gun laws at all. They call everything
[03:16:58.400 --> 03:17:01.880]  an automatic weapon. They're scared of their own shadows. You know, if it goes bang, it's
[03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:06.100]  something terrifying. And unless it's in the hands of troops in black uniforms with giant
[03:17:06.100 --> 03:17:11.040]  V armored vehicles. And that's what you should be afraid of. But they're like, oh, I love
[03:17:11.040 --> 03:17:12.040]  that.
[03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:15.620]  What could ever go wrong in a democratically elected government? I'm with you. Yeah. What
[03:17:15.620 --> 03:17:20.280]  about all the tyranny where they want to make kids take deadly anthrax shots now? And like
[03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:22.920]  we talked about the start of the interview where they're just saying, oh, we're going
[03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:26.400]  to take money out of your bank account now. It's a new tax.
[03:17:26.400 --> 03:17:29.840]  It's amazing to me. Of course, these are the logical the logical ends of institutional
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:33.680]  socialism. And yet everyone says, well, you know, it's patriotism like that. Obama could
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:37.320]  get them on the last day of the union and say, well, it's time for a new economic patriotism.
[03:17:37.320 --> 03:17:41.400]  Well, what's more economically patriotic than giving 10 percent of your deposits up to Uncle
[03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:45.280]  Sam so he can make the budget work? I mean, this is where this logic leads.
[03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:49.640]  And it's not even make the budget work. They're destroying eighty five billion a month, putting
[03:17:49.640 --> 03:17:54.040]  it into derivatives that they've already written off to hurt us. Oh, yeah. I mean, they admit
[03:17:54.040 --> 03:17:57.480]  it's to hurt us. I'm giving the propaganda, which is like, well, we got to take this.
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:01.520]  So, you know, your grandma can get her cash or check her welfare check. And really, they've
[03:18:01.520 --> 03:18:06.040]  worked it where we could feed the whole world 30 years ago. Now we can't even feed ourselves
[03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:11.120]  because when they make scarcity and they're in control of the only conduits of of energy
[03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:15.240]  and things, then they are all powerful. These bankers have gambling addictions, you
[03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:19.060]  know, they should be in treatment. I mean, they're maniacs and paying bonuses. Right.
[03:18:19.060 --> 03:18:22.400]  And yet we know this thing's totally insolvent. This is a broke nation in history. I mean,
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:26.760]  it's the glittering collapse of some empire from from years past. And we're watching it
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:30.600]  happen in slow motion. Get into Bitcoin, people. Your bank account is no longer safe. Your
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:34.040]  retirement account is no longer safe. Embrace something like printable guns. It doesn't
[03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:38.640]  mean. Well, I'll say this. Bitcoin is growing rapidly. That makes me a little paranoid.
[03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:42.680]  But I have. Well, I mean, I have talked about it, but just getting diversified into it and
[03:18:42.680 --> 03:18:49.320]  other things. Yes. We'll grow the revolution of ideas that will lead to even better things.
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:52.880]  It's at least right. A lesson in practical anarchy, which is, you know what? I don't
[03:18:52.880 --> 03:18:56.760]  need this institution and I can handle these things myself and we can do things peer to
[03:18:56.760 --> 03:19:00.560]  peer. We don't need the more we work outside the system, the more we build new systems.
[03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:04.880]  Yes. Yes. Importantly. And I think that's one of the primary lessons of this. What?
[03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:08.160]  You can make something yourself, which is already a revolutionary. Yeah, but I mean,
[03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:12.440]  in this star starved culture, you didn't do this to be a celebrity. You did this to have
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:18.140]  true revolution of human potential. And now, Cody, you and your cohorts are like really
[03:19:18.140 --> 03:19:22.120]  well known and on the map and getting invited to speak to some of the coolest people in
[03:19:22.120 --> 03:19:27.400]  the world. Congratulations. I mean, you are another model for other people to trailblaze.
[03:19:27.400 --> 03:19:31.680]  There are still many things to trailblaze more than ever. The revolution of the mind
[03:19:31.680 --> 03:19:36.600]  is happening now. The globalists want to think and want to make you think they're invincible
[03:19:36.600 --> 03:19:41.160]  and all powerful. They're not. They're a joke. If we all just simply start doing independent
[03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:45.640]  things, it's over and we're going to have pure discovery on that road. I think that's
[03:19:45.640 --> 03:19:50.160]  a lesson. In fact, here's here's the part about us. That's that's so unexpected, right?
[03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:53.960]  I think we're naive, optimists about the future of the world. You know, we're not here to
[03:19:53.960 --> 03:19:57.040]  ruin your party. We're here to actually portray a vision of liberty. You're creative. You're
[03:19:57.040 --> 03:20:00.200]  creating the future. God bless you. Retransmission starts now.
