[02:29.480 --> 02:34.480]  Wall Street Journal had to say think you know what's going on you don't jaw
[02:34.480 --> 02:41.880]  dropping so that's coming up but first Obama was already out demonizing the
[02:41.880 --> 02:46.360]  Second Amendment and putting out this info yesterday ahead of the shooting
[02:46.360 --> 02:50.040]  where two people were killed in the theater you would think watching the
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.720]  mainstream media that it's the end of the world hour after hour after hour of
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.040]  press conferences governor gentle I mean you would think that an asteroid was
[03:00.040 --> 03:05.000]  coming to destroy the earth because it's a theater the whole world's a stage each
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.960]  of us players upon it and now we're hearing on the news again don't ban
[03:09.960 --> 03:16.120]  guns ban white people because another lone nut drifter reportedly shot two
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.880]  people and then himself here's president Obama if you ask me where has been the
[03:21.880 --> 03:29.960]  one area where I feel that I've been most frustrated and most stymied it is
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.760]  the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on
[03:34.760 --> 03:43.520]  earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun safety laws even in the
[03:43.520 --> 03:52.440]  face of repeated mass killings and mass killings look at the number of
[03:52.440 --> 03:58.840]  Americans killed since 9-11 by terrorism it's less than a hundred if you look at
[03:58.840 --> 04:04.080]  the number that have been killed by gun violence it's in the tens of thousands
[04:04.080 --> 04:11.400]  and for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is
[04:11.400 --> 04:18.920]  distressing but it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.920]  remaining 18 months man it's hard to listen to him he saw that little gleam
[04:23.920 --> 04:28.760]  in his eye in his remaining 18 months he is coming after the guns we're gonna
[04:28.760 --> 04:33.440]  play that clip and we come back and analyze it piece by piece because the
[04:33.440 --> 04:37.400]  whole thing is upside down bizarro world
[04:37.400 --> 04:42.600]  Switzerland has more guns than we do and they have lower crime the areas with
[04:42.600 --> 04:50.120]  guns have low crime we're 330 million people mass shooting violence is down
[04:50.120 --> 04:56.960]  it isn't guns killing people it's people it's just all lies every stinking word

[08:44.560 --> 08:50.920]  p.m. Central Standard Time I'm your host Alex Jones there has been another
[08:50.920 --> 09:00.640]  shooting a lone drifter from Alabama in Lafayette Louisiana reportedly shoots
[09:00.640 --> 09:09.600]  two people and you would think that a major city just blew up they are all
[09:09.600 --> 09:12.920]  over the news saying it is the fault of the Tea Party the fault of
[09:12.920 --> 09:19.040]  conservatives they are all over the news saying come on not one more life take
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.960]  the guns when you go to New York Chicago DC the places where they've taken the
[09:23.960 --> 09:28.520]  guns they have the highest crime rates in the country in the case of Chicago the
[09:28.520 --> 09:34.040]  world 40 something people a week almost all of them black get shot in Chicago
[09:34.040 --> 09:39.360]  what is it about 15 a week die and 90 plus percent of it is black on black
[09:39.360 --> 09:46.440]  there is almost zero discussion of that because the citizens can't stand up for
[09:46.440 --> 09:51.880]  themselves and are just fed on by the criminal element it is racist that since
[09:51.880 --> 09:55.520]  the end of the Civil War in the north and the south the first gun control laws
[09:55.520 --> 10:01.120]  were put in at city levels to keep black people from being able to own guns
[10:01.120 --> 10:07.400]  well I'll be you know what if I'm gonna have a black person owning a gun in the
[10:07.400 --> 10:12.480]  north of the south they passed laws that blacks couldn't have guns and so the
[10:12.480 --> 10:17.480]  criminal element always gravitated to those neighborhoods because they knew
[10:17.480 --> 10:22.160]  people couldn't protect themselves it was a group you could push around just
[10:22.160 --> 10:29.320]  like the Asian mob whether it's Japanese or Chinese or Taiwanese pick on
[10:29.320 --> 10:35.000]  people in their neighborhoods the Italian mafia 200 years ago 150 years ago
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.640]  was just street thugs that would shake people down at their vegetable stands in
[10:39.640 --> 10:43.400]  their hardware stores and then grew into what we saw in the 50s running the
[10:43.400 --> 10:48.760]  country and it's the same thing for the Mexican mafia feeding on Hispanics and
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.480]  all the different ms-13 different variants and it's the black criminal
[10:53.480 --> 11:00.320]  groups heavily armed feeding on black people the exact same story over and
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.080]  over again arm the mothers arm the fathers blow the punks away blacks been
[11:06.080 --> 11:11.360]  happening in Detroit where the police chief said people need to arm themselves
[11:11.360 --> 11:15.120]  the black police chief and they've shot a whole bunch of thugs hundreds of them
[11:15.120 --> 11:20.880]  and guess what suddenly crimes going way down in Detroit because they don't
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.880]  have a bunch of strict gun control and even though it's very poor and has
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.440]  collapsed its crime rate is going down look it up because the criminals are
[11:30.440 --> 11:37.520]  scared to car jack or home invade because they get laid out with lead but
[11:37.520 --> 11:40.600]  this is how they can make a mountain out of molehill two people are dead it's
[11:40.600 --> 11:47.400]  very tragic upwards of a hundred people die a day on the highways are we saying
[11:47.400 --> 11:56.520]  man cars to dad six wounded a gun-free zone well Paul Watson has the article
[11:56.520 --> 12:02.400]  info wars.com don't blame all Muslims for Chattanooga but blame all
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.560]  conservatives for theater shooting with no evidence yet that this guy was a tea
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.000]  partier but tea partiers on record just departments own numbers
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.920]  conservative libertarian people have the lowest crime rates out there in studies
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.680]  and the highest level of charitable giving look it up just type conservatives
[12:24.680 --> 12:30.160]  libertarians highest level of charity study type in tea party lowest crime
[12:30.160 --> 12:37.200]  rate it is a fact people self-identifying as conservative or constitutionalist or
[12:37.200 --> 12:40.840]  libertarian have the lowest crime rate but if you watch mainstream dinosaur
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.800]  media but they're not telling women to hold have special devices so that they
[12:45.800 --> 12:49.800]  can pee standing up or telling women to show their feminists by having green or
[12:49.800 --> 12:54.040]  purple underarm hair by the way we give you the New York Times and Yahoo people
[12:54.040 --> 12:57.440]  don't believe me when I mentioned it yesterday this is the top stories have
[12:57.440 --> 13:01.960]  green underarm hair pee standing up if you're a woman white men are inherently
[13:01.960 --> 13:06.600]  bad whites are criminals whites are dangerous and you sit there MTV New
[13:06.600 --> 13:14.280]  York Times MSNBC it is crazy town and then out of 330 million people there's
[13:14.280 --> 13:18.720]  just crime and murder going on you know by the hundreds every day because that's
[13:18.720 --> 13:24.560]  what's always happened overall crimes is 92 is down 61% according to
[13:24.560 --> 13:30.560]  professor lot the Justice Department says 51 whatever let's just say 51% drop
[13:30.560 --> 13:40.480]  51% drop since 1992 and you would believe there is a insane epidemic of
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.800]  people swinging from chandeliers shooting everybody and the only place
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.160]  that's happening is the south side of Chicago New York DC that's a bad areas
[13:49.160 --> 13:52.920]  of Dallas Houston I mean every major city has bad areas where there's a bunch
[13:52.920 --> 13:56.840]  of drug dealers and criminals and all the rest of it and that's what goes on in
[13:56.840 --> 14:00.440]  those areas and the criminals gravitate to those areas because they can get a
[14:00.440 --> 14:06.040]  way with it they can then go out of the crime area rob the middle class rob the
[14:06.040 --> 14:15.360]  suburbs rob working-class folks and then come right back into their warrants and
[14:15.360 --> 14:17.840]  that's what's going on and there's you go to those neighborhoods there's white
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.120]  scum there's black scum there's Hispanic scum they're all scum in they're
[14:23.120 --> 14:27.240]  feeding on good people and poor people live in those areas and scum all acts
[14:27.240 --> 14:33.120]  just the same they just got different colored skin and so I mean I was there
[14:33.120 --> 14:36.360]  this morning and I watched for like 30 minutes and then I came back and watched
[14:36.360 --> 14:40.600]  another 30 minutes I was only elliptical for like 25 that I was halfway
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.440]  watching it was looking waits then I I watched for another 30 minutes getting
[14:43.440 --> 14:49.280]  ready and I never saw any information just the police acting like it was the
[14:49.280 --> 14:52.200]  end of the world the governor acting like it was the end of the world
[14:52.200 --> 14:57.920]  everyone's just acting like it's this giant spectacular theater event I mean
[14:57.920 --> 15:01.520]  if a chemical plant blows up and kills 50 people it's on the news for a couple
[15:01.520 --> 15:06.360]  hours if there's a highway pile up and it kills a hundred people it's hard to
[15:06.360 --> 15:11.000]  leave it in the news if bad stuff gets in the water and you know it kills 14
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.960]  people it's not even in the news but if two people get shot in the theater oh
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.400]  my gosh we're defenseless in a theater a shooter could pop up any minute and kill
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.640]  us it's creating the perception that imminent death could happen at any
[15:25.640 --> 15:30.600]  minute and why is a Republican governor playing along with us in Lafayette
[15:30.600 --> 15:37.400]  Louisiana what is he doing with an hours of it in breathless press conferences
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.880]  it's bizarre but it shows how mainstream media's losses credibility it's
[15:45.880 --> 15:49.680]  falling apart its ratings are declining steadily but still it can put on a
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.080]  hoax still it can make something like this the top story and Obama in a
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.200]  chilling 58-second clip part of an interview with the BBC we're gonna
[15:58.200 --> 16:04.600]  analyze here in just a moment has this wicked gleam in his eye and he goes I'm
[16:04.600 --> 16:09.520]  frustrated I haven't gotten the guns he goes but I'm gonna really make some
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.760]  changes in the last 18 months Obama admits US gun laws are his biggest
[16:13.760 --> 16:21.240]  frustration close quote and he doesn't talk about 51 percent drop in crime
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.720]  using guns he doesn't know the economy starting unravel so crimes actually
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.120]  starting to go back up but that's because of collapse but it's still nothing
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.400]  compared to 92 levels in the whole crack war and he just implies that we're the
[16:34.400 --> 16:38.240]  only country that hadn't had the guns taken no Switzerland hasn't had their
[16:38.240 --> 16:46.400]  guns taken he's guarded by guns himself he has bodyguards and he sits there and
[16:46.400 --> 16:52.040]  implies that the guns are going out and attacking the people and no word about
[16:52.040 --> 16:56.880]  almost all of the quote mass shootings over 90% of them just department's
[16:56.880 --> 17:01.880]  numbers are gangland shootings just like with the mob in Chicago in the old days
[17:01.880 --> 17:06.320]  with the Italian mob shooting up the Irish mob or vice versa or the Jewish
[17:06.320 --> 17:13.040]  mob shooting up the Italian mob or vice versa you would watch this and and and
[17:13.040 --> 17:16.400]  you would think there was just an epidemic just like they do with shark
[17:16.400 --> 17:21.880]  attacks there been more than 50 attacks this year with small sharks thinking
[17:21.880 --> 17:27.840]  your foot is a fish and biting it there's been a couple deaths and I saw
[17:27.840 --> 17:31.440]  articles just last month that it's cutting back on beach profits for hotels
[17:31.440 --> 17:35.880]  because there has been a little bit of unusual level of shark bites still very
[17:35.880 --> 17:40.080]  low and people are scared to death you got a better chance of a leprechaun
[17:40.080 --> 17:43.960]  jumping out and giving you some gold having a great white shark attack you
[17:43.960 --> 17:48.120]  but people think they're about to die any minute let me tell you who's dying
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.200]  because they count criminals getting shot as people killed by guns in the
[17:52.200 --> 17:56.880]  news most the people killed in crime statistics are shot by the police or by
[17:56.880 --> 18:01.880]  citizens shooting criminals and you can find a lot of bad cops out there sure
[18:01.880 --> 18:06.560]  society's degenerated but most the cut shootings are completely justified when
[18:06.560 --> 18:11.920]  the police are being shot at and there's thousands of cases of citizens
[18:11.920 --> 18:18.640]  aiding the police with firearms to pin people down guns are the answer they're
[18:18.640 --> 18:22.480]  not the problem let's play this Obama clip one more time then I'm gonna come
[18:22.480 --> 18:26.680]  back and play it slowly and just every second stop it and go over the lies
[18:26.680 --> 18:33.160]  because no one can lie as a tissue as a compendium as a continuum as a body of
[18:33.160 --> 18:41.320]  frothing stewing baloney filled BS like mr. Bravo Sierra Barack Hussein Obama
[18:41.320 --> 18:51.000]  let's go ahead and go to it if you ask me where has been the one area where I
[18:51.000 --> 18:59.080]  feel that I've been most frustrated and most stymied it is the fact that the
[18:59.080 --> 19:04.680]  United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we
[19:04.680 --> 19:12.160]  do not have sufficient common sense gun safety laws even in the face of
[19:12.160 --> 19:21.000]  repeated mass killings and you know if you look at the number of Americans
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.320]  killed since 9-11 by terrorism it's less than a hundred if you look at the number
[19:27.320 --> 19:33.000]  that have been killed by gun violence it's in the tens of thousands and the
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.520]  guns get us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that no
[19:38.520 --> 19:45.680]  watch his eyes distressing he's coming but it is not something that I intend to

[24:12.960 --> 24:19.600]  United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them Mr. and
[24:19.600 --> 24:24.280]  Mrs. America turn them all in I would have done it one thing that I think is
[24:24.280 --> 24:28.120]  clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be
[24:28.120 --> 24:32.600]  repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and
[24:32.600 --> 24:36.680]  then only do it every Monday we need to do this every day of the week and just
[24:36.680 --> 24:42.400]  really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way and
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.600]  we're gonna play more of those clips today where the president the vice
[24:47.600 --> 24:55.200]  president and others during the campaign in 2008 2007 promised that they
[24:55.200 --> 25:00.360]  weren't coming after semi-autos rifle shotguns handguns anything and it was a
[25:00.360 --> 25:06.360]  complete conspiracy a total lie that they owned guns they believe in the
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.440]  second amendment and how dare anyone say they were gonna try to get our guns
[25:11.440 --> 25:18.160]  I've got Obama saying it more than 30 times we've got Biden saying it dozens
[25:18.160 --> 25:23.440]  of times I know because I was gonna put that in the Obama deception too that
[25:23.440 --> 25:28.440]  never finished maybe I should just play minute after minute of their lies it's
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.320]  like saying you can keep your doctor it cuts your prices by half well first
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.680]  Obamacare was gonna be free it's they're just such predators they're protected by
[25:38.680 --> 25:43.800]  guns they've disarmed people all over the world and now they want our guns and
[25:43.800 --> 25:48.840]  now they want Switzerland's guns Switzerland has the lowest crime rate
[25:48.840 --> 25:54.080]  in Europe look it up yeah England has low gun crime because they absolutely have
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.760]  a ban there they're an island but they have three to ten times depending on
[25:59.760 --> 26:04.080]  what numbers you look at in what region the muggings the stabbings the beatings
[26:04.080 --> 26:08.640]  to death so yes you get beaten to death or stabbed to death three to ten times
[26:08.640 --> 26:14.400]  more often and their crime rate is at least double on average in the United
[26:14.400 --> 26:19.080]  Kingdom what it is for the US national average what we have is pockets of
[26:19.080 --> 26:26.720]  hellish crime very small hellish pockets and we need guns in those pockets
[26:26.720 --> 26:32.000]  because what's not in those pockets legal citizens with guns that is
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.920]  citizens that are able to have guns legally they follow the law they get
[26:36.920 --> 26:43.000]  preyed upon they're mainly poor black poor white poor Hispanic Americans and
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  it's despicable now let's go over this clip of Obama chilling because he's
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.240]  coming for the guns the social security folks if you wire transfer money that
[26:52.240 --> 26:57.920]  means that you supposedly are inept and what's the technical term the FBI memo
[26:57.920 --> 27:03.360]  uses that you've been found incompetent so they're not just gonna say you're
[27:03.360 --> 27:08.200]  mentally ill because you go to a psychologist or because you're depressed
[27:08.200 --> 27:11.560]  no no they're taking your guns and if you don't like it you won't get your
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.080]  social security just like the IRS is now taking people's money and their pay
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.400]  checks and their refunds for Obamacare fines they promise that wouldn't happen
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.720]  they are a pack of criminal scum now let's start playing the clip here and I'm
[27:25.720 --> 27:28.920]  gonna talk over his lies but we'll be stopping and here it is if you ask me
[27:28.920 --> 27:36.240]  where has been the one area where I feel that I've been most frustrated and
[27:36.240 --> 27:43.320]  most stymied it is the fact that the United States of America is the one you
[27:43.320 --> 27:49.760]  know why he feels stymied because we at least get the physical holding of
[27:49.760 --> 27:53.880]  weapons to defend ourselves we at least understand that but he's still done it
[27:53.880 --> 27:57.960]  outside of law so in a way that's a lie because he's getting a lot of it done
[27:57.960 --> 28:02.040]  and they're brainwashing our kids suing the gun manufacturers death by a hundred
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.880]  cuts then he goes to lie and says we're the only country where they haven't taken
[28:05.880 --> 28:09.800]  the guns there's actually four or five that still have some rights only the US
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.840]  and Switzerland that have pretty strong rights let's go back to the next life
[28:13.840 --> 28:19.000]  advanced nation on earth in which he implies your advance if you don't have
[28:19.000 --> 28:26.960]  your guns common sense gun safety laws common sense in the past of common sense
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.000]  says if you have more guns there's less crime in areas that have gun laws have
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.800]  the highest crime so it's another lie saying it's common sense what you're
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.480]  doing another deception please continue repeated mass killings it's a
[28:40.480 --> 28:45.040]  pause again repeated mass killings there's a couple hundred people die a
[28:45.040 --> 28:51.640]  year in mass shootings and over 90% is gang related one group shooting another
[28:51.640 --> 28:55.280]  group and you notice what happens it's hardly on the news you know like 20
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.880]  people get shot in Detroit five or six die and a gang shooting or Chicago and
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.560]  it's not even just a blip but man one old white guy goes in and shoots two
[29:04.560 --> 29:07.880]  people it's the end of the world it's the tea party they're coming to get us
[29:07.880 --> 29:14.000]  let's continue and you know if you look at the number of Americans killed since
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.280]  9-11 by terrorism it's less than a hundred let's hit boss then he goes on to
[29:18.280 --> 29:23.080]  say it's thousands by guns well guns didn't do it criminals with a tool did
[29:23.080 --> 29:26.800]  it or insane people and a lot of the folks you talk about getting killed
[29:26.800 --> 29:30.440]  were criminals that were killed when folks defended themselves so why were
[29:30.440 --> 29:35.760]  they alive but there was some truth there let's back it up 15 seconds we
[29:35.760 --> 29:43.400]  come back we'll play a rare happening a true blue moon Obama told the truth this
[29:43.400 --> 29:52.640]  is stunning stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:52.640 --> 30:02.600]  and the GCN radio network liberals call for disarming all white men after

[32:02.920 --> 32:06.800]  syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars calm
[32:06.800 --> 32:11.440]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality
[32:11.440 --> 32:16.120]  and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30 40

[33:14.760 --> 33:16.840]  happen
[33:16.840 --> 33:29.200]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[33:29.200 --> 33:48.800]  so Obama says something truthful here in the clip and that's that we've only
[33:48.800 --> 33:55.160]  had a hundred people killed by terrorism since 9-11 yeah so why are they
[33:55.160 --> 33:58.400]  taking more and more of our liberties constantly in the name of countering
[33:58.400 --> 34:04.560]  terrorism and then how 15 years of 9-11 is the Wahhabist movement out of Saudi
[34:04.560 --> 34:10.760]  Arabia bigger and more powerful than it has ever been and is now taking over
[34:10.760 --> 34:16.040]  Egypt Libya Syria and parts of Iraq with our government's blessing and support
[34:16.040 --> 34:22.720]  and why isn't ISIS attacking us more if they hate us so much because they're
[34:22.720 --> 34:30.600]  controlled by the West they are directed by the West and they do have camp
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.800]  followers and bots and useful idiots that aren't in on the conspiracy who do
[34:35.800 --> 34:40.360]  occasionally attack and that's why when they do attack the government keeps it
[34:40.360 --> 34:44.080]  very quiet and the media does because that doesn't fit into the narrative
[34:44.080 --> 34:49.720]  there weren't hours of press conferences last week eight days ago when those
[34:49.720 --> 34:55.080]  Marines got shot seeing in for three days kept saying why would he do it he
[34:55.080 --> 35:02.200]  was all American boy MSNBC said probably a conservative and of course he said he
[35:02.200 --> 35:08.440]  was doing it as a jihad and then that's seen as anti-muslim no I'm not
[35:08.440 --> 35:13.360]  anti-muslim in general I'm anti radical extremists being funded by the
[35:13.360 --> 35:17.320]  globalist and their camp followers attacking us and then the media won't
[35:17.320 --> 35:23.800]  cover it because it doesn't fit into your narrative so let's go back to the
[35:23.800 --> 35:31.160]  Obama clip where he says he's coming after those guns here it is repeated mass
[35:31.160 --> 35:38.440]  killings and you know if you look at the number of Americans killed since 911 by
[35:38.440 --> 35:43.640]  terrorism it's less than a hundred if you look at the number that have been
[35:43.640 --> 35:51.720]  killed by gun violence it's in the tens of thousands that part and most of them
[35:51.720 --> 35:55.560]  criminals being shot or criminal shooting criminals the vast minority
[35:55.560 --> 36:02.600]  people being killed by criminals with guns and then in the aggregate overall
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.520]  crime rate knowing down with guns as gun ownership by good people and
[36:06.520 --> 36:13.360]  proficiency goes up and then he sits there an axle upset and concerned just he
[36:13.360 --> 36:18.000]  can't keep us safe he really wants to help us when NATO and Obama and Hillary
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.600]  Clinton on record funded al-Qaeda now known as ISIS to kill more than 80,000
[36:24.600 --> 36:30.120]  people they estimate now who were innocent not even combatants in Libya
[36:30.440 --> 36:36.880]  tens of thousands upon tens of thousands unknown numbers in Egypt
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.680]  hundreds of thousands in Syria somewhere over 350,000 hundreds of
[36:42.680 --> 36:49.480]  thousands in Iraq whole families executed gays thrown off of buildings
[36:49.480 --> 36:55.640]  churches blown up priests killed beheaded al-await non-radical Muslims
[36:55.640 --> 37:03.160]  or they're really more like the al-awaits or the Sufi Muslims aren't even what I'd
[37:03.160 --> 37:10.560]  call Muslims they're like Jewish mystics Babylonian mystics it's like King
[37:10.560 --> 37:17.640]  Solomon stuff it's more Masonic oh they find them they really hate them it's a
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.480]  branch of the Shiites that's what Assad is and that's why they really want to
[37:22.480 --> 37:25.960]  get him that's why I didn't make women wear bags on their heads or sexually
[37:25.960 --> 37:29.920]  mutilate them and once women to go to college and have equal rights so they
[37:29.920 --> 37:34.760]  got to be killed is Obama up there talking about that he's so concerned
[37:34.760 --> 37:41.560]  the the the hundreds of thousands killed that he's supported or the Muslim brotherhood connected
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.640]  to it all no or groups connected to him attacking shopping malls in Nairobi
[37:46.640 --> 37:53.880]  Kenyan no it's all fake bull and I'm just sick of it but let me tell you what
[37:53.880 --> 37:57.680]  this signifies they are coming after our guns and they are fully capable of
[37:57.680 --> 38:03.400]  staging a massive false flag at a shopping mall at a grocery store at a
[38:03.400 --> 38:08.840]  public school at a college and killing hundreds and just showing the dead bodies
[38:08.840 --> 38:14.480]  and saying see what you did gun owners you are guilty for this now by the guilt
[38:14.480 --> 38:22.080]  submit to us and they attached the rebel flag to a mental patient who was on
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.160]  the amnesic I predicted I said if he's only amnesic it may be staged sir and
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.600]  sir he was only amnesic came out the police report it was staged LAPD just
[38:30.600 --> 38:40.600]  look it up shooting of RFK you can't make this stuff up and there's no telling
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.720]  the theater shooting he was on drugs on amnesics when they wore off he said he
[38:45.720 --> 38:50.160]  was set up to the police in lockup told people next to him the jail cell then the
[38:50.160 --> 38:54.200]  media came out and said oh actually he was never in an area to talk to folks but
[38:54.200 --> 38:59.680]  the prisoners went public said yeah he was there and he was in a DARPA classified
[38:59.680 --> 39:05.400]  mind control program under the the top Air Force psychiatrist one of the top
[39:05.400 --> 39:11.360]  ones in the country that commanded air bases before and then became his
[39:11.360 --> 39:15.360]  basically handler and met with him hours and hours and hours and hours
[39:15.360 --> 39:20.840]  multiple times a week and he was getting upwards of $85,000 a year of
[39:20.840 --> 39:29.960]  government funding for a secret project with DARPA with brain interface we
[39:29.960 --> 39:35.480]  reported it back at the time by searching his name it was in the Denver post
[39:35.480 --> 39:42.920]  and in the LA Times a few months ago with his trial or whatever it came out
[39:42.920 --> 39:51.880]  that he was part of a government brain research program oh yeah he sure was just
[39:51.880 --> 39:58.080]  like Theodore Kaczynski the Unabomber just type it into a search engine Theodore
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.360]  Kaczynski worked for the CIA and you'll get Atlantic Monthly you'll get LA
[40:03.360 --> 40:10.920]  Times you'll get Associated Press he was in the CIA MK ultra program not for 10
[40:10.920 --> 40:16.760]  years not for 20 years but for close to 30 years his family said he
[40:16.760 --> 40:23.160]  disappeared into CIA mind experiments oh there's nothing to look at here there's
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.240]  nothing to research here let's all just move along
[40:28.720 --> 40:36.400]  CIA at Harvard there it is Harvard in the making of the Unabomber Atlantic
[40:36.400 --> 40:44.320]  Monthly but they just act like it's a coincidence no it's not Tim McVeigh
[40:44.320 --> 40:51.800]  highly decorated those into special ops get sheep dipped so they take you and
[40:51.800 --> 40:57.960]  put you into spy operation maybe that mainstream news articles about how he
[40:57.960 --> 41:01.600]  was sheep dipped he said I will not be he wanted to set up right-wingers that
[41:01.600 --> 41:04.920]  we're gonna bomb a building they were gonna wind up the white supremacist at
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.280]  Elohim City run by the Southern Primary Law Center to do it Terry Nichols is on
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.560]  record I've talked to other folks that were on death row with with McVeigh in
[41:13.560 --> 41:17.000]  basically phone calls that they didn't even know we're gonna happen on this
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.480]  show you've heard it live and the police involved FBI and others who've
[41:21.480 --> 41:28.000]  exposed it and when they said no we're gonna go ahead with the bombing just
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.040]  like a mad salon Egyptian security said I'm not going along with the bombing of
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.640]  the World Trade Center in 93 we've had him on he's a listener McVeigh said I'm
[41:36.640 --> 41:42.320]  not gonna really bomb a federal building we wired this up to set him up they
[41:42.320 --> 41:46.200]  said all right buddy and then that morning they drugged him and he was
[41:46.200 --> 41:49.800]  found the side of the road crawling around on the ground with no license
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.240]  plates foaming at the mouth saying it hurts it hurts get the chip out there's
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.840]  a chip in my butt that was in the newspapers it's like oh he was foaming
[41:58.840 --> 42:02.440]  at the mouth on the side of the road with the state police reported saying I
[42:02.440 --> 42:07.400]  got a chip I got a chip I mean whether he had a chip or not they'll I don't know
[42:07.400 --> 42:11.040]  what's going on I miss all cloak and dagger stuff what I told you is what we
[42:11.040 --> 42:17.880]  know and I've interviewed Jane Graham who was one of the top people at HUD who
[42:17.880 --> 42:22.640]  would walk up the back stairs wouldn't take the elevators for exercise and saw
[42:22.640 --> 42:26.120]  what she said we're a lot of really good-looking serious men I mean she said
[42:26.120 --> 42:30.400]  she was a younger woman at the time so these are really good-looking men yeah
[42:30.400 --> 42:33.680]  one of them was famous German intelligence according to her it's the
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.840]  guy we know flew out of the US had a Southern Prairie Law Center lawyer I
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.280]  should add that came to his defense famous fella well the other side of the
[42:42.280 --> 42:45.640]  Southern Prairie Law Center the guy that played the part of the guy excuse me
[42:45.640 --> 42:53.880]  on the other team and she said what are you doing they're putting big gray
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.640]  sticks of butter and wires and they said we're from the telephone company honey
[42:58.640 --> 43:03.200]  and she didn't fight them on the news somewhere FBI somewhere ATF senior and
[43:03.200 --> 43:10.400]  the other was German intelligence with McVay and she was there she even talked
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.520]  about it why are they doing all that is they wired a building in front of
[43:14.520 --> 43:19.560]  everyone with federal IDs and then McVay's like okay let's let's bring the
[43:19.560 --> 43:23.480]  white supremacist in let's set him up and they went no we're going ahead he
[43:23.480 --> 43:29.320]  said I'm not blowing up a daycare center oh really McVay well guess what you'll
[43:29.320 --> 43:33.440]  fit the bill the evil right-wing soldier and the truth is they've been
[43:33.440 --> 43:39.120]  casing militias all over the country and he'd been at Waco too on who they were
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.120]  gonna set up next as part of that Pentagon project so for all the military
[43:43.120 --> 43:49.320]  personnel all the special forces people who have shown up at my events who have
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.600]  threatened me this is years ago they don't do it anymore guess they can't
[43:53.600 --> 44:00.480]  find folks that'll do it that have tried to set us up just remember and remember
[44:00.480 --> 44:05.560]  well that you could be on one of these operations someday and that you could be
[44:05.560 --> 44:10.240]  set up so you just remember that you just remember when they're getting ready
[44:10.240 --> 44:13.280]  to blow up a federal building with a daycare in it that you might be the one
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.720]  they set up buster and I know you know that you're just gonna really serve the
[44:18.720 --> 44:22.120]  evil and hope you're not the one they pick because that's how we win
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.960]  Machiavelli in justifies the means really what's the end to put veterans on
[44:26.960 --> 44:32.640]  don't treat list and kill them and kill old people and abort babies and bring
[44:32.640 --> 44:36.440]  down the country and shut down humanity I mean why would you want to serve this
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.720]  because you get incrementally put into it you start running drugs you start
[44:40.720 --> 44:45.440]  doing assassinations for the government but the criminals that run it and next
[44:45.440 --> 44:50.440]  you're being told blow stuff up be part of these operations and the only reason
[44:50.440 --> 44:53.960]  we haven't seen more Oklahoma cities is we're on there but they know the local
[44:53.960 --> 44:59.600]  police departments have all seen Oklahoma City bombing cover-up films
[44:59.600 --> 45:03.480]  they've seen my show they've heard the interviews I mean I've been in police
[45:03.480 --> 45:08.720]  departments multiple times and the police chief or the SWAT team head or
[45:08.720 --> 45:12.960]  whoever will get up and say Alex I need to hear all this I know and we'll open
[45:12.960 --> 45:17.480]  their cabinet up and it'll be my videos other people's videos and and and John
[45:17.480 --> 45:20.840]  Burch society literature they go we know what's going on thank you have a nice
[45:20.840 --> 45:31.040]  day so can you imagine how it is for the globalist who want to pull this off and
[45:31.040 --> 45:34.920]  now everybody knows about false flags I mean we had two lawyers on a plane from
[45:34.920 --> 45:38.600]  Amsterdam with the underwear bomber who gets led on to the plane drooling so
[45:38.600 --> 45:41.760]  he's looking at him with a sharp dressed American and they're going he doesn't
[45:41.760 --> 45:45.680]  have any ID and he flashes ID and says you know basically national security they
[45:45.680 --> 45:51.280]  go okay they let Mutalib fly he gets up basically you know stumbling around peeing
[45:51.280 --> 45:54.960]  on himself as I was basically described once they're getting ready to land and a
[45:54.960 --> 45:58.800]  firecracker goes off in his pants and they announced we're putting in body
[45:58.800 --> 46:05.000]  scanners next month we just ordered them they've been ordered a year before when
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.760]  Chertoff was still at Homeland Security he then goes becomes the head of the
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.120]  company where he ordered them a year before and his shelf gets 20 plus
[46:12.120 --> 46:20.520]  million dollars off 3 billion the CIA puts a drugged person on the plane with
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.200]  a firecracker in their pants and so we all now get to have our genitals grabbed
[46:24.200 --> 46:29.680]  do you know how much it scares them that they know our people are everywhere
[46:29.680 --> 46:36.000]  watching everything and later it came out in Congress Haskell's questions he
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.480]  and his wife's points were brought up and the head the deputy head of
[46:40.480 --> 46:45.480]  transportation mr. Kennedy said yes it's true an unnamed agency told us to let
[46:45.480 --> 46:49.920]  him on the plane I'm gonna say that again an unnamed agency told us to let him
[46:49.920 --> 46:56.680]  get on the plane I didn't mean to go off in a whole jag about false flags it's
[46:56.680 --> 46:59.920]  just that we don't know what they're gonna pull next but Obama had a
[46:59.920 --> 47:03.960]  certainty in his eye criminals always tell you what they're gonna do and he
[47:03.960 --> 47:07.400]  said I'm coming for the guns in my last 18 months and let me tell you I could
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.640]  feel it my gut I can see it and that might be the false flag that one they
[47:11.640 --> 47:15.960]  come for the guns people will start shooting back and then the whole civil
[47:15.960 --> 47:21.840]  war kicks off and this is just a disaster this is horrible they're gonna
[47:21.840 --> 47:25.200]  try for it they want to wreck the country they're shutting the nation down
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.080]  they are breaking our families down they are shutting down our industries they
[47:30.080 --> 47:33.800]  are Obama care is meant to bankrupt the country they are going for broke right
[47:33.800 --> 47:39.640]  now and it is so sad and listen they have to take over and have authoritarianism
[47:39.640 --> 47:43.480]  in their view because they know they can't shut the internet off till they've
[47:43.480 --> 47:46.920]  done that they can't curtail it till they've done that and now Planned
[47:46.920 --> 47:50.840]  Parenthood is coming out saying brace yourselves they're gonna have racist
[47:50.840 --> 47:55.040]  videos where we're celebrating killing blacks and minorities and brace
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.560]  yourself they're gonna have they're gonna have us dissecting babies and
[47:58.560 --> 48:04.000]  selling their parts they've got undercover video that's right the Patriots do
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.960]  and by the way it doesn't matter what you do criminals go ahead and try to shut
[48:07.960 --> 48:10.920]  the internet off go ahead and try to arrest us go ahead and blow up a federal
[48:10.920 --> 48:15.080]  building and blame us we all know the truth and so the signal's been sent and
[48:15.080 --> 48:18.800]  everybody understands what's going on and people should be burning copies of
[48:18.800 --> 48:23.360]  this show on DVD because when they shut stuff down if they do we're trying to
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.280]  stop that folks will kill for a copy of this show breaking this down because you
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.840]  see here's why they got to shut us down as everything we've warned of begins to
[48:32.840 --> 48:38.120]  manifest as it already is the credibility is gonna go from high to
[48:38.120 --> 48:44.040]  stratospheric to messianic and I don't mean myself but the liberty message the
[48:44.040 --> 48:51.080]  resistance to evil is messianic it is the answer to the evil and when stuff
[48:51.080 --> 48:55.800]  gets hellishly dark and hellishly cold folks are gonna want want to warm their
[48:55.800 --> 49:01.440]  hands by the fire of truth and truth flows through the universe from the
[49:01.440 --> 49:04.720]  beginning of time into the future it can't be turned off it can't be
[49:04.720 --> 49:10.240]  suppressed so kind of hold a beach ball down on the bottom but here it is
[49:10.240 --> 49:12.800]  backlash
[49:15.680 --> 49:19.480]  I'm gonna get into a whole bunch of these reports Planned Parenthood expects
[49:19.480 --> 49:24.640]  undercover reporters to release video of clinics harvesting baby organs they're
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.040]  gonna show a highly sensitive area in the clinic where the tissue is processed
[49:28.040 --> 49:33.760]  yeah we're gonna humanize that tissue that you don't want us to look at and
[49:33.760 --> 49:41.200]  don't you think you can win you'll never shut any of us down my heart and soul
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.360]  knows that the worse it gets the stronger the people that love the truth
[49:46.360 --> 49:53.280]  are gonna be evil is evil and wickedness and those that serve darkness is
[49:53.280 --> 49:59.120]  absolutely pathetic and weak but it intimidates us into bowing down to it
[49:59.120 --> 50:03.080]  I'm gonna go to break I said that we were gonna have plenty of the new product I
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.600]  ordered double of the new product thinking that we tend to sell out of
[50:06.600 --> 50:10.480]  stuff so quick when it's first offered I ordered double what we usually do a

[54:29.160 --> 54:34.520]  after our guns that that that murderous shark-eyed glare to dominate and break
[54:34.520 --> 54:38.480]  America and finally get those bitter clingers your kids belong to the
[54:38.480 --> 54:43.200]  government and the globalist your bank accounts your guns your Bibles it's all
[54:43.200 --> 54:53.760]  being conquered right now it's really happening the borders are open the laws
[54:53.760 --> 54:57.920]  are suspended the illegals are allowed to fly without IDs but citizens have the
[54:57.920 --> 55:02.800]  book thrown at them illegal aliens can just ship in 10 packages full of drugs
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.480]  right in front of the border patrol or patrol literally looks the other way
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.640]  with their cars and drives off as the drug deliveries made big as a smart guy
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.080]  and so is Owens they say clearly the board patrol was given a tip to leave
[55:16.080 --> 55:26.400]  very shameful but then lemonade stands all over the country get ticketed find
[55:26.400 --> 55:30.880]  or arrested Amish are under assault because humans engaging in normal
[55:30.880 --> 55:36.200]  commerce is illegal the globalists want us shut down in a giant reservation slash
[55:36.200 --> 55:43.440]  plantation the model is a giant cashless concentration camp and that's not
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.840]  rhetoric that's what the new world order is and they just put in a so-called
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.960]  black president to make it politically correct now they're gonna put a woman in
[55:51.960 --> 55:55.760]  to do whatever she says because she's a woman and that moves me to this next
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.440]  story I mentioned this a few days ago didn't show the articles and we got
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.200]  emails and comments going the crazy Alex Jones claims that you know they say
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.080]  women should show their feminists and have colored arm hair and that women are
[56:08.080 --> 56:12.600]  being standing up and then people are acting like I'm obsessed with this no I
[56:12.600 --> 56:16.360]  was pointing out while all hell's breaking loose we're having this forced
[56:16.360 --> 56:22.200]  on us daily mail New York Times Yahoo here it is women who dye their armpit
[56:22.200 --> 56:26.520]  hair and it goes on to show that they're feminists they do this a new article
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.720]  came out yesterday that say men cooking is an act of dominance that that is so
[56:31.720 --> 56:37.480]  now a traditional role like barbecuing well that's bad too it's just see
[56:37.480 --> 56:41.040]  everything's bad you just submit to whatever they say and then maybe maybe
[56:41.040 --> 56:45.200]  you'll be okay I mean I don't care if you want to have armpit hair I don't
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.440]  associate with you you know I shaved my face because I like having less hair I
[56:49.440 --> 56:54.360]  think it's attractive and women shave their legs if you're into lot-nest
[56:54.360 --> 56:59.920]  monster type stuff that's your business if you're into dating big foot that
[56:59.920 --> 57:04.800]  knock I mean some people are into gorillas the point is is that you can
[57:04.800 --> 57:09.920]  do that all day long if you want I don't have to adopt your culture
[57:09.920 --> 57:14.280]  tolerance means you can have green arm hair you think but again they don't have
[57:14.280 --> 57:17.520]  science they don't have jobs their college degrees are worthless so the
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.760]  media says be special attain something have green arm hair have blue arm hair
[57:22.760 --> 57:26.240]  I know some guys didn't take a lot of showers already had green arm hair
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.600]  without the color now continue on the football locker room and then we've got
[57:30.600 --> 57:35.080]  this Yahoo learning to pee standing up to show your feminism one woman's
[57:35.080 --> 57:38.280]  journey and it's a big feminist thing they have these little cups that look
[57:38.280 --> 57:45.960]  like a funnel and you do it and it's the new thing to do and it's discriminatory
[57:45.960 --> 57:51.080]  I scroll down as we show folks the funnel on TV it's discreet it's discriminatory
[57:51.080 --> 57:56.040]  if you don't have urinals in the women's bathrooms and again brown paper bags are
[57:56.040 --> 58:00.960]  racist I mean you can't make this up and don't blame all Muslims for Chattanooga
[58:00.960 --> 58:05.000]  but do blame all conservatives for the theater shooting Paul Joseph Watson
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.480]  article info wars.com you understand the articles we write and the information
[58:09.480 --> 58:13.400]  we cover and the videos we put out or something the establishment would love
[58:13.400 --> 58:18.440]  to shut down it's coffin nails to them you understand it's a war we're in a
[58:18.440 --> 58:23.560]  savage toe-to-toe war and guess what we've got some good blows in with the
[58:23.560 --> 58:27.160]  truth fight with two daggers in our hands and the globalists are stumbling
[58:27.160 --> 58:30.560]  around bleeding all over the place right now the problem is they're about to
[58:30.560 --> 58:34.160]  counter offense I can tell you right now you got to get in there and we got a
[58:34.160 --> 58:37.800]  deal with them politically we got to sever their head politically and expose
[58:37.800 --> 58:41.760]  them with a murdering ghoulish organized crime narcotics trafficking child
[58:41.760 --> 58:46.240]  molesting absolute scum of the earth garbage felt these maggot infested
[58:46.240 --> 58:51.320]  demons are. Hey how you doing? Good brother. Just recently start using your

[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.920]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:30.400]  We are in the hands of extremely wicked, vicious, slathering, foaming at the mouth
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:37.000]  criminals who lust. I mean I lust after cheese and leaf enchiladas covered with
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:46.040]  onions and Spanish rice and a Doseki's lager. I lust to be at the Caribbean
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.280]  drinking a pina colada and smoking a big old Cuban cigar watching my kids play
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.040]  in the surf. Probably not good things they're decadent worldly things but
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.880]  that's what I'm into. You know that's my sins. My sins maybe every once in a while
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.280]  sleeping an hour late or you know looking at a woman when they walk by
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.680]  they're attractive when I shouldn't. The globalist though they desire to dominate
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.280]  you and fly over just villages of poor people living in shacks while they set
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:20.560]  up in big giant palaces. They lust after burning cities and wars. Hitler it was
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.040]  reported by the Germans themselves would go out to the front in the first few
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.560]  years of the war when he was winning it. The Polish front, the French front, the
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.600]  Russian front and he'd watch through telescopes. There's film footage of this
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:40.040]  through big binocular style telescopes. The Stuka bombers bombing things and
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.960]  it said that his doctors would give him amphetamines and he would sit there and
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.560]  eat maybe 20 pastries. He was a vegetarian but he would eat like you know
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:52.840]  sometimes 20 pastries and he would just sit there eating sugar pastries in
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.520]  heaven in his gray uniform with guys in black uniforms around him watching
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.080]  cities burn.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:08.280]  See I wouldn't want to watch a city burn. I wouldn't get off on that but Adolf
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:15.920]  Hitler did. I wouldn't get off on Ted Bundy you know for a month torturing
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:22.800]  on woman to death or Jeffrey Dahmer for a week torturing somebody to death. Let's
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.560]  see there are people that do and when you look at Planned Parenthood and all
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.640]  these globalists and Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton and all these people and
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.520]  Michael Moore with six armed bodyguards but he wants your guns they are
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:40.360]  pus-filled creatures that know they're preying on you and have a will to follow
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:46.520]  a script and follow the power elite to be given power even though they're
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:53.160]  untalented stupid bloated weak people. It's giant armies of weak satanic scum
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:59.960]  gathering together with their desire to pull down the good because in their
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:06.800]  ugliness in their diseased minds beauty and strength and honor is like a dog
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:13.440]  whistle to a dog's ears it's like fingernails on a chalkboard and they
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.280]  want to silence it they want to shut it down do cockroaches like the light
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:29.640]  coming on. No they don't. Now there is a Rodney James Dio line I forget from which
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:39.680]  song where he talks about the way that black is pretty to the purest heart.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.080]  They're places of pleasure they offer you treasure if you fly but then there goes
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:57.640]  the soul of you and I. I know the song it's Evil Eyes and that says it all black
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.640]  and I don't mean the color black but the darkness of tyranny it's more a blue
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:11.320]  cold the way that black is pretty to the purest heart that's absolutely true
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:17.000]  evil from afar because it's so alien and when you don't know what it is you have
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.840]  it stuck your arm in it and found out it's a meat grinder found out it's
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:30.720]  another dimension looks pretty on the surface looks alluring a beautiful
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:36.960]  woman who has that evil sparkle in her eye that Jezebel's spirit seems to be
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.440]  more beautiful than the sweet little maiden who physically is even more
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:46.760]  attractive. Why do good men choose evil? That's another question because we don't
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:56.000]  just face the garden variety low-level creatures like Gollum we face people
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.840]  like Obama. Have you ever dreamt of having superpowers? Well what if I told
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:08.360]  you there are real-life superhumans and their DNA could be worth billions. Drug
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.680]  companies have their eyes on people like Stephen Pete who can put his hand on a
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:18.920]  hot stove or step on glass and feel no pain and about 100 people share Timothy
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.360]  Dreyer's condition his bones are so dense he could walk away from a mangled
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:29.080]  wreck unscathed. Both men's apparent superpowers come from uncommon deviations
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.880]  in their DNA but rather than freakish these traits are seen as a gift from
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:39.120]  God to the drug companies who want to turn them into something useful something
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.400]  good for business. The painkiller market alone is worth 18 billion a year so of
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.840]  course the industry is pressing ahead with research into genetic irregularities.

[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.360]  another full hour plus to flesh more of this out that's why there's just so much
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.600]  news Steve quail of Steve quail calm and the Q files joins us best-selling
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.360]  author syndicated radio host for 23 years probably one of the most popular
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.720]  guest maybe even more popular than myself on coast-to-coast AM that I know
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.840]  because I've talked to the insiders not not just to coast-to-coast but it
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.960]  clerk channel talk about how much the ratings go up with Steve quail is on I
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:01.280]  would hear this guy talk about issues 20 years ago and I thought he's sincere a
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.960]  lot of that's true but he's crazy on a bunch of this other stuff and then now
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.600]  most of what he talked about 20 years ago he'd been around a few years before
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:19.000]  me that is vocally ended up being true I mean I remember him talking about they've
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.080]  already got clones and laboratories are already splicing us with animals and
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.880]  then you know 10 years later it was mainstream news growing humanoids and
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.560]  cows to harvest their organs and shame they have no rights because the you know
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.760]  they're part pig or part cow I mean that's in the literature 20 years ago
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.960]  now it's in the news and it's like all big deal and oh they're super genes
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.840]  they're finding in people and they're they're taking your blood at the doctor
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.360]  and not telling you it's being sold to be tested and then later it's worth
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.280]  billions and you don't get paid I heard quail talk about that 20 years ago now
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.520]  it was in Wired magazine yesterday CBS News two days ago so we're living in the
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:02.040]  future it's just not evenly distributed there is a breakaway civilization what
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.280]  we've been told about the earth and its history has nothing to do with reality
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.800]  what modern churches preach about the age of the earth and all this is a false
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:16.120]  debate to then be discredited by science itself putting out this info the
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:21.200]  truth is we don't know but it's twisted interpretations of the Bible if you
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.040]  actually interpret it correctly and look at what's currently happening then it
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.480]  makes incredible sense and it's scary because you go oh my god this is real
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.400]  but you will not hear it from 99% of the preachers folks so Steve quail
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.000]  joined us he's gonna get into some of the wilder stuff next week and an hour
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.160]  and a half interview with David Knight here on this transmission but the the
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.720]  issues we're gonna get into now is the war on the military Bobby Jendall calls
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.960]  for arming the public and then suddenly there's a shooting they're hyping up like
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.280]  it's the end of the world we're gonna look at admitted subliminals and carrier
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.720]  waves and how screen time is brain damaging the public that's the main
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:05.320]  issue he wants to get into and then we actually research what he's saying it's
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:09.640]  in the research papers it's even in the news that screen times brain damaging
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:15.440]  children and adults don't give babies screen time carrier waves reprogramming
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.240]  brain who would have known it puts you into a sleep level the exact carrier
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.640]  waves by accident they're claiming because the outside researchers at
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.480]  universities who weren't paid to do it by DARPA 30 years ago they'll go into a
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.120]  study and go it's funny it puts you in a sleep state right at near sleep like
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.600]  sleepwalking and it's an exact carrier wave resonance with the light flicker
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.720]  and there's a carrier wave audio it's really weird that they out of thousands
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.200]  of different frequency levels this right one got chosen because it's on purpose
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.480]  I was allowed into DARPA research facilities see they arrest so many
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.520]  people now I talked about this a decade ago really 14 years ago and didn't
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.600]  realize what I wasn't being allowed into because it was never really spoken it'd
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.320]  be like let me take you in this lab now and they'd like look on the door it would
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.480]  say restricted DARPA and it was a UT and I was taken through all this stuff and
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.840]  it was like it was like a science fiction movie and it was all about carrier
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:19.280]  waves mesmerizing they had a whole area about how to make women become
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.560]  sexually excited with electrodes hooked to their genitals to actually see I'm
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.280]  not gonna say it on air but you know when a woman gets excited and I just even
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.800]  14 years ago when was it it was no it was it was it was it was it was with
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:40.600]  Kevin Booth in 99 so 16 years ago I know I'm ranting I'm gonna go to Steve
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.880]  Gwell now it's just he tells me his topics he wants to cover and then I
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.080]  independently know it's true and I'm just realizing this is so insane no
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:53.040]  wonder most the public can't wake up they're under positronic attack we're
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.200]  living in a science fiction movie we're living in a dystopia why are some of us
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.000]  immune or at least quasi-immune because when I watch mainstream TV now I find
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.920]  myself only just give in to it I find but then but then something in me says
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.920]  no I'm not gonna submit but I mean it is powerful folks I guess the Bible says
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.040]  if it wasn't for Christ coming even the elect would be deceived and given over
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.600]  to great delusion Steve quail thank you for joining us Steve quail.com
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.840]  Well Alex what an intro and this is probably the most pressing issue in of
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:27.480]  our day because you know we used to talk you and I used to talk at large about
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.000]  televisions and all the stuff they were doing with televisions people poo pooed
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.240]  it and now I want to coin a new term on your radio program let's call it instead
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.560]  of conspiracy theorists let's call it conspiracy realists the weight of
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.600]  evidence is upon us and I like what and then this is important I like what
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.440]  Donald Trump told what's his name the guy Anderson Cooper of the Central
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.440]  Intelligence Agency not yeah nobody trusts you 70% of the people don't trust
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.400]  you and to watch the liberal left and the globalist and the elitist basically
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.480]  crawling out of their skin over Trump what you know what's interesting right
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:11.400]  now telling the truth is absolutely contrary indicated in this country and
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.160]  nobody tells the truth and so all of a sudden Donald Trump comes along and
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:22.640]  tells the truth and boy is it easy fangs in the in the that their toenails grow
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.320]  out into claws but I think the thing that we got to talk about is reality
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.480]  avoidance syndrome that's another term that I like to use look Alex they
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.320]  bastardizing this language so bad anymore that you can't even use terms they
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.600]  used to have a common meaning because everything is being twisted George
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.720]  Arwell said that was the Fabian socialist plan in his nonfiction books and
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.240]  that's why he turned against them at the end was to remove language and turn
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.920]  people into politically correct creatures that only knew a few dozen
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:56.600]  terms absolutely and again Atlas shrugged Ayn Rand just nails it did she just
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.200]  nailed it obviously she was involved with one of the Illuminous and knew
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.520]  there are plans but here's the deal even our television sets are not only
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.000]  watching us but what you said in the introduction is so true infrasonic
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.080]  subliminal messages if people understood that at one point in the probably a
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.040]  decade the majority of money in black ops was going to mind control now every
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.600]  day we hear about neural implants every day we hear about basically the robots
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:29.320]  taking over every day we hear about cyber sex we hear about virtual
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:34.400]  what they're trying to do is divorce everyone and I believe that video games
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.240]  now look I'm not mad at gamers but I don't play them but the point is a mind
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.960]  control platform developed by DARPA that's declassified absolutely so what
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:50.000]  what we have to do is basically get people to do an amazing thing shut down
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.720]  for at least six hours a day and and I mean some people are on I can just tell
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.200]  you by their emailing to me are on almost 24 seven and then they crash and
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.720]  come back but with the subliminal messages and then when you basically tie
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.840]  it in with all the mind control all the psychotropic drugs and now the big the
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.120]  big announcement with scopalamine or burn dinga by the way burn dinga the
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.520]  scopalamine dust is called zombie dust if you know I remember talking about
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.800]  that 20 years ago and the glaze came over everybody's eyes but the problem is
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.920]  is that people now cannot think I think was Hitler said it's a good thing for
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.800]  us people don't think I paraphrased it now look at two all of the news that
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:39.120]  Hitler never died in the bunker with Eva Braun never did even the DNA test
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.720]  independent DNA now why is that critical because you and I have used the term the
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.200]  fourth right the fifth right and the final right there are people that have
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:52.840]  written books by those titles but one of the fascinating things is is that so
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:59.760]  much effort was being put in even in the days of Germany to control what people
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:04.080]  thought to control excuse me what people did and let me give you a good
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.160]  example the vilifications of the veterans because we got to get into this
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.680]  it just came out the warnings you've been giving the warnings I've been giving
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:17.600]  that 238,000 I bet she's closer to quarter million to 300,000 our bets
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.360]  have been intentionally denied not only their benefits but medical care and
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.480]  this is one of the most infuriating things in the world yet yet most of the
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.200]  congressmen and all of the Senate especially the traders in the Senate
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:37.000]  which is the majority do not even take up the cause even former veterans and
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.640]  and when Trump made the statement about McCain that he did in the past we did
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:47.840]  shows on the POWs and the MIAs left behind and his name always popped up on
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.160]  top of the cover up now why is this critical because at all costs the
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.680]  globalists the illuminous do not want any truth coming out that's why the virtual reality that's
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.000]  by the virtual world that's by the consistent repeating of lies on the
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.160]  mainstream news all the networks are owned by the same people you can switch
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.800]  channels and get the same headline news and the same word for work they may put
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.680]  on a different blonde or a different brunette but the bottom line is it's the
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.000]  same message over and over tell a lie tell a big enough lie tell it often enough
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.520]  and the people will accept it as reality and now they're intensifying the lies to
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:31.560]  a level never before seen in an attempt to overturn reality itself I mean we
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:35.240]  would think that this would backfire on them but they obviously think it's going
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.520]  to be successful saying two plus two equals five that we've actually teach
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.280]  that that that you can keep your doctor when you can't that raising debt
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:49.400]  limits don't raise debt limits that white people kill more black people than
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:57.360]  black people kill white people I mean just absolute inverted reality just
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.360]  intensifying and as you mentioned just in the last couple years RT reported
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:08.080]  230 plus thousand US troops denied care period every veteran every veteran I
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:15.440]  know is being denied health care at the VA right now unless they were high level
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.000]  officers they are being told no we're not going to give you treatment for that
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.120]  no we're not going to take care of you and we see in the movies now the bad
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.620]  guys are the former vets they're clearly getting ready for a purge of the
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:33.000]  military a purge of vets because they're worried about anybody who would know how
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.080]  to organize and resist during a totalitarian takeover including back
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:43.000]  a biker gangs in Waco one of the things that I think most people have got to
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.680]  understand as fast and furious was a big deal it wasn't a minor infraction of a
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:53.480]  law it was arming gangs and and what they admit to arming is this totally
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:58.040]  different 15 years ago Alex if you remember there were ships being unloaded
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.480]  in the ports the west coast ports from Seattle it was in the LA times they caught
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:08.600]  containers full of tens of thousands of fully auto AK-47s absolutely but what
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.440]  they didn't talk about was a heavy weapons that were already brought into
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:17.000]  this country in pre-stage good example a friend of mine was a and this is a
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.320]  contemporary story a couple a couple years ago and he said he was on the
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.720]  Columbia River in a certain town I forget the name of the town but he had
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:30.380]  to do a I guess an electrical check he was a power alignment and he said he
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:35.120]  got into a warehouse and his curiosity was just provoked and that he said this
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.760]  there were literally hundreds and hundreds of crates of Russian weapons
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.160]  now why is that critical well the Columbia River comes right in pretty
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.920]  much to you know parts of Washington and other parts and they can come in on
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.280]  boats they can come in on little mini subs certain areas that depending on high
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:57.560]  tide and stuff but this is real evidence now I remember you 15 years ago
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:01.400]  saying they were secretly training Russians in anti-terrorism for the
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:06.720]  American people in Denver and then two years ago it was on Fox News the Denver
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.520]  Post and other papers they admitted Russian troops were here training to
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:15.600]  take on so how are we at war with Russia but then at the same time under the UN
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.000]  they're training them to occupy us how does that dialectic work and then I
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.800]  talked to folks in the state police and Joe Biggs talked to folks in the
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:29.160]  Banditos they said that they're getting rid of the older motorcycle gangs that
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:34.280]  aren't part of the Mexican mafia in the future for a takeover in Texas I don't
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.080]  know your view on that but you mentioned motorcycle gangs well yeah my
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.040]  view is to set obviously the cohesiveness of a quote a motorcycle
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:48.880]  let's call it to a club okay because not all these guys are gangs okay no matter
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.560]  what colors now you know as well as I do that that whole thing in Waco was a
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.760]  setup and I'm telling the even in PR now admits it was a shut up yep and the
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:03.680]  shots fired the greatest travesty and I pray that some of the judges in Texas at
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:09.240]  the state level including the Supreme Court of Texas will absolutely step
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.800]  into this because those guys were held how long Alex some of them 30 days they
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.320]  were grabbing people and the mom and pops in the town that weren't even part of
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:22.160]  it absolutely so ladies and gentlemen you've got to ask yourself why well
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:26.840]  here's the answer to your question first on the gangs because they can form
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.720]  especially the veterans I would guess now I don't know the makeup of those
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.880]  of different groups that were involved but I would guess pretty close to a
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.640]  majority were veterans I would guess that so once it's not a difficult show
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.960]  they're just worried about any organization just like militias just
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.680]  like they don't want outside farmers markets or lemonade stands any swap
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:53.760]  meats garage sales the feds passed the law for $15 million fines on garage
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:58.560]  sales that's Fox News headline I'm not joking if they find one thing that's
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:04.520]  been recalled ever so so yes it shut down any any public gatherings basically
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:10.600]  absolutely and this is why there's such monitoring this is why there's such it
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.720]  isn't amazing they know everything you and I type they know everything we
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.720]  speak about obviously on the radio they know all this stuff yet they can't find
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.520]  ahead of time some guy who's texting in the opening and giving his you know
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:29.080]  Arabic statements I mean or or let's look at something even more real it is
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.960]  fascinating to me that if any state is hated by the current administration it's
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.000]  Texas you remember the story you know you remember seeing the images when Perry
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.080]  was governor of Obama meeting with him putting his feet up on the desk well
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.600]  showing someone the bottom here is a cultural flipping off of the person in
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.640]  total contempt that's their religion in the Middle East you know Obama has those
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:57.680]  characteristics and the situation that is fascinating is that you know the army
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.800]  just in the last what 2448 hours basically said anybody defending you
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:08.000]  should be treated as terrorists and yet they denied they denied their recruiters
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.960]  the ability to even arm themselves with side arms and said pull down the
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.280]  well we confirmed it from callers and we went out and talk to the recruiters
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.040]  it's come down then later it was in the news confirming our report they I mean
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.800]  the higher ups of the Marines the army you name it called it and they said you
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.480]  don't even give them a chance you call the cops and say you want them arrested
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.960]  for trespassing you don't even tell them to go you we want to get these
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.240]  patriots in jail because this is the enemy this is the top of America that
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.480]  would stand up to defend people this is the scum this is who we have to go
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:44.320]  after because the top brass are men and women that work for the globalist and
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:51.400]  who want to arm ISIS absolutely and and now people got to understand when we
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.800]  when we were reporting years ago and you started with the Mayak report and on
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:03.560]  the other documents identifying veterans as enemies of the number one enemy
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:09.040]  number one and said that veterans would attack every police department I mean
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:15.200]  what an insane statement yep and so the interesting thing is is that in in the
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.720]  years that I was on talk radio set of 20 years ago now it's important to put
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.320]  this into perspective because that's how long it's been building I said the goal
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.640]  of the overthrow of the United States it you're not you'll know you're in the
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.320]  last stages when the police have turned against the people and people are
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.880]  turning against the police and all of this has been race-baiting and it's not
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.280]  the white guys and I'm not blaming blacks but it's the media justice it's
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.160]  and it's the media that foments the revolution you said on my show 20 years
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:51.240]  ago 20 years ago in 1995 I've been there interview you from the beginning you said
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.840]  they're gonna demonize the military they're gonna night of the long knives
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.200]  when they try to turn the public against the police and vice versa for
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.800]  destabilization you know it's coming and then once they have the first layer
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.160]  takeover then they're going to round up the veterans and they're gonna round up
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.160]  the Patriots in the military and they've got a red and blue list and now
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:14.560]  that's all admitted two years ago the army admits internment camps and they
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.920]  even use the word reeducation camp why would they use the famous Soviet term
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:27.800]  of a torture camp a reeducation why do they even use the same names I mean it's
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:35.640]  so naked it is naked and and the obvious point in all this is that somebody
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:40.040]  beyond the Russians and someone beyond the US government is controlling the
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.080]  strings the real puppet masters of the world aren't the guys even the
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.720]  dynastic families of you know the rock ballers Ross Childs and all that
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.840]  typical culprits there are even people or as I suggest entities that have
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:57.640]  orchestrated this when you look at the completeness of the plan for the
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:01.720]  destruction United States you know Michael Savage a border language culture
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.040]  will he has to add the people to now to that the great wall penetrating the
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:11.520]  weather underground you know Alex again given the amount of people that were
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.520]  available and alive just a population United States and now they're up to about
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.360]  a hundred million on their different list and these camps aren't built just to
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.360]  take up space Walmart's aren't closed just to basically frustrate shoppers
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.080]  there is an integrated plan underway and this is what people have got to say
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.560]  it's the bigger picture it's bigger than martial law it's the complete
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.680]  overthrow it's the look at what they've done to the Confederate flag okay then
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:44.000]  you know what flag is next the US flag you mark my words the US flag will be
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:53.680]  considered the absolute I would say the symbol of racism symbol of everything
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:56.800]  that the United States has done we joked about it two weeks ago it's now
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:02.520]  being proposed by mainstream groups to replace it with a rainbow absolutely you
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:11.760]  know absolutely and so we are at the point where obviously everything that is
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:19.840]  being done is how do I say this we are in a position now where everyone who
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.160]  used to love this country look at the look at all of the NFL even national I
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:30.040]  guess national football they everybody's down on guns and the whole situation
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:36.760]  your and my disfavorite person goes on Pierce Morgan and starts blaming Bobby

[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.400]  end of the interview to give us more details on that subject Steve quail is
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:28.480]  our guest we know this bohemian grove is going on right now it's final day is
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:36.160]  this Sunday and they are doing a cultic rituals having orgies having homosexual
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:41.600]  sex and the issue is it's the Republican leadership doing it not
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.120]  everybody that goes there's bad not everybody you know there is a Satanist
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.480]  but it's a way to induct ruling class people as the doorway into the deeper
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.800]  cult but even John Ronson who snuck in with me but made me promise the guy that
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.240]  wrote the book ministeric goats that got made into a movie he wrote them he made
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.280]  me promise not to say he was there because of liability could have gotten
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.640]  sued he I and my hands and stuck in I had to not put a lot of the footage in to
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:20.080]  my film because it was John Ronson there with us but I put dark secrets inside
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:25.920]  bohemian grove out and he was there he saw it with me he saw the big photo on a
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.720]  tree of Henry Kissinger there was secret service nearby so I couldn't get the
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:34.080]  camera hidden and get footage of it dressed in drag doing something sexual
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:40.120]  and the point is this is not some moral judgment of this not because I don't make
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.960]  moral judgments but because get past that and just look at it for what it is
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:51.520]  blackmail even spy magazine even people magazine admits huge problems with HIV
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:59.280]  at the bohemian grove back to the 70s back to the early 80s just huge bizarre
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:05.240]  behavior with former presidents prime ministers British royalty Dutch royalty
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:12.040]  female prostitutes down the road at the hotels 2,700 acres with just men having
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:18.360]  sex with each other this is to compromise people and it's going on right
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:24.840]  now same thing at skull and bones homo erotic worshipping the devil and every
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:29.600]  culture that goes downhill ends up worshipping a dark entity so whether you
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.560]  believe it's real or not the elites do believe in the devil I've been there
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:41.240]  inside for five hours and I thought it was like a stupid devil worship play
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:47.560]  except the men were raptured they were dead serious more focused than I've seen
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:54.080]  people in any holy roller church that I've attended and I've been in Baptist
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:57.400]  southern Baptist Pentecostal and growing up the whole nine yards I mean these
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:03.520]  people were hardcore serious and their eyes were on fire during the mock human
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:10.480]  sacrifice of a child we say mockers it appeared to be mock people say you're
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.640]  covering up look I look they found dead kids in the area there's a lot of weird
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.120]  stuff you talk to the locals it's like one of those vampire movies from the
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:23.080]  60s and with Peter Cushing and you know he's trying to talk to locals I won't
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:26.800]  talk to him I mean it's it's it's like that it's very Transylvanian looking too
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.520]  and I don't mean to digress it's just that Steve Quill gets off into what

[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.640]  with I wanted to have the ultimate cleanser that has shilogy and a bunch of
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:02.280]  other compounds just the shilogy alone has hundreds of different herbs it's
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.840]  like the built-up oil of herbs over thousands of years and then bleeds out

[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.360]  broadcast now we have this phenomenon when something first comes out it's a
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.560]  best-seller sometimes it's not but usually it is so this time I said I want
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.200]  to order double on our first run because that way we'll have this for a few
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.520]  months and I kind of sat around and planned it out where the next shipment
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.120]  is just being produced right now it's been sourced as being produced to be

[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:04.200]  it still doesn't fund it long term because it was budgeted out to fund this
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.600]  part of our operation until September but then it's all sold out so it does the
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.240]  same thing as if it's sold out by September when you miscalculate that's
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.920]  how supply side stuff is but thank you for your support deep cleanse is

[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:12.160]  Steve I want to get into the news with you and then I want to talk about your
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.400]  updated book and your new film coming out before you leave us and you'll be back
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.880]  next week to get more into the mindset of the illuminist and and why they're
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.760]  building this why they're doing this why they're trying to block off
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:28.560]  alternative histories that we continue to discover actually do have roots in
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:32.960]  reality but Steve Quayle giving you the floor now because I've been ranting some
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:37.640]  here you wanted to get into this latest shooting and how they're hyping it Bobby
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:42.800]  Jindal where you see the election going Obama says he's gonna go after the guns
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.600]  he told BBC yesterday in the next 18 months they're going after Social
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.640]  Security recipients guns saying if you take a wire transfer or automatic
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.560]  transfer of your check that means that you are incompetent I mean that's in the
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:59.960]  FBI memo this is really bold are they trying to start a civil war Steve
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:06.760]  Quayle absolutely now why is it critical that people understand this the the
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:11.360]  idea of the war and the primary the primary Jade Helen states okay and we
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:15.120]  know it's bigger than that Alex I can talk about Montana what's going on up
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:20.600]  here but more importantly than that they have to divide the nation Jesus said a
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:26.360]  house divided against itself cannot stand and so we've got how do we say
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.240]  this the 23rd mass shooting since Obama became president and isn't it
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.200]  interesting it had to be in Bobby Jindal's state near Louisiana and it's
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.360]  fascinating to me that the governors that care for the men in both the
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:46.640]  military or the National Guard in their states are now being vindicated just
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:51.400]  wait there'll be more attacks on the states and people are getting how do I
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.760]  say this we are at a hair trigger in my opinion now let's get back to something
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:00.360]  because if you ask me a question it's really critical the United Nations
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:05.400]  obviously Russia and China are the leading at ranking members by power at
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:10.800]  least of the Security Council the secret agreements that exist that most
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:14.600]  people don't know but you have been told I have been told we have been told
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.360]  pretty much are and this is what you've got to understand ladies and ladies and
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.560]  gentlemen they do not want you as United States citizens they want you as
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:30.840]  citizens of the world in order to do that they have to take the guns John
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:35.560]  Stewart was on TV with Obama at you know saying you got to take the guns away
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.760]  and then you know being accused of white privilege well here's the deal in
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.120]  order for the communists in order for the globalist by the way communism is just
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:49.920]  one of the things that the globalists use they want the complete now Alex
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.640]  here's the reality avoidance thing that I can't seem to break through God help
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:00.600]  you to break through it God help me and anybody else is that this really is the
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:06.680]  plan we can quote the globalist we can quote the Illuminati until we're blue in
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:12.920]  the face about they want this many people dead how is it that the disconnect
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:17.560]  does not transfer through to people well that's because again of the subcarrier
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:23.120]  signals infrasonics blah blah blah but the point that's really critical is that
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.880]  I would think most people who at least one in three if they have their way it's
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:32.360]  nine out of ten who are in the sights would see the bigger picture you know
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:35.720]  I've been told that I don't know if you know for a fact that you're banned on
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:40.120]  military bases but you know I've been told that I am banned just about on
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:44.200]  anything to do with the military okay in four wars is banned on almost all
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:49.880]  military bases getting to info wars and prison planet for about a decade yes yes
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:54.320]  and and I mean we've known that for some time but now people are saying hey wait
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:58.920]  a minute if this stuff is coming to pass that Steven Alex Alex and Steve are
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:03.360]  talking about then why are they banning watch how you why and this has got to
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:08.800]  sink in because first you know the very first statement that the president made
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:15.480]  was he wanted a private security basically army and and why is it that
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.480]  those guys dhs are getting funded and while the military basically has to
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:27.680]  beg now it's it's obvious with all of the the firings of our generals admirals
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:33.680]  you know senior military officials that there's a different Pentagon now and the
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:39.400]  Pentagon unfortunately I believe is under the spell of the pentagram and so
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:45.080]  when we talk about the war on the vets it can be it's not prophecy to say
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:49.760]  here's where it's going to head to next you just said and this is a plan and
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:54.320]  beyond anybody on social security that takes their check they're going to
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.720]  consider anybody incapacitated they're going to have you mark my words they're
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:03.400]  going to declare senility or they're going to come up with something and say
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.960]  every veteran suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder they're going to
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.480]  try just like the Jews and others got persecuted in Germany they're now
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.720]  getting it ready openly to say veterans conservatives libertarians white people
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:21.920]  are inherently evil and now need to be dealt with unless you're a leftist you
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.960]  can see the takeover everything the weathermen openly talked about in front
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.960]  of the FBI that came out in court this was their plan and since you raise it
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:38.360]  think about Obama saying I will go after the guns I will get the guns the next
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:44.680]  18 months we played that last hour John Stuart says act quickly take those guns
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:50.520]  mr. president I mean this is an outrageous move with them cheerleading to
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:55.240]  start the Civil War when John Stuart openly has armed bodyguards I mean
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.480]  these people will be held accountable when all this kicks off for their
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.320]  sedition against our country so since you mentioned it here's the John Stuart
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.800]  clip and then I have huge breaking news here it is what are you going to do you
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:15.040]  know you are running out of time it is you know some extent but you don't have
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.760]  that much time to take away Americans guns declare martial law and put hard
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.280]  working Americans in FEMA camps if you're gonna do that you better get
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.320]  started you better get started see they make a big joke out of it we just had
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:34.200]  him on the BBC saying he's got 18 months and he will act and now they're coming
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.520]  after the vets they're putting them on don't treat list that's a death sentence
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:43.000]  right there they've built in fact pull up watch this article just type in yes
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.360]  internment camps are real proof or Army manual talks about reeducation camps
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.760]  info wars.com they're like three years old has the Army field manual how to
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.760]  process our social security numbers how to break our families up it's in the
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.360]  Army times it's in there it is leaked US Army document outlines plan for
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:09.240]  reeducation camps in America they call them that it's an army mill okay so it's
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:13.120]  just like they first said the Planned Parenthood videos about killing kids
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:16.600]  aren't real and settling their body parts now they admit it but then they had
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.240]  salon come out yesterday and say it's not real and then I'm a racist and that
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:25.980]  Margaret Sanger isn't that's inverted reality folks I was brought up to hate
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:30.800]  racist my sister's Korean adopted but I don't have to sit here and tell you I'm
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:36.560]  not racist the proof is I stand up for life and I'm ranting I apologize Steve

[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.160]  skipping network break this is so important we told everybody that that
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.600]  this was going on a day before it came out that there were threats in Florida
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.720]  in Tampa and that there was an order to call the police and arrest people with
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.880]  guns trying to protect it that was in mainstream news yesterday so we have all
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:51.080]  the names all the facts documented exclusive to info wars.com red linked
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.400]  up at the top of the site we're gonna get it red linked report Tampa recruiting
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:00.080]  offices evacuated due to shooting threat let's add the word shooting to that so
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:03.800]  people understand how serious this is and we've confirmed Austin's getting
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:08.120]  threats or a suburb of Austin we've confirmed that Las Vegas is getting
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:11.400]  threats this goes right into what you were talking about the attack on the
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:15.680]  military Steve Quill sorry well no that's critical that people understand
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.480]  that and and I'm gonna I'm gonna tell people what's gonna happen you're gonna
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:23.720]  see a mass exodus from the military and you're gonna see a lot of people go in
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:29.240]  a wall now I'm not trying to foment anything I'm just telling you and even
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:33.360]  the guys in the Pentagon the people that monitor every word you say and I say
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.400]  they'd better understand something that some of these people are tired of their
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.720]  best friends their fathers their brothers or mothers and some some cases
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:48.560]  being murdered I want to make this clear the veterans administration is
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:56.240]  absolutely under orders to deny to deny veterans life-saving help unless like
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:00.380]  you said let's just say it we know there's covert programs going on to kill
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:04.480]  veterans that were in sensitive positions by poisoning them we know
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:08.960]  that's going on too one of the saddest things Alex is I got a letter from oh
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:14.720]  excuse me an email from a wife of a veteran who absolutely has to have pain
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.880]  medicine you know he's so messed up and please when I say messed up so much pain
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:27.000]  he's begging his wife to take his life that makes me so crazy that the gutless
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.240]  senators the traitorous children from hell are smirkingly smirkingly keeping
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:39.960]  their silence while the greatest attack in history we will go down okay it's one
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:44.240]  thing to have a Trojan horse is only to have a Trojan government and the thing
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:48.440]  that's amazing to everybody is the bill of rights the Declaration of Independence
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.480]  the Constitution our hate crimes you put the you put the video up years ago of
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:53:00.440]  the military you know training the federal government is a globalist
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:05.000]  Trojan horse it is the takeover they're waging war on the vets they're waging
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.960]  war on us it's already here are we undoubtedly with the pope announcing
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:13.800]  world government global carbon taxes global communism I mean what is the
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:18.200]  system going to do Steve is everything you've talked about everything George
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.720]  has talked about George Dory everything I've talked about with the New World Order
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:28.440]  is coming true drudge is reporting on it all these other world net daily what
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:33.000]  what is the system going to do is our credibility rises and rises well
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.560]  obviously they've got to stop our access to the internet they've got to shut us
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.640]  up they'll break apart whoever and I that's why I tell your listeners and my
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:45.480]  listeners you know pray for Alex pray for me pray for Doug Hagman pray for
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:48.600]  these men that are out there and women that are really telling the truth and
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:52.920]  what I'm seeing to Alex is there's some you know writers that used to be
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:57.240]  considered conservatives that are let's just say this they'd make them but they
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:02.560]  make Judas Iscariot look like a little eager because they are so duplicitous and
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:08.000]  so treasonous and here is the deal people have got to understand that they
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:14.160]  have to go into a full reality check they can no longer we were put into this
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:16.840]  incrementally I think about this whole time I know what you're gonna say is in
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:20.200]  the spirit we have been put into it incrementally you've got a break out of
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:23.520]  it you don't come out of it incrementally you've got a break out of the
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:27.600]  trance even if you're already awake and aware if you're not scrambling like
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:32.560]  someone being drowned to get out of this and warning people desperately we need
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:37.560]  hysteria we need stuff to break that's what it's for we need the floods coming
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:42.280]  the damn broke get to high ground we need to get that kick in the ass going is
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.920]  that what you were about to say absolutely and if they if anybody called
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.000]  and let me tell you neuro linguistic programming if anybody calls you me or
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.920]  anybody telling the truth and I would say empiric truth the documents are back
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:55:01.200]  us up if they call us fear mongers doom porn those words are indicative of I
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:07.600]  basically trying to reinvent language to get people to dismiss the truth look
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.360]  the whole world lies in the evil one that's what Jesus said okay and that
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:19.400]  means that the truth is now a the most avoided vilified nullified concept I
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.880]  believe in the United States in the world let me finish this about the
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:27.160]  United Nations the United Nations is going to use the Russian troops the
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:31.520]  Chinese troops both borders we talked about all the weapons explain how it's
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:35.200]  gonna work as they dissolve the US government they have to have one program
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:38.560]  that looks legitimate for the troops and the Congress but as you said they're
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:44.680]  building a parallel UN FEMA 7277 takeover that's actually in US code and
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:49.520]  already law to then use Russians and Chinese here then our troops are sent
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:56.120]  over there to keep control of them that's the UN agenda 21 literal hunger
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:01.840]  games model go ahead absolutely and that's why people are seeing intermingled
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.360]  with all the pictures of trains with all the highways are seeing UN vehicles now
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.880]  this is something that most people don't understand those dums and I'm not
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:14.800]  talking about the Senate right now but the deep underground military bunkers
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:22.360]  or bases have so much more to bring out some of these bases are huge Alex and
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:27.600]  so what's going to happen is it's going to as things escalate and here's what
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.160]  I'm trying to my goal is to diffuse Civil War okay I want people to
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:36.800]  understand that that's right I want the gangs to understand that you're being
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:42.000]  set up I want the blacks to understand and I'm talking black panthers to
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.400]  understand they're being set up the racism listen when when someone says
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.480]  Margaret Sanger was not a racist that is the dumbest ass statement I have ever
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.200]  heard in the world you know look don't listen to anybody when you hear some of
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.680]  this is you know that doesn't sound right Alex said she was Steve says he was
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:04.480]  and go read what she is and she was and for the record she wanted the
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.880]  annihilation of the black people more black she said I want every black person
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:14.360]  exterminated absolutely so Alex and imagine fake liberal sites say in the
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.120]  same article I'm racist the Planned Parenthood videos of hoax and Margaret
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:25.240]  Sanger was not racist I mean these people are pure servants of fraud and up
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:29.520]  hell let me say this we're in the same time period people want to go read
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.280]  Jeremiah 5051 Jeremiah was the Old Testament prophet that said whirling to
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:38.440]  them who call evil good and good evil how about the doctor that was you know
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:42.920]  trying to barter with baby parts in order to get her Lamborghini well I'll
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:46.560]  tell you one thing I hope she gets her Lamborghini because she's already on a
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:51.480]  fast track to hell people this should absolutely be astonishing
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:57.520]  veterans who have defended your freedom because you sat back and did nothing
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:03.560]  because you sat back and said nothing this is the enemy and those people that
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:09.040]  have said nothing how do I say this done nothing even begun there to spine up
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:15.840]  stand up and and do something Alex they're complicit in their own destruction
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:22.600]  that's the other thing I can't seemingly get across Steve quail.com is the
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:28.920]  website Steve quail is our guest I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war I
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:32.280]  wish it wasn't true but it turns out we were right about basically everything
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.160]  except it's worse than we thought and it looks like we could be two minutes to
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:40.640]  midnight the enemy is moving the enemy is moving alert worldwide the enemy is
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:44.120]  moving fast we don't know exactly what they're gonna pull but we know what
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.480]  they've got in their hand and it's bad

[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.640]  is running low and is in question that's why it's more important than ever to

[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:41.880]  today remember this iodine stores safely for years available exclusively at

[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:39.120]  Alex Jones King James version first John 519 20 we know that we are of God and
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:45.280]  that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one and we know that the son
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.640]  of God has come and has given us understanding that so we may know him
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:54.160]  who is true see I'm able to judge who's good and who's bad in the world and we

[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:11.760]  life again and we know that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:19.320]  undoubtedly ladies and gentlemen we are now in the power of the evil one and the
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:25.640]  decisions been made the death race has begun the triggers being pulled and this
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:28.360]  is the big test everybody thinks you're just gonna lay down it's gonna leave you
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:34.080]  alone now that's what the wolves go after first and just great judgment is
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:37.400]  coming upon this country so much evil is going on the three minutes we have left
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:40.440]  you're gonna be on for an hour next week at least breaking more of this down
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:44.480]  Steve quell.com tell me about your new film coming out tell me about the book
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:49.400]  that accompanies it at Steve quell.com well interesting Alex technology of
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:54.280]  the fallen delayed due to the discovery of historical documents you can go to
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:59.200]  your listeners go to true legend the series legends plural the series.com
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:03.960]  we found when Tim alberino went to South America this is critical we found
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:11.840]  documents that have not been seen by anybody for 450 years talking about the
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:17.200]  supernatural nature of the sexual perversion of the giants people that
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.560]  don't believe this you know I can't do anything about your unbelief but even
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:29.880]  Diodorus famous historian kind of an author 400 you know 500 years before
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:36.320]  Jesus bottom line is Alex the subject matter of supernatural evil and you
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:39.600]  just laid it out the bohemian grove and all these people you know they're being
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:44.760]  promised now something they're being promised the same lie that Eve was told
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.720]  in the Garden of Eden he shall not surely die sure well that's the I mean
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.560]  that's the Nephilim I mean look at the movie Prometheus where its giants as
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:57.880]  well they're just throwing it in our face well listen my new book and this is
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:03.360]  really important Genesis 6 giants first came out but I think 10 15 years ago I
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:09.280]  the whole thing has been redone 60 70% of its new but what's fascinating who
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.680]  legends the series it's almost like we were given a time lock into the ancient
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:19.460]  past to validate and verify even stories that the Incas to Incans and the
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:25.080]  Mayans and the Aztec told that was you know basically in their oral tradition
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:29.960]  and then their stele is that when the giants went after each other to
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:34.720]  solidize each other that literally lightning came down from heaven now
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:40.640]  what's the shot on that you know what's the chance of that 450 years ago how
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:46.000]  about this conquistadors putting their sword in the eye socket of a giant and
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.080]  a conquistadors sword can be 36 to 42 inches and barely touching the back of
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:55.280]  the skull people so that's just that's just me them making it up it's a
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:59.760]  universal thing so true legend of the series where we've got the first episode
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.720]  pretty much done as a matter of fact when I get off with you I'm going to film
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:07.400]  my last part and I think people's minds are going to be blown away because when
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:12.280]  you understand who's been covering up let me address one thing real quick how
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:15.820]  is it that the Pope is pushing for a one-rule government he's speaking
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:19.280]  against capitalism and yet in the same breath he's saying he believes in the
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:24.440]  devil and demons you know why he made that statement guess who are going to be
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:30.560]  made out to be the devil and demons anybody who resists the new order again
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:36.200]  true legends of series dot com my book Genesis 6 Giants is available on my
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:40.880]  website Steve quail dot com and from the from the response I'm getting from all

[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:25.180]  speaking of brave new books population control is one of your most important
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:28.940]  books and I've read most of them how corporate owners are killing us Jim Mars
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:34.620]  bestselling author of rule by secrecy and the trillion dollar conspiracy and he
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:38.700]  joins us to break this down but first I want to go to this report and get his
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:44.660]  take on it Tampa recruiting offices evacuated due to threat unspecified
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:48.900]  shooting threat comes one week after Chattanooga shooting Joe Biggs and Josh
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:53.140]  Owen shot the video of smugglers at 60 yards away bringing in masses of drugs
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:57.180]  basically during Trump's visit to the border that was on drugs and made national
[02:09:57.180 --> 02:10:02.500]  news last night now Joe is talking the recruiting offices got him to go on
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:07.180]  record they've evacuated all the Tampa facilities won't let him be armed won't
[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:11.260]  let citizens come stand out front and now this has happened here's Joe Biggs
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:16.340]  report with the text the tweets all the evidence red linked at info wars.com
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:22.020]  here it is Joe Biggs here with info wars.com now about 40 minutes ago I got
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:27.020]  a tweet from a friend who lives in Georgia whose son lives down in Florida in
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:32.580]  roommates with a recruiter now this recruiter says that they have been
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:37.980]  ordered to evacuate all the recruiting stations in the Tampa area due to a
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:44.140]  threat now I talked about this earlier in the week when I was standing guard in
[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:48.180]  front of the recruiters office in South Park Meadows in the South part of
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:51.780]  Austin one of the recruiters from one of the departments came out and said that
[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:56.980]  they were getting threats in Las Vegas and in Florida now it looks like the
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:11:02.180]  they have taken it to another level with a direct threat in Tampa Bay so these
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:06.380]  guys have evacuated and I know this because I personally have called
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:11.500]  numerous locations in the Tampa area and gotten zero answers the phone just
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:16.820]  rings and or goes to a voice recording so this is happening right now we're
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:20.980]  going to keep our eyes on it stay alert if you're in the Tampa area if you have
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:24.260]  the ability to swing by one of these places and see if they are indeed open
[02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:30.100]  or if they are vacant give us a tip on the video below I'm Joe Biggs with
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:35.140]  infowars.com Joe Biggs doing a great job at breaking news stories every day
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:38.980]  just ferreting around it really has a nose for investigative reporting and also
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:42.980]  tracking the internet which I know you teach journalism as well I tell you
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:46.420]  mainstream media doesn't do its job anymore that's giving rise to the new
[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:50.780]  media that's almost about to supplant the old dinosaur media and here you are
[02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:54.860]  with a leg in each world population control how corporate owners are killing
[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:59.140]  us available at amazon.com and bookstores everywhere mr. Mars good to have you
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:04.260]  here with us let me tell you what the greatest irony is on this gun thing okay
[02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:09.220]  here we've got trained military people who have been trained on firearms but
[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:14.580]  they won't let them go armed to protect themselves but the greatest irony is is
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:19.140]  that you'll find in my new book population control that the United States of
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:24.780]  America over the past couple of decades is the arms merchant of the world we
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:30.860]  provide 78% according to congressional records of all the arms sold to
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:35.460]  everybody around the world including of course the Isis and the Arcata and all
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:41.380]  the rest and half the global half the global spin expenditures just on us yes
[02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:47.060]  so we provide 78% of all the arms into people in the world and then we look at
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:52.980]  Russia and China Russia's 5% turn it China's 3% so we saw more arms in
[02:12:52.980 --> 02:12:57.140]  Russia and China combined all around the world and yet here in our own country
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:01.380]  they want to take guns away from everybody it's amazing aren't you a
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:07.540]  veteran yourself yes I was in the army during Vietnam what do you make of the
[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:13.140]  situation where we now know there they put 200 plus thousand veterans on don't
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:16.540]  treat lists and just say go die we've known for a year and they just keep
[02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:20.220]  doing it it seems like I thought if we exposed evil a lot of times that we get
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:23.900]  turned around back in your day or be when I was on there 20 years ago now the
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:28.300]  evil comes out the IRS persecutes people a thousand times times Nixon
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:32.940]  literally and don't get in trouble well hey come on look at it Alex the
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:37.860]  veterans are the most dangerous group to them because not only are veterans
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:46.020]  patriotic but veterans have weapons and know how to use them common sense you
[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:48.780]  brought it up I don't want to bring up a story I'm in it just shows the insanity
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:52.380]  we can put it on screen if they have it yesterday I remember two days ago salon
[02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:55.780]  that basically takes White House talking points and regurgitate some came out
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:59.100]  and said that the Planned Parenthood videos of hoax Planned Parenthood admits
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:02.700]  it's real and that I'm basically the bad guy that Margaret Sanger was not a
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:06.940]  racist there it is conspiracy theorist of hijacked the GOP what happens when
[02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:11.580]  Trump Cruz and Carson start following Alex Jones lead and goes the Planned
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:19.100]  Parenthood hoax is a case study and how we're deceptive they admit this it's not
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:25.900]  a hoax you know that well we're into we're into when Nostradamus the famous
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:31.100]  16th century seer said that we're gonna go in a time period when black is white
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:35.940]  and white is black up is down down is up and believe me that's that's where we
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:41.340]  are right peace is war well you've you've actually written a book that a lot of
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:44.460]  it was about Margaret Sanger and the Nazi influence in the U.S. right and
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:47.500]  we even have some slides in there some of it's in this book tell us about Margaret
[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:51.340]  Sanger since they say she was a loving person well yeah and I'm the racist you
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:56.260]  have to go back and understand about the eugenics this movement okay eugenics
[02:14:56.260 --> 02:15:00.260]  came up in the late 1800s and it was basically started right here in the
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:04.500]  United States in fact in California and was supported by some of the wealthiest
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:09.180]  biggest name people in country the Haramans the melons the Rockefellas and
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:16.220]  and eugenics is basically let's have the perfect race you know if you had the
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:20.500]  wrong skin color or the wrong bone structure or your IQ wasn't up to their
[02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:27.020]  standards by the 1930s most every state had sterilization laws okay and you
[02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:32.140]  could be sterilized involuntarily but what happened was is that the Germans
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:36.540]  got hold of that and said hey that's pretty good and the Nazis took power and
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:40.420]  they carried it to its logical extreme which as well we have some people like
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:45.500]  Jews and Gypsies that we think might dirty the gene pool so they just said
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:49.980]  we'll just kill them and had World War two and we had the Holocaust and the
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:53.260]  people in the world went wait a minute you know we can't just go around killing
[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:58.500]  people so today if you'll talk to these globalists they're all still very much
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:03.940]  eugenicists and they will say flat out in fact they have it etched in stone in
[02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:08.540]  Georgia at the Georgia Guidestones head Turner he says we want to maintain the
[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:13.480]  human population at 500 million that's a 90 plus percent reduction right which
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:16.420]  begs begs the question well wait a minute what's supposed to happen to the
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:20.540]  other seven billion of us and more importantly who's going to decide who
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:25.020]  stays and who goes and how are they going to get rid of us well the Nazis
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:29.180]  show that they're running in trouble if they try to just shoot people and hang
[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:33.740]  them and kill them so what they're doing is they are slowly thinning the human
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:41.140]  herd through bad food bad air bad water bad vaccines do you know the third
[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:46.500]  leading cause of death in America today after heart attacks and cancer is
[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:51.460]  conventional medical treatment I didn't know that I want to get into your book
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:55.460]  it's simply amazing and it's solution based to understand what to avoid and
[02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:59.900]  as long the line that I'm focusing on exposing the breakaway civilization is
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:05.300]  poisoning us so that they can basically just phase us out but they can and
[02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:08.660]  profit from it and profit while they do it that's the genius of these people
[02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:11.860]  they're not dumb and it's kind of an argument if we put up with it maybe we
[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:15.180]  deserve it but I wanted to ask you a selfless question because I grew up
[02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:19.180]  hearing how great Texas was and how we were the smartest the toughest the most
[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:22.820]  honorable blah blah blah Lord knows a lot of bad comes out of Texas too but now
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:27.740]  that I've studied history traveled the world I do know that Texas is certainly
[02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:31.580]  exceptional the military has always tried to recruit as much as a count of
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:36.820]  Texas saying they found in combat and operations Texans on average you make
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:41.300]  the best soldiers and then it's I notice it's Texans so much that are resisting
[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:45.060]  the New World Order but it was Texans that also killed Kennedy who also do
[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:49.460]  really nasty stuff so dark side and light side Texas seems to be a real
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:53.580]  crossroads and now Texas is opposing so much of the New World Order you're a
[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:57.960]  classic Texan go way back class you're a Texas you know just standard great
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:02.580]  Texas guy what do you think about Texas before we go to break well Texas is it
[02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:07.260]  I'm like you Alex I've traveled the world I've been to Tibet I've been to
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:11.420]  the Middle East I've been to Europe I've been to Canada been all over and
[02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:15.340]  there's some prettier places there's some very picturesque places but I've
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:20.980]  never found a place in the world that I think measures up to Texas Texas we've
[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:26.460]  got it all and we've got beaches we got mountains we got forest we got planes
[02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:32.660]  we got the people to this we go back to people yes and you go back to the people
[02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:36.980]  who broke away from Mexico and I'm not talking about the white settlers I'm
[02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:41.020]  talking about once again and the Hispanic people that lived here and I
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:45.700]  know I don't know at least in my life growing up in Texas everybody got along
[02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:49.300]  everything's good and you mentioned some of the bad stuff that came like
[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:54.660]  Kennedy okay let me tell you something some some of those people involved in
[02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:58.820]  some of the bad stuff we're not even truly Texans one of the things that's
[02:18:58.820 --> 02:19:03.020]  really griped me for years the fact that the Bush family they say well I'm
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:07.500]  from Texas well they're Texas oil men no no no they came from Connecticut
[02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:12.220]  they're just Yankee carpet baggers and you're right Texas has always had a
[02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:17.900]  military history that we should be proud of I know during the late great war
[02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:21.460]  between the states it was Robert E. Lee one of the most famous generals in the
[02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:25.940]  world he said when the going gets tough I call them my Texans and I
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:30.940]  unfortunately you know today we've all gotten fat and soft and and easy but I
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:34.380]  think it's time to buckle down and pay attention well I mean just look how much
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:37.940]  Texas is giving the globalist resistance yeah and then look at how the feds are

[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.780]  Jim Mars is our guest in the next segment I'm gonna ask him what the
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:21.460]  globalist in-game is and does he agree that he's got a weird feeling like
[02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:24.940]  everybody else does and that things are coming to a head but I haven't read your
[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:28.620]  book yet I've scanned over it it looks like a page turner I'm gonna read it on
[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:34.420]  the airplane over to Spain next week but population control how corporate
[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:38.420]  owners are killing us Jim Mars best-selling author this is short
[02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:42.620]  segment long segment coming up what do you want to tackle first about the
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:47.140]  premeditated plan to kill us and make money off doing it well I think the key
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:51.580]  thing here is you got to understand and I use quotes from many people in a
[02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:55.700]  chart though at their activities we got a short segment here so I'll just put it
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:59.700]  in a nutshell take your time as we go to the next that this is our area this ties
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:04.540]  into everything issue that you deal with Alex and all the people who follow you
[02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:11.820]  this has gone beyond politics this has gone beyond philosophy or debate this is
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:18.420]  self-defense these people want you dead and they're working at it and if you
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:22.260]  care anything about safety and well-being of your family your loved
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:26.980]  ones you better read my book you better study better listen to Alex and you
[02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:31.100]  better find out what they're doing to you so that you can have a countermeasure
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:34.500]  so you've researched it deeply and that's I mean they're just open it's like
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:38.740]  Bayer knowingly putting HIV for 10 years in hemophilia X blood product and then
[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:42.460]  it came out they knew it and liked it well let me quote from Prince Philip a
[02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:47.700]  leading globalist okay the head of the Windsor's over there in England he says
[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:53.820]  if I'm it reincarnated I would like to come back as a deadly virus to help
[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:58.020]  solve the overpopulation problem that's right in other words he wants to kill us
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:04.700]  now how about he goes first yeah that's what I say let him take the first step
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:09.660]  but it but here's the whole thing it's all based on the phony premise all these
[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:14.740]  globalists you Bill Gates you know Warren Buffett in turn water money you
[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:17.940]  listen to any of them they'll tell you that the overriding problem in the
[02:26:17.940 --> 02:26:22.580]  world today is overpopulation too many people okay now if you live in a big
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:26.100]  city and you have to put up with the noise the traffic pollution it's pretty
[02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:29.660]  easy to fall into that yeah there's just too many people using up all the
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:35.940]  resources but if you look at it coolly and logically and let's look right now
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:41.100]  today in Hong Kong the average living space is 1,700 square feet hey if you
[02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:45.500]  have an apartment 17 our square feet that's pretty decent size it's bigger
[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:51.580]  than most apartments I lived in and based on 1700 square feet the entire 7.5
[02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:56.460]  billion population in the world could live comfortably enough just in the
[02:26:56.460 --> 02:27:02.140]  state of Texas that's true and I've seen those statistics but the West is dying
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:05.940]  and has a problem we're having 1.3 children on average for two adults you
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:09.780]  gotta have 2.1 to even replace and take care of the folks or economies collapse
[02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:14.380]  we know this the third world is growing fast they have dirty technologies it is
[02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:17.460]  causing some problems but they're suppressing as you know you've written
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:20.580]  books on it a lot of advanced technologies that would have taken us out
[02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:25.060]  of this right none the none the least of which would be to pursue and move on
[02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:30.300]  into space as we heard about when we were kids that's humans need a goal yeah
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:33.460]  we're go the moon we're gonna have a mine minerals it'll pay for the space
[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:37.780]  problem we're go have colonies on Mars and we keep going but then you'd have to
[02:27:37.780 --> 02:27:42.660]  be a fan of humanity and not write us off that's right and and it's hard
[02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:48.060]  enough to control this world it must less if you go into others you wanted to
[02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:51.340]  get into glyphosate I said what's the most important thing in your book and
[02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:57.180]  you said glyphosates glyphosate even even the world health organization now
[02:27:57.180 --> 02:28:02.020]  has admitted that glyphosate is a carcinogenic it can cause cancer but
[02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:07.060]  what I'd like to point out is that they've showed that the rise of glyphosate
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:13.140]  use which is the major ingredient of Roundup which is the Monsanto herbicide
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:19.140]  which they are putting now on all of our important food crops soy corn wheat and
[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:25.860]  you can draw a parallel rise between the rise of the use of glyphosate and the
[02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:32.060]  rise of autism in children which has just gone out that's shocking I'm no
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:37.140]  chemist but you mean lots of weed poison hundreds of billions of tons being
[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:40.780]  used a year four hundred billion tons a year now being used in every water
[02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:46.780]  table we'd weed killer might not be good for our brains well Jay poison and
[02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:51.420]  you know it's well that's a conspiracy theory but now I tell you want some
[02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:57.940]  shocking Dr. Stephanie Synod a MIT research scientist who says that there
[02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:02.860]  is a definite link between glyphosate and autism definitely the crap snakes
[02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:08.980]  yeah and she says that about 2025 it's just ten years from now she said at
[02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:15.100]  current rates every other child yep will be autistic well I think that's that's
[02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:18.540]  a good good I mean thank you new world order yeah well and from their
[02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:22.420]  standpoint that's pretty good because hey it'd be easy my love that's only ten
[02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:27.500]  years away I know and then half the new kids will be retarded yep and they're
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:30.620]  like oh don't use the word retarded but it's okay to kill him it's okay to brain
[02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:33.180]  damage them just use the politically correct term okay let me be correct
[02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:38.900]  they're going to be seriously mentally disabled right now can we talk about but
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:44.140]  it's okay I mean it's okay because they'll vote Democrat oh boy you're
[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:49.500]  something else Jim Mars is our guest stay with us we're on the March the

[02:30:24.980 --> 02:30:30.060]  red SUV while four illegals frantically toss huge packs of what are almost
[02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:34.900]  certainly drugs into the back of car those men flee back to wars Mexico while
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:39.660]  the vehicle drives off into America Mexican drug cartels make up to 29
[02:30:39.660 --> 02:30:44.300]  billion dollars annually from US drug sales and the footage illustrates how
[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:48.620]  easy it would be for terrorists to bring militants weapons and explosives into

[02:33:16.580 --> 02:33:21.540]  Jim Mars is gonna host the show I told everybody that for about six years I've
[02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:25.820]  been doing the show 20 it's been syndicated for 18 and a half but for
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:30.020]  about 18 plus years I've been on from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and for about five years
[02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:34.940]  six years about five and a half years I did a fourth hour but when I started
[02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:37.380]  doing the nightly news and getting a lot of crew members under me and have a lot
[02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:41.540]  of administrative stuff and research stuff I shifted and stopped doing the
[02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:44.460]  fourth hour because it was just killing me I mean I literally had to go take a
[02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:48.660]  nap for like an hour afterwards three hours kills me too I think it's the
[02:33:48.660 --> 02:33:51.300]  bright lights or whatever when I do it the show at home every once in a while
[02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:55.820]  it's dark I just feel great when I go forever it is I'm actually thinking
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:58.820]  about sometimes just doing the show from home and having anchors in here that
[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:01.900]  are covering news just because people say that sometimes when it's not even
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:05.900]  video they say man shows even better when it's just old-fashioned radio maybe a
[02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:09.300]  day a week or something I'm gonna start doing that in the future but long story
[02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:17.100]  short absolutely but long story short Jim Mars is going to be hosting 30
[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:21.780]  minutes of the next hour by himself in here he's a great guy smart guy he can
[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:25.060]  do the whole fourth hour if he wants because a lot of stations want that
[02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:29.100]  fourth hour we are going to start having it be a guest host hour I'll host it a
[02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:32.220]  lot of times as well we'll have roundtable discussions it'll be a news
[02:34:32.220 --> 02:34:36.820]  hour it'll be really something special every day that fourth hour we're
[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:39.820]  bringing it back and some stations never turned it off when I quit doing the
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:43.780]  four hours two years ago a lot of stations still carry it so Jim Mars will
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:48.820]  be doing as much of the as much of the fourth hour as he wants I predict you
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:53.180]  want to do the whole thing cupcake so so so that's coming up and if you want

[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:36.780]  buddy best-selling authors here the new book population control this is a book
[02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:40.860]  I can really get behind you've had a lot of other amazing books but I kind of
[02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:44.340]  know about JFK because I read your book 25 years ago and you can write a book
[02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:47.540]  about the rise of the Nazis and how the fourth Reich's connected to us and I
[02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:50.940]  kind of know that a lot of folks don't this new book I was reading through it
[02:38:50.940 --> 02:38:55.060]  got a lot of stuff I didn't know and it really puts it all together for the case
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:59.100]  we ought to sell this ourselves we don't yet we saw a lot of your books and
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:03.260]  dovetail it with in game because my film in game covers a lot of this as well
[02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:07.380]  that they're in game is takeover shut off the resources and kill everybody so
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:10.340]  Jim Mars people can go to your website and also get the book give me your
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:17.340]  website website oddly enough is jimmars.com J.I.M. M.A. R.R.S. to ours and
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:22.820]  Mars a good Scottish name I correct you are you can you do a Scottish accent for
[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:36.780]  me I think I lost my Scottish accent you look like a Scottish guy though yeah it's
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:42.420]  true did you hear where there's a famous pub in Scotland and the managers
[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:47.420]  announced they have a new policy that they're making the waiters wear pants
[02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:52.460]  because this is true really because too many women were coming in and trying to
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:58.500]  pull up their kilts to see what they were wearing and they said that at first
[02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:03.260]  it was funny he said I hear women go after this yeah that's right
[02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:08.980]  there's nothing feminine about it I mean it's comfortable manly kilts absolutely
[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:13.740]  and then I could wear a kilt and then be on TV and get a courage award like
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:23.460]  Caitlyn Jenner at ESPN because you feel like it that you're a third gender wait
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:26.140]  a minute I'm gonna go to you a minute can we pull up that I've announced I've
[02:40:26.140 --> 02:40:30.660]  come out of the closet can you guys pull it up other videos Alex Jones comes
[02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:36.460]  out of the closet I've come out of the closet but but not that I'm a woman or
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:41.380]  not that I'm gay but that not that I'm a space alien or a blood-drinking lizard
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:47.900]  from the planet Pop-Tart no I've come out we have the video ready yeah yeah we're
[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:50.940]  gonna pull it up I mean it's in the system I know I just sprung it on you
[02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:55.740]  the videos on info wars.com Alex Jones has now come out of the closet while
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:59.860]  they're finding out what do you think this obsession with this stuff is is it
[02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:03.500]  about diverting from the fact that we're all losing our basic rights so the new
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:10.900]  right is that women can be standing up I don't know it's to me it's proof of the
[02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:15.860]  psychological problem that they've noticed with rats you know you put a few
[02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:20.340]  rats in a cage they get along just fine you put too many rats in a cage they
[02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:24.660]  start going nuts and they turn on each other and I think maybe that's it there's
[02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:28.940]  too many people crammed together and and so people don't like to have a future
[02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:32.060]  they don't feel like they can be creative used to you wanted to explore you
[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:35.660]  wanted to invent you want to build you wanted to have art now it's I'm gonna
[02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:39.540]  have green-arm hair that shows that I'm mad at men I'm gonna be standing up I'm
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:42.940]  in a lot joking they have serious shows going women are pinging standing up this
[02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:47.740]  is the true feminism and it's just like what it's like it's just stupid well I
[02:41:47.740 --> 02:41:55.740]  don't care like Bruce Jenner can call himself anything he wants to but when
[02:41:55.740 --> 02:42:00.820]  it comes down to biologically he's a man and I'm did you see what they said on
[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:04.340]  seeing in that one of the co-hosts said I'll put you in a hospital if you say
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:09.820]  that again mm-hmm oh yeah yeah there that's a that's tolerance that's the
[02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:14.340]  left the leftist in the crazies they they practice tolerance and if you don't
[02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:17.340]  want tolerance they'll beat the crap out of you and put you in the hospital and
[02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:20.820]  you know I think of you as a classical liberal you're for drug decriminalization
[02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:25.100]  you're for alternative energy I mean liberals you know really you really like
[02:42:25.100 --> 02:42:29.380]  you but you're not a fascist I mean you're not wanting to arrest me it's not
[02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:33.460]  that we care of some guy wants to be a woman I don't want to pay for it no I
[02:42:33.460 --> 02:42:37.300]  not differ with you I don't I've never thought of myself as a liberal I think
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:40.940]  of myself more as a conservative but what I meant like a classical liberal like
[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:44.220]  Thomas Jefferson well that's it it's like if you're conservative what is it
[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:49.620]  that you want to conserve too many so-called conservatives today particularly
[02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:54.660]  the rhinos you know they want to conserve the status quo and that's not me what I
[02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:59.620]  want to conserve is the Constitution the Bill of Rights and the idea of freedom
[02:42:59.620 --> 02:43:04.020]  private property do what you want property and equality you know I you know
[02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:07.940]  doing the when the civil rights thing came around and I stopped and thought
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:11.780]  about it and I was a good ol redneck southern Texas boy but I thought you
[02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:15.260]  know they got a point why should somebody be discriminated against because
[02:43:15.260 --> 02:43:18.780]  the color of their skin I said I'm backing off I'm gonna you know I'm not
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:22.700]  gonna I'm gonna help them out of whatever let's all just be equal but you
[02:43:22.700 --> 02:43:29.060]  know it's it's not even equal anymore now it's reverse racism and people just
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:33.340]  don't get it because you know I think everybody if I say I'm gonna vote for
[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:39.940]  this person because he's black okay well you know that's just as much racism as
[02:43:39.940 --> 02:43:43.820]  to say I'm gonna vote against I would vote for a black Ron Paul and it would
[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:47.340]  even think what color they were right I could literally are a woman they're
[02:43:47.340 --> 02:43:50.580]  gonna make if we don't want Hillary that we're against women well no no no see
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:54.780]  I'm that same way I I have no problem at all with the woman in the White House I
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:58.860]  just not Hillary because I don't think she qualifies well yeah because she
[02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:03.860]  probably actually is a man in drug she's the reverse of Jenner well no
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:09.780]  actually she is Jenner generally speak I'm being sarcastic you know that you
[02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:13.500]  know they actually say that Michelle is it is a trainee yeah I heard that and I
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:17.940]  snicked that one off until I really looked at it seriously and she's got I
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:22.580]  think there's some question there you don't think that's like a cigar she's
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:27.460]  hiding her pants well it could be it could be she might just have a saggy
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:36.340]  panties I don't know I don't want to go there I'm still having trouble enough
[02:44:36.340 --> 02:44:41.300]  trying to tell people explain the problem of two planes knocking down
[02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:47.620]  three building maybe when they held chopo Jenner it shot off like a missile and
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:52.540]  blew up building seven yeah I mean I mean that makes as much sense okay I'm
[02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:56.180]  gonna stop right there it's a family show but this is what's in the news how
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:45:00.020]  do you not talk about it yeah I mean if they're just force-feeding all this
[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:06.100]  garbage we do have the video so this is my coming out I have become a dog a a
[02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:12.980]  bloodhound I am trans species and if you don't agree with it then you're a racist
[02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:18.420]  terrorist but if you love your dog Jenner is actually the real El Chapo the
[02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:22.180]  problem is he hasn't actually done the chopping so I say he's a fraud with me
[02:45:22.180 --> 02:45:27.140]  I've gone and I've had surgery and I've had these prosthesis ears added I am
[02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:33.060]  now choosing to be trans zoological I believe is the term I made it to be
[02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:36.340]  trans able to chop my arms and legs off and I'd be known as a biscuit and live
[02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:39.980]  in a box being care of and if you don't accept it you're hateful the fact if you
[02:45:39.980 --> 02:45:45.220]  don't adopt my lifestyle and wear dirty brown socks on your ears after you
[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:49.620]  work out you're a racist you're a homophobe you're an anti zoological
[02:45:49.620 --> 02:45:55.460]  fob you're a piece of filth so now I become my new self
[02:45:57.860 --> 02:46:02.900]  that's real actually you know I saw the latest conspiracy I think I sent it to
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:06.900]  Nico because what it's sad but all these schizophrenics and mentally ill people
[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:10.020]  that are now online they have a voice which is good everybody has a voice
[02:46:10.020 --> 02:46:13.580]  down here but now they don't just think I'm Bill Hicks they think Rush Limbaugh
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:21.060]  is wait for it Jim Morrison I mean that one is even better that was a good one
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:29.300]  Alex I've got a fire hydrant out there I want to introduce you to oh yeah you'll
[02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:33.460]  love it love it for so actually since I put those ears on I have been pinging on
[02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:38.860]  fire and it's my right to do it that's right it's my right I deserve a
[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:45.020]  courage award there it is Rush Limbaugh aka Jim Morrison was Bill Hicks aka Alex
[02:46:45.020 --> 02:46:51.260]  Jones influence to get on radio so that's how it's all connected I mean look
[02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:56.460]  at this and this is not sat down these people actually back it up back it up
[02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:05.340]  they actually on this video show side-by-side to say Rush Limbaugh's Jim Morrison
[02:47:05.340 --> 02:47:10.220]  they're so crazy yeah I know how silly can you be I mean everybody knows you're
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:17.060]  actually Karl Rove David Mendelssohn listen I did this video I said I was
[02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:20.060]  really a British thespian as a joke people think it's real now they're
[02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:25.020]  searching David Mendelssohn that's the thing they won't admit that Glyphosate
[02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:29.380]  is connected to brain damage and that one half of the kids in the country by
[02:47:29.380 --> 02:47:35.260]  2025 are gonna be brain damaged that's admitted in this epic the government
[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:38.820]  admits Florida's brain damaging us now right but no one will talk or they
[02:47:38.820 --> 02:47:41.540]  admit chemtrails are real no one will cover the real documents they just want
[02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:44.740]  to speculate and then that's how the media tries to discredit us you know I'm
[02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:48.740]  just trying to cover up I'm really I'm actually Jim Morrison I'm insulted I mean
[02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:52.500]  I like Bill Hicks at some levels but I think Jim Morrison as a musician was more
[02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:57.340]  interesting so actually I am Jim Morrison were you being accused of it
[02:47:57.340 --> 02:48:04.740]  you might as well go for it oh they're already connecting me says RJ Jim we'll
[02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:08.780]  be spawns of Satan together yes we're talking about us well you actually are
[02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:14.660]  you really Jim Morrison you have to do something with your hair all right I'm
[02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:18.980]  gonna stop start get into your book get into the more serious areas and then you
[02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:21.540]  know a lot of people don't have beer together that's a lot of fun that's right
[02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:24.780]  then we look up at seven hours this past hey that would be your fourth hour
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:29.420]  right there you just moved to a local pub and and sit around have few beers and
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:34.460]  then just talk honestly please don't give me that idea that's actually we've
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:38.300]  actually had that idea but I've pretty much quit drinking to lose weight and
[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:44.460]  so you know I only drink after six now and of course it's always six somewhere
[02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:47.460]  on the planet well maybe I'm being sarcastic I'm not a heavy drinker if you're
[02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:53.860]  drinking six maybe I didn't cut it down to two but I'd only drink at six I get
[02:48:53.860 --> 02:48:58.380]  it cut from six I only have two at two and three at three and four at four and
[02:48:58.380 --> 02:49:03.980]  five at five and six at six and well hey take me I don't drink anymore or any

[02:56:39.260 --> 02:56:43.020]  saying when you started doing this 50 years ago you've been around that long
[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:53.700]  you may actually be the real Gandalf no I'm Santa no I'm not actually that old but
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:58.140]  it's true when I started off and I'd be on radio shows or whatever and I'd try
[02:56:58.140 --> 02:57:01.540]  to tell people you know there's a clique of people trying to run the world and
[02:57:01.540 --> 02:57:05.580]  they're meeting secret societies and they're trying to set the agenda and
[02:57:05.580 --> 02:57:09.660]  they're trying to run everything and I'd get these calls coming in saying now how
[02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:13.260]  do you let this guy on the air you know this guy's a nut you know this guy's a
[02:57:13.260 --> 02:57:18.700]  conspiracy theorist this guy's a buff this guy's an idiot you know what the
[02:57:18.700 --> 02:57:23.860]  last ten years or so I don't get those calls anymore I'm sure those people may
[02:57:23.860 --> 02:57:28.380]  still be out there but they're keeping them to themselves you know he classified
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:31.940]  in congressional hearings many years ago that the CIA and the 60s started
[02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:35.820]  using that term the Clintons in their first presidential run it's been
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:39.420]  released by their library that they said anyone criticizing them call them a
[02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:48.900]  conspiracy theorist oh exactly no no it goes back to 1954 no no no 1967 I believe
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:54.180]  after the Kenny assassination and there was a document filed by the CIA's
[02:57:54.180 --> 02:57:59.380]  Division of Intelligence and went to all their bases and all their assets and if
[02:57:59.380 --> 02:58:03.300]  you know anything about Malkinburg media it went to the media and it said
[02:58:03.300 --> 02:58:06.780]  anybody that's questioning the basically anybody questions the government
[02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:11.020]  you call them a conspiracy theorist and that's why it's interesting I have a
[02:58:11.020 --> 02:58:16.860]  1940 dictionary and you go look up conspiracy and it says a plan that's
[02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:19.980]  all it was a plan so if we ever talk about bad people having plans in
[02:58:19.980 --> 02:58:23.900]  government or corporations it doesn't exist well everybody knows it does of
[02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:29.460]  course the our legal system puts people in jail every year have convicted of

[03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:37.940]  worry the fourth hour probably has about 500,000 people watching and listening
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:41.660]  not a couple million like the main show but not for long because after we start
[03:00:41.660 --> 03:00:45.340]  hosting the fourth hour it's gonna be huge so Jim without further ado you got

[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:51.660]  six minutes come back with 18 minutes and come back with five minutes and we
[03:00:51.660 --> 03:00:55.580]  got a loaded phone lines from folks all over the world want to talk to Jim Mars

[03:01:02.380 --> 03:01:07.420]  and he's not kidding I mean I came here to speak with my friend Alex and all
[03:01:07.420 --> 03:01:13.700]  of a sudden I'm it I don't know I guess he had to go make a bathroom run or
[03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:18.500]  something but it is interesting though and I'm I'm happy to be here because
[03:01:18.500 --> 03:01:23.460]  especially since we can take calls because I'm always interested to find out
[03:01:23.460 --> 03:01:28.140]  what people want to know about you know I'm always making these talks and I
[03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:32.660]  watch carefully to see how many people get up leave and and I'm gratified that
[03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:36.940]  very seldom do many get up leave so I guess they're interested in it but I
[03:01:36.940 --> 03:01:41.260]  never really know what they actually want to hear about so here we have some
[03:01:41.260 --> 03:01:46.580]  calls coming in but before we start taking the calls I want to plug for
[03:01:46.580 --> 03:01:52.900]  population control how corporate owners are killing us there's a ton of
[03:01:52.900 --> 03:01:56.700]  information in there and it's information that you really need to hear
[03:01:56.700 --> 03:02:02.860]  about about bad food bad air bad water let's talk about water for just a
[03:02:02.860 --> 03:02:07.540]  minute one of the things that's being really a contentious issue today is
[03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:13.620]  fracking and for those of you don't know what fracking is that's a short term
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:20.020]  for hydraulic fracturing and what they do is they pump water with about 40,000
[03:02:20.020 --> 03:02:28.420]  chemicals in it deep into underground to under high pressure so it'll crack the
[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:34.620]  earth and open up these strata down there in the deep underground and the
[03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:39.980]  idea is because so they can bring out more gas and oil and now this comes back
[03:02:39.980 --> 03:02:45.580]  to a little thing known as peak oil which I'm sure you've probably heard
[03:02:45.580 --> 03:02:50.460]  about if you don't understand it and this goes back to the 50s with a
[03:02:50.460 --> 03:02:57.020]  professor named Hubert who somehow determined that by the year 2000 we
[03:02:57.020 --> 03:03:01.460]  were gonna hit the peak of oil okay and that's only so much oil because there
[03:03:01.460 --> 03:03:05.340]  were so many dinosaurs that died and plants that fell over and got compressed
[03:03:05.340 --> 03:03:10.820]  under the layers of the earth for billions of years and created fossil
[03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:15.980]  fuels and that there's only so much of it there and when you get to a certain
[03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:21.060]  point it's gonna be gone and he said that point was gonna speak at the year
[03:03:21.060 --> 03:03:28.780]  2000 and that's it it's all over well folks that turns out to be another bogus
[03:03:28.780 --> 03:03:36.540]  theory okay in 2011-2012 oil and gas production we're at at higher rates than
[03:03:36.540 --> 03:03:40.740]  ever before but the key thing is this if somebody tries to tell you well no
[03:03:40.740 --> 03:03:44.660]  we're running out of petroleum we're running out of oil here's three words
[03:03:44.660 --> 03:03:51.980]  you throw back at them back in rock formation okay B-A-K-K-E-N the back in
[03:03:51.980 --> 03:03:58.100]  rock formation stretches up through Montana and the Dakotas and into Canada
[03:03:58.100 --> 03:04:04.900]  and it is a vast underground untapped source of petroleum and the experts have
[03:04:04.900 --> 03:04:11.460]  estimated that even at increased rates of consumption there's enough petroleum
[03:04:11.460 --> 03:04:19.500]  there to last us for 2,000 years holy cow so see there's there it is and
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:25.100]  there's no reason then to be pushing all of this
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:30.820]  fracking because there's plenty of oil untapped I also might mention those of
[03:04:30.820 --> 03:04:35.140]  you know your history know that beginning of the 20th century and I
[03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:41.940]  hear some music playing so we're all it's gonna say is early 20th century you
[03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:47.300]  had the teapot dome scandal about oil federal selling public oil
[03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:52.940]  privately and that's still going on we got a lot of oil more right after these

[03:08:25.540 --> 03:08:32.580]  your stand-in temporary host on the alex jones show today this is stuck with this
[03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:38.340]  last I mean please to have this last hour but before we continue talking
[03:08:38.340 --> 03:08:44.740]  about the oil or the lack thereof let's take a quick break to us for some
[03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:53.540]  breaking news from Infra wars reporter Joe Biggs Joe hey I actually got some
[03:08:53.540 --> 03:09:00.140]  information from a friend in Georgia now he his son lives in Tampa Florida he
[03:09:00.140 --> 03:09:05.820]  roommates with a recruiter at one of the local stations in that area and he has
[03:09:05.820 --> 03:09:09.780]  given us information saying that they have been told to evacuate now a Don
[03:09:09.780 --> 03:09:14.740]  Salazar and myself have both called numerous recruiting stations without
[03:09:14.740 --> 03:09:20.060]  any answers the phone will ring and or go to a recorded statement at that point
[03:09:20.060 --> 03:09:24.460]  now we have confirmed though we actually have a listener who has gone down to the
[03:09:24.460 --> 03:09:29.900]  numerous recruiting centers and Tampa has taken pictures of empty offices so
[03:09:29.900 --> 03:09:33.620]  this is happening due to a threat that they got for a shooter that could
[03:09:33.620 --> 03:09:38.380]  possibly happen now earlier in the week I spoke to a recruiter in South Austin
[03:09:38.380 --> 03:09:44.300]  who said that some of the offices in Las Vegas and Florida were getting threats
[03:09:44.300 --> 03:09:49.380]  of another attack now this comes a week after the shooting in Chattanooga that
[03:09:49.380 --> 03:09:54.620]  left numerous Marines and a Navy sailor dead so we've got to take this
[03:09:54.620 --> 03:09:59.000]  seriously and I want people in that area you know to be on watch and if you
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:03.740]  can if you know anybody in those areas call them make sure they're okay find
[03:10:03.740 --> 03:10:08.580]  out what's going on and send us some tips and just to add the point good job of
[03:10:08.580 --> 03:10:11.020]  the citizen reporters going out there being the eyes and the ears on the
[03:10:11.020 --> 03:10:14.580]  ground this is the human intelligence of the American people people the world
[03:10:14.580 --> 03:10:18.100]  that can outmaneuver the mainstream media and the rest of them they want to
[03:10:18.100 --> 03:10:20.940]  cover up what's happening these recruiting centers and show the real
[03:10:20.940 --> 03:10:24.220]  terrorism threat in this country they're obsessing still about two people dead in
[03:10:24.220 --> 03:10:27.580]  movie theater as if it's the end of the world and making it a big deal while
[03:10:27.580 --> 03:10:31.900]  ignoring five dead look all the deaths are important whether it's people in
[03:10:31.900 --> 03:10:35.780]  military facility or the recruiting center or folks in movie theater but
[03:10:35.780 --> 03:10:38.500]  they're doing this to demonize the American people other points we're
[03:10:38.500 --> 03:10:43.140]  gonna throw it back to Jim Mars but but great job for you and the team and a
[03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:46.860]  Don Salazar get these reports out and to that citizen reporter we're adding those
[03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:50.940]  photos I'm told right now confirming they're empty at those facilities so
[03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:54.060]  so they've abandoned their post they've been told to evacuate and run up the
[03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:57.820]  white flag by the traders in charge who won't let them be armed and on top of
[03:10:57.820 --> 03:11:01.180]  that they've already forced the Marine Corps recruiters to not wear their
[03:11:01.180 --> 03:11:05.220]  uniform and essentially wear civilian tire this is what we have to remember
[03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:13.780]  gun-free zones are kill zones that's absolutely correct thank you Joe thank
[03:11:13.780 --> 03:11:18.420]  you stay with it yeah I don't understand this is all I mean you have
[03:11:18.420 --> 03:11:22.420]  military men these are men if there's anyone who could be trusted with a
[03:11:22.420 --> 03:11:27.380]  firearm it would be a trained military man and yet these guys are saying oh no
[03:11:27.380 --> 03:11:33.340]  you can't take your gun and don't wear your uniform folks this is the well all
[03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:40.020]  I can think of is un-American and also back to our discussion that during the
[03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:48.020]  break here they brought me a copy of the newsweek from 1979 and in here it says
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:57.220]  why we must act now because it says 1979 we only have 8.7 years left of
[03:11:57.220 --> 03:12:02.140]  petroleum crude oil that's it we're gonna be out folks and we've heard that for so
[03:12:02.140 --> 03:12:06.620]  long and it's simply not true there's all everywhere plus we do need to wean
[03:12:06.620 --> 03:12:11.620]  ourselves off of oil because we're killing ourselves on oil pollution you
[03:12:11.620 --> 03:12:15.740]  know you realize and I'm sure Alex has brought this up that there's still
[03:12:15.740 --> 03:12:20.940]  spraying corrects it down in the Gulf of Mexico and the the Gulf is almost dead
[03:12:20.940 --> 03:12:25.140]  we you know we got problems with Fukushima and they're they're still
[03:12:25.140 --> 03:12:29.660]  admitting they can't stop that radiation leak in fact there is more and more
[03:12:29.660 --> 03:12:35.500]  evidence that the Pacific Ocean is having all kinds of problems because of
[03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:40.660]  this continuing radiation and what's our good government done about it well as
[03:12:40.660 --> 03:12:45.540]  I understand it they no longer monitor for radiation on the West Coast well how
[03:12:45.540 --> 03:12:51.140]  convenient now they don't have to tell us how badly they're radiating us so but
[03:12:51.140 --> 03:12:55.060]  back to the water situation before we go to the collars and I am interested in
[03:12:55.060 --> 03:13:01.660]  getting calls I want to explain that not only is the whole idea of fracking
[03:13:01.660 --> 03:13:09.700]  unnecessary because we do not need to find even more outlets for gas and oil
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:14.980]  so there's something else going on and what an increasing number of people
[03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:21.620]  believe is that this fracking is done for one major purpose and that is to to
[03:13:21.620 --> 03:13:28.980]  adulterate and to destroy our water tables okay and why would that why would
[03:13:28.980 --> 03:13:34.180]  that be who would want to destroy our water well right now today in the world
[03:13:34.180 --> 03:13:40.500]  there are about a handful of major corporations who are gaining control over
[03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:47.460]  the water supply we find in fact that water is so critical now in California
[03:13:47.460 --> 03:13:54.940]  that Governor Jerry Brown has announced water reduction with fans okay they
[03:13:54.940 --> 03:14:01.260]  possibly can find you up to $500 if you water your lawn and and what kills me is
[03:14:01.260 --> 03:14:06.780]  having been out there I know I was visiting in Palm Springs and we went
[03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:12.060]  to a golf course there such as the one you see here and it was beautiful I had
[03:14:12.060 --> 03:14:16.700]  sprinklers you know spraying and then I find out that in Palm Springs alone
[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:23.460]  there's 125 golf courses now here's 125 golf courses built in the California
[03:14:23.460 --> 03:14:28.380]  desert you know and that they all have to water and the greens and the fairways
[03:14:28.380 --> 03:14:33.300]  and then wonder why they don't have why they're running out of water it's
[03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:39.420]  ridiculous but then you also find that these wealthy families are investing
[03:14:39.420 --> 03:14:45.620]  in water because in fact the head of the Dow chemical was quoted as saying that
[03:14:45.620 --> 03:14:51.900]  water is the oil of the 21st century and you have a handful of corporations
[03:14:51.900 --> 03:14:58.700]  Nestle Coca-Cola Perrier who are gaining more and more control over the water now
[03:14:58.700 --> 03:15:04.900]  you know a person can go a few days without food and can still function but
[03:15:04.900 --> 03:15:10.620]  if you don't have water you're in real serious trouble and so then we look and
[03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:18.620]  we see that the this wealthy elite they are buying into the water industries
[03:15:18.620 --> 03:15:23.220]  Warren Buffett for example is heavily invested in water treatment and water
[03:15:23.220 --> 03:15:29.660]  filters t-bone pickings has bought up a property all up and down the oligolar
[03:15:29.660 --> 03:15:35.980]  aquifer which provides water for the bread basket in middle America but the
[03:15:35.980 --> 03:15:41.220]  one that really caught my attention was some years ago it was reported that the
[03:15:41.220 --> 03:15:49.260]  bush family had bought something like 300,000 acres in Paraguay all right and
[03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:55.580]  in knowing the background of the bushes in the pro-nazi stand of the patriarch
[03:15:55.580 --> 03:16:01.100]  Prescott Bush who was prosecuted during World War two for being a front man
[03:16:01.100 --> 03:16:06.100]  financial man for Hitler and the Nazis I thought maybe they were going to build a
[03:16:06.100 --> 03:16:10.660]  housing development call it Borman acres or something but come to find out
[03:16:10.660 --> 03:16:15.980]  the bush family and their 300 acres in Paraguay it just happens to sit over the
[03:16:15.980 --> 03:16:22.220]  Guarani aquifer one of the largest single bodies of ground water in the
[03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:26.980]  world so they're they're slowly but surely trying to gain control over the
[03:16:26.980 --> 03:16:31.540]  world's water supply now think what kind of power that would give someone you
[03:16:31.540 --> 03:16:35.980]  want to drink of water you pay what I say in fact and I've watched that just
[03:16:35.980 --> 03:16:41.260]  over my own lifetime when I was 13 I went to work in a grocery store sacking
[03:16:41.260 --> 03:16:46.420]  and then before long I'd work my way up and I was checking in fact I worked in
[03:16:46.420 --> 03:16:49.780]  the meat department I worked in the produce department I got a pretty good
[03:16:49.780 --> 03:16:55.340]  grocery education and if you had come to me at that point and said can you show
[03:16:55.340 --> 03:16:59.380]  me where the water is I would have pointed you to the water fountain or to
[03:16:59.380 --> 03:17:04.940]  the hose outside you turn on the faucet the water comes out nobody nobody was
[03:17:04.940 --> 03:17:10.100]  buying water you know that was considered a natural resource then it was
[03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:14.460]  belong to everybody but then over the course of my life I've seen all of a
[03:17:14.460 --> 03:17:19.780]  sudden there's being a section of the drink shelf where you've got bottled
[03:17:19.780 --> 03:17:28.100]  water and today you have an entire aisle full of water and and if they don't get
[03:17:28.100 --> 03:17:32.460]  you with the public water just be sure and read some of the labels on the
[03:17:32.460 --> 03:17:35.460]  bottle water because there are already some of the bottle water is being
[03:17:35.460 --> 03:17:40.420]  fluoridated and that's another thing I talk about in my book population control
[03:17:40.420 --> 03:17:45.780]  is that in the 1930s if you bought sodium fluoride it came in a can and
[03:17:45.780 --> 03:17:52.180]  marked poison but this is what this is what they're giving you today so the
[03:17:52.180 --> 03:17:57.780]  whole purpose of fracking I think is to wreck the water tables and you need to
[03:17:57.780 --> 03:18:02.260]  be aware of that and we need to start cleaning up our water supplies and we
[03:18:02.260 --> 03:18:10.060]  need to start caring about what we're doing because we're ruining one of the
[03:18:10.060 --> 03:18:17.500]  most basic necessities of life okay where are we we got a couple of minutes
[03:18:17.500 --> 03:18:23.620]  left if you'll notice I've been joined by the Queen Mother of England oh no I'm
[03:18:23.620 --> 03:18:36.460]  sorry it's my friend Gator I think I think Alex caught him the crawling
[03:18:36.460 --> 03:18:41.100]  around outside or something must be an infiltrator but he's been pretty
[03:18:41.100 --> 03:18:45.420]  passive for right now I think we got time maybe for one call can we get a
[03:18:45.420 --> 03:18:50.420]  call in here let's start with John and FEMA region five okay we got John and
[03:18:50.420 --> 03:18:55.940]  FEMA region five howdy John yeah how you doing Jim it's about time I got a
[03:18:55.940 --> 03:19:03.540]  chance to talk to you I've watched a lot of your videos from the contact at
[03:19:03.540 --> 03:19:08.540]  desert series and I go to you with the educational Ian I was wondering if you
[03:19:08.540 --> 03:19:15.020]  can explain the actual cycle of the new world order starting with Babylon and
[03:19:15.020 --> 03:19:21.540]  King but then a nether and how it grows through a crescendo and then crashes and
[03:19:21.540 --> 03:19:27.460]  goes underground and comes up different eras because I think if people start
[03:19:27.460 --> 03:19:34.020]  looking at it you see where it's coming from and where it's going okay now well
[03:19:34.020 --> 03:19:39.380]  let's see now I've got a minute or two and you want me to give the history of

[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:45.260]  Alex Jones and we just had a caller John who had asked you know how did the
[03:24:45.260 --> 03:24:51.300]  New World Order start and geez we could you know we could have three or four
[03:24:51.300 --> 03:24:56.540]  programs talking about that but let me point you to my book our occulted
[03:24:56.540 --> 03:25:03.180]  history and what you find is you go far back in even beyond our recorded history
[03:25:03.180 --> 03:25:10.140]  and there are legends and stories in every ancient tribe and peoples in the
[03:25:10.140 --> 03:25:19.660]  world from the Aborigines in Australia to the North American Indians to the
[03:25:19.660 --> 03:25:28.820]  Hindu Indians in the Vedas to the Bible Ezekiel in the wheel and to the some of
[03:25:28.820 --> 03:25:34.980]  the oldest writings in the world from the Sumer civilization that predated the
[03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:43.340]  Egyptians over in Mesopotamia and they all say the same thing that folks came
[03:25:43.340 --> 03:25:53.220]  from the sky and taught them various things language law mathematics garden
[03:25:53.220 --> 03:26:01.620]  farming agriculture and to my surprise even taught them how to make beer I am
[03:26:01.620 --> 03:26:08.020]  being a somewhat of a beer fanciennado I once tried to research it and find out
[03:26:08.020 --> 03:26:12.300]  well you know where's beer come from because after all it's easy to figure
[03:26:12.300 --> 03:26:16.860]  out how ancient man figured out wine you know you got some grapes that fell off
[03:26:16.860 --> 03:26:22.820]  the grape vine lay on the ground under a hot sun fermented the thirsty caveman
[03:26:22.820 --> 03:26:28.980]  came along says wow you try some of that and he says I and then he gets a buzz
[03:26:28.980 --> 03:26:35.060]  and he's going I really like that so now he's got wine but beer beer you have to
[03:26:35.060 --> 03:26:40.020]  have malts and hops and various things you know and and then you have to mix
[03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:42.980]  them in just right proportion and you have to add water and you have to have
[03:26:42.980 --> 03:26:47.420]  some sugar and then it's all got a firm in a certain amount of time I mean this
[03:26:47.420 --> 03:26:52.900]  is a it's a complicated formula I somebody figure all that out well
[03:26:52.900 --> 03:26:58.300]  according to these ancient tablets these cuneiform tablets left by these
[03:26:58.300 --> 03:27:04.740]  ancient Sumerians there the people that came from the sky their gods if you will
[03:27:04.740 --> 03:27:09.820]  taught them how to make beer and they had four different kinds of beer back in
[03:27:09.820 --> 03:27:16.780]  the ancient ancient world okay and something tells me one of one of those
[03:27:16.780 --> 03:27:22.060]  types was probably not like beer they probably had something else but the
[03:27:22.060 --> 03:27:26.940]  point is is that they all tell the story that there were these outsiders who came
[03:27:26.940 --> 03:27:33.300]  and set us on the course of civilization now these outsiders they didn't want to
[03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:40.140]  have to mix with the the raggle taggle humans so they created kingship they
[03:27:40.140 --> 03:27:46.820]  created interlopers they created a priest cast that would unit that would
[03:27:46.820 --> 03:27:52.580]  pass along and deal directly with the humans and over a period of time these
[03:27:52.580 --> 03:28:00.780]  gods dropped out of sight and the whole idea of people and their gods it turned
[03:28:00.780 --> 03:28:06.340]  into a metaphysical thing you didn't see God but we all know he's there and then
[03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:12.380]  the priest cast they were getting rich and powerful you know by representing God
[03:28:12.380 --> 03:28:17.220]  God told me to tell you here's how you're gonna live and they didn't want to give
[03:28:17.220 --> 03:28:22.100]  that up so they built a whole system of catechisms and theologies and the
[03:28:22.100 --> 03:28:28.100]  etc etc and so for the longest time all the way up to the middle ages the human
[03:28:28.100 --> 03:28:34.940]  humans were pretty much governed by religion okay but with the advent of the
[03:28:34.940 --> 03:28:45.620]  printing press and with science and with the the new turnover and the age of
[03:28:45.620 --> 03:28:54.500]  enlightenment the power of religion began to wane and they moved into finance
[03:28:54.500 --> 03:28:57.740]  going to break it a month I was here doing a great job are you gonna continue

[03:33:59.460 --> 03:34:05.460]  and I got I got totally off in the left field trying to explain about how the
[03:34:05.460 --> 03:34:11.340]  secret society started so I'll try to make this quick after they the key
[03:34:11.340 --> 03:34:15.820]  mechanisms for controlling humans have always been religion and then finance
[03:34:15.820 --> 03:34:21.100]  and today is mostly finance but if you've been keeping up with Alex if you've
[03:34:21.100 --> 03:34:24.940]  been keeping up with some of the other people the the financial situation is
[03:34:24.940 --> 03:34:31.900]  getting very shaky so keep an eye on that because you know I think we're
[03:34:31.900 --> 03:34:36.700]  coming up on a time period it's gonna make 2008 look like just a bump in the
[03:34:36.700 --> 03:34:42.940]  road let's move on and and find out from more colors have we got a caller I
[03:34:42.940 --> 03:34:49.900]  think Chuck in Arizona was next hey Chuck in Arizona are you there hi mr.

[03:34:57.900 --> 03:35:02.620]  let me let me introduce let me introduce Lee and I could do here I got
[03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:08.060]  thrown here in this in the hot seat with Alex Jones he likes to this is this is
[03:35:08.060 --> 03:35:14.260]  what this fourth hour is all about now surprises actually sees there so you
[03:35:14.260 --> 03:35:19.860]  have something good looking to look at you've got the nice voice okay Chuck what
[03:35:19.860 --> 03:35:28.620]  you got form will this be an overdrive form on YouTube I believe so yes okay
[03:35:28.620 --> 03:35:31.540]  okay cool because that's the only way I get to watch you guys and listen to you
[03:35:31.540 --> 03:35:36.700]  guys so real quick I want to make four points first one most important I think
[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:41.100]  we need to have a push for national sovereignty every citizen needs to become
[03:35:41.100 --> 03:35:46.540]  a sovereign citizen if you do this it binds you to the Constitution which is
[03:35:46.540 --> 03:35:52.140]  the law of the land this in turn will hold the police's feet to the fire and
[03:35:52.140 --> 03:35:56.580]  make them act properly to make the judicial system work the way that it's
[03:35:56.580 --> 03:36:01.780]  supposed to work now if you do that we've always been told all problems
[03:36:01.780 --> 03:36:06.540]  start at home if we start at the base program and we work our way up through
[03:36:06.540 --> 03:36:10.620]  the judicial system we can further work our way up into politics to make these
[03:36:10.620 --> 03:36:17.940]  politicians act like they are supposed to act because they work for us okay so
[03:36:17.940 --> 03:36:23.100]  Chuck you say that we are we need to become sovereign citizens and we need
[03:36:23.100 --> 03:36:27.900]  to vote on representatives who will actually represent us and if they don't
[03:36:27.900 --> 03:36:32.540]  then we need to vote them out and start all over again and might I point out
[03:36:32.540 --> 03:36:37.340]  that that's not a radical idea I tell you this is the way it's supposed to be
[03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:43.580]  okay but it's gotten away from us and so what you're saying is not totally agree
[03:36:43.580 --> 03:36:48.380]  is that we need to go back to basics which is we are all sovereign citizens
[03:36:48.380 --> 03:36:52.980]  and we're all operating together and I also hear you about starting at a local
[03:36:52.980 --> 03:36:58.140]  level this is most important I'm pretty much giving up on the federal level of
[03:36:58.140 --> 03:37:04.060]  the federal Washington is so corrupt so bought and paid for that I think it's
[03:37:04.060 --> 03:37:08.180]  gonna be near impossible to try to actually just change it around what we
[03:37:08.180 --> 03:37:12.940]  can do is go to the local level get on the school board get on the city
[03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:16.540]  council get on the county commissioners and then when the feds come along and
[03:37:16.540 --> 03:37:21.660]  say okay here's what you're gonna do just say no right Leigh Ann well that's
[03:37:21.660 --> 03:37:25.220]  what we'd like to do but I mean here we've got the federal government just
[03:37:25.220 --> 03:37:30.060]  passing what the house is voting on that safe and accurate food labeling act and
[03:37:30.060 --> 03:37:34.020]  they don't care that the states want safe labeling they don't want care that
[03:37:34.020 --> 03:37:38.260]  the states you know want GMO foods labeled well that's it they ride rough
[03:37:38.260 --> 03:37:43.260]  shot over us on everything and it's not not necessarily always the feds up
[03:37:43.260 --> 03:37:48.300]  there near where I live in Denton County some thoughtful people got together and
[03:37:48.300 --> 03:37:52.460]  they actually passed an ordinance saying they could not do any fracking in Denton
[03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:57.380]  County and what happens governor Abbott of the state of Texas rams through a law
[03:37:57.380 --> 03:38:02.300]  that says you can't pass laws in locally that prevents business from doing
[03:38:02.300 --> 03:38:07.380]  things you know what about freedom in democracy is he not heard about right or
[03:38:07.380 --> 03:38:11.100]  we got a Chris Christie saying if he becomes president he's going to treat
[03:38:11.100 --> 03:38:16.700]  all of the diseased pot smokers with some federal law enforcement there I
[03:38:16.700 --> 03:38:20.420]  mean just totally bypassing the fact that states have voted on this that
[03:38:20.420 --> 03:38:25.180]  medicinal marijuana they're okay with it so that's right and by the way you can
[03:38:25.180 --> 03:38:29.100]  read about that my new book population control because I kept a close eye on
[03:38:29.100 --> 03:38:33.500]  Washington state and on Colorado where they have legalized not only medical
[03:38:33.500 --> 03:38:38.620]  marijuana but recreational marijuana and you know what guess what their taxes
[03:38:38.620 --> 03:38:44.620]  have the tax income you know their profits have gone sky high their traffic
[03:38:44.620 --> 03:38:50.900]  facilities have dropped crime has dropped it's obviously only the reasonable
[03:38:50.900 --> 03:38:53.740]  prudent thing to do
[03:38:53.740 --> 03:39:01.060]  yeah let's go to the next caller who we got we've got mark in California calling
[03:39:01.060 --> 03:39:08.100]  from KOMY 1340 a.m. he'd like to discuss the Franklin cover-up oh boy okay mark
[03:39:08.100 --> 03:39:13.420]  what have you got for us well I have Doug Malar for you he's worked with a
[03:39:13.420 --> 03:39:20.620]  senator for 25 years and there's only about 10 real heroes and Doug Malar is
[03:39:20.620 --> 03:39:25.820]  one of them he he's like 77 he got arrested up there in bohemian grove and
[03:39:25.820 --> 03:39:31.460]  the guy Doug Malar is just a wealth of information and if you or Alex would
[03:39:31.460 --> 03:39:37.660]  like to interview him he is available okay all right we can have get his
[03:39:37.660 --> 03:39:42.180]  information from you after we get off the air there you go yeah we're we're
[03:39:42.180 --> 03:39:45.740]  looking into anything and everything and if this has to do with the Franklin
[03:39:45.740 --> 03:39:50.180]  cover-up I might point out that this is a huge scandal going on in the UK right
[03:39:50.180 --> 03:39:56.580]  now about child pornography and child abuse and they they are trying to keep
[03:39:56.580 --> 03:40:01.900]  this as quiet as possible but it needs to spread over here because they're going
[03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:06.620]  back to the Franklin cover-up into all of these allegations that some of the
[03:40:06.620 --> 03:40:11.740]  most powerful people in this country are involved in child abuse and child
[03:40:11.740 --> 03:40:16.300]  pornography this is this is serious enough we need to start dealing with
[03:40:16.300 --> 03:40:21.380]  that too absolutely it goes all the way to the top okay do we have another
[03:40:21.380 --> 03:40:26.260]  caller let's go to Dwayne in Wisconsin he'd like to discuss population control
[03:40:26.260 --> 03:40:31.740]  oh population control that's my new book let's discuss that what's on your mind
[03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:37.460]  Dwayne thank you mr. Mars out real pleasure to have you host in the show
[03:40:37.460 --> 03:40:43.140]  also with Leanne yeah I thought it was only fitting to title my my whole
[03:40:43.140 --> 03:40:48.420]  segment here a population control as as your new book is aptly titled just a
[03:40:48.420 --> 03:40:54.220]  couple quick things I just wanted to run through a few things real quick kind of
[03:40:54.220 --> 03:40:57.980]  rapid fire and then you can give me your commentary on it you know it's pretty
[03:40:57.980 --> 03:41:02.500]  clear our second amendment is shifted from the right to protect yourself from
[03:41:02.500 --> 03:41:07.500]  individuals in government to a means of destroying the Constitution you know it's
[03:41:07.500 --> 03:41:11.060]  just like being politically correct you know brainwashed people think it's about
[03:41:11.060 --> 03:41:14.500]  respect for others and you're not hurting people's feelings but it really
[03:41:14.500 --> 03:41:18.860]  truthfully has a lot more to do with restricting our free expression of
[03:41:18.860 --> 03:41:22.780]  thoughts and killing the first amendment I mean this is a hypothetical question but
[03:41:22.780 --> 03:41:27.440]  how offended would the general public be if the humane society was caught
[03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:31.860]  harvesting kitten and puppy fetuses and selling the parts for profit I see a
[03:41:31.860 --> 03:41:35.700]  lot more posts on Facebook about caring for animals and adopting them than I
[03:41:35.700 --> 03:41:40.780]  ever do about prenatal care for unborn children and adopting kids now it comes
[03:41:40.780 --> 03:41:47.060]  down to this indoctrination you know to rampant implementation of thousands of
[03:41:47.060 --> 03:41:50.620]  sustainable development policies sustainable development which of course
[03:41:50.620 --> 03:41:56.460]  is new speak for agenda 21 that agenda 21 which salon dot com likes to call an
[03:41:56.460 --> 03:42:02.340]  Alex Jones construct well if agenda 21 is the Alex Jones construct why is it
[03:42:02.340 --> 03:42:09.180]  cited by name in our federal register volume 63 number 163 Monday August 24th
[03:42:09.180 --> 03:42:15.540]  1998 under linkages to other initiatives is that evidence and proof of
[03:42:15.540 --> 03:42:20.460]  conspiracy yeah you've been doing your homework how dare you hit them with facts
[03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:28.340]  right by the way it it's really incredible and to me over the years all
[03:42:28.340 --> 03:42:35.500]  of this our argument over birth control and particularly over abortion what I
[03:42:35.500 --> 03:42:41.620]  find interesting is that most of the anti-abortion people who number one I
[03:42:41.620 --> 03:42:45.740]  feel like their heart is probably in the right place but where's their mind they
[03:42:45.740 --> 03:42:51.300]  seem very concerned about these unborn babies and yet when these kids are born
[03:42:51.300 --> 03:42:56.100]  in the third world countries and in China and in Iran and Iraq and in
[03:42:56.100 --> 03:43:00.540]  Afghanistan and in our own country they don't seem to care about the ones who
[03:43:00.540 --> 03:43:05.700]  are already living and breathing you know they there in fact the big economy
[03:43:05.700 --> 03:43:10.580]  is is it I think you'll find that most people who are anti-abortion are pro
[03:43:10.580 --> 03:43:15.300]  death penalty yeah so you know let's let's save the babies but then if they
[03:43:15.300 --> 03:43:20.300]  turn out bad well we'll execute them right we have the black lives matter
[03:43:20.300 --> 03:43:24.780]  protesters out there who were offended that we were daring to point out how
[03:43:24.780 --> 03:43:29.980]  many black babies are aborted by Planned Parenthood every year and she one of them
[03:43:29.980 --> 03:43:34.700]  actually said I kill my kids so you're absolutely right about that I mean and
[03:43:34.700 --> 03:43:38.740]  and actually they're not allowed to be called babies or fetuses or anything
[03:43:38.740 --> 03:43:49.100]  they're called products of conception that's that's the Nazis did that they
[03:43:49.100 --> 03:43:55.300]  call it retroactive birth control but you know speaking of okay here I gotta
[03:43:55.300 --> 03:44:00.700]  tell you my down abortion that is a true controversy and I call it a true
[03:44:00.700 --> 03:44:05.100]  controversy because I think there are equal numbers of thoughtful caring
[03:44:05.100 --> 03:44:11.160]  educated knowledgeable people who simply cannot agree okay on when life starts and
[03:44:11.160 --> 03:44:17.300]  how important blah blah blah okay so why is there any problem freedom anybody
[03:44:17.300 --> 03:44:22.900]  ever heard that term freedom you're free not to have an abortion you're free to
[03:44:22.900 --> 03:44:27.420]  have an abortion nobody can make somebody do something else it'd be up to the
[03:44:27.420 --> 03:44:32.820]  the woman to her doctor to her family when the censorship begins oh but
[03:44:32.820 --> 03:44:41.860]  that's not politically correct oh I'm sorry I get a lot of people it is about
[03:44:41.860 --> 03:44:44.980]  having child they can't take care of what they got raped or or they were doing
[03:44:44.980 --> 03:44:48.500]  drugs and her friends can be brain damaged well there's medical issues the
[03:44:48.500 --> 03:44:52.020]  whole point is what's driving and promoting it though is the eugenics based
[03:44:52.020 --> 03:44:56.300]  system yes and so I don't want to hear about how you know cops kill you know
[03:44:56.300 --> 03:44:59.300]  however many black people probably hear it's not even a hundred and it's terrible
[03:44:59.300 --> 03:45:01.740]  some of its wrongs sometimes you know they're in the wrong sometimes the cops
[03:45:01.740 --> 03:45:05.220]  from the wrong about these lives matter when then the blacks are being targeted
[03:45:05.220 --> 03:45:08.820]  for extermination you know with the whole Margaret Sangerdill so that's my
[03:45:08.820 --> 03:45:12.700]  angle separating those two they make the whole compendium and the taxpayer
[03:45:12.700 --> 03:45:18.660]  funding of Planned Parenthood about you know a woman's choice well then fine
[03:45:18.660 --> 03:45:22.100]  don't make me pay for it you know there's so many layers to this then it's
[03:45:22.100 --> 03:45:24.660]  not a federal issue my hair is even sticking up even though I'd be in here
[03:45:24.660 --> 03:45:28.100]  both of both of them
[03:45:32.100 --> 03:45:34.620]  oh my god you like the new show
[03:45:34.620 --> 03:45:41.140]  hey but can you put this the slide on with Margaret Sangerdill and Hillary
[03:45:41.140 --> 03:45:46.340]  Clinton that's a hoax Salon says it's a hoax she's not a hoax
[03:45:46.340 --> 03:45:53.260]  she loves the babies yet no break it's a hoax yeah there we go Margaret Sangerdill
[03:45:53.260 --> 03:45:58.140]  the founder of Planned Parenthood says colored people are like human weeds and
[03:45:58.140 --> 03:46:03.500]  need to be exterminated and we find Hillary Clinton is a big supporter I
[03:46:03.500 --> 03:46:09.140]  admire Margaret Sanger enormously her courage her tenacity her vision so I
[03:46:09.140 --> 03:46:18.100]  guess Hillary has that same vision Gator man here Gator me baby
[03:46:18.100 --> 03:46:21.660]  Hillary Clinton's a guest of the show isn't from the dead
[03:46:21.660 --> 03:46:25.980]  feed me see more what are you racist against alligators you're afraid to have
[03:46:25.980 --> 03:46:33.020]  our first alligator president a trans alligator gender change you like the
[03:46:33.020 --> 03:46:41.100]  fourth hour crazy fourth hour I'll tell you come on let's go who is Dwayne still
[03:46:41.100 --> 03:46:46.380]  on the line Dwayne is no longer on the line okay who we got next next we have
[03:46:46.380 --> 03:46:51.620]  Robert in California he'd like to discuss global elite mental illness global
[03:46:51.620 --> 03:46:56.660]  elite middle yeah that's true years of inbreeding will do that too that's
[03:46:56.660 --> 03:47:00.700]  exactly right that's what happens when you go to those Bohemian Grove meetings
[03:47:00.700 --> 03:47:07.260]  okay Robert out in California you're probably hot and dry out there tell us
[03:47:07.260 --> 03:47:13.380]  what's on your mind yeah all the Kim trolls are just drying up all that water
[03:47:13.380 --> 03:47:18.700]  Jim Leanne and Alex Jones in the background this my question is this
[03:47:18.700 --> 03:47:24.580]  with all of our elites being crazy and wanting to kill us and obviously our
[03:47:24.580 --> 03:47:30.460]  representatives are not representing us and their mentality they're they're
[03:47:30.460 --> 03:47:36.900]  unstable now being very questionable about that why are we playing footsies
[03:47:36.900 --> 03:47:42.780]  with crazy people well basically because they have their hands on the purse
[03:47:42.780 --> 03:47:48.220]  strings but you're absolutely right and that's why that's why we need to get
[03:47:48.220 --> 03:47:53.620]  those people to step down and we need to do something different and like I said
[03:47:53.620 --> 03:47:57.340]  earlier I'm not sure we're going to be able to do very much at the national
[03:47:57.340 --> 03:48:04.060]  level but locally you can see that you people who think the same way you do
[03:48:04.060 --> 03:48:08.340]  people who know the same things you do get into office and start taking the
[03:48:08.340 --> 03:48:12.420]  steps necessary to straighten things up in other words you pack your city
[03:48:12.420 --> 03:48:17.540]  council with knowledgeable people who care about the health and safety of your
[03:48:17.540 --> 03:48:21.460]  community and they're going to take a hard look at fluoridation and probably
[03:48:21.460 --> 03:48:26.580]  decide not to quit fluoridate in the water and involuntarily medicating you
[03:48:26.580 --> 03:48:30.820]  right or even like we have our governor here in Texas who stood up with this
[03:48:30.820 --> 03:48:34.740]  jade helm exercise and said well my constituents are concerned so I'm gonna
[03:48:34.740 --> 03:48:38.300]  go ahead and just make sure the National Guard keeps their eye on them make sure
[03:48:38.300 --> 03:48:43.420]  they're not violating their exactly and the what really shocked me we're not
[03:48:43.420 --> 03:48:47.980]  really considering the political correctness idiocy that's going on but
[03:48:47.980 --> 03:48:52.660]  the reaction of people in the mass media and in the other parts of the
[03:48:52.660 --> 03:48:57.620]  country acted like some big terrible thing was going on all it all governor
[03:48:57.620 --> 03:49:01.900]  Abbott said was he was going to tell the Texas State Guard to just watch and
[03:49:01.900 --> 03:49:05.380]  monitor and see what they were doing what's wrong with that and that's only
[03:49:05.380 --> 03:49:10.740]  prudent particularly when a good number of people are concerned about what's
[03:49:10.740 --> 03:49:16.060]  going on and speaking of jade helm have you noticed the wooden clog in the
[03:49:16.060 --> 03:49:20.300]  middle of it yes a lot of people wondering kind of what what that is well
[03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:23.580]  I'll tell you what that is because having written a book called the rise of the
[03:49:23.580 --> 03:49:27.980]  fourth Reich which is how the third Reich Nazis were simply brought over here
[03:49:27.980 --> 03:49:32.300]  after the war rolled into our military industrial complex so that we would
[03:49:32.300 --> 03:49:38.540]  hopefully get our edge on the on the Russians I immediately saw it wouldn't
[03:49:38.540 --> 03:49:44.380]  clog on the in the center of the jade helm 15 logo and I immediately thought
[03:49:44.380 --> 03:49:49.540]  that the Nazi concentration camps when you were sent in there they put you
[03:49:49.540 --> 03:49:54.180]  they put you in striped pajamas and gave you wooden shoes so to me it's a
[03:49:54.180 --> 03:49:59.260]  symbol of a concentration camp and my question would be why is there a
[03:49:59.260 --> 03:50:07.340]  symbolic thing of Nazi concentration camps on the official logo of this
[03:50:07.340 --> 03:50:13.060]  military exercise in the United States in 2015 and that's interesting because
[03:50:13.060 --> 03:50:17.460]  it's transparent it's a little hidden it's almost like yeah invisible yeah it's
[03:50:17.460 --> 03:50:21.260]  almost like here's a little hint for you right that you you don't realize it's

[03:50:25.980 --> 03:50:30.700]  we've gotten into as well that's well and of course their logo says master the
[03:50:30.700 --> 03:50:36.060]  human domain whoa what's the human domain just about anything to do with the
[03:50:36.060 --> 03:50:43.820]  human right absolutely they're gonna mastery well on their way yeah I hear

[03:54:59.660 --> 03:55:06.860]  doing the work of two men Laurel and Hardy all right we're back we're gonna
[03:55:06.860 --> 03:55:12.700]  take one more call we're going to who Chris in North Carolina he'd like to
[03:55:12.700 --> 03:55:18.020]  discuss the Georgia Guidestones okay Chris what's on your man yes sir thank
[03:55:18.020 --> 03:55:23.980]  you first and foremost for your service I appreciate it I served there and my
[03:55:23.980 --> 03:55:32.900]  question is is I know they put 2015 I think it was 2015 block on Georgia
[03:55:32.900 --> 03:55:37.540]  Guidestones and I was wondering what you think about that because Alice Jones has
[03:55:37.540 --> 03:55:42.460]  talked about how he feels in his guts on impending doom and a lot of people
[03:55:42.460 --> 03:55:46.780]  talked about it but now they put it on the Georgia Guidestones and you know
[03:55:46.780 --> 03:55:51.620]  R.C. Christian is just a face name for somebody else with probably with a new
[03:55:51.620 --> 03:55:55.020]  order and I wonder what you think about it because you're pretty much a big
[03:55:55.020 --> 03:55:59.700]  researcher on the Georgia Guidestones that's right in fact I cover the Georgia
[03:55:59.700 --> 03:56:06.380]  Guidestones here in my new book population control and of course what
[03:56:06.380 --> 03:56:12.940]  you find is the very first admonition is maintain a human population on the
[03:56:12.940 --> 03:56:21.500]  world to 500 million well again right now it's 7.5 billion so what are they
[03:56:21.500 --> 03:56:29.060]  gonna do with the other seven billion of us and also the fact that they put 2015
[03:56:29.060 --> 03:56:35.060]  on there is only just adds to the accumulation of evidence that I mean you
[03:56:35.060 --> 03:56:39.820]  talk to some of the financial people they say get out of the stock you know
[03:56:39.820 --> 03:56:45.740]  run for the hills you hear military people going you know they're they
[03:56:45.740 --> 03:56:52.620]  are purging the US military of people who are pro-constitution they're the
[03:56:52.620 --> 03:56:59.780]  Pacific ring the volcano activity it's hyping it up the the Yellowstone
[03:56:59.780 --> 03:57:05.380]  Caldera is long past time that it could explode I mean there's so many never
[03:57:05.380 --> 03:57:11.260]  mind asteroids coming in there's just so much going on that it it really is
[03:57:11.260 --> 03:57:15.740]  pretty creepy right now and so I would I would advise keeping your eyes and ears
[03:57:15.740 --> 03:57:20.020]  open and and just as a matter of prudence maybe there's a hurricane or
[03:57:20.020 --> 03:57:23.860]  maybe there's a tornado get yourself some food some water and have some
[03:57:23.860 --> 03:57:29.860]  supplies listen to Alex Jones he tells it like it is in he will keep you
[03:57:29.860 --> 03:57:35.980]  apprised as things start to happen okay Leanne tell us about the news tonight
[03:57:35.980 --> 03:57:39.780]  well first I just wanted to say with the Georgia guide stones how bizarre that
[03:57:39.780 --> 03:57:44.180]  they always had that slot where where something was going to be put and then
[03:57:44.180 --> 03:57:49.060]  lo and behold someone updated it this year with the 2015 stone that was
[03:57:49.060 --> 03:57:52.620]  bizarre because I never even had noticed that well and just like the rest of the
[03:57:52.620 --> 03:57:57.020]  those stones including this mr. Christian who's some of them it's all very
[03:57:57.020 --> 03:58:01.380]  mysterious nobody seems to know and nobody seems to be able to tell us
[03:58:01.380 --> 03:58:05.700]  exactly what all this is but it to me it's quite obvious that it ties into
[03:58:05.700 --> 03:58:09.540]  futuristic thank you absolutely well we're gonna be talking about that on the
[03:58:09.540 --> 03:58:13.940]  news tonight the disclosure project so can't wait to get that out for everyone
[03:58:13.940 --> 03:58:25.620]  disclosure we're gonna disclose and that's disclose not ok music central the
