[10:14.400 --> 10:20.080]  the free home of the brave it's absolutely outrageous so that is coming

[10:24.120 --> 10:30.200]  this yesterday because I got it during the last break but I do want to talk
[10:30.200 --> 10:33.320]  about this today maybe when we open the phones up later folks would like to
[10:33.320 --> 10:37.000]  comment on I'd like to get your take on it this is not a joke this is out of AP
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.240]  Reuters yahoo are just some of the articles I have would you pledge your
[10:42.240 --> 10:48.120]  soul as lone collateral well one big bank is doing just that and is getting
[10:48.120 --> 10:52.480]  thousands of commerce there's no credit check there's no nothing they just
[10:52.480 --> 10:56.320]  want your soul of course in the end of the day that's all this new world order
[10:56.320 --> 10:59.520]  really does want when you actually get down to the nitty-gritty they want to
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.200]  control your mind your intellect and that's what all this petty hype and the
[11:04.200 --> 11:09.840]  fad-driven fashion-driven society is where people will kill for money and
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.600]  kill for fashion and kill for status that means nothing they sell their souls
[11:15.600 --> 11:22.880]  for nothing but empty hot air so would you pledge your soul as lone
[11:22.880 --> 11:26.840]  collateral Reuters there's another one out of a
[11:26.840 --> 11:32.200]  Deutsch press Argentur that's like the AP of Germany lot beings prepare to sell
[11:32.200 --> 11:37.720]  their souls for quick cash hell we're ready to sell our souls the name of
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.240]  saving the planet it's all a complete fraud but it makes you feel good sell
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.680]  out your economic future for the global green tax which they're now admitting
[11:45.680 --> 11:52.280]  will be selectively enforced against any and all facets of life an open tax
[11:52.280 --> 11:56.960]  thousands of taxes to private corporations and banks openly being set
[11:56.960 --> 12:02.120]  up who could have thought of such open corruption well I guess for decades they
[12:02.120 --> 12:05.880]  been taking the IMF and World Bank US taxpayer money and giving it directly to
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.680]  private banks so this is just them taking their rightful place at the head of
[12:10.680 --> 12:18.640]  the table ruling us according to them here's another one banks big banks don't
[12:18.640 --> 12:25.600]  want California's IOUs from Arnie another fad-driven Enron frontman clown
[12:25.600 --> 12:30.280]  who then was elected the name of fighting Enron man you gotta love that but
[12:30.280 --> 12:37.200]  again they were replacing one horrible socialist gun grabbing piece of filth
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.520]  Governor Gray Davis with another gun grabbing open borders promoting piece of
[12:42.520 --> 12:46.480]  filth who actually met with Enron officials and helped run the scam and
[12:46.480 --> 12:50.640]  then ran on stopping it when Gray Davis had nothing to do with it and actually
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.240]  blew the whistle on it so they tried to nail him to the wall and did see see
[12:55.240 --> 12:59.280]  everybody woke up to Bush being a scam so then they fell into the arms of Obama
[12:59.280 --> 13:03.320]  now they're gonna wake up to Obama being an absolute fraud nightmare probably a
[13:03.320 --> 13:09.720]  one-term president but then who look out for the Republican savior I mean can't
[13:09.720 --> 13:14.040]  the public get this elementary fact that it's all a dog and pony show
[13:14.040 --> 13:21.520]  WWF wrestling tag team baloney they better they better get it quick
[13:21.520 --> 13:31.800]  I mean I know I harp on this like a parrot but still the public doesn't fully
[13:31.800 --> 13:35.280]  understand this they're starting to get it you're hearing the term I coined the
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.480]  left-right paradigm shattering a left-right paradigm it's now being
[13:39.480 --> 13:47.080]  repeated all over liberal websites all over conservative sites all over
[13:47.080 --> 13:52.000]  libertarian sites all over campaign for liberty science all over the place
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.280]  another testament to what one person can do imagine what you can do if you
[13:58.280 --> 14:00.680]  become leaders out there well you already have you've been spreading my
[14:00.680 --> 14:04.720]  films my radio show my work and then ladies and gentlemen I know I'm not up
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.360]  to the task I'm not perfect I don't have all the answers but none of us do the
[14:08.360 --> 14:13.720]  fact is step up to the plate get in the game start living you want to beat the
[14:13.720 --> 14:17.840]  new world order start feeling confident start going to the swimming pool even
[14:17.840 --> 14:21.400]  though you got a little bit of a belly and the women's magazines have told you
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.680]  you're not you're not beautiful or maybe you don't have enough tattoos well
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.600]  still you can go to the pool and still be cool or let's say you're a man your
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.440]  muscles aren't big enough you got a little bit of flab go to the pool swim
[14:36.440 --> 14:43.200]  enjoy yourself I mean it just starts by not caring what people think about you
[14:43.200 --> 14:52.640]  more and more I realize that but then not just not caring not caring about
[14:52.640 --> 14:58.080]  their phony corporate new world order values getting back to basic values of
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.640]  who you are and what you stand for and just loving the creation you live in
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.360]  and enjoying the consciousness that you've been gifted with and then once
[15:08.360 --> 15:13.520]  you get your head screwed on straight and all of us it's a daily process half
[15:13.520 --> 15:16.280]  the time my heads point in the wrong direction ladies and gentlemen the
[15:16.280 --> 15:21.040]  issue is becoming conscious and self-aware they always talk about
[15:21.040 --> 15:27.360]  when will machines become artificially aware well if they are you won't be
[15:27.360 --> 15:32.880]  told about it I won't be told about it probably already have to some extent by
[15:32.880 --> 15:39.600]  that I mean thinking plotting developing expanding exponentially its
[15:39.600 --> 15:45.800]  computing power is that human is out of soul no but could come up with an idea
[15:45.800 --> 15:54.640]  to do something on its own AI we know if the many purposes is already there
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.880]  sometimes I wonder can we just get humans to become self-aware I mean just
[15:59.880 --> 16:03.760]  getting outside yourself just looking at what you're doing looking at how you're
[16:03.760 --> 16:07.680]  acting look at how you're behaving looking at the mental template that's
[16:07.680 --> 16:11.360]  been downloaded into your head from birth as we're set in front of the
[16:11.360 --> 16:21.120]  television sets to crap in our diapers all our parents gobbled whatever it was
[16:21.120 --> 16:27.760]  they were distracting themselves with I guess hypothetically a lot of you back
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.800]  in the 60s and 70s maybe your parents were in entertainment into golf into sex
[16:31.800 --> 16:41.880]  into drugs into uppers downers into being self-centered into being workaholics
[16:41.880 --> 16:46.560]  alcoholics whatever we've been a screwed up society for a long time but but you
[16:46.560 --> 16:52.320]  notice the establishments always waging war on the upright on the strong on the
[16:52.320 --> 16:56.800]  self-sufficient on people that aren't dependent on them because they see you
[16:56.800 --> 17:05.320]  as a threat because if you are upright if you are self-aware if you are awake
[17:05.320 --> 17:09.760]  you're not gonna like what's going on around you you're gonna realize society's
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.160]  degenerating and falling apart you're gonna realize really bad wicked people
[17:14.160 --> 17:19.120]  are in control who are self-aware and know how the world works they just made
[17:19.120 --> 17:24.440]  the decision hey I'm gonna join the evil I'm gonna go and rip off all these
[17:24.440 --> 17:27.960]  idiots in fact I'm gonna push to make them even dumber and make sure they
[17:27.960 --> 17:34.200]  don't wake up see it's a fundamental difference in philosophy in mindset in
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.600]  spirit in that there are those of us that just want people to do well and be
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.280]  happy and we love art and we love other people being successful and we love the
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.760]  dynamic human spirit and we love exploration and discovery and we love
[17:49.760 --> 17:55.520]  the animating contest of liberty but we're normally so busy with our own
[17:55.520 --> 17:59.120]  lives and our own visions and our own ideas we don't like getting other
[17:59.120 --> 18:02.880]  people's business we don't like having to stand up and speak out we just
[18:02.880 --> 18:07.160]  disgustedly try to stay out of the way of the evil controllers and their zombie
[18:07.160 --> 18:13.360]  slaves but we don't have a choice this is crunch time this is survival time we
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.960]  are in the fight of our lives we are in a fight for our very lives because this

[21:58.240 --> 22:03.400]  back. Hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal
[22:03.400 --> 22:07.120]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[22:07.120 --> 22:10.840]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[22:10.840 --> 22:13.800]  place limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[22:13.800 --> 22:17.560]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[22:17.560 --> 22:21.560]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket
[22:21.560 --> 22:25.160]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank
[22:25.160 --> 22:29.240]  run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the Fed
[22:29.240 --> 22:32.680]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[22:32.680 --> 22:36.560]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[22:36.560 --> 22:40.880]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[22:40.880 --> 22:45.320]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[22:45.320 --> 22:50.000]  silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own

[24:46.240 --> 24:49.240]  Let your children play
[24:50.240 --> 24:53.240]  They want us to give up
[24:53.240 --> 24:56.240]  The establishment wants to break our spirit
[24:57.240 --> 25:02.240]  We have to make a commitment to become educated and informed on how the world
[25:02.240 --> 25:05.240]  really works to get out of the left right
[25:06.240 --> 25:11.240]  cul-de-sacs and back alleys they try to send us down the rat holes
[25:11.240 --> 25:16.240]  and really discover the true structure of the world government
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.240]  that coming up I have a clip of Al Gore yesterday in England calling for global
[25:21.240 --> 25:23.240]  government
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.240]  oh but it doesn't exist I have to sit there with major newspaper writers going
[25:27.240 --> 25:30.240]  would you like me to give you hundreds of news articles it's where they're
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.240]  announcing world government run for and by private banks you'll pay your
[25:33.240 --> 25:36.240]  carbon taxes to and they just say so
[25:36.240 --> 25:41.240]  you believe this is like exists and I said no it's like to give you sources
[25:41.240 --> 25:45.240]  now I want to talk about what you believe you you imagine this if you ever
[25:45.240 --> 25:48.240]  been diagnosed as it's just
[25:48.240 --> 25:53.240]  they're just henchmen their mercenaries hired to carry this out against us
[25:53.240 --> 25:56.240]  and they're all bought with fiat money
[25:57.240 --> 26:00.240]  created out of nothing backed up with our labor
[26:02.240 --> 26:05.240]  it's at the globalists are such scam artists such frauds
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.240]  it should be so easy to see through all their corruption and all their lies
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.240]  but see people buying a little lies and they buy into medium sized lies and they
[26:14.240 --> 26:19.240]  buy into big lies until people don't even know what reality is anymore when
[26:19.240 --> 26:23.240]  it's right there in front of everybody's faces a bunch of psychotic control
[26:23.240 --> 26:26.240]  freaky genesis are in control of everything
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.240]  they're trying to bring in a worldwide dictatorship so nobody can resist them
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.240]  they're not in total control right now they're very weak right now
[26:33.240 --> 26:38.240]  they're in an embryonic phase they're trying to very quickly though grow legs
[26:38.240 --> 26:41.240]  and move on us
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.240]  kick their butt now wake up
[26:45.240 --> 26:47.240]  I got some solutions coming up
[26:51.240 --> 26:54.240]  in fact guys I forgot to bring it in here during the break we go grab me the
[26:54.240 --> 26:57.240]  cranberry juice bottle out of the refrigerator I want to get it to a
[26:57.240 --> 27:01.240]  solution after the break and it has to do with the cranberry juice bottle
[27:05.240 --> 27:07.240]  you'll get what I'm talking about in a minute
[27:07.240 --> 27:16.240]  the fight for the future of the species is now we got a bunch of mad
[27:16.240 --> 27:21.240]  scientists playing God backed up by filthy rich robber barons and royalty
[27:21.240 --> 27:26.240]  that are making their move for world government a eugenicist paradise of
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.240]  control freak psychopathic sadism
[27:30.240 --> 27:36.240]  don't let them break your spirit don't let them get you down don't let them
[27:36.240 --> 27:42.240]  convince you that you're powerless and can't affect change people are
[27:42.240 --> 27:46.240]  awakening in mass the establishment is behind schedule they're moving with
[27:46.240 --> 27:50.240]  everything they've got to try to swarm us with so much corruption and so much
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.240]  tearing that we just give up we can't do it
[27:55.240 --> 28:01.240]  we need to break their spirit we just set about grim faced determined
[28:01.240 --> 28:06.240]  committed knowing each little action we take against them if the people
[28:06.240 --> 28:13.240]  move with irresistible force in the info war with newsletters and giving
[28:13.240 --> 28:17.240]  DVDs to people having viewing parties and calling it a talk radio and going
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.240]  and speaking at city council and running for water commissioner their city
[28:21.240 --> 28:26.240]  council or school board going and injecting real issues never stopping
[28:26.240 --> 28:30.240]  handing out flyers in front of public schools the first day of school
[28:30.240 --> 28:34.240]  telling people there's no law you've got to take vaccines with the laws that
[28:34.240 --> 28:38.240]  that against them saying it's the law we've got to get lost past saying it's
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.240]  against the law to lie and say it's a law and then you've shown people how
[28:43.240 --> 28:46.240]  they're being lied to you've unlocked their mind it's just a few examples of
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.240]  fighting back just not stopping there's nothing worse though and more frustrating
[28:51.240 --> 28:57.240]  than knowing victory is within our reach to the point of I get tunnel vision
[28:57.240 --> 29:01.240]  like a gunner on an aircraft coming in over a target over and over again a
[29:01.240 --> 29:05.240]  world war two in Korea and Vietnam back when they strafe targets still they
[29:05.240 --> 29:08.240]  go ahead and just fly right into the ground they'd be strafing a train or
[29:08.240 --> 29:12.240]  strafing a tank or strafing a bridge or strafing a troop column and they
[29:12.240 --> 29:16.240]  just just stay on target and fly right into the right into it because they
[29:16.240 --> 29:21.240]  were so focused and I tend to you know end up working till two in the morning
[29:21.240 --> 29:25.240]  last night and I got up at six thirty this morning and I just realized you
[29:25.240 --> 29:30.240]  know what if people just had the commitment I had if I could somehow
[29:30.240 --> 29:35.240]  infect people with the same fury and the same anger and the same focus our
[29:35.240 --> 29:40.240]  problems would be over very very very soon the globalists are enthused and
[29:40.240 --> 29:45.240]  empowered with an energy of control freak evil and reveling in our blood I

[34:26.240 --> 34:30.240]  believing the federal certification and now people are going with multiple
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.240]  certifications from third-party groups now the big lobbies are coming in
[34:34.240 --> 34:39.240]  trying to lobby that you can't have a third-party certified that you can't put
[34:39.240 --> 34:43.240]  on milk there's no growth hormone synthetic growth hormone that makes
[34:43.240 --> 34:47.240]  your five-year-old daughter grow a beard and start having you know kids when
[34:47.240 --> 34:56.240]  she's seven look people know the deformities are up the diseases are up
[34:56.240 --> 35:00.240]  the sperm counts down the women are falling apart the breasts are rotting
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.240]  off every form of cancer is exploding the people know what you're going to them
[35:05.240 --> 35:10.240]  you sicko freaks so go ahead and stage your terror attacks go ahead and launch
[35:10.240 --> 35:15.240]  your world war three we know you're behind it we know your trash
[35:15.240 --> 35:22.240]  let me give you a solution just five years ago you couldn't find hardly any
[35:22.240 --> 35:28.240]  candy any fruit juice any food I mean they put sugar and everything and they
[35:28.240 --> 35:40.240]  put the chemical manipulated distillate of what is in corn and call it corn syrup
[35:40.240 --> 35:45.240]  high fructose and there's all these different studies with it linked to
[35:45.240 --> 35:50.240]  diabetes and linked to all sorts of endocrine disruptions and chemicals and
[35:50.240 --> 35:54.240]  for some reason half of products tested with it have high levels of mercury
[35:54.240 --> 36:00.240]  not involved in the manufacture of it for these companies just dump the toxic
[36:00.240 --> 36:04.240]  waste in the food folks they figured out they could just dose it out just like
[36:04.240 --> 36:07.240]  they said oh we got all this sodium fluoride and toxic waste left over from
[36:07.240 --> 36:11.240]  making the atomic bombs and from aluminum just put it in the water the
[36:11.240 --> 36:20.240]  idiots will never know you know you think somebody at a McDonald's spitting
[36:20.240 --> 36:25.240]  hocking up some flim and your hamburgers bad the new order puts poisoning
[36:25.240 --> 36:31.240]  your kids vaccines in your water it's the same spirit as some control freak
[36:31.240 --> 36:34.240]  who's working at McDonald's it doesn't like the fact that they're that you're
[36:34.240 --> 36:39.240]  there and for no reason you're not even rude to them but they stick a booger in
[36:39.240 --> 36:42.240]  your food I was at a restaurant I've gone to I don't go to restaurants a lot
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.240]  I'm too busy one I've gone to maybe ten times over the last five six years and
[36:46.240 --> 36:52.240]  I sat there and I watched a bus boy stick a booger in the food and you know I
[36:52.240 --> 36:57.240]  didn't even say anything because see America is about denial and if I would
[36:57.240 --> 37:03.240]  have said anything they would have denied it and then all these instant
[37:03.240 --> 37:06.240]  calculations it was a 99% chance because I could see it was kind of a bad
[37:06.240 --> 37:11.240]  culture at that restaurant now kind of waiters with attitudes because you know
[37:11.240 --> 37:14.240]  everybody needs to be a movie star everybody needs to be a big stud
[37:14.240 --> 37:18.240]  everybody needs to be super successful and so they're not empowered and then
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.240]  even if you're a movie star you're not empowered it's all part of not
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.240]  appreciating what you've got and so there's the bus boy little smart mouth
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.240]  and I was yet an attitude when he brought bread over to the table is an Italian
[37:30.240 --> 37:35.240]  restaurant and I watched him over there just happened to look over when he was
[37:35.240 --> 37:39.240]  picking up more bread and stuff to bring out to other people and I saw him sit
[37:39.240 --> 37:43.240]  there and pick his nose and then joke with his buddy and stick it in somebody's
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.240]  dish and you know I should have said something as they let it out the door to
[37:47.240 --> 37:52.240]  the people outside eating but I knew it was a restaurant of scum and filth and
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.240]  that they would have just said no it's not true and probably call the police on
[37:56.240 --> 38:02.240]  me that's how trash operate and those are the type of people the CIA is
[38:02.240 --> 38:07.240]  hiring the have you seen the Associated Press and Reuters reporting they're
[38:07.240 --> 38:11.240]  hiring all these bankers that are laid off of the smaller banks there's no more
[38:11.240 --> 38:15.240]  retail banking needed it's all just the big mega banks stealing and so they're
[38:15.240 --> 38:18.240]  they're hiring them to carry out domestic operations and they're they're
[38:18.240 --> 38:24.240]  hiring all these thugs and criminals and people right out of college and because
[38:24.240 --> 38:28.240]  that's the only sector hiring to carry out their criminal operations it's not
[38:28.240 --> 38:31.240]  enough to ship in narcotics it's not enough to ship in the majority of the
[38:31.240 --> 38:37.240]  drugs and then launder the money through to private prisons owned by them now
[38:37.240 --> 38:42.240]  they're going to run all your local cities and towns just criminals all on
[38:42.240 --> 38:47.240]  fancy pants power trips running around there's CIA credentials you make me
[38:47.240 --> 38:54.240]  sick oh by the way you didn't get a memo over there the CIA did not shoot your kids
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.240]  up with vaccines did you hey did you get a memo enough to drink that sodium
[38:57.240 --> 39:04.240]  fluoride did you get a memo about the terraforming the chemtrail spring
[39:04.240 --> 39:10.240]  did you get a memo about that no you didn't get a memo because you're hated
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.240]  by your masters just as much as I am whether you like it or not you're in
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.240]  the same boat with Alex Jones so you're on this power trip that you're above
[39:18.240 --> 39:21.240]  everybody that's all that matters is status well let me tell you you don't
[39:21.240 --> 39:27.240]  have any status but a quizzling idiot who was recruited because they could
[39:27.240 --> 39:31.240]  assess your mental mentality that you were the type of useful fool the useful
[39:31.240 --> 39:35.240]  idiot they could use to carry out their operations let me give you some positive
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.240]  news here some positive news and information for everybody out there
[39:40.240 --> 39:51.240]  listening five years ago almost every product I saw including even so-called
[39:51.240 --> 39:56.240]  organic products well would say oh organic high fructose corn syrup had
[39:56.240 --> 40:06.240]  fructose corn syrup in it now in the last year just a year or so ago about
[40:06.240 --> 40:10.240]  half the products had it and then now maybe 10% because I go to the store and
[40:10.240 --> 40:15.240]  start looking and I haven't been able to drink ocean spray cranberry juice
[40:15.240 --> 40:19.240]  cocktail even though I like it in probably 10 years since I learned about
[40:19.240 --> 40:25.240]  just how bad high fructose corn syrup was I haven't been able to drink it
[40:25.240 --> 40:30.240]  because it had it in it but see we educated the public you educated the
[40:30.240 --> 40:35.240]  public many other people educated and then the big corn syrup producer
[40:35.240 --> 40:38.240]  consortium archer daniel's metal and others got together and they put out
[40:38.240 --> 40:43.240]  these ads where there's an idiot husband with the bossy queen bee wife that
[40:43.240 --> 40:48.240]  wears the pants so this is targeting the women who they know do 80 plus percent
[40:48.240 --> 40:51.240]  of the grocery shopping it isn't that they want to give you power women they
[40:51.240 --> 40:54.240]  want to kill you that are in the hammer they want to give you diabetes so they
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.240]  run by the time you hit 4550 jack all the money you've got saved into their
[40:58.240 --> 41:02.240]  medical military industrial complex run by the Rockefeller family on record
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.240]  but you know they run these ads in every ad we played them where the man's the
[41:06.240 --> 41:10.240]  idiot he's the moron and he goes gee honey you're eating a popsicle you know
[41:10.240 --> 41:16.240]  at the picnic you're eating a popsicle that is high fructose corn syrup I
[41:16.240 --> 41:19.240]  heard that might not be good she goes oh what are your facts he goes I don't
[41:19.240 --> 41:22.240]  know I just heard it I don't have any proof she goes actually it's incredibly
[41:22.240 --> 41:25.240]  nutritious all the studies show and he goes oh you're so scientific and smart
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.240]  I'm an idiot she goes it's alright dummy and sticks it in his mouth but she's
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.240]  feeding in grapes so so for the 20% of males that saw it they don't mind the
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.240]  female calls them stupid as long as she puts grapes in his mouth so the
[41:37.240 --> 41:41.240]  psychology is the female will serve you everything will be good you'll have this
[41:41.240 --> 41:47.240]  great pastoral happy scene as you're the god if you'll just take the corn syrup
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.240]  and let us kill you and then for her 80 plus percent of the time it was an
[41:51.240 --> 41:54.240]  84% last time I saw the numbers of women making most of the grocery store
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.240]  purchases you know out doing the hunting and gathering or they're doing the
[41:59.240 --> 42:02.240]  gathering we're out in the business world doing the hunting that's how we're
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.240]  designed they're doing the gathering so she'll go out and go it's his fructose
[42:07.240 --> 42:12.240]  I saw that where that woman was smart she showed the man I'm gonna drink it and
[42:12.240 --> 42:19.240]  get diabetes oh I'll show him so it's so feminist remember how in the 1920s
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.240]  suffrage it was already happening women were standing up for themselves so they
[42:23.240 --> 42:27.240]  hijacked the movement ever Bernays wrote about this top psychologist psych warfare
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.240]  expert for the army at the time and they said we'll get the women smoking
[42:31.240 --> 42:35.240]  cigarettes and we'll break up the family and we'll have the women working two
[42:35.240 --> 42:39.240]  jobs and the men working two jobs so the state can raise the children for the
[42:39.240 --> 42:43.240]  new organized managed economy he wrote this the head psych warfare expert for
[42:43.240 --> 42:48.240]  the army later for GM and Ford and in federal government I mean just go read
[42:48.240 --> 42:56.240]  his own books the nephew of Sigmund Freud openly calling you idiots he said and
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.240]  we'll make it radical and cool we'll hand out free cigarettes and sponsor the
[43:00.240 --> 43:04.240]  suffrage movement and make it feminist to smoke boy you really proved how you
[43:04.240 --> 43:08.240]  were rad didn't you get that lung cancer grandma when you're watching her wheeze
[43:08.240 --> 43:12.240]  and die or great grandma she probably was part of that and boy she was al-Qaeda
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.240]  it wasn't she she was hit hard by the new world order baby that's psych warfare
[43:17.240 --> 43:25.240]  that's death culture that's devastation force that's hard core victory over you
[43:25.240 --> 43:31.240]  you know how the new world knows when it's one when it's killed you these people
[43:31.240 --> 43:38.240]  don't play games now they're running TV ads telling you high fructose corn syrup
[43:38.240 --> 43:43.240]  is God guess what total collapse total failure they're taking it out of
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.240]  everything so now I've seen different legislation moving where they don't have
[43:47.240 --> 43:52.240]  to tell you what something is just call it a new scientific name for sugar so
[43:52.240 --> 43:56.240]  we'll have to start the whole process over the took a decade of warning people
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.240]  of what this is person to person that all that new name kind of like when dying
[44:01.240 --> 44:05.240]  core got caught running giant child kidnapping rings it was an AP and Reuters
[44:05.240 --> 44:10.240]  and Chicago Tribune and Houston Chronicle and New York Times they just
[44:10.240 --> 44:15.240]  changed the name Monsanto changed their name we spent decades exposing these
[44:15.240 --> 44:20.240]  monsters these tyrants they want a monopoly over food production and genetics
[44:20.240 --> 44:25.240]  they just changed their name so they're gonna change the name by law that they
[44:25.240 --> 44:30.240]  can change its name so you don't know that's chemical weapon that is hard core
[44:30.240 --> 44:35.240]  savage victory over you and your family that is kicking your teeth in that is
[44:35.240 --> 44:40.240]  coming after your family these people are hard core this isn't a frickin game
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.240]  people that's why I get upset when I see everybody worshiping the stupid hollow
[44:45.240 --> 44:52.240]  soul-sucking diversion of that pathetic Wraith Michael Jackson because that stuff
[44:52.240 --> 44:56.240]  doesn't matter ladies and gentlemen this matters but I'm telling you our victory
[44:56.240 --> 45:02.240]  our victory is when I now read what somebody bought in the office somebody
[45:02.240 --> 45:09.240]  bought a big old container and says here on the back of the Ocean Spray
[45:09.240 --> 45:15.240]  cranberry ingredients filtered water cranberry juice from concentrate cane
[45:15.240 --> 45:25.240]  or beet sugar vitamin C that's it that's it you had a gigantic victory this
[45:25.240 --> 45:31.240]  was over 70% of the sweetening market see they know you want something sweet
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.240]  they're gonna put the poison in what sweet just like rat poison just like the
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.240]  aspartame with Donald Rumsfeld and the Terminator seeds and Monsanto and
[45:41.240 --> 45:46.240]  Searle and all of it it's always these people he also got Prozac approved
[45:46.240 --> 45:51.240]  he's a key guy over each giant mass operation of chemical and biological
[45:51.240 --> 45:57.240]  attack against the people just like Kissinger these are demons of hell and
[45:57.240 --> 46:02.240]  they're trying to pass laws where they can create a new lexicon of terms so we'll
[46:02.240 --> 46:05.240]  have to then inform the public again but by then we're going to be off the air
[46:05.240 --> 46:08.240]  and the web is going to be shut down for all intents and purposes if they
[46:08.240 --> 46:11.240]  continue to have their victories they're having victories we're having victories
[46:11.240 --> 46:18.240]  that's why we're forcing them to show their hand there is a victory I'm hard
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.240]  I hardly if it ought to take a video camera I'm just by myself and they'll throw
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.240]  me out of the store kind of low-key go around and videotape all the stuff or
[46:27.240 --> 46:33.240]  somebody should write an article on this that just a year ago had corn syrup in
[46:33.240 --> 46:39.240]  it and it doesn't now because of you that is a victory and there's thousands of
[46:39.240 --> 46:45.240]  them but the big thing is even though you lose over and over again it's the
[46:45.240 --> 46:49.240]  perseverance like George Washington that matters we got an article up on
[46:49.240 --> 46:53.240]  full wars dot com about George Washington perseverance today you got to keep
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.240]  coming back and coming back and coming back ten years ago and this is Austin
[46:57.240 --> 47:02.240]  supposedly a trendy progressive town there was one store you could find
[47:02.240 --> 47:07.240]  organic food at now all of them have got it and it's supplanting most the non-organic
[47:07.240 --> 47:10.240]  and forcing the big agribusiness product software many of the stores more than
[47:10.240 --> 47:17.240]  half of it is organic locally certified and so that's actually saving local
[47:17.240 --> 47:21.240]  agriculture and it's making big agrimad so they're trying the premises ID and
[47:21.240 --> 47:27.240]  animal ID to shut it down we're actually gaining ground there because of your
[47:27.240 --> 47:31.240]  purchasing habits and what you've done and they're really getting scared because
[47:31.240 --> 47:35.240]  for a while organic was more expensive but now it's coming so widespread and the
[47:35.240 --> 47:39.240]  supply line for it is becoming more robust and it's passing on savings and
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.240]  getting cheaper for even the poor people in the inner city drinking the really
[47:43.240 --> 47:49.240]  strong fluoride yeah they've done federal studies I've had the one of the top
[47:49.240 --> 47:53.240]  scientists the EPA on whose we've written letters to his bosses talking about
[47:53.240 --> 47:56.240]  how for some reason in the inner city areas they find three to four times the
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.240]  lead and and and fluoride well yeah they've got most big cities special pumping
[48:01.240 --> 48:05.240]  centers that over chemicalize the black and Hispanic areas oh but I'm sorry
[48:05.240 --> 48:08.240]  your Chicano low recon quista group won't tell you that because they're really
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.240]  just big pimps pimping you using race psychology and they're on big Fortune
[48:13.240 --> 48:18.240]  500 payroll you think Metsha and La Raza care about your Raza your race when
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.240]  they're when they're nothing but low-level pimps soldiers for Fortune 500
[48:22.240 --> 48:28.240]  eugenicist when you start hearing your Chicano or your black power group tell
[48:28.240 --> 48:32.240]  you about mercury in the shots or mercury in the water or mercury in the corn syrup
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.240]  don't give that black baby that mercury but see you're not going to hear that
[48:37.240 --> 48:42.240]  it's all going to be about puffing up and is somebody a racist and was it code word
[48:42.240 --> 48:47.240]  for race and just looking for racism behind every bush and under every table
[48:47.240 --> 48:56.240]  meanwhile giant scientific system is just attacking you 24-7 I'll give you
[48:56.240 --> 49:05.240]  another solution HR 1207 254 last time I checked cosponsors it's sailing towards
[49:05.240 --> 49:10.240]  the 290 for an absolute complete hands-down passage in the house the
[49:10.240 --> 49:17.240]  Senate came in and used a rule on no legislation in spending bills but then
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.240]  Senator DeMitt pointed out that there was all this legislation in the spending
[49:20.240 --> 49:26.240]  bill and had the chairwoman the head of the Senate had to admit repeatedly that
[49:26.240 --> 49:29.240]  video is up on info wars dot com prison point dot com admit that there was a
[49:29.240 --> 49:33.240]  double standard and the rule was misapplied because they wouldn't even allow
[49:33.240 --> 49:38.240]  a Senate vote on a Senate version to simply audit the private offshore Fed you
[49:38.240 --> 49:42.240]  know what Senator DeMitt was now talking like a G. F. Regriffen or Aaron Russo
[49:42.240 --> 49:55.240]  or Ron Paul or Alex Jones like a red Beckman like a Bill Benson he was
[49:55.240 --> 50:04.240]  openly there saying private offshore unelected unaccountable out of control
[50:04.240 --> 50:08.240]  and the media went into overdrive calling him crazy but the public didn't buy
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.240]  in that oh I'm crazy because I don't want to drink your corn syrup that you
[50:13.240 --> 50:16.240]  just so happen to mix mercury with for no reason Washington Post Associated

[54:40.240 --> 54:51.240]  okay so I was going over solutions now the bankers are having to show their hand now they're saying no you can't audit us and showing that the U.S. Senate has
[54:51.240 --> 54:58.240]  bought and paid for and people are witnessing the Senate leadership engage in unconstitutional procedural rulemaking
[54:58.240 --> 55:04.240]  so they've turned the house and Senate in little dictatorships where the committee chairman vote themselves imperial power
[55:04.240 --> 55:18.240]  this is a pack of criminals that wouldn't allow anyone to read the 1313 hundred page climate bill and now we've got the bill and it's worse than we thought
[55:18.240 --> 55:27.240]  total shutdown of everything china india mexico hundreds of other third world countries and no greenhouse cuts even if you believe the malarkey
[55:27.240 --> 55:39.240]  and then now we have Senate hearings of congress asking the different individuals in the Obama administration maybe I'll play it later
[55:39.240 --> 55:52.240]  hey the U.N. zone charts show that this is going to increase greenhouse gases if the West makes these changes because all the industry is just going to move to China and India
[55:52.240 --> 55:59.240]  and they said yeah we admit that so what but then one person in the White House says I disagree with that as if the U.N. zone chart
[55:59.240 --> 56:10.240]  ladies and gentlemen this is the entire society being seized this is a desperate gamble by the establishment to wage war on industry and life
[56:10.240 --> 56:16.240]  and to micromanage every facet of our lives and I know you know that but we better get the word out to people and again
[56:16.240 --> 56:26.240]  they have hijacked the environmental movement in many respects they founded it but they've hijacked the better elements of it
[56:26.240 --> 56:32.240]  because nobody wants to drink toxic waste and live in all this but see the environmental movement says nothing about the toxic waste
[56:32.240 --> 56:41.240]  and the radiologicals and the chemicals and the genetic engineering all the serious threats it's always just carbon carbon carbon that plants breathe
[56:41.240 --> 56:50.240]  a wonderful good gas only 4% of the atmosphere we're at the lowest point ever recorded of carbon dioxide
[56:50.240 --> 56:57.240]  if you look at the last 10,000 years it was always higher in the samples they test so it's been going up and down the last 10,000 years
[56:57.240 --> 57:08.240]  and I've had all these climatologists on this is the official meters the official university testing of carbon dioxide I mean it's been as high as 14% before
[57:08.240 --> 57:17.240]  it's 4% it's good plants breathe it believe me go look up what plants breathe I'm not lying to you
[57:17.240 --> 57:26.240]  they've done polls with the average American says Bandai hydrogen monoxide water they've got people believing did you find the mercury clip
[57:26.240 --> 57:34.240]  yeah go ahead and play the mercury clip right now this is local news with this air nationally that is this was a news feed
[57:34.240 --> 57:41.240]  where they create these news pieces that they then voice locally it's a news package from CBS broadcast center in Manhattan
[57:41.240 --> 57:45.240]  and then this broadcast all over the country this was the local Austin version here it is

[58:04.240 --> 58:12.240]  that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the opposite
[58:12.240 --> 58:18.240]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance
[58:18.240 --> 58:26.240]  okay there you go and I've got clips for the news saying lead is good for children folks lead is not good for children they think you're so dumb
[58:26.240 --> 58:33.240]  and those painted trollops over at the local news station are so dumb I don't think they're evil that they believe it
[58:33.240 --> 58:40.240]  no one be surprised they didn't go home that day and give their kid a spoon full of mercury

[1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:29.240]  Hi Dr. Bob Bowman coming up in the next segment several other very informative guests coming up today dealing with the attack on the press
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:39.240]  and freedom of speech the hate crimes bills that is all coming up in the next three hours
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:48.240]  we're going to be simulcasting live at prison planet dot tv at eight after so heads up on that but look the point I was making about solutions and the power we have
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:57.240]  is that look at how we're exposing the Federal Reserve and we're not going to have victories and auditing and or abolishing and overnight but this is part of the awakening process
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:06.240]  it's like harmonics you just got to keep steadily beating and steadily drumming and not stopping and knowing you're going to win
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:18.240]  I mean it's like a physical fight folks I've I've fought a lot bigger and tougher and stronger men than me and I and I but I guarantee it I'm not going to stop
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:25.240]  attacking I'm not going to stop swinging and I'm not going to think about it I can't tell me how many times somebody's punched me and waited for me to fall down
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:35.240]  while I'm busy throwing five five deadly blows into their throat it's the same thing you don't sit there and punch the enemy and wait and see what's going
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:45.240]  to happen you keep punching you keep pounding and they get you down you bite them they get you down you grab them in the groin they get you down you poke them in the eyes
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:56.240]  but even that you just got to get gutted up folks and go wild and it's that same spirit you ever had four or five big guys on top of you
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:05.240]  kicking you stomp anyone you're down and you just got up and bust out of and just take them on it's that same attitude that America has to have
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:14.240]  and I don't know if you haven't experienced that feeling I'm sorry for you but you've got to decide you're taking the fight to them
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:23.240]  in the info war and you know I was making the point because I saw some rules on Codex Alimentarius being adopted on drugs and food
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:32.240]  they want to list healthy vitamins and minerals as drugs so you have to pay prescription prices just to get them and so by law it can't even be in your food
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:41.240]  I'm not kidding that is it can't be added to your food and then so if the food happens to have natural vitamin C or vitamin B 12 or 6
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:47.240]  you're not allowed to brag about that and say oh we believe this has health benefits they can tell you Prozac and Ritalin are great for you on the news
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:57.240]  but Cheerios can't say that they're a healthy product that's been shown if you eat a diet high in fiber it helps flush your system out
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:09.240]  see it's a sick joke so cranberry juice cocktail no longer has high fructose corn syrup linked to all those serious health problems
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:18.240]  because you demanded it you wouldn't buy it anymore and no matter all their propaganda and all their TV ads telling you it's good for you it didn't work
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:24.240]  we have the medical science we have the studies the truth is out so now they want to change the name entirely without to tell you what's in it
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:33.240]  and they already have that where they say natural and artificial flavors or artificial and natural flavors they can call fructose corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:47.240]  or its derivatives natural flavors they can call aspartame artificial flavors so become aware of that they're always playing games just because you beat them once they're going to come back
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:04:01.240]  they know the prize belongs to who fights the hardest they know the jewel of liberty belongs to who stands up the strongest
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:06.240]  and I'm going to talk more about solutions today and I got a big list of issues I want to cover
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:12.240]  and just thoughts on the new world order and a bunch of news here in front of me that we'll get to as well today
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:20.240]  but Bob Bowman always informative coming up in the next segment investigators easily smuggled bomb material in the government buildings
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:27.240]  this is Paul Joseph Watson prisonplanet.com the Washington Post AP and Reuters are all reporting on it we have links to Washington Post here
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:35.240]  this is a report by the government accountability office and inadvertently this credits a claim often made by 9-11 truth debunkers that bombs could not have been smuggled into the 20 hours
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:43.240]  or buildings said without being noticed by security in the past year investigators successfully smuggled bomb making materials into 10 high security federal buildings
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:48.240]  constructed bombs and walked around the buildings undetected reports the Washington Post
[1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:53.240]  that's because the government knows there's no real threat of terrorists unless it's them about to do it
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:05:00.240]  you understand that of course there's no it's not real security when they run out and arrest you for photographing it's just to let you know you're a slave

[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:40.240]  Dr. Bob Bowman he's a former director of advanced space programs development for the US Air Force in the Ford and Carter administrations
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  in a former United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with 101 combat missions

[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:55.240]  and it goes despite his involvement with space programs and defense he emerged as an early public critic
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:09:00.240]  of the strategic defense initiative because it was a decapitation offensive weapon system
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:09.240]  during the Ronald Reagan administration and on the McLeil news hour he called it the ultimate military lunacy easily overwhelmed

[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:29.240]  really the whole two-party system you agree with me that we've got to shatter this whole left right idea because the power structure
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:36.240]  just keeps sharing power between the false left and right and so we never really get a true revolution or change or
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:41.240]  I mean you said you told me you've seen the Obama deception what's your take on the whole state of affairs
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:53.240]  okay well I agree with you absolutely and what I've been doing for about the last 9 years is trying to shatter this left right division
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:11:03.240]  because we the American people have been artificially divided by the powers to be the global elite the global robber barons if you will
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:15.240]  they have artificially divided us into liberal and conservative they've taken their one party and divided it into two parts
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:23.240]  and split up the hot button issues you know you guys be for abortion you guys be for against it you guys be for gun control you be against it
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:33.240]  you be for school prayer you be against it the thing that makes all of those issues in common besides the fact that the federal
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:40.240]  government probably has no business mucking around with them in the first place is that the global elite could care less how it comes out
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:52.240]  those issues do not affect their bottom line so they really don't care they don't care which party wins in general ever since John F. Kennedy
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:12:03.240]  every nominee of both the Republican and Democratic parties has been a member of the trilateral commission and handpicked by them
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  for the nomination of their party JFK was the last nominee of either party not to be a member of the trilateral commission
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:23.240]  of course we know what happened to him we have to end this artificial division we have to bring the American people together left and right
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:34.240]  and we've been very successful in that in the last few years many of the events on my speaking tour each year are co-sponsored by the Green Party
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:43.240]  and the Libertarian Party they're co-sponsored by the Ron Paul meetups and the Dennis Kosinich meetups I mean this is really coming together
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:54.240]  and it's working and these people are recognizing that they have common interest that both the left and the right have been alienated
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:13:03.240]  and mistreated by our government and the powers that be well I want to give some solutions and also talk about what's happening in the current world
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:15.240]  and your view on Barack Obama but addressing the viewers out there Bob can you explain to them how the two party system became this divide and conquer mechanism
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:22.240]  because people still email me and call me and say now explain to me how the two parties are controlled or explain to me no matter who gets in office
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:28.240]  the consolidation of power happens the corporate looting happens I mean break that down for folks
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:40.240]  well I mean it goes way back to time with Thomas Jefferson he warned us about power corporations and Teddy Roosevelt did it and on and on right through Dwight David Eisenhower
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:50.240]  who warned us about the military industrial complex which is essentially the same thing now the whole problem got a lot worse in the 19th century
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:14:04.240]  when the railroad somehow got a Supreme Court justice to talk about corporate personhood and the myth of corporate personhood has gone on to this day
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  and has been parlayed by the corporations into a First Amendment free speech right to spend as much money as they want buying up politicians and buying up votes with their corporate controlled media
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:37.240]  now the next real big acceleration of this fascist trend happened under Reagan when they got rid of the FCC ban on ownership of multiple media outlets
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:57.240]  and allowed these media conglomerates to get a monopoly until now we've got almost every major media outlet being controlled by six multinational corporations
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:12.240]  with interlocking boards of directors all of which are in bed with the weapons manufacturers the oil companies and all the others who are running things
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:29.240]  and because of that they collude every four years to work with the trilateralists and builder burgers and council on foreign relations to make sure that their handpicked nominees
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:37.240]  get the nomination of the Republican and Democratic parties and once they can do that then they don't care who wins the general election
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:46.240]  they know one of their guys is going to get it it's a choice between Tweedledee and Tweedledum in some cases Tweedledum and Tweedledummer
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:55.240]  but that's how they do it essentially and then Congress of course who the Constitution really gives the power to
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:16:12.240]  Congress has been bought and paid for by the K Street lobbyists the corporate lobbyists to the point where almost all the members of Congress with the exception of people like Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich and a few others
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:27.240]  almost all of them are bought and paid for and have abdicated their responsibility to Dick Cheney's invention of the unitary executive in other words the imperial presidency
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:41.240]  and since they have their guy under their thumb in the presidency and the Congress becomes immaterial and so what you have is our government under direct control
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:52.240]  of the corporations we have energy policy being made by Enron we have agricultural policy being made by Archer Daniels Midland and Monsanto
[1:16:52.240 --> 1:17:07.240]  defense policy being made by the weapons manufacturers it goes on and on almost every regulatory agency in the government is headed by an executive of the corporations that they're supposed to regulate
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:17.240]  so we have complete corporate control of government at the highest levels and that's exactly what Benito Mussolini defined as fascism
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:24.240]  and now you should know and I wanted to ask you about this and you can repeat that I've interrupted you or add any points
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:41.240]  now that they use so-called free market terms and freedom of speech to rig the game and buy everything up and consolidate and create these oligopolies or these cartels working as a monopoly I guess a monopoly capitalism would be the term
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:54.240]  now they're doing a mopping up operation the name of stopping extremist and racist from having free speech that the house has passed the hate crimes bill that actually states if the government says you hurt somebody's feelings
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:18:06.240]  or what you said might lead to someone doing something violent even if you didn't call for it I've never seen a hate crime bill this strong that has now passed the house the cyber bullying thing says the same deal
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:17.240]  we have the New York Times saying we need internet gatekeepers we need to the CEO, Rupert Murdoch CEO said two days ago arrest bloggers put them in jail
[1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:29.240]  so they're saying we don't get any free speech so now that we're actually getting an alternative voice and challenging them now that their hypocrisy and imperial hubris is so obvious they're moving to block our free speech
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:49.240]  can you comment on the empire's consolidation? Oh absolutely and you know the height of this fascist hypocrisy is Glenn Beck saying that 9-11 truthers are terrorists out to destroy this country
[1:18:49.240 --> 1:19:02.240]  we got the 9-11 truthers are essential to saving this country because of all the evil that has been done in the name of 9-11 and is still being done in the name of 9-11
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:18.240]  you know there are people out there who know that the Bush administration's official conspiracy theory on 9-11 was total hogwash but they say well that's ancient history and you know who cares
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:39.240]  we have to understand that even President Obama is out there expanding the war in Afghanistan putting the war into Pakistan and blaming it on 9-11 so until we destroy the government myth and get some real truth out there
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:51.240]  the evil will continue no matter who is president and I think that's the message we need to get out there to the truth community that they are absolutely essential and they must not give up
[1:19:51.240 --> 1:20:00.240]  Butter Bob Oman got a break come back and complete that statement I mean I really agree with what you're saying presidents come and go the shadow government remains the same

[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:07.240]  yeah
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:12.240]  morning at the mine, you could see him arrive. He stood six foot six. Dr. Bob Bowman is our
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:17.920]  guest and time flies when you've got a great political mind like this with you. We're going
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:24.320]  to be talking to a pastor who's fighting against the hate crimes bill the next hour. So I wanted
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:27.680]  to have you finish your thought when we were talking during the break about what Teddy
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:32.800]  Roosevelt's quote. So can you repeat what we were discussing here privately? I mean,
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:36.520]  now they consolidated their power. Now it's obvious the Federal Reserve's private. We
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:41.640]  have this banking Wall Street Goldman Sachs, you know, holding shares in the New York Fed
[1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:46.880]  openly with their former executive feeding them all the money. I mean, now the public
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:50.760]  is really starting to get mad and wake up. And now we're hearing, oh, Northcom's going
[1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:56.120]  to have troops on the streets. Oh, now we're going to have local CIA offices. Oh, I mean,
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:25:00.480]  this is across between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, in my view. So I want you to
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:04.400]  speak to the whole police state as well. But this attack on the First Amendment. Yeah,
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:10.880]  well, the First Amendment is designed to protect we, the people, the dissenters. That's what
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:17.000]  it's about. It's not designed to protect the people who are defending government actions.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:21.720]  It's designed to protect those of us who are criticizing the government. That's what the
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:32.080]  founding fathers planned. That's what all of our great statesmen have said. Teddy Roosevelt,
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:39.600]  great Republican president, great fighter of the corporations, said that dissent is
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:46.800]  the highest form of patriotism. By the way, that's one reason why I've renamed our organization
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:54.240]  from the Institute for Space and Security Studies to the Patriots. And the organization
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:26:02.400]  is the same 501c3 that's been going on for 27 years, whistleblowing and myth busting and
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:08.320]  telling the truth. But now the name is the Patriots has been for the last couple of years.
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:17.760]  And our website is thepatriots.us. There's a lot of us in this country involved in truth
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:26.320]  telling. You're one of the greatest. We are the ones that the First Amendment was written to protect.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:34.480]  So it's there for not just unpopular speech, but popular speech. I mean,
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:38.240]  we're with the Constitution Bill of Rights. Most polls agree with us. It's not that it's even
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:41.920]  for unpopular speech, though it protects that as well. It's for the speech the establishment
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:46.800]  doesn't like. That's right. That's right. If you look at Project Censored, for example,
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:55.200]  to every year they repeat 25 stories which have been self censored out by the corporate monopoly
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:01.440]  media. And the thing that ties those all together, the thing they have in common,
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:09.520]  is not sloppy journalism or carelessness. It's that those 25 stories are dangerous to the
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:21.440]  establishment. They break the myths by which the corporate government fascist entity controls the
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:30.640]  people, brainwashes them, and keeps them docile and ignorant. You got interrupted by the break.
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:35.120]  You were talking about how important it is to break the 9-11 myth because so much of the
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:41.840]  tyranny we're now living under has been built on that. Openly, Bush and now Obama are publicly
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:46.320]  switching the entire apparatus of Homeland Security and Northcom around saying, oh,
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:51.040]  it's for gun owners. It's for liberals. It's for libertarians. It's for animal rights activists.
[1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:56.160]  It's for land rights activists. And these federal reports list everybody. Basically,
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:00.480]  anybody who's politically active in any way is spied on. And now they admit the Department of
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:06.160]  Defense has regular army spying on Ron Paul and myself. We got the documents and they go to
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:11.920]  in the Fed protests and they're spying on peaceful peace activists at cookie bakes. I mean, they're
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:17.120]  spying on everybody. Aren't they the terrorists? Isn't that anti-American? Well, of course it is.
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:25.760]  Of course it is. And that's why we've got to insist, all of us, that we are the patriots.
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:37.280]  We are the patriots. They are the terrorists. Those in and around our government are the terrorists.
[1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:47.280]  And, you know, there are a lot of people out there, a lot of my buddies, retired military officers
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:56.640]  who know a lot of the truth, but they're intimidated because they want to be patriotic. So they
[1:28:56.640 --> 1:29:02.640]  support the government. Baloney, supporting the government is not what's patriotic. It's doing
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:08.560]  what's right. It's following the Constitution, honoring the truth, serving the people. Our
[1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:14.720]  government does not do that. We are the ones that are doing that. We are the patriots. They are the
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:20.320]  terrorists. Well, I hate to use the overused Hitler parallel, but so much parallels that.
[1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:27.600]  The German military, which had a lot of spree decor and a great past, they got beguiled and
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:32.720]  sold out thinking patriotism was following Hitler. Instead of patriotism is really what
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:38.480]  Operation Valkyrie tried to do, saying no. But this New World Order system isn't in one man in a
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:43.120]  furor. It's a system. I want to talk about the architecture of the New World Order, what's happening
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:48.000]  with Obama and a lot more when we get back. Long segment coming up with Bob Bowman. Stay with us.
[1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:57.840]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:04.960]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the

[1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:05.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:09.920]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:15.200]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:20.320]  to have. It's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:25.120]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:29.200]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[1:31:29.200 --> 1:31:33.360]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[1:31:33.360 --> 1:31:38.560]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.960]  peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:49.760]  Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:21.360]  You're on personal Jesus.
[1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:29.280]  Someone to hear you prayer. More of a great discussion behind the scene for Dr. Bob Bowman.
[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:33.120]  And I know we got Reverend Ted Pike on about the hate crime bill. We'll have it on about 15
[1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:36.960]  after. So let's just call and let him know that hate crime bill is important. We'll have it on for
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:42.640]  45 minutes today. But I want to have as much time with Dr. Bob Bowman as possible here in studio.
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:49.120]  Okay. From your perspective and then I want to spend some time on Star Wars because that's
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:53.200]  certainly not dead. That's going on now. This global decapitation system and a lot of what you
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:58.000]  told me privately. It wasn't classified. You said it. Some of it leaked out. So you could tell me
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:02.560]  about it is now kind of coming out in the news. I wanted to discuss this global decapitation
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:08.160]  system and what that means for these these controllers. But the architecture of this
[1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:12.240]  global corporate state from your decades of deep research and also working in some of the most
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:16.880]  secret black programs, although you were compartmentalized to a certain extent, but in your world
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:21.360]  travels and knowing a lot of world leaders, what is the architecture of the new world order? What
[1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:26.080]  is the new world order? What is its end game? Because for my research, it's eugenics and control
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:32.720]  and enslavement. And then looking at Obama, you know, is he kind of the new order closer or
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:37.440]  can we make him rebel against them? Or will they destroy him if that happens? But I mean,
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:42.640]  let's just start with the architecture of the new world order. Well, I think the architecture of
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:49.520]  the new world order is, of course, the Council of Foreign Relations, the Tri-Lateral Commission,
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:57.360]  the Bilderbergers, the the guys that came out of the old Cecil Rhodes organization, the corporate
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:06.400]  the corporate governing councils. Yeah. But then there's the the the operating arm, really,
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:17.360]  is the World Trade Organization, the IMF and the World Bank. And with those, and of course,
[1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:26.720]  since it's under their thumb, the U.S. government and their enforcers of the U.S. military. And
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:35.360]  we talked before about the military and what happened in Nazi Germany and what's happening here.
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:45.200]  One thing that I've always said and people mentioned, what about martial law? Are they
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:50.800]  going to do that? Are they going to round up all of us dissenters? And I said, who are they going
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:56.000]  to use? Because I don't think my buddies in the military will do it. I think they will
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:04.160]  encircle us and point their guns outward to protect us from Blackwater or Z, as they call it now.
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:07.680]  There's a terrorist organization, if ever there was one.
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:14.800]  That even sounds like a comic book name. I mean, if I was a pulp fiction author,
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:22.080]  Cobra or Z or chaos, I mean, Z. Yeah, yeah. I'm encouraged by the Oathkeepers.
[1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:29.120]  This is an organization that I've joined and many, many in the military and law enforcement have joined.
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:36.960]  And it recognizes the fact that our oath of office in the military, in politics,
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:42.480]  in law enforcement says that we will protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:49.680]  against all enemies foreign and domestic. I mean, we don't promise to obey a president
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:56.080]  or a commander. We promise to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:00.640]  against all enemies foreign and domestic, which, by the way, includes a renegade president,
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:09.040]  vice president. And so the Oathkeepers have said, in line with our duty to protect the Constitution,
[1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:14.000]  we are going to protect Americans who are following the Constitution.
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:21.760]  We are going to refuse any order to disarm American citizens or arrest American citizens
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:30.240]  or incarcerate American citizens when those citizens are merely exercising their constitutional rights.
[1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:35.520]  And I'm encouraged by that. Wow, that's great that you brought that up because we actually
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:42.240]  sent cameras up to the big Oathkeepers event on Lexington Green. And there they all were,
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:46.400]  just hundreds and hundreds of people from around the country and thousands
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:50.240]  on the Internet at Oathkeepers saying we're not going to go along with this because
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:54.960]  it's always been said that tyranny of it comes will come to your door in a uniform.
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:02.880]  And let's go back, though, to that power structure because I inadvertently interrupted you,
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:09.520]  seconding what you were saying. We have at the top the Council on Foreign Relations
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:15.120]  and a few other big think tanks that kind of set the policy. Well, I mean, you've got the
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:19.200]  robber and I mean, I want your view, but this is my view at the very top. You've got the big
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:24.000]  robber baron, royal families, the people that control the majority of the world's wealth,
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:29.200]  the the the monopoly capitalist, they'll fund fascist, they'll fund Soviets, they'll fund
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:33.440]  socialists, they'll fund whatever consolidates power. You've got them at the top, then you've got
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:40.240]  the big think tanks, the CFR kind of managing the five or six thousand superclasses. Rothkopf
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:44.240]  calls it in his book bragging about their power admitting they run the world. So that's kind
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:49.760]  of their big management team. And then they've got governmental and quasi governmental structures
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:54.400]  and regional roundtables over the different sectors and the enforcers are the military.
[1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:59.440]  But because the military in the West won't carry out these tyrannical actions by and large,
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:05.920]  because of lessons from history, they're now trying to create special cadres of paramilitary
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:12.960]  local SWAT teams all being expanded with local liaison military offices and local CIA offices.
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:19.040]  So I see them attempting to build the cadres up to brigade strength in a regional system. And they
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:24.080]  say local community FEMA camps where you want to come, you get food and medicine there. And
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:29.920]  they're artificially imploding the economy by design to kind of force people into their arms
[1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:34.960]  to reengineer the economy where everything is force fed into this kind of corporate strip
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:42.640]  mining system of vertical integration. Comments on that. Yeah, I mean, that's certainly a possibility
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:53.200]  what what I see is that essential to what they're doing is this whole thing of
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:40:03.840]  preventive war, wars of aggression, the the building of their empire by using the militaries
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:10.400]  of the United States and Great Britain and Israel. Don't the bad guys throughout history
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:14.800]  always they're the ones that do a preemptive war? I mean, of course, I mean, your own words,
[1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:23.280]  make that clear to the viewers out there. Well, preemptive war is another word for war of aggression.
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:28.800]  And it's a war crime. According to the Nuremberg principles, which the United States created
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:35.440]  and established at the end of World War Two, and on the basis of which we hung Nazi war criminals
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:44.400]  who were just following orders, we have established that work of aggression is a war crime. That is
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:52.720]  something that Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld should have been indicted for. And if it is continued
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:59.680]  much longer under the Obama administration, there are folks in the Obama administration
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:05.600]  that are putting themselves in danger of becoming war criminals. What I'm trying to do
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:14.640]  with the Oathkeepers is to expand the list of orders that they will disobey to include
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:21.120]  participating in any war of aggression. Well, I mean, that's what George Washington said.
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:27.120]  We don't get foreign entanglements. We don't go into foreign wars. We don't involve ourselves
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:34.960]  in anything unless we're being attacked. And then several presidents later, we then see Thomas
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:40.320]  Jefferson when some of the Barbary pirates, when some of the Moors were attacking some of our ships,
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:44.560]  we sent Marines out to deal with it. But that's something completely different than going into
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:52.960]  Iraq and leveling the place. Yeah, absolutely. And these wars of aggression are not only war
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:42:02.320]  crimes. They are unconstitutional. And they are treason against the United States of America.
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:09.520]  They are killing our young soldiers, our young men and women, using them as hired killers for
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:15.680]  the corporations. We've got to stop that. We have to say that according to the Constitution,
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:24.320]  we have got to have a military whose mission is to protect the American people and our borders.
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:32.560]  Period. Period. End of report. Not to protect the global financial interests of multinational
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:40.160]  corporations and banks. Bechtel, Halliburton, Exxon, Folgers, Chiquita Banana, you name it.
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:49.120]  What about the imperial hubris of Dyncor and Halliburton in the news running white slavery
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:53.920]  trafficking? And then Rumsfeld is asked about it by Cynthia McKinney when she was in Congress. And
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:57.760]  he says, I'm not going to discuss it. They were in the penalty box. Now they're out of the penalty
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:03.440]  box. They got a fine. No one goes to jail. But if somebody kidnaps a child down the street from
[1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:10.080]  a playground, there's amber alerts and freakouts. I mean, the level of looting the Goldman Sachs openly,
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:16.800]  you know, running the White House, the last two White Houses openly engaging in cash payments
[1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:22.720]  to themselves with their former executives running the treasury and running the Federal Reserve.
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:31.440]  Yeah. And on that note, I've got to say any corporation, any entity which is too big to fail
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:40.720]  is too big to exist. We used to have antitrust laws. We used to have anti-monopoly laws. It's
[1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:46.160]  time we did again. Isn't that just a mind game to say too big to fail? Or, well, yeah, the president
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:50.160]  ordered torture and it is illegal, but he's the president. And then you just give in to the
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:55.680]  dictatorship. You give in to the tyranny. It's that seduction. And then kindly, and then finally,
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:44:00.720]  you have a capitulation to evil. And it's just, oh, that's just the way it is. And then the sky's
[1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:11.040]  the limit. Yeah. And it all rests on the myths that we are told. And the antidote is the truth.
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:19.040]  And that's why what we are doing, Alex, you and I, and so many of our buddies, is so important.
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:28.480]  We've got to explode those myths because it's upon those myths like 9-11 that all the evil
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:39.600]  actions get carried out and excused off and justified. There are a lot of these truths that
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:51.920]  we need to expose, not just 9-11. For example, I'd like to expose all the myths that we've been told
[1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:59.280]  about the murders of our soldiers in the field, especially the women. Most of them are women.
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:07.360]  I think families have a right to know what really happened to soldiers like Pat Tillman and Levina
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:14.320]  Johnson. Now, most of the viewers know who Pat Tillman is. You know, football star turned,
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:20.480]  war hero turned, conscientious objector, which the army said was killed in action. Then they said,
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:28.000]  well, it was really friendly fire. But there is a lot of evidence that that so-called friendly fire
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:33.680]  came from less than 10 feet. And he was really fragged because he was turning against the war.
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:38.960]  And that would be embarrassing to the establishment. Well, the army's own internal reports that the
[1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:42.960]  family had been brought out, and I've actually talked to the family, was that they shot him. He
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:47.280]  hid behind a rock and he said, hey, I'm Pat Tillman. What's your problem? And they walked right up and
[1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:54.720]  did him. And my God, those soldiers followed that order, I guess by the, probably the CIA in the
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:59.520]  field. Because Pat was sending letters home saying, I'm going to come home and speak out
[1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:06.080]  against this fraud. We're guarding the OPM. I even heard BBC admit about a month ago on XM that,
[1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:10.720]  oh, yes, the U.S. troops are guarding the OPM and letting the farmers sell it so the Taliban
[1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:16.640]  doesn't get a foothold. The Taliban runs those fields. And now there's heroin all over the streets.
[1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:21.440]  It was on local news last night that everybody's on heroin now in Austin. I mean, the government
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:26.480]  openly ships it in. They'll openly kill Pat Tillman. But now, see, that's patriotic. Oh,
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:30.960]  we have to kill Pat. It's for America. We've got to ship heroin for the kids, Bob.
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:35.520]  Yeah. Well, you know, and, but I bet you most of the people out there never even heard of
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:43.920]  Levina Johnson. Tell folks about her. Well, Levina Johnson was a young American girl,
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:52.960]  African American, lovely Christian virgin. She volunteered to fight in Iraq. Her body was found
[1:46:52.960 --> 1:47:01.120]  in a Halliburton tent. Her body was shipped home. Her parents in a closed casket. Her parents told
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:06.560]  not to open the casket. Well, her father was a physician. Still is. And I've talked to him
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:12.640]  personally. He opened the casket and he examined his daughter. Her brains had been blown out. There
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:18.880]  were bruises all over her body. Her hands were badly burned, too badly burned to hold a gun,
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:26.320]  for example. And her genitals had acid poured on them in an apparent attempt to destroy DNA
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:36.720]  evidence. The army ruled it a suicide. A government that honors the truth must seek out the truth
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:41.600]  and then tell the truth. And by God, we have to demand that. Well, that's what I was going to
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:47.280]  point out is that once you give in to evil, it's all over. Sky's the limit. And these
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:51.840]  psychological warfare chiefs, they cold-bloodily knew when they had Rumsfeld come out and go,
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:56.320]  we're taking off the gloves. We're doing it for America. This was a seduction of evil.
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:48:00.320]  And then as soon as you say torture is okay, then the Washington Post had an article going,
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:03.280]  yeah, we're doing stuff for their kids in front of them. And then McLeod,
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:07.520]  Sheikh Mohammed confessed everything but killing Kennedy and sinking the Lusitania
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:11.760]  and bombing buildings that weren't built till four years after he was incarcerated. And they were
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:18.160]  waterboarding multiple times a week for years. It turned out that was all staged. Some of the
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:24.080]  torturers of some of the detainees said, well, we were ordered to, here's our national security
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:30.160]  letter. They arrested the torturers and use the Patriot Act to gag them. That was in the news.
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:36.560]  So the issue here is even the torturers will be sold out. Why do all of these people for money
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:43.280]  printed out of nothing by the private banks sell their entire souls? And then it becomes
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:48.400]  unpatriotic when they're killing all these Marine Corps and Army investigators in corruption.
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:55.200]  And they're killing all these officers and all this corruption is set in. And then now the C-130s
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:01.040]  are collapsing with buckets to use the bathroom in, but the officers have new jets with like pleasure
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:07.280]  palaces in them with secretaries. I mean, this is like Rome burning and Nero's guzzling wine up on
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:18.480]  the parapet. I mean, this is disintegration level. It is. For the last 30 years, I've been quoting
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:26.880]  scripture. Psalm 33, a king is not saved by his mighty army. Warriors not saved by his great strength.
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:34.240]  The war horse is a vain hope for victory in its in its mighty cannot save. Psalm 37 gives the
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:41.440]  prescription for national security. It says trust in the Lord and do good that you may dwell in the
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:49.920]  land and have security by accepting the evil. We are destroying this country and its security.
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:55.760]  And it's incredible. It's like the new order really are like alchemist or or magicians. They
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:50:00.400]  got a spell on the people of darkness. They're obsessed with petty issues. They can't tell good
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:08.720]  from bad. They accept the evil, not knowing it destroys the whole system or not care. I mean,
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:16.560]  let's face it. These people that we're talking about who are guilty of this evil are motivated
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:30.640]  by greed and power, money and power. And it doesn't matter whether you say, oh, they want a fascist
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:36.160]  new world order or they want a communist new world order. It doesn't matter. What they want
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:44.720]  is the money and power. And we have to take it away from them. We have to separate big money
[1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:50.880]  from political power in this country. And that's not easy to do, but we have to do it.
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:56.080]  We have to have a government which is not bought and paid for by those big money interests.
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:51:01.040]  Bob, gotta break, gotta break. This is amazing stuff. Let me ride back more, Bob Bowman.

[1:51:15.840 --> 1:51:20.560]  involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible

[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:10.400]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:16.480]  world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:21.600]  myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:27.120]  fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:33.440]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:41.280]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:49.040]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy

[1:54:13.360 --> 1:54:17.200]  All right, we've got Reverend Jet Plank coming up in about 20 minutes, middle of the next segment,
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:23.760]  in the second after next, 15 after he was. Bob Bowman, it's just wonderful having you here.
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:29.200]  It's great to have you here in town with us, and I'm making another Obama film,
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:33.280]  and I thought about having you in that and just thought, oh, he's busy, and I'm busy,
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:38.320]  and I kind of rush that out. That film had five interviews. This one's got 10. This will be the
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:44.720]  11th. I'm doing one more. This film is just jam-packed, and it's just perfect to have you,
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:47.680]  and you've now agreed that you want to be in the film, so you're going to be in the next
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:52.880]  Obama film. I haven't released the name yet, but that will be out in October, folks. We're
[1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:55.600]  taking our time on this. I was going to release it quickly, but I'm taking my time.
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:00.080]  But we're going to talk about Obama now coming up in his list of betrayals,
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:03.360]  and again, we're not attacking Obama in a left-right paradigm. We're attacking
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:08.160]  to show he's a deceiver, a betrayer, and Bob was probably saying if he does buck him,
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:12.160]  they'll destroy him like they've done others. But before we go there, tell folks about your
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:21.120]  speaking tour. Well, I've had a couple of events so far, and there are dozens to come. We're covering
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:26.640]  the eastern half of the country this summer in four and a half months. We're not trying to do the
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:31.600]  whole country this year like we have the last few. Speaking in Austin tonight at Brave New Books at
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:37.440]  seven o'clock on the 11th, we're speaking in the Dallas area. We're going from there to Oklahoma
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:43.440]  City and then Tulsa and up to Kansas City and on, and people can check the website,
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:54.720]  ThePatriots.us, and find out where we're going to be when, and people can call me on my cell
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:56:01.920]  phone for goodness sakes. I have it with me. They can call the organizers. The organizers are
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:12.000]  listed in a document that's been sent around. So ThePatriots.us, and you're going to be speaking
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:17.440]  of Brave New Books down at the end of Guadeloupe off the drag. Great bookstore, great place down
[1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:22.240]  there this evening. So folks, be sure to get there early. So it's got room for about 150 folks,
[1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:27.360]  and it's pretty much always standing room only if you get there late. But regardless,
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:32.160]  it's a great event and great folks down there at Brave New Books. Now, Bob, this is a short segment.
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:38.000]  We're almost out of time here today, and I've got some sponsors I need to thank here for just a
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:42.160]  moment, but then we're going to come back to you in just a second, and we're going to keep you for
[1:56:42.160 --> 1:56:45.920]  15 more minutes getting into Obama, getting into the globalist agenda, what's going to happen if
[1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:51.600]  they hit Iran. Before we do that, I want you to know about some of the folks that have made
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:59.200]  today's show possible, and that's New Silver Solution. A New Silver Solution is what I use
[1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:05.200]  in my house if one of my kids has an infection, or if I've got a cold. It's antiviral and
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:10.400]  antibacterial. Now, nothing is a silver bullet, pun intended, but silver has been proven for a
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:14.720]  long time, and this has been clinically proven to just have a massive effect. And we've had a
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:19.680]  lot of medical doctors here on air when nothing's working with these bacteria and viruses to say
[1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:27.200]  that nano silver is the way to go. So supernaturalsilver.com, supernaturalsilver.com, and there's
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:34.240]  banners up on infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com. So be sure and check out supernaturalsilver.com
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:39.280]  today. Every cupboard, every medicine cabinet needs to have it. Also, another one of our fine
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:44.800]  sponsors I want to tell you about is HomeGain, and this is a great service. It's a free service.
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:52.080]  It's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com, homegain.com. You can simply visit their site and or click
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:59.360]  through on maxlittleorangegorillaoninfowars.com, and they have a whole bunch of free services
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:03.120]  there. Again, the whole site's free at homegain.com. They have Street View where you can look at the
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:07.280]  house, street level, and take a virtual walk through the neighborhood. You're interested in.
[1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:11.760]  You've got to see it for yourself, and again, it's absolutely free. I personally like the
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:16.320]  home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's
[1:58:16.320 --> 1:58:20.800]  value before you put it on the market, and it's absolutely free. And they have another system
[1:58:20.800 --> 1:58:24.880]  where you put in your home address, and it tells you what the realtors are really seeing internally
[1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:30.160]  of what they think the value is on your home, whether they're underestimating or overestimating
[1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:35.200]  with what they're publicly telling you. So that's homegain.com, homegain.com,
[1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:40.320]  homegain.com, and my websites of course are infowars.com and prismplanet.tv.

[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:21.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:31.040]  By the way, you know who else is going to be in the new Obama film? You know what,
[2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:36.320]  I'm not going to announce it. This thing's got everybody. It's crazy. And they all really make
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.400]  key points. It all comes together as a synergy. Most of these guys don't even know each other,
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:46.320]  but they're all on the same page for liberty and freedom. Okay, Bob, I've got a bunch of
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:51.520]  rapid-fire questions. Barack Obama. I mean, he said he wasn't going to hire lobbyists,
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:56.000]  in your own words, as well as taping for the live film. You know, go over it. He's lying about not
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:00.160]  hiring lobbyists. He's lying about signing statements. He's lying about not raising taxes
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:06.160]  unless you're above $250,000 a year. It's a huge stunt where they've moved some of the troops out
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:11.520]  of a few cities and redrawn the lines of Baghdad and five other cities where the bases are on
[2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:15.520]  the cities and the troops are there, but they're just now saying that isn't part of the city.
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:19.440]  They're playing all sorts of semantical and statistical games. They're increasing troops
[2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:24.320]  to 100,000 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. They're escalating the great game and divide and conquer
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:30.000]  there. I mean, I didn't like slick willy. I didn't like George W. Bush. I didn't like George Bush's
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:35.760]  daddy. I didn't like any of these guys, but Obama, he said, I mean it. I pledge this is real.
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:40.240]  You can trust me. And I mean, is he the new world order closer? I mean, we know he's filled
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:45.280]  his administration with old brass of the neocons. And is it only people like Fox,
[2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:52.000]  Phelan or Fallon quitting that are stopping them from attacking Iran with Biden saying green light,
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:02:03.840]  baby, go in? I'm not sure, but I, I hope that Obama will return to what he knows is right.
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:15.280]  I mean, he is not a bumbling ignoramus puppet like we've had. He is intelligence. He is articulate.
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:22.560]  He is charismatic. And this makes him far more dangerous than George W. Bush. If he allows
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:29.680]  himself to be used, but because he is intelligent, because he used to be a community organizer,
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:36.240]  because of what he said in the past, I believe he really wants to do the right thing by the American
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:45.600]  people, but he doesn't know how to do it. And we're going to tell him how to do it. But isn't
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:51.520]  that the best kind of Judas go is somebody who believes that they're selling the magic elixir
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:56.640]  or whatever? I mean, I agree he's charismatic. He's slick, but he is reading off a teleprompter
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:02.240]  written by the military industrial complex. You speak of a teleprompter. I think that he is so
[2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:08.480]  intelligent that he's going to see through it at some point. And like Jimmy Carter, he's going to
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:16.000]  turn against his masters. And Carter had the presidency essentially taken out of his hands by
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:25.360]  his big new burjinsky. Obama has the same mentor, big new burjinsky. And we know that there's going
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:32.000]  to be a struggle if Obama says, I'm not doing this anymore. I promised real change and what I've
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.760]  given the American people is chump change. We're going to have real change and I'm going to start
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:43.200]  serving the people and you guys in the big corporations, you know, sorry about that.
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:47.120]  Well, Bob, he revels though, and we'll talk more about this in the final segment coming up.
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:52.240]  He revels when I'm watching him, his body language. He is relishing all these lies. He's
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:04:00.560]  relishing betraying the people. I mean, he is really getting into it. And I know what I'm
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:05.360]  seeing on his face and I know you're hoping that he'll reverse course. But I mean, do you admit
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:13.440]  he has completely done a 180 from what he said he would do? Sure. He has done some good things.
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:21.360]  He has made some positive changes. But like I say, the token change, chump change for him to
[2:04:21.360 --> 2:04:29.600]  really come around is going to be dangerous to him. Barak's one weakness, it seems, is that he
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:37.440]  liked he wants to be liked by everybody, including the global elites. And the fact is, you can't
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:43.840]  serve two masters and he is at some point going to have to decide whether he's going to carry
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:53.040]  through on his free election pledges to serve us, the American people, or if he's going to
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:58.240]  continue to serve those global elites that he is surrounded himself with. All right, stay there.
[2:04:58.240 --> 2:05:03.440]  We got a break. Climb back with Bob Bowman. What can you do to keep you and your family safe

[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:27.920]  Final segment with Dr. Bob Bowman here in studio. This is coming up in the next segment for us
[2:08:27.920 --> 2:08:33.840]  the hour. We've got Reverend Ted Pike joining us to break down the hate crimes legislation.
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:40.640]  Let's pass the house. And it's so draconing and it makes my head spin. I mean, it just outright
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:45.200]  gets rid of the First Amendment. Okay, Bob, you were continuing. You know, looking at Obama,
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:50.240]  everything that Clinton set up was a foundation for Bush. Everything Bush set up was a foundation
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:57.600]  now for Obama. And Obama, whether it's draconing and gun control or expanding wars,
[2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:03.040]  or bringing in more corporate lobbyists or banking looting, it doesn't matter what it is,
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:08.800]  or a tax on free speech with all this legislation. I mean, it's even got my head spinning that
[2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:13.920]  they're moving this fast and they're getting so much of it passed or on the verge of passing.
[2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:20.320]  Is this the system starting to panic or in your view? I mean, speak to that. Do you agree
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:24.080]  there are rushing things right now? And why are they rushing things? Is it because things are
[2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:29.520]  going so well? Or is this a failing forward because they see the audit of the Fed building? They see
[2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:33.520]  people becoming knowledgeable about the power structure and its architecture. They see the
[2:09:33.520 --> 2:09:40.720]  military waking up. What's happening? Oh, I think they're very worried. They're worried about all
[2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:46.400]  of us dissenters. They're worried about Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich working together,
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:52.640]  old friends of mine. They're worried about the 9-Eleven Truth Movement. They're worried about
[2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:59.600]  Obama and their control over him. I think they're greatly worried and they're trying to get done
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:07.840]  what they need to get done. I sent Obama an inaugural address. He didn't use it, but those are the
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:18.400]  things that he ought to do. He needs to reverse course. He needs to get rid of all 1,100 signing
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:25.520]  statements of George W. Bush and promise that he's not going to do that because the Constitution
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:32.560]  doesn't give the president the power to make legislation or un-make it. It gives that to
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:42.560]  the Congress, the people's representatives. He needs to do away with presidential directives 20
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:50.160]  and 51, which give him dictatorial powers. He needs to tell Congress that they've got to repeal
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:57.520]  the misnamed Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act. He has to get rid of all of the
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:05.120]  executive orders and legislation, which is the foundation of martial law and the incarceration
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:10.880]  of the U.S. citizens. That's a key point I forgot to even make in this film we're making, so please
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:18.560]  make it now, Dr. Bowman. With more details, he's keeping everything Bush is doing on the signing
[2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:26.400]  statements in the police state and the Patriot Act and now saying, yeah, even if these detainees
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:32.080]  are found not guilty in kangaroo courts, we're still going to hold them. I mean, that's throw
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:38.000]  you in the dungeon, throw away the key, the bedrock of tyranny, is it not? Absolutely, absolutely.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:45.760]  And he's got to do away with that. He's got to release all those detained without charge. He has
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:53.280]  to really close Guantanamo Bay and tell the American people, don't worry, we'll find somewhere else
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:12:02.240]  for Bush and Cheney. I mean, he's got to make those bold steps. He's got to give us real change,
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:07.760]  change we can believe in. That's what he promised. That's what he has to do. The American people are
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:14.000]  not going to be satisfied with chump change and we know better. Okay, well, they're starting
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:20.240]  his President Obama's poll numbers are starting to really slide. And a lot of his supporters are
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:24.800]  saying, where is the change? This looks like more of the same, the same globalist corporate agenda,
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:28.800]  same new world order. What is going to happen when they try to give the Federal Reserve this
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:35.200]  fault, total power, not just over banking, but over all financial operations from a hot dog stand to
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:44.320]  a golf club park? I mean, what's going to happen as people realize it is change, but more change
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:48.880]  towards tyranny and consolidation of power because clearly right now that's where it's going. If Obama
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:53.840]  doesn't change course, what do you see happening in the future domestically on Main Street, but also
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:12:57.920]  with Iran and Pakistan? If he stays the course, where is this agenda taking us?
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:05.280]  It has been said by some very good people, those who make
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:13.680]  peaceful revolution, revolution, impossible, make violent revolution inevitable. Start over.
[2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:19.840]  That was great. I interrupted. It's helping you. Go ahead. Those who make peaceful change
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:28.640]  impossible, make violent revolution inevitable. I heard that many times when I was sharing the
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:36.320]  stage with William Sloan Coffin and of course he got it from the Kennedys and it's true.
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:48.560]  The only way we're going to save this country is through a nonviolent revolution. We need
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:57.360]  exactly what Obama promised. Well, I described a nonviolent revolution. Here's Ocean Spray Cranberry
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:02.160]  drink and I couldn't buy this for the last decade because it had high fructose corn syrup in it,
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:05.920]  which has been proven in a lot of studies to be linked to diabetes and a lot of problems.
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:09.840]  Also, for some reason, it has high levels of mercury. In fact, people won't believe it.
[2:14:09.840 --> 2:14:15.040]  Put the Washington Post up. Half of corn syrup products have mercury in it and so I couldn't
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:21.600]  drink it. But now suddenly it has pure sugarcane in it as its ingredient. That was because the
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:28.320]  people stopped buying anything with high fructose corn syrup overnight. It's vanishing like a vapor
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:34.640]  at morning like phantoms at dawn. There is a microcosm of us voting with our dollars and our
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:40.240]  ideas and by getting the word out person to person and then voting with our dollars.
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:50.560]  But right now I am hoping that Obama will give us some real leadership. He's the only president
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:15:01.920]  we've got and I'm not giving up on him yet, but we can't wait forever. He may only have four years
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:12.480]  and he's got to take action and take it now. Absolutely. I mean, I'm making a big deal out
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:20.240]  of this today. This is a huge victory, Bob, that this product and many others has high
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:25.120]  fructose corn syrup in it and now because the people saying no word of mouth, even with the
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:29.840]  big high fructose corn syrup, Archangels, Midland Propaganda ads that they've been running in the
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:35.840]  last year on every TV channel I've seen, they failed. Again, we have to get our spirit back. We
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:40.000]  have to say we don't have a broken spirit. We're not capitulating. We're not giving into your
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:45.840]  tyranny. We're not giving into a global corporate dictatorship. And with that said, your breakdown
[2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:52.160]  briefly on what's happening with the banking takeover, this engineered financial collapse,
[2:15:52.160 --> 2:15:57.360]  are they going to be successful? Well, they've already been successful in stealing hundreds of
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:03.840]  billions of dollars from the American people. It's, you know, pump all the money to the top,
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:07.840]  promise the people it's going to trickle down. And of course, it never does.
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:16.640]  And this is a part of it. And let me say it, if they're too big to fail, they're too big to exist.
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:21.360]  Absolutely. That said, just a few more quick questions while we've still got you here in
[2:16:21.360 --> 2:16:28.480]  studios for Reverend Ted Pike comes up. When you're out there across the land, when you're out there
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:34.640]  speaking to the people, I've already talked about HR 1207 to audit the Fed having 250 plus sponsors,
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:39.920]  even if the Senate runs a procedural scam and won't let it come to a vote. Now the people are
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:45.600]  saying, why are you hiding this? What are you covering up? People are now discovering the
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:50.160]  Federal Reserve is the real dictatorship that sits above the whole country. And I'm just seeing
[2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:54.720]  everywhere across the political spectrum on awakening. Can you speak to auditing the Fed and
[2:16:54.720 --> 2:17:01.440]  speak to what you're seeing across the country with an awakening? We not only need to audit the
[2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:11.200]  Fed and I certainly support that, but eventually we need to disband the Fed. We need to get rid of it.
[2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:18.000]  Many people say, well, giving the Fed more power is okay because we're going to nationalize it.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:23.280]  We're going to make it really federal. I mean, right now it's no more federal than Federal Express,
[2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:32.160]  but that doesn't do any good if the Federal Reserve becomes really a part of the government.
[2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:40.400]  That's going to be okay only if the government is still not ruled by these global money elites.
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:49.440]  And right now it is. So we have to keep spreading the message that the Federal Reserve is private.
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:57.520]  It has private stockholders like the Queen of England and a lot of other folks. They don't
[2:17:57.520 --> 2:18:03.680]  put a penny of their money at risk when they loan to the U.S. government. They're not loaning their
[2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:11.120]  own money. They're just putting an entry in a ledger and they're getting hundreds of billions
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:20.320]  of our tax dollars in interest payments every year when not a penny of their money is at risk.
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:28.000]  What kind of a return is that? It's infinite percent. This isn't even fractional reserves.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:33.040]  This isn't even fractional reserve banking. This is just complete flim flam fraud and
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:36.800]  through this magic checkbook they've gained the whole world. So of course they want to
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:40.800]  implode the economy and get us into debt. That's how they get control of us. That's how they get
[2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:46.480]  the real assets. Well, you're traveling across the country on a speaking tour. Folks can find out
[2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:56.560]  more of course at the website. Thepatriots.us. Thepatriots.us. Dr. Bob Bowman, it's great
[2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:00.400]  having you. We didn't have time to get into when you started speaking out against the
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:06.320]  Star Wars program as a decapitation weapon. Right. How you experienced the Rick game.
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:13.200]  Well, you said GE came and offered you a big buyout. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I got attempted bribery,
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:21.440]  attempted blackmail, death threats, IRS harassment. I got three audits in two years. The FBI and the
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:28.800]  CIA called me in. Yeah, they didn't like me speaking out and telling the American people.
[2:19:28.800 --> 2:19:33.520]  One of the offensive weapon disguised as defense. What did the CIA say when they called you in?
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:42.400]  Well, they didn't like the fact that I was traveling overseas speaking against actions of
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:52.800]  the US government. And, you know, as if not agreeing with government actions was somehow
[2:19:52.800 --> 2:20:00.240]  unpatriotic. And, you know, this whole idea is why we have to insist on free speech.
[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:07.760]  Attention, an important product from hempusa.org micro plant powder will change your life by
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:13.280]  removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses,
[2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:18.400]  and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients. Micro plant
[2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:24.160]  powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the
[2:20:24.160 --> 2:20:29.200]  blood, organs, spine, and brain. This product has the ability to rebuild cartilagin bone,
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:34.240]  which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints. Silica is a precursor to calcium,
[2:20:34.240 --> 2:20:39.360]  meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart. There is no better time
[2:20:39.360 --> 2:20:44.240]  than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter. And with an
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:52.560]  unlimited shelf life you can store it anywhere. Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org. It's a

[2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:05.760]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:09.520]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:14.640]  Well, the armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count. Now take that blank page of yours
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:19.520]  and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[2:21:19.520 --> 2:21:23.920]  The only real option is precious metals for your retirement, your kids' education,
[2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:27.760]  or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:31.680]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package,
[2:21:31.680 --> 2:21:36.240]  and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[2:21:36.240 --> 2:21:46.240]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128, that's 800-686-2237, extension 128,
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:50.160]  and together we can develop a make sense program before the clock runs out.
[2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:57.680]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128, and take charge of your future and thank you.
[2:21:57.680 --> 2:22:07.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:12.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:18.080]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:22.720]  the best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:28.160]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:35.040]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's
[2:22:35.040 --> 2:22:42.560]  fascism. It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government. This film documents
[2:22:42.560 --> 2:22:50.080]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception
[2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:58.000]  today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv, the Obama deception,
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:04.400]  the people strike back. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing
[2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:08.960]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real
[2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:13.280]  meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:16.880]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:21.360]  that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the
[2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:27.600]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless

[2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:37.520]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre

[2:23:56.240 --> 2:24:00.080]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:08.960]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:18.560]  a war on for your mind.
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:32.080]  Okay, he's a very busy man. He does hundreds of radio talk interviews. True Tellers is the
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:35.520]  website. We'll give you the full address here in a moment. He's Reverend Ted Pye,
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:42.000]  and he fights the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, the globalist who openly in Europe
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:46.480]  have banned free speech. They're banning it in Canada, and I have the bills here in front of me.
[2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:53.360]  This is past the House, and it has language I never saw before, which says whoever transmits an
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:57.760]  interstate or foreign commerce, any communication, that's the Internet, with the intent to coerce,
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:03.360]  intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress. And I've seen the federal judges argue,
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:07.040]  and he has the videos up on his site. Maybe we'll pull some of those up in a few minutes,
[2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:10.480]  where they're saying, no, if you hurt somebody's feelings, we're going to arrest you.
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:16.240]  So, substantial emotional distress to a person using electronic means to support severe repeated
[2:25:16.240 --> 2:25:21.920]  or hostile behavior. Hostile saying, I'm sick of your tyranny. Shall be fined under this title
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:26.080]  or in prison, not more than two years or both. And then it goes on to say anyone trying to
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:32.800]  influence politicians, anyone trying to, I mean, this is the end of free speech. This is the end
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.520]  of it. And they always say, oh, let's ban Nazi's free speech. Whether you love a Nazi's speech
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:41.920]  or hate a Nazi's speech, whether you love a Black Panther speech or hate their speech,
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:45.200]  whether you like Metsha saying they're the God race and for the race, everything,
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:51.920]  those outside the race, nothing. The point is, they sell this idea, and then they want to restrict
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.680]  everybody's free speech and are openly saying in congressional hearings, ban free speech, ban
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:04.480]  architects and engineers, and they put them up next to al-Qaeda training videos. So,
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:08.800]  nobody has fought this like Reverend Ted Pike, and I saw the language in this and didn't think it
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:13.280]  could pass the House. It has passed, folks. It has happened, just like the carbon bill and just
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:17.840]  like everything else is passing. This is the time the new owner's taken over. So, quick segment now,
[2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:21.120]  do this for the rest of the hour, maybe a little bit longer if you can do it. We have another
[2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:26.000]  guest coming up, Reverend Ted Pike, tell us what's happening. I've never seen things this
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:31.360]  ominous America in this much peril. Well, actually, Alex, what you were quoting there from is the
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:38.240]  anti-defamation League's anti-bullying bill, which is a separate bill, which is now in the House
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:43.600]  Judiciary. But I saw the same language in the hate bill, correct? Well, no. And that federalizes
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:49.760]  local police. Yeah, the hate bill, which is S-909 is a different piece of legislation, and that has
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:55.520]  passed the House. The anti-bullying bill is still in the House Judiciary. Now, what the
[2:26:55.520 --> 2:27:02.320]  federal hate crimes bill, S-909, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, says back in
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:08.880]  its original 1968 hate law, which was passed at the height of the civil rights movement just after
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:16.160]  Martin Luther King was killed, it says in Title 18, Section 2A, that anyone, a talk show host,
[2:27:16.160 --> 2:27:24.480]  a pastor, even a person on the street corner who uses language that might induce or incite some
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:30.240]  unstable person to commit a hate crime, he could be 2,000 miles away and hear you on the radio,
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:37.360]  then that original speaker can be tried as a principal in federal court right along with the
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:43.920]  active offender with a possible 10-year prison sentence. So you see this big federal hate bill,
[2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:50.080]  which could go for a vote next week in the Senate, is basically a series of amendments
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:57.040]  on that original 1968 law, which was basically a hate crime speech law, but it really couldn't
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:03.040]  be enforced effectively because of something called states' rights and law enforcement,
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:08.560]  which prohibited the federal government from coming down anytime it wanted and intervening
[2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:14.720]  and taking over in states' rights. All of those barriers, the six major barriers, will be washed
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:22.160]  away if the federal hate bill is passed in the Senate and basically what it will be doing is
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:29.360]  establishing a police state system, a perfect unity, a seamless unity between federal policing
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:38.640]  powers and local policing powers. Please continue. Yes, now the big problem this week is that
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:46.560]  Democrats have decided they are going to attach the hate bill, S909, on to the defense authorization
[2:28:46.560 --> 2:28:52.720]  bill, which is up for a vote perhaps as early as next Wednesday. Now, we have a tremendous
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:59.120]  opportunity here now to destroy the hate bill because two weeks ago, in the Senate Judiciary
[2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:05.040]  Committee, the Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, really, really messed up.
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:11.840]  He came in there with great prestige and for 45 minutes he was supposed to undergird and support
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:17.760]  and strengthen the hate bill. Actually, he did exactly the opposite. He shot off his mouth and
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:25.840]  he said that this hate bill, contrary to what it says on the first bill, the first page of S909,
[2:29:25.840 --> 2:29:31.520]  this bill will not protect all Americans according to race and religion and gender. No,
[2:29:31.520 --> 2:29:38.320]  he said this is a very specific bill meant to protect only historically persecuted groups
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:46.480]  like blacks, like homosexuals, like Jews, etc. So actually what this does is create a super group
[2:29:46.480 --> 2:29:53.040]  of super citizens, titles of nobility here in the United States. We're on the march,
[2:29:53.040 --> 2:29:58.320]  the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:58.320 --> 2:30:05.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this
[2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:10.560]  summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:16.160]  two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:30:16.160 --> 2:30:21.280]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:25.520]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:29.600]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:30:29.600 --> 2:30:33.760]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[2:30:33.760 --> 2:30:38.800]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:30:38.800 --> 2:30:42.720]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:47.200]  Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at

[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:08.560]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent
[2:32:08.560 --> 2:32:12.880]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own
[2:32:12.880 --> 2:32:17.120]  bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[2:32:17.120 --> 2:32:21.600]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[2:32:21.600 --> 2:32:26.160]  equation but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe
[2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:30.800]  from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports. And they do it at almost half
[2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:38.080]  the cost of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:18.080]  Folks, since I got Rev. Ted Paik on late, he's going to be with us into the next half hour
[2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:22.800]  of the final hour. Then the guest from the San Antonio newspaper who went and took a photo
[2:33:22.800 --> 2:33:29.600]  of the public NSA snooping base, the cyber security internet snooping base where Big Brother reads
[2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:34.320]  our mail. They ran out and grabbed him, basically kidnapped him. That's coming up in the last 30
[2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:41.120]  minutes. We're going to go back to Rev. Ted Paik to break this down, folks. He's always there ringing
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:44.400]  the alarm bell when they try to destroy the First Amendment, but this time they're coming the
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:48.480]  closest I've ever seen. We'll see if he agrees with me. He was explaining to me during the break
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:52.800]  that it's similar language in the cyber bullying and the hate bill. In fact, I have both of them here,
[2:33:53.520 --> 2:33:58.240]  but that the hate bill is even worse than the passages I was reading. So we're going to go over
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:03.040]  that and play the video clip of them admitting that Holder is saying that, no, this doesn't
[2:34:03.040 --> 2:34:07.840]  protect everybody. This only creates a select group that's protected. But before we go back
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:11.520]  to Ted Paik, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that are making this hour
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:17.920]  of the radio show possible. And one of those is MySolarBackup.com. A lot of things can cut off
[2:34:17.920 --> 2:34:22.080]  your electrical power, hurricane, snow, and ice and storms. Listers should move towards getting
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:26.720]  off the grid. And here's a great way to do just that. A solar power generator is now available
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:32.000]  from our longtime sponsor Solutions from Science. You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:38.400]  of the power source, 1800 watt generator, and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:42.560]  endless electricity. Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in the blackout,
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:46.800]  gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity. It's the perfect emergency backup
[2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:52.480]  for troubled times. The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks. So make your move today.
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:58.240]  Go to MySolarBackup.com. That's MySolarBackup.com. One word. MySolarBackup.com or give them the
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:04.880]  toll-free number, folks. You can give them the call at the toll-free number 877-327-0365,
[2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:11.120]  877-327-0365. And then in closing, got to get one plug in today
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:21.040]  for my films. Ladies and gentlemen, my DVDs, my films, have been seen by conservatively,
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:26.080]  well, the Obama deception, well over 15 million people in three months free on YouTube and Google.
[2:35:26.080 --> 2:35:30.400]  You can go count up all the views on the channels. And I quit counting a month ago,
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:36.560]  so it's more than that. 15 million views free on the web. This baby, over 20 million views
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:42.480]  in the last two years online. Over 20 million we know of. Now, I've only sold a few thousand
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:47.600]  DVDs. I don't care. I love reaching people. I love saving lives. I love people understanding
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:51.920]  the globalist, our eugenicist who openly want to set up world government. People say,
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:55.920]  okay, we're going to live under a world government big deal. It's to kill you, folks. It is to
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:36:03.040]  persecute you. It is to rip you limb from limb. This film is life-saving. Get the DVD. Have it.

[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:22.800]  cruddy YouTube or Google quality. The point is this is high quality DVD. Respect yourself
[2:36:22.800 --> 2:36:26.560]  enough to have it in high quality. You're going to spend two hours and 40 minutes watching it.
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:30.560]  There's an online bibliography proving every claim and document in this film. What is the

[2:36:35.520 --> 2:36:41.520]  I've ever released. It shatters the left-right paradigm, exposes how both parties are controlled,
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:46.240]  the hate speech laws, the tyranny, the FEMA camps, the North com, Obama being a liar,
[2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:52.240]  but showing people, Republicans who watch it, that Bush was a liar as well. This film is
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:57.600]  shattering the left-right paradigm. Biggest film we've ever released. Get it on DVD at infowars.com

[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:02.880]  going to let the DHS report saying Christians and gun owners and libertarians or terrorists.
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:06.480]  We're not going to let their demonization work. We're not going to let their chilling effect

[2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:19.840]  15 minutes because I'm going to try to sit back and shut up and have Reverend Pike run over all
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:24.800]  the facts. Reverend, go back into that. Go back into the fact because I've read the bills and
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:29.200]  you're absolutely right. You're the expert on this. There it is, federalizing all the local
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:35.520]  police further, teaching them with federal training by the ADL and Southern Property Law Center
[2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:41.520]  to be political officers. Jason Burmes' mom was driving into New York, went through the tollway,
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:46.160]  didn't have a transponder, so they give you a little ticket card and the ticket card said,
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:50.000]  suspicious person, a yellow card, and the person said, I'm giving you this card because
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:54.480]  of your 9-11 truth sticker. And so she was then seen as a terrorist. They're already beginning
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:39:01.200]  the no fly, no buy or no buy, no fly bills to ban you flying if you're on a no fly list,
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:08.000]  to ban you having a job, 1,200,000 on it and growing each month by 24,000. It's this whole
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:14.480]  culture of Soviet style, secret police, commissariat, turning our local police into political officers.
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:18.640]  So I want you to go over that and then explain to us the hate bill versus the other bill,
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:24.160]  then later we'll play the Holder clip. Reverend Ted Pike, truthtellers.org, you've got the floor,
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:30.720]  break it down. Well, as I was saying, Attorney General Holder has given a tremendous tool to
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:37.920]  those who want to defeat this hate bill. And what he said again is number one, that they're contrary
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:43.920]  to what the bill says on the front page that all American citizens, according to race, religion,
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:49.760]  or gender, will be protected by the federal government from violent hate crimes in the state
[2:39:49.760 --> 2:39:56.080]  that this bill is passed. Holder said, oh no, no, no. This bill is for those historically
[2:39:56.080 --> 2:40:01.200]  victimized groups, basically a white Christian heterosexual civilization,
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:09.120]  primarily homosexuals, blacks, even women, Jews on and on. And number two, what came out in the
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:17.360]  across examination in the judiciary two weeks ago was that Holder could not find a single
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:24.560]  example. He could not present any statistics that the state are not punishing violent hate crimes
[2:40:24.560 --> 2:40:30.800]  on the local level. He was again and again asked, and we have this in this 10-minute video at
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:38.240]  truthtellers.org. Again, Senator Sessions, Senator Cober on this, just give us one example,
[2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:44.320]  and he couldn't. And you see, what this video does, we have at truthtellers.org, is it knocks
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:50.640]  the foundation out of two of the very strongest arguments which the anti-defamation leak has
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:57.920]  convinced. Not only the members of Congress, though, but of state legislators, ADL, is proud
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:05.200]  of his website, adl.org, that it persuaded 45 U.S. states to adopt some version of its model and
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:10.480]  a hate law. And right at the beginning of the argument of the ADL throughout the 1990s, the
[2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:17.920]  legislators on the local level was this promise, oh no, this bill is not favoritistic toward some
[2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:23.360]  groups. This bill will protect everyone, according to race, religion, and gender. See, it's written
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:28.400]  right there on the front page. And all these legislators said, well, that's great, everybody's
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:33.520]  going to be protected. Now, astonishingly, maybe the Attorney General of the United States is
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:43.440]  saying no. This is an egalitarian, very discriminatory law against the 90% plus of the American
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:50.400]  people. This is only to protect those victims of historic Christian-wide heterosexual persecution.
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:59.360]  So what we have to realize is this is a massive scam, a massive takeover, a massive erosion
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:04.640]  of the First Amendment to the Constitution, giving us free speech of the 10th Amendment to the
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:10.000]  Constitution, which tells the federal government to butt out of state's rights and law enforcement.
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:15.440]  And of course, the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which says the government can't
[2:42:15.440 --> 2:42:22.560]  exalt one group above the other. Now, what I am calling all Americans to do in the next
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:31.120]  several days is to call in to your senators. And also, at truthfellers.org, we have all
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:37.520]  hundred members of the U.S. Senate go there on the action page and spend some time this week
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:44.000]  because the heat bill is scheduled to go through to possible passage by mid next week. Spend some
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:50.640]  time before work. Spend some time during your lunch break calling all senators, if you possibly
[2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:57.040]  can, with this very simple message. This is an astonishing simple message, but here's what I'd
[2:42:57.040 --> 2:43:05.680]  like you to say. Ask me, the staffers there, have you watched the shocking video that shows
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:13.280]  Attorney General Holder saying there is no equal protection under the heat bill? It's on the home
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:21.440]  page at truthfellers.org. Now, what we want to do, we want to absolutely saturate the Senate of
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:26.320]  the United States, especially the Democrats as well as the Republicans, with the staffers,
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:33.680]  the senators, the aides all watching the Attorney General of the United States, now telling the
[2:43:33.680 --> 2:43:41.440]  whole world that contrary to what the ADL and Holder have been telling the Democrats,
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:49.040]  there is no equal justice under this heat bill. There is no reason for the federal government
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:54.400]  to come down and meddle in local law enforcement because the states are doing a perfectly good
[2:43:54.400 --> 2:44:01.760]  job of prosecuting hate crimes. People need to, number one, come to truthfellers.org, the Holder
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:08.640]  video, the Holder expose is right there on the home page. Click off and go on to a journey
[2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:17.120]  into hate bill fantasy land, according to Holder, and then number two, call these numbers to your
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:22.400]  members of the Senate and hopefully all hundred members of the Senate. Here's the toll-free number,
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:32.160]  eight seven seven, eight five one, six four three seven, again the toll-free number to the Senate,
[2:44:32.160 --> 2:44:41.120]  eight seven seven, eight five one, six four three seven, and the back of toll number is two zero
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:50.800]  two, two two five, three one two one, again that back of number is two zero two, two two five,
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:57.520]  three one two one, and here again is the simple message you deliver to the staffers,
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:02.880]  and you don't even have to say you're against the hate bill, just say have you watched the shocking
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:10.480]  video that shows Attorney General Holder saying there is no equal protection under the hate bill,
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:17.840]  it's on the home page at truthfellers.org. Now what we're finding is that dozens of
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:23.760]  staffers are now watching this video, dozens are reporting that they will watch it and they're
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:29.840]  going to be recommending it to their senators. We want a totally avalanche Congress that that is
[2:45:29.840 --> 2:45:35.440]  the Senate. In the next several days before mark-up hearing perhaps on Monday or Tuesday
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:41.360]  and a vote perhaps next Wednesday, we want to we want to knock out the pillars underneath
[2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:45.680]  the two of the very strongest arguments which the liberals have made for the hate bill.
[2:45:46.640 --> 2:45:52.960]  Well I mean inherently in Europe it's only select groups that are protected and then once they say
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:46:00.240]  okay you're arrested if you say that 5,999,000 Jews died, not 6 million, and then okay you're
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:06.800]  arrested if you call somebody the n-word, and then I have mainstream BBC articles, BBC headlines,
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:14.000]  hundreds arrested in hate sweep, and they have secret agents that sit in the bars and restaurants
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:20.320]  to hear hundreds of different racial terms, and then now we're hearing oh we want to add the term
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:31.360]  midget to be banned by the FCC from talk radio when a midget isn't even a derogatory term you know
[2:46:31.360 --> 2:46:36.960]  it's called midgets and dwarfs, two different you know a midget is somebody who's proportionately
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:45.360]  proper size their head their hands their feet and a dwarf has a chromosomal disorder
[2:46:45.360 --> 2:46:51.120]  and but that's like in England when Robin Page who isn't even political not liberal or conservative
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:55.920]  BBC one man and his dog host where he goes different towns and samples their beer and cheese
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:01.120]  he gave a speech saying we deserve the same rights for rural communities as homosexuals and
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:08.080]  Muslims he was arrested and they said the word homosexual is hateful so even scientific terms
[2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:13.600]  aren't allowed it's at their discretion so once they've done this now they're saying climate change
[2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:20.560]  denial you need to be arrested and this is the point I want to raise here I can see how I'm being
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:24.960]  set up and I want you to comment on this and then have the floor and go over this sir but I want to
[2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:31.040]  inject this here I'm already experiencing it when Mr. Poplowski killed the three cops
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:37.920]  a few months ago in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania within two hours of him killing the cops and
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:43.920]  then giving up there was an article in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette attacking me in the
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:52.400]  headline by name saying Poplowski was a fan and I influenced him to do this now it then came out
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:58.000]  later that they'd gotten his comments off info wars and he'd been on hundreds of sites Fox News
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:06.160]  you name it and that he was actually attacking me for not being anti-semitic but the point is I
[2:48:06.160 --> 2:48:10.320]  talked to the reporter within and he's a little guy who works with the local southern property
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:19.360]  law center they all have their little pet reporters within two hours of these cops being killed they
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:24.240]  had gone in the computers their operatives in the police department had fed that to the ADL
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:28.160]  and southern property law center but southern law southern property law center specifically
[2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:35.680]  had then fed it to demonize me in the news same thing with von brun and then now I have
[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:43.440]  reporters calling me up from national publications psychology today wall street journal uh a bunch
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:48.000]  of other newspapers where I'm not even calling them back now going are you making people kill
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:54.480]  people should your speech be restricted so I'm now seeing the setup where I've got some of the
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:58.560]  biggest websites out there I've got the biggest alternative websites info wars.com prison planet
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:04.000]  dot com where it's all about what people say on my message board or if the or they tell police
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:11.040]  they never heard my show I'm being set up for arrest exactly what the bill says the cyber bullying

[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:44.640]  principal in federal court right along with that person who claims that over the past seven years

[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:28.080]  here is the attorney general
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:33.680]  i'm meeting in close to karan and um the scripture and and says uh
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:41.840]  homosexual activities are uh immoral and uh he's attacked by gay activists
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:49.040]  well the statute would not would not necessarily cover that um on the other hand i think that
[2:54:49.040 --> 2:54:56.160]  so is there is there a reason for someone to think that um this is um odd does that strike you
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:55:02.480]  as odd that one might be a the crime and another one not we're talking about crimes that have a
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:08.960]  historic basis groups who have been targeted for violence as a result of the color of their skin
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:16.000]  their sexual orientation that is what the statute tends what is is designed to cover well i think
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:20.240]  that's part of the problem they only are not protected groups security guards are not protected
[2:55:20.240 --> 2:55:24.960]  groups soldiers apparently not protected groups some are protected groups and get special
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:31.360]  protection under this law well but one has to look at the history of the unfortunate history
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:37.840]  in of our nation um there are groups who have been singled out who have been the objects of
[2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:45.280]  violence simply because of their sexual orientation the color of their skin their ethnicity um
[2:55:45.280 --> 2:55:50.560]  we have to face and confront that reality that which historically has been a problem for that
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:56.640]  nation continues to be a problem for this nation in the absence i asked you guys last week hearing
[2:55:56.640 --> 2:56:01.680]  well we'll play the rest coming up next hour but the point here is we're gonna go back to ted pike
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:06.400]  i grew up in dallas texas and i had black friends on the football team and i went over
[2:56:06.400 --> 2:56:14.080]  their house and hung out on the weekends and a few times we were attacked by groups of other blacks
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:21.920]  going through a neighborhood because i was white when whites get attacked and there are many black
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:28.560]  on white crimes that are racially motivated they don't get a hate crime charge that's not happening
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:36.560]  in europe you notice oh america's bad our history i white people are bad and that's what this is
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:40.960]  all about and it's about racial politics and whites are basically almost art of the minority
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:46.720]  they're mainly elderly and uh you know the so-called majority is is elderly and the little
[2:56:46.720 --> 2:56:51.760]  reconquista and others brag you all white people are all dying we're gonna get you ah and that's
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:56.720]  all cute and funny and forward and chevy in general mode you know everybody funds that miller
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:04.160]  brewing funds met general rosa that's all okay it's just we're going to have select groups so the
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:10.080]  government's gonna persecute groups if a white guy kills a black guy there's gonna be a hate crime
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:15.360]  charge but if a black guy kills a white guy there's not so this is the type of mind control but it's
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:21.440]  worse than that it's the federal nature of turning your local police into political officers that
[2:57:21.440 --> 2:57:27.680]  judge each crime off of whether it was racially or sexually motivated but then it goes further
[2:57:27.680 --> 2:57:31.120]  that was the old hate bills they wanted this new one that reverend pike was just covering
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:33.920]  this is a quick segment we're about to go back to him

[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:31.600]  the end of freedom but look these criminals can pass this law i'm not following but the point
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:36.560]  is they're trying it they're very close to passing and it's real okay reverend ted pike please continue
[3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:42.480]  with the history of this and and then now what's in this bill specifically because they're on the
[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:48.080]  news admitting and the bill says if you influence somebody by your speech not even calling for
[3:00:48.080 --> 3:00:57.040]  violence you go to prison i mean this is just off the charts anti-american anti-freedom yes
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:03.440]  absolutely if we want to know where this bill is heading you just have to go up to canada in canada
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:10.880]  in 1971 the adl the neighbor rift after 10 years of lobbying they finally persuaded parliament in
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:17.520]  ottawa just minutes before the christmas vacation to adopt their federal heat crimes law for canada
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:25.120]  that's section 319 and the government also about 10 years later adopted an anti-heat so-called
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:33.360]  anti-heat internet law section 13.1 and what that says is that if your speech is even likely
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:40.400]  to cause humiliation or hurt or wounded feelings and some member of a federally protected group
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:46.720]  then that is a federal heat crime and you can go you can have a five thousand dollar minimum
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:53.600]  of a prison dollar excuse me a fine but if you continue in such statements you will go to prison
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:59.520]  and the cyberbullying bill as we mentioned earlier is exactly like the canadian law it says that if
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:06.560]  you even intend to cause emotional severe emotional distress in another person then you can go to
[3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:12.240]  prison for two years you don't even have to cause you emotional distress in them you just have to
[3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:19.440]  intend it so these adl laws are all thought crimes laws they are very subjective very nebulous and
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:26.000]  unclear they're just wide open for expansion clarification by federal judges if this bill
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:32.560]  is passed very quickly a contrary to what adl tells legislators they say oh this is only a bill
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:38.720]  to to prosecute violent heat crimes in the states when the when the states can't or won't enforce
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:44.880]  the law but the truth is as soon as this bill is passed and the government begins to lay down
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:51.760]  indictments against people even for violent hate crimes then the liberal judges will begin to
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:57.680]  pontificate from the bench they will very quickly say oh no we have to do more than just protect
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:03.920]  homosexuals jews etc from violent physical hate crimes we need to protect their delicate
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:11.840]  emotions and self-esteem we want to uh we'll have to legislate and to pontificate uh adjudicate i
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:17.520]  should say against those that verbal violence that goes across the airwaves and out of the
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:23.440]  pulpit and so on so this is a very slippery slope that this hate bill will take take us immediately
[3:03:23.440 --> 3:03:30.320]  and again i have to i have to repeat we can't we can't kill this hate bill next week if americans
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:38.240]  now will call their senators today immediately after this program call them and and just ask them
[3:03:38.240 --> 3:03:45.760]  would they like to watch this shocking video that shows the attorney general of united states holder
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:52.720]  saying spinning it out that there is no equal protection under the hate bill tell the staffers
[3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:58.880]  to go immediately to truth tellers dot org they're on the homepage you'll see the attorney general
[3:03:58.880 --> 3:04:05.120]  saying it basically exactly the opposite of what the liberal have always been taught that this
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:11.360]  various equality and justice under this hate bill not so says holder this bill is only for a
[3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:16.400]  protected elite or protected minority of those who've been but that's what the bill i mean that's
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:22.000]  what the bill says and it says the feds basically they choose just like with the green carbon tax
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:27.920]  the bill that's passed the house gives these federal boards 30 plus agencies unlimited power
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:34.240]  on anything producing carbon so the media is always it's only on big power plants and cold plants
[3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:40.080]  it's not on you but then you read the bill it's on everything and and and we already have enough
[3:04:40.080 --> 3:04:45.040]  of a chilling effect in this country so right when people are mad tired of the tyranny they're
[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:52.000]  creating these new political crimes and turning our police into political officers we're going to

[3:08:09.600 --> 3:08:12.720]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:20.880]  we're talking to ted pike true tellers dot org i'm alex jones at info wars dot com prison planet
[3:08:20.880 --> 3:08:29.200]  dot com and i have the national international media attacking me on a weekly basis in national
[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:38.320]  publications saying i'm causing murders you've got 300 million people in this country you're
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:44.800]  going to have a few lunatics that kill folks from time to time i don't deserve to be blamed for this
[3:08:44.800 --> 3:08:50.000]  plus i'm not calling for it and it turns out that von brun actually didn't like me and either did
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:59.840]  ploskey but regardless to say that you're guilty because they say you're guilty not even for your
[3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:05.440]  speech but they say something you said may have made this person commit these crimes a few months
[3:09:05.440 --> 3:09:10.480]  ago i was wondering why does the media keep trying to with no connection to connect me to these people
[3:09:11.360 --> 3:09:15.680]  and and their questions are you causing them to kill do you feel guilty should you get in
[3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:20.320]  trouble they're getting fed the line and then i found out in my case the southern property
[3:09:20.320 --> 3:09:26.720]  law center is on my butt and the adl has been caught breaking into police stations and stealing
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:31.040]  files on people and they're the ones that train the local police i mean this is brainwashing and
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:35.600]  then i've seen it in the news where people get arrested for giving the police ron paul videos
[3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:43.280]  or or or my films or get arrested for a anti-un sticker on their car and the mayac and dhs report
[3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:48.560]  in now homeland security holder one has a bill where he will put you on the terror list for
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:53.280]  your political speech and they're already doing this and won't say why a million plus people
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:58.080]  are on it and they have a bill where if you're on the no fly no judge no jury extra judicial
[3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:03.120]  you're going to be on the no buy list for guns we're saying if you have bad credit you're going
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:09.040]  to be on the no fly list and then no guns so it's not just the hate bill or the cyber bullying bill
[3:10:09.040 --> 3:10:15.760]  or the dhs reports or the no fly no buy or this new bill i covered yesterday i've got it here in
[3:10:15.760 --> 3:10:20.880]  the stack i'll give you the bill number if i can dig it out they're now saying oh and saying there's
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:28.080]  a new world order is hate that's codeword and we're like what even if it was codeword for
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:33.760]  something it's your first amendment but it's not david ike wrote a book believing that space aliens
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:41.360]  control the world and he was arrested in canada and they said space aliens is code for jews so
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:49.680]  there's also a rampant like hitlerian or soviet style paranoia where i mean this is a reign of
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:54.640]  terror this is so unamerican ted pike break down more of how they're federalizing our local police
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:11:00.640]  and can you elaborate on my point that that that this is just a nexus for other things in this
[3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:06.320]  this i keep calling it soviet this is particularly soviet of secret list and secret arrest and
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:12.480]  and and no judge no jury i mean this isn't this is incredible ted pike well it's extremely important
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:18.720]  that we defeat the hate bill because the hate bill is kind of the flagship of other is the biggest
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:23.680]  head on the hydra or it's the body of the hydra that's right the big big federal hate bill is a
[3:11:23.680 --> 3:11:29.920]  broad bill which will end free speech in america but we have to realize that there are basically
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:36.160]  three civil rights hate crimes bias crimes bill now before congress the first of course is the hate
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:42.320]  bill uh but there's also ender which is the employment nondiscrimination act that's now
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:49.760]  in three committees in the in the house judiciary the enda is the is adl's the workplace uh
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:56.080]  hate crimes law which makes it a federal offense to to deny employment to a homosexual because
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:01.760]  he's a homosexual and that federalizes everything that's right and and and brings the feds in and
[3:12:01.760 --> 3:12:08.240]  weird sensitivity training when nobody is even talking or thinking about this it's like forcing
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:15.440]  sex ed on third graders it's it's it's perverted that's right and it also enda will force churches
[3:12:15.440 --> 3:12:22.160]  to hire homosexuals in nonclerical nonclergy positions so congress shall make no law respecting
[3:12:22.160 --> 3:12:26.240]  an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof this is the end of free
[3:12:26.240 --> 3:12:31.920]  association free market property rights yeah now if we can if we can defeat the hate bill
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:37.840]  this weekend perhaps as early as this week if we can flood as the senate with this request
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:44.640]  that the staffers and the senators watch this very embarrassing very damaging video with holder
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:50.160]  admitting there's no equal protection and there's no need on the local level for a hate crimes bill
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:54.480]  there is a good chance we can and not get in the head of this week but we're going to have to
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:13:00.480]  have massive calling in to to the congress immediately after this program today Ted more than
[3:13:00.480 --> 3:13:04.800]  that you you know you are i would imagine that hundreds of interviews have you done hundreds
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:10.960]  of interviews the last month on this oh yes uh huh yeah i i'm doing constantly broadcasting this
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:16.960]  is this is coming to a head because the readers the majority read says he's got to have the hate
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:23.600]  bill passed by the august recess and if the arms because they know obama stalling and losing power
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:28.880]  by then they've got to pass the the green takeover the carbon tax slave enslavement they've got to
[3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:32.640]  pass the gun grabbing they've got to pass the open borders they've got to get it all uh
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:38.160]  by the winner but the reason i brought up if you're doing interviews i've been doing a lot of
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:44.240]  national and regional shows myself lately and i they'll say i was what's most important right now
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:50.320]  and i go well the hate bill and the cyber bullying bill and i'll read the subsections on air and these
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:56.080]  talk show hosts are shocked they aren't even aware of it because there's such a news blackout
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:01.040]  why we're so blessed to have you so i would also encourage listeners to get the stories that
[3:14:01.040 --> 3:14:07.280]  curtain emos written off info wars dot com off prison planet dot com uh to get the reports off
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:12.240]  true tellers dot org to get the video clip from youtube that you're linked to and pass that on
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:20.080]  the direct link to people so they can see uh this for themselves so so not just calling the senate or
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:24.480]  is it just best to call the senate well right now you see we only have several days time to
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:31.040]  do this because if they have a markup station as early as next to tuesday
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:36.560]  end of the senate judiciary the the hate bill then will be predestined to go forward very
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:42.080]  rapidly rapidly they would they could have a markup station and the liberals there could vote to move
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:48.000]  it forward as an amendment to then uh it could uh they could go through the rules committee the
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:53.360]  next day only the hour for that and be on the floor the senate by by wednesday so really right now
[3:14:53.360 --> 3:14:59.280]  why did you say monday it could be by friday so i mean we've obviously won some battles since i
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:05.600]  was reading your site monday yeah but but uh you see the margin uh in the house we had a massive
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:11.120]  margin in favor of the hate bill something like 74 votes in the senate it's different it's a much
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:17.600]  more dicey uh there's probably seven or eight uh votes in favor of the hate bill over the republicans
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:23.680]  but but what what we have to do is destabilize the democrats letting them know in no uncertain
[3:15:23.680 --> 3:15:29.600]  terms that if they do vote for this hate bill that we the people are we're going to remember
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:34.400]  because the midterm elections are coming up fairly soon and one of the reasons the democrats want to
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:39.680]  rush it through the is because they want to get this passed them this pro pedophile hate bill is
[3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:45.200]  not going to sound very well in the sound bites the year from now at midterms they want to get this
[3:15:45.200 --> 3:15:51.760]  orwellian anti christian legislation taken care of now and so that the family can emphasize family
[3:15:51.760 --> 3:15:57.120]  values for the next half of this congress so right now is the crucial hour we got to get those calls
[3:15:57.120 --> 3:16:04.880]  going in again the toll-free number two your senator is eight seven seven eight five one
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:12.720]  six four three seven again that's eight seven seven eight five one six four three seven and
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:21.520]  the backup toll number is two zero two two five three one two one and that's two zero two two
[3:16:21.520 --> 3:16:28.960]  five three one two one and just give them this simple message have you watched the shocking video
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:35.840]  that shows attorney general holder saying there is no equal protection under the hate bill it's on
[3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:42.640]  the home page yet truth tellers dot work well i mean reverend ted pike there is no doubt that
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:48.080]  these people are out of control i mean the the hate bill i agree with you is the big hot topic
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:52.640]  right now is what they're trying to pass right now but you look at everything else the seizure of all
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:59.120]  energy production and all human activity taxing the carbon cycle uh what plants breathe carbon
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:04.240]  dioxide saying what plants breathe is a deadly poison listing it as a deadly poison now i mean
[3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:11.840]  this is insanity uh the the start trying to start new wars the anti gun bills the likes of which
[3:17:11.840 --> 3:17:17.280]  we've never seen and then all these hoax articles in the mainstream saying there is no gun bills
[3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:22.640]  you know why are people buying guns i really see this all coming to a collision because it
[3:17:22.640 --> 3:17:28.000]  looks like the establishment is bum rushing right now are they doing that out of strength
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:32.720]  or are they doing that out of desperation realizing that the people are becoming wise to their new
[3:17:32.720 --> 3:17:37.840]  world order well i think they are they're they're doing it out of desperation the adl has global
[3:17:37.840 --> 3:17:45.040]  ambitions and if in a race with the new alternative media of the internet talk radio and so on which
[3:17:45.040 --> 3:17:51.040]  is spilling the beans about their role as the architect of most of this legislation but we
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:57.120]  have to uh we have to realize that yes these are all other great concerns these other bills are
[3:17:57.120 --> 3:18:04.240]  very threatening but if we lose speech under the federal hate crimes bill we will lose all our other
[3:18:04.240 --> 3:18:09.680]  freedoms and we have freedoms to criticize these other these other pieces of very threatening
[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:16.560]  legislation so number one priority this is kind of the beating heart of our of our republic is to
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:22.800]  keep that precious speech free speech alive the hate bill is a sword pointed at our free speech
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:27.520]  well i agree with you ted but but let's expand let's say they do pass it try to implement it
[3:18:27.520 --> 3:18:30.880]  we've then got to fight it every step of the way i mean for those that don't know you know them
[3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:35.280]  i've had them on it's mainstream news that in philadelphia preachers that come out to street
[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:41.680]  corners yes and preach are charged with hate crime uh by the state and taken to prison and
[3:18:41.680 --> 3:18:47.200]  then huge court battles ensued these people this is not just our opinion they mean business and
[3:18:47.200 --> 3:18:52.080]  folks even if you disagree with somebody coming out and protesting you the point is if you take
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:56.400]  their freedom of speech we live in a tyranny i mean i don't think people realize that reverend
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:03.200]  you're not joking in fact it's hard to describe just how real and hardcore this is yes and it's
[3:19:03.200 --> 3:19:08.640]  spreading like a cancer to all the western industrialized democracies america is a
[3:19:08.640 --> 3:19:14.800]  holdout we still do not have a federal hate crimes law a d well once the international
[3:19:14.800 --> 3:19:20.880]  allies hate hate crimes enforcement of uh... it with the right to deport people like the
[3:19:20.880 --> 3:19:26.800]  rudolph and uh... zonal and then others they want to have you arrested if you say global warming
[3:19:26.800 --> 3:19:34.560]  isn't real that that's right that they're very aggressive a very uh... well in their desires

[3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:29.920]  to pass your 10 pike i already see the media setting me up got someone openly saying the
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:38.000]  new york times they've got to put gatekeepers on the web the uh ceo of a news group when it's one
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:45.120]  moorlach's company saying arrest bloggers ban free speech i mean they really are starting
[3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:50.240]  to figure out that we're taking them on and so they're gonna try to get nasty i don't see it
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:56.000]  succeeding but but if they pass this bill under the soviet model that they're adopting what will
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:01.920]  happen to alex jones well the broadcasting industry is going to start receiving guidelines from the
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:12.080]  fbc that language which might induce aid abat and so on according to the 1968 law title 18 section
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:18.560]  2a it will now become indigable as a federal crime and it'll be in the same category as
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:24.480]  inciting to riot or shouting fire in a crowded theater things like that and that you'll you'll
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:30.960]  be experiencing a tremendous pressure coming down to force you to become much more neutral
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:36.560]  and blandy in what you say if we want to again if we want to know what what the american talk
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:41.760]  radio will be like just go to canada uh... up in canada you can talk about gardening you can
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:47.920]  talk about sports or whatever you want but you cannot criticize federally protected groups
[3:25:47.920 --> 3:25:53.760]  such as homosexuals the dionists and so on in specific terms you certainly cannot
[3:25:53.760 --> 3:25:58.400]  save from the pulpit or from the airwaves if you're christian broadcasters that the
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:03.920]  the jews killed christ the 2000 years ago that is considered a heat crime in canada
[3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:09.280]  and it's also considered a heat crime in canada to quote leviticus the romans from the bible
[3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:14.560]  saying it's a homosexuality is an abomination that will give you an immediate five thousand
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:20.640]  dollar fine if if that pastor ever preaches again on that subject from those verses he is
[3:26:20.640 --> 3:26:29.200]  facing contempt of court charges and which means present and everybody's so cowed that
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:36.000]  the police are like desperate spiders in black holes david i comes walking in saying
[3:26:36.720 --> 3:26:42.880]  i think there's reptoids from planet you know whatever and they say that's code arrest him
[3:26:42.880 --> 3:26:48.080]  and david's going no brother peace love it's flying saucers you're not even allowed to talk
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:53.600]  about flying saucers up there they arrest you everything is hate yeah and there's so many
[3:26:53.600 --> 3:26:58.800]  other groups that want to get on the heat crimes bandwagon the claiming uh they have also been
[3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:05.280]  victimized by white christian heterosexuals but you know what about all the black students and
[3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:09.680]  synagogues and stuff where they catch them putting the swastikas on themselves this is
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:17.040]  clearly a political weapon oh yeah and uh the the media is in collusion with this but there is
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:22.240]  no recourse i mean we just simply have got to keep this hate bill from passing it i encourage
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:27.440]  everybody to come to truth tellers dot org immediately after this program watch the
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:32.480]  holder video of the way it'll make your blood boil and then get those calls off immediately
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:36.720]  sure and we're gonna get around just a moment one more time but the minutes we have left here
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:42.160]  here let's say it passes though and they start federalizing the police more and political
[3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:46.560]  officers show up what do i do when the police show up here i guess i just get in handcuffs
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:51.840]  and go to the prison that's freedom i mean this isn't america i'm not going along with it and
[3:27:51.840 --> 3:27:58.160]  anybody that tries to arrest me for my political speech is a terrorist yeah there's a lot of
[3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:02.000]  big talk out there i hear on talk radio people says where we're gonna fight we're gonna go to
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:08.240]  jail we're gonna we're not going to submit but when you're facing 10 years in prison for criticizing
[3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:13.440]  federally protected groups uh the people shut up pretty fast and the record in canada and also
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:20.400]  europe australia is that the people of independence and courage and liberty uh become very docile
[3:28:20.400 --> 3:28:26.960]  very quickly and uh the the sky's the limit then the real raping the taking the farms the
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:33.440]  ranches the cpsing the kids the brainwashing the children the indoctrinating uh fifth graders
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:37.840]  like michael jackson would do at the public schools just basically will be ruled by michael
[3:28:37.840 --> 3:28:42.240]  jackson snapping turtles and that's basically the end of it that's right and it's a fantasy
[3:28:42.240 --> 3:28:46.320]  to think that we could take this this law to the court because the courts are still liberal
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:50.560]  through left wing and pro hate bill to begin with it they make a mockery of it i would even call
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:56.320]  them liberal these are disgusting anti-american anti-free speech you know you you may hate what i
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:29:02.080]  say somebody may hate what ted says somebody may hate what bill clinton says but they have a right
[3:29:02.080 --> 3:29:09.760]  to say it this is the united states and we need to all stand up against this and and just realize
[3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:14.560]  this is another symptom of just how rotten washington is it isn't enough they're stealing
[3:29:14.560 --> 3:29:20.400]  us blind they want to tell us to sit down and shut up or we'll be arrested this is just outrageous

[3:33:17.760 --> 3:33:24.880]  the narcotics trafficking yalees who control the opium supply in the u.s had lost their monopoly
[3:33:24.880 --> 3:33:31.360]  in the 20s so they openly lobbied to criminalize drugs they controlled the police they could ship
[3:33:31.360 --> 3:33:36.720]  the opium and then produced into heroin into the country the cocaine that was in the coca-cola they
[3:33:36.720 --> 3:33:41.200]  could ship it in making it illegal and make larger profits they set up the national security

[3:34:10.720 --> 3:34:17.200]  was all about bossing us and letting us know we're now slaves and i saw a story in the washington
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:24.400]  post a few weeks ago secret buildings you may not photograph and this is out of the washington post
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:32.160]  and people are at bus stops beside major buildings that don't even have fences around them
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:37.600]  and there's no sign saying don't photograph and they just run up and grab you and drag you in

[3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:22.880]  be at walmart across the street anywhere now they're gonna now this system looks at the face
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:27.840]  scanning cameras on the street corners and other nsa facilities read your mail illegally and they
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:32.560]  abc news admits they listen to your phone sex if you're talking to your wife from iraq i mean
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:40.240]  and this is all non-terror related for us citizens and it's the nsa's new data mining facility this
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:48.080]  is the only market hiring domestic cia spies east german society and so we have the reporter greg
[3:36:48.080 --> 3:36:53.600]  swartz who took this evil photo now again they're surveilling you without warrants they're tracking
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:37:00.080]  you there they're they're they're breaking the law but you as a local newspaper you can't go over
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:06.080]  there and take a photo of them so we have the thought criminal on and and ladies gentlemen we
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:11.920]  have to go out and expose these illegal facilities more now the key is they came off of the facility
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:17.680]  they grabbed him he's gonna tell us the story mr. swartz thanks for coming on with us uh thanks
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:22.960]  for having me alex had been a big fan ever since waking life well that see now we know why you're
[3:37:22.960 --> 3:37:29.840]  in trouble sir yeah yeah so right off military drive they're in san Antonio right by walmart
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:36.480]  you don't dare show the new just one of the spook factories this isn't supposed to exist
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:42.080]  and the nsa doesn't exist we're not reading your email go ahead yeah it's strange that um
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:49.680]  this facility is located directly across the street from a 24 hour walmart super center which
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:55.680]  doesn't seem like the most secretive location and uh you know you've seen the picture it's
[3:37:55.680 --> 3:38:01.600]  surrounded by barbed wire but it looks fairly innocent and uh i just walked along the sidewalk
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:09.360]  there took about five or six pictures i even chatted with a uh worker who was on the other
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:16.640]  side of defense uh working on and what you talk to a fellow slave you don't talk in prison camp
[3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:23.360]  america pal did you have permission to talk to him uh well i guess not that's a hate crime
[3:38:23.360 --> 3:38:28.400]  that's how you're al qaeda pal we gotta get rid of the bill of rights al qaeda's trying to hurt us
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:34.640]  anyways good so so you're you're please continue so you talk to one of the fellow slaves yeah you
[3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:40.720]  know i asked him about uh where he said he was a contractor he'd come down from maryland i guess
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:48.400]  he said um you know they can't even get local people to do this and um and so i was almost
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:55.200]  expecting him to come to grab me then for daring to uh uh speak with this fellow and so then i just
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:01.200]  walked back to the Walmart and i i almost thought he maybe they're actually not going to have on me
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:09.200]  and that's when the police car drove up and it was uh one nsa officer and one local fapd officer
[3:39:09.200 --> 3:39:13.680]  yeah again this is a fed who engages in crimes every day they always lied about it now it's
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:19.120]  admitted everything's red everything's listened to no freedom end of america total treason they get
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:25.440]  actual intercepts on 9 11 or told to stand down because that's just chatter to cover the op and
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:29.840]  here they are with a local cop it's the same everywhere to enforce their violation of the
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:36.880]  first amendment through color of law intimidation so they pull up what happens to the slave next
[3:39:36.880 --> 3:39:45.680]  uh well you know they uh they just uh sort of detain me right there in the Walmart a lot and
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:51.440]  that's where the entire uh detainment took place i wasn't taking any secret facilities
[3:39:51.440 --> 3:39:57.360]  but uh give us a blow by blow so you're so you're sitting there and you know his hand on his gun
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:03.280]  what does he say does he say stay right there uh i mean describe these two fellas for us these two
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:09.680]  america killers yeah well it was i was right about to uh i was approaching my car in the parking
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:16.880]  lab to get ready to leave and uh when they pulled up and um it was mostly the nsa officer you know
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:22.880]  he asked me what i was doing their officers they're not public servants it's officers authorities
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:28.800]  officials just calling the royalty so the royalness approached you what did the royalness say
[3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:35.440]  they wanted to know who i was what was i doing there you know so i told them well i'm a journalist
[3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:42.160]  with the local paper uh or we're doing a story on your new facility here yeah if you were a russian

[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:07.760]  come here great anyway so you say you're with the local paper oh my god that's real al-qaeda
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:12.880]  you know you know the cyber security command has set on record they have set on record their job
[3:41:12.880 --> 3:41:18.960]  is to wage war against alternative blogs and media and one colonel in fact pull this up army
[3:41:18.960 --> 3:41:25.200]  colonel says kill bloggers kill u.s citizens so see they're training to take on the merit we own
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:29.600]  their property and they ain't gonna be able to fight us taking over and shipping our cocaine and
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:36.400]  heroin we rule america now and you're not gonna stop us you little piece of garbage we're the
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:42.400]  patriots ha ha ha everyone else happened right and then you know about half of i'm sorry i mean
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:46.800]  start over start over so he asked why are you here what are you doing you say i'm with the press
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:52.800]  and they like just go whoa we just found an al-qaeda oh my god we just got one of them oh my god
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:57.920]  i mean there are main missions taken on the media go ahead sorry the cyber commands for
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:03.440]  attacking this is an attack facility like an attack submarine it's not out there doing surveillance
[3:42:03.440 --> 3:42:10.080]  it's attacking the web go ahead they had to do a full background check on me and i actually have
[3:42:10.080 --> 3:42:15.760]  no record so um but that was false arrest but i'm gonna try to shut up i just get so excited you've
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:21.040]  got the floor blow by blow yeah come up uh the the the the the the royal god is talking to you tell
[3:42:21.040 --> 3:42:26.880]  us what happened it was mostly a lot of standing around while they were looking up my uh non-existent
[3:42:26.880 --> 3:42:34.560]  police record and um waiting waiting and then the one NSA guy had to hear from his superior
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:39.680]  and it was just a lot of waiting around i think just a matter of intimidation to show you know if
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:44.560]  you try to look into these matters this is what we're at the very least this is what we're gonna
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:48.720]  happen when i waste a lot of your time if i'd had any kind of record then they probably would have
[3:42:48.720 --> 3:42:54.400]  uh uh detained me for further interrogation well let's be clear here that that was false
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:59.680]  arrest false imprisonment like the soviet union where they say line up line up comrade i'm going
[3:42:59.680 --> 3:43:05.760]  to run your background what are you doing taking photos of the kremlin you're in a lot of trouble now
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:11.600]  but see now it's well we're america so we can do it as you say ever say hey you know you got my
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:16.240]  license you don't have any right to do this you surveil us all day illegally criminals i'm leaving
[3:43:17.600 --> 3:43:22.400]  well no i kind of played along with them i thought maybe it would be uh i wanted to see
[3:43:22.400 --> 3:43:27.520]  what they were going to do if i didn't put up a fuss um maybe it would have been a better story
[3:43:27.520 --> 3:43:31.440]  if i had put up a fuss but i didn't really want to give them an excuse so how does this end they
[3:43:31.440 --> 3:43:37.920]  say get you you said they did want you to erase the photos right they asked me to erase the photos
[3:43:37.920 --> 3:43:45.200]  yes and um i i said to the gentleman well are you ordering me to erase these photos
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:51.680]  he said well no i'm asking you as a friend and as a friend who illegally spies on you every day
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:58.800]  criminally yeah well you know in that case i will uh refrain i'd like to keep these photos
[3:43:58.800 --> 3:44:04.880]  you know for the story that's why i took them and so um you know eventually after about 45 minutes
[3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:12.880]  standing around and uh checking into my background at all they uh let me go with the photos um did
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:18.720]  they warn you though did they warn you to not ever come back or don't do it again no no they didn't
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:23.920]  they really say anything that uh specifically although obviously they uh yeah well they got that
[3:44:23.920 --> 3:44:29.840]  message across yeah have you seen the washington post article they did do that in uh in in virginia
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:35.840]  right i saw that and um you know it's interesting about half of this country's alternative weekly
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:40.960]  newspapers are yet to be gobbled up by big corporate conglomerates so that's something
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:46.960]  they might still fear as far as the the truth actually being yeah tell us about the san antonio
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:52.480]  al qaeda i mean the san antonio current evil evil because i mean i'm being sarcastic but
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:58.080]  on record this cyber security command says it's going to go out and attack info wars dot com
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:01.840]  prison planet dot com they say they're gonna attack alternative media and then some of their
[3:45:01.840 --> 3:45:06.960]  operatives have said they may have to kill kill us that's freedom though killing the press is what
[3:45:06.960 --> 3:45:12.400]  america's all about yeah well if you're familiar with james bamford that's where he i was inspired
[3:45:12.400 --> 3:45:16.880]  to write the story by his work you know his book the shadow factories was where we first heard
[3:45:16.880 --> 3:45:23.200]  about this new san antonio data center and from his research it sounds like this data center may
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:29.360]  eventually be able to hold all the information in the world so it's quite a massive facility and
[3:45:29.360 --> 3:45:33.680]  when the one of the reasons they put it here is because they got microsoft to come along
[3:45:33.680 --> 3:45:40.960]  and uh take another nearby facility so there's some synergy there well microsoft is a nsa front
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:47.040]  it's founded and set up by ibm to get around antitrust laws it is a eugenics trust uh
[3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:53.680]  uh total over 50 billion of microsoft money has now been given to eugenics yeah well that
[3:45:53.680 --> 3:46:00.560]  would add up because the nsa did not agree to put this facility in san antonio until microsoft
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:09.360]  committed to do the same yeah no no microsoft is the nsa some yeah so they're going hand in hand
[3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:14.160]  there hey hey it's all the guys in this facility are all shooting their kids up with cancer virus
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:19.120]  mercury shots you know they love it they're all drinking fluoride too so hey guys you don't like
[3:46:19.120 --> 3:46:23.600]  me on the web watching this right now you feel real tough about all the stuff you've done to me
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:27.520]  remember your bosses are doing it all to you because you know what i'm right and you're wrong

[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:37.200]  so just take those shots and enjoy it well yeah i know as i'm sure you know alex the military has
[3:46:37.200 --> 3:46:43.120]  been uh responsible for all kinds of toxic contamination of the public in this country uh i
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:48.480]  didn't know they openly spray it and and and they take their own troops they go we'll give you three
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:54.080]  days leave if you sign this form to let us test a flu bug on you and they go sure right for america
[3:46:54.080 --> 3:46:58.960]  and they murder them with nerve gas knowing it's going to kill them and then i'm against murdering
[3:46:58.960 --> 3:47:04.160]  the troops so i'm bad see and you're bad too buddy you got to be watched oh yeah at the former
[3:47:04.160 --> 3:47:08.880]  you don't like murder in the truth here they they dumped all kinds of chemicals down the drains
[3:47:08.880 --> 3:47:13.600]  and contaminated the entire neighborhood there's very high rates of cancer and birth defects in
[3:47:13.600 --> 3:47:18.880]  the south san antonio near that air force base and they deny that there's a connection
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:25.280]  the even uh have put a gag order on a uh scientist who came in to study the liver cancer and found
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:29.760]  that some of the cancers in the area may be attributable to living above the plume coming from
[3:47:29.760 --> 3:47:36.240]  the base and uh see that's patriotic small children dying all around us is america right god
[3:47:36.240 --> 3:47:42.880]  you're some kind of sick commie freak against children dying of cancer i bet you'd like us
[3:47:42.880 --> 3:47:47.200]  to live in the soviet union where you don't have a right to oh i mean i guess that's what
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:52.320]  we're becoming see see yeah yeah see the problem is they've always denied all this and i try to
[3:47:52.320 --> 3:47:58.000]  have fun with it but i'm just getting sick of it i mean brother i was in dc and i just sent
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:01.360]  more cameras up there to do interviews it was the same thing you can be in a park
[3:48:01.360 --> 3:48:07.280]  100 yards away from a monument and they run over and say don't tape it national security i mean it's
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:13.520]  all they've given the security guards and cops the orders to go out and humiliate and boss and
[3:48:13.520 --> 3:48:20.320]  enslave so what you got actually an nsa base is is is is almost reasonable though it's not
[3:48:20.320 --> 3:48:25.440]  but in their minds it is compared to what i mean they've given the orders to let us know
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:33.520]  that we are slaves it's an intimidation yeah that's uh and that's um whether you know whether
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:37.920]  or not it will change under obama is right that's a big question i know you're not too optimistic
[3:48:37.920 --> 3:48:43.760]  about that uh i would like to hope that there's a chance i'm not saying i need to believe it but
[3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:50.000]  a chance that maybe just maybe obama is has actually infiltrated the new world order power
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:56.720]  structure to which is the only way that you can change it to get up there and maybe we'll
[3:48:56.720 --> 3:49:01.520]  turn out to be on our side but he can't do anything too fast or they'll take him out so it's gonna be
[3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:10.320]  a uh uh careful process well you know they say hope springs eternal my friend yeah and uh i see
[3:49:10.320 --> 3:49:16.320]  you have a website here outside the san Antonio current is that the smoking mirror dot blogspot.com

[3:56:41.280 --> 3:56:51.040]  marky bill which for all of its flaws does put a price on carbon and is very much a step in the
[3:56:51.040 --> 3:57:02.240]  right direction it achieves real reductions below the 1990 base level by 2020 and that is the threshold
[3:57:02.240 --> 3:57:12.080]  that many have said including many in china is the threshold that will dramatically increase the
[3:57:12.080 --> 3:57:23.680]  prospects for uh success but it is the awareness itself that will drive the change and one of
[3:57:23.680 --> 3:57:28.720]  the ways it will drive the change here it comes global governance and global back it up back it
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:34.800]  up i wanted to hear it again look at this bastard you will pay taxes directly to him and he admits

[3:57:55.280 --> 3:58:00.960]  again that will drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through
