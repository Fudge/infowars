[00:00.000 --> 00:30.000]  We continue our number today 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231. That's toll free. Michael Corbin is sitting in for Alex Jones who is now with me reporting live from New York.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  At the Republican National Convention. Good morning Alex or good afternoon where you are and how are things going?
[00:36.000 --> 00:48.000]  Well Michael, things are really heating up and I'm here in Gotham and we're into the second day of the Republican National Convention. Lord Schwarzenegger and others will be speaking this evening.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  Obviously I'll be inside the convention getting video of that and interviewing a lot of different people.
[00:52.000 --> 01:02.000]  But just to, I guess in a little bit more calm fashion, not out in the middle of the street via cell phone, now I'm here for my hotel room.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  Perhaps I can go over and kind of chronicle some of the things that have happened since I got here Saturday night.
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.000]  Yeah, I'd love to hear, I want to hear more about David Gergen and also Michael Moore and whatever else you've got going on out there. Sounds exciting.
[01:16.000 --> 01:36.000]  Well it's amazing. The most exciting thing that I can talk about, it's also very frightening, is the fact that the media said a few thousand protesters and literally, literally, we would try to catch a cab to get back in front of the different demonstrations.
[01:36.000 --> 01:49.000]  And we'd have to go over 5, 6, 7, 8, in some cases 10, 15 streets over because the protest was so big on Sunday that it took over whole sections of the city.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  So now a lot of the estimations are a half a million but guaranteed it was 300 plus thousand.
[01:56.000 --> 02:07.000]  I mean we're talking about, on the local news they showed helicopters up above several blocks and it would just be masses of people going back for miles.
[02:07.000 --> 02:22.000]  It was huge but the most exciting thing was, literally, when I talk to the organizers, 10,000 of the people had the 9-11 cover up signs saying that the government basically is behind September 11th.
[02:23.000 --> 02:32.000]  And yesterday I talked about this Zogby poll that we're posting on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and it's on the official Zogby website.
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  They did a poll last week in New York of 850 people. I mean Zogby is one of the most highly respected polling agencies out there.
[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  And as I said, 41% believe the government was behind 9-11 and of the other percentage, the largest percentage of that believes that they at least had prior knowledge.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  It's just a few percentage points that think the government didn't have prior knowledge.
[02:54.000 --> 03:05.000]  And that's what I've gotten, Michael, from all the thousands of interviews over 1600 that I've done around the country on AM and FM stations as a guest on shows, liberal shows, conservative shows.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  I know I talk about this all the time but it's the best news we've got.
[03:08.000 --> 03:19.000]  People are not buying this. It is an illusion. And I watched Rudolph Giuliani's, it was a pretty good speech last night, and the guy, it was just patent lies, propaganda, not about Kerry.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  I mean most of that stuff was true. What he said about Bush's cousin and Skull and Bones' mate was true.
[03:24.000 --> 03:35.000]  But the way they pose as our saviors and they're going to keep us safe from the terrorism and just incredible lies when you know the facts of the government involvement.
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  It's so disgusting to see people involved in 9-11 posing up there as our saviors. It's just totally disgusting.
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  But there were some other developments that happened Sunday and then Monday that I didn't get to yesterday.
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  When we got here Saturday, we got here about 8 o'clock and we stayed up until about 2 in the morning just going around the city interviewing people.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  And they have signs up saying it's not illegal to videotape but you might get in trouble when that's in the newspaper.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  Really?
[04:06.000 --> 04:14.000]  Yes, so it's all color of law. So we go down to the subway and I'm videotaping and this woman starts screaming at me from behind the glass enclosure where you buy your tickets.
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  And she says, that's terrorism, you can't do that, stop it, police, police.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Oh my God.
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  Oh, it's just amazing. And then you'll be out on the street and police will ask, why are you videotaping? Well, because I'm wearing a press badge.
[04:30.000 --> 04:45.000]  Imagine how bad it is just for the average person. Meanwhile, they've got this Fuji blimp that I talked about, which is the forerunner of the giant tethered blimps that are going to be 30 plus times the size of the Goodyear blimp with the ground-putting radar.
[04:45.000 --> 04:53.000]  This thing says Fujifilm sponsoring NYPD and it's flying around surveilling. You might have 10 helicopters in the air at once hovering over people.
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  And so here they are surveilling us, their cameras are good but they're setting the precedent where our cameras are bad.
[04:59.000 --> 05:11.000]  Well, then last night I ran into, well, I'm sure you've heard of the fellow who had that Vox New York website that got the government so mad he made so many predictions.
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.000]  Right.
[05:12.000 --> 05:24.000]  I ran into this guy at a 9-11 truth meeting with all these prominent people and he takes me out along with my film crew last night on his cigarette boat.
[05:24.000 --> 05:36.000]  And I got the tour all the way around Manhattan and no fewer than three times we get stopped by the Coast Guard aiming M60 machine guns at us.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  Good heavens.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  But they were nice and they didn't care that we were filming, they were just checking and they were guarding the Statue of Liberty and the rest of it.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  So I understand that.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  And then we had a little bit of fun with them, they wanted to race so we raced the Coast Guard and beat them.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  This cigarette boat has got two giant engines.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  Folks, I was having a blast but I was out there just to get video of the city.
[05:57.000 --> 06:06.000]  But then we get back and we take the train from New Jersey because his dock was in New Jersey back across over into New York.
[06:06.000 --> 06:15.000]  And once we got to the New York side, the doors open at a stop in the subway and there is this old lady bent over, collapsed.
[06:15.000 --> 06:23.000]  A homeless person, had to be like 78 years old, maybe 80, totally collapsed, her head on her chest asleep.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  So I went over and gave her some money.
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  John Stapp Miller happened to be there, he gave her some money.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  And we're sitting there videotaping going, this is what's wrong with our society, how will this happen?
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  And these cops run over and go, you're not allowed to film that and show that and start making me erase my tape.
[06:38.000 --> 06:45.000]  And another lady on the train that we weren't even with took a photo of them, they flip out, smash her camera right in front of us.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  Smash a woman's camera in front of us.
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  She starts crying, they write down her ID and say we may have to get you for something and she's crying and begging, I'm not a terrorist, please.
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  This is a woman with blonde hair by the way, imagine if she was a Muslim.
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  And so there's this woman crying and begging and I have to stand up to them and go, look man, this is America, we're allowed to tape.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  Well, do you want to get arrested? Well, no, but do whatever you have to do.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  And so this went on and on and finally we got back on the train and left.
[07:10.000 --> 07:17.000]  But this is the atmosphere and then I get home and see Giuliani's speech re-aired.
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  And so I'm laying in the motel room dead at 3.30am watching him re-air it on CNN.
[07:25.000 --> 07:34.000]  And there's Giuliani going, we're fighting against the tyranny, the tyranny in the police state they have overseas, we're bringing you freedom, we're protecting freedom, blah, blah, blah.
[07:34.000 --> 07:47.000]  And here I am living in a place, staying in a place where they smash women's cameras, rip the film out, right in front of them, where they threaten to arrest you for giving old people, disabled people money.
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  I mean, it was just absolutely amazing to see all of this happening.
[07:52.000 --> 08:03.000]  And then, of course, as I said back on Sunday, we were over behind the convention center at Square Garden and this black sedan pulls up and out gets David Gergen with one of his handlers.
[08:03.000 --> 08:10.000]  And I walk over, the big, again, White House advisor for what, three presidents, and he's walking in the back and I go, will you talk to us, sir?
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  And I give him a few softball questions and then I just said, well, what about Bohemian Grove?
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  And he said, I better not talk about that.
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  And I said, well, back in 96, you joined the Democrats and the Republicans were mad and said, oh, he's Bohemian Grove, ha, ha, ha.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  And you said in the newspaper, well, I don't run around naked like the rest of them.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  And he started turning red.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  He goes, I'm not going to talk about that.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  And I said, well, sir, you're part of it.
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.000]  You're part of the rituals.
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  And he goes, oh, what do you know about it?
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  And I go, well, I've got video of it.
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  And he goes, you were allowed in there under our trust.
[08:37.000 --> 08:38.000]  And how dare you do that?
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  And I said, wait a minute, I snuck in there.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  And he goes, oh, you're the one.
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.000]  You're the one.
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.000]  You're the one that trespassed.
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  And he, the guy's like 6'6", jumps in my face, and I mean, I'm only 5'11", starts bumping into me.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  This is all on video, two different angles, getting right in my face, bumping into me, starts using mild profanities at me.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  And then bowls off angrily and starts trying to call security on us.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  This is for standing on a public street in New York.
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  And then also, yesterday, I'm down by Madison Square Garden, and they call it an actual security event.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  Everything's cordoned off for a few hundred yards around it, four or five streets around it.
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  Now they're going to increase the security perimeter.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  And I'm just standing up against the wall videotaping police.
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  And all of a sudden, there's this horrible pain in my elbow, and this huge cop is squeezing my arm, going, turn that camera off, get moving.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  And I just looked at him, and he had his billy club.
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  He just wanted me to do something.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  He just wanted to crack my head.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  And again, folks, I'm a guy in a dress shirt, you know, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  Can you imagine what it is like for people who are, you know, not, you know, the classic, you know, white guy America?
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  I've really seen them just randomly harassing weak people, period.
[09:50.000 --> 10:01.000]  Women, children, families, and I'm not saying all the police are like this, but then last night at Madison Square Garden, the cops will use horses in designated areas.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  And they say, well, your march is allowed to march from, you know, from, say, Union Square down to Madison Square Garden.
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  But it's got to stop here, and we cordon you inside these barricades, as we've seen before.
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  Well, then they start breaking the barricades up and getting people in other sub-boxes.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  Then they have horses ride in, and none of this is on the news, and start bumping the people.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  And then all of a sudden, the cops just come in, and hundreds of them on mopeds, these big mopeds, start bumping people.
[10:25.000 --> 10:33.000]  Well, they ran over some man. He fell into his wife, a white couple, and this big black guy just punches the cop right in the face.
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  He goes flying off the moped. About 800 riot police and black uniforms come running out from his parking garage, just waiting.
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  It was all staged. They got the people they wanted, started the fight. I mean, it's just psychological warfare.
[10:46.000 --> 10:53.000]  I mean, you can't run over men and women with mopeds and bump them. And they're all peacefully standing where they're supposed to go.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  And I've seen this over and over again on tape, on video, being there, being here.
[10:59.000 --> 11:07.000]  Witnesses I've talked to from Portland and Seattle and the meeting down in Miami last year, they do this over and over and over again.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  It's the government manipulating the police against the people, Michael.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  Yeah, absolutely. It gives new meaning, too, to your video about the police state.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  You know, because it's a very sad testament to what this country is becoming. We are living under a police state.
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  Well, what was that man supposed to do when he watched people getting run over by mopeds for no reason?
[11:27.000 --> 11:36.000]  I mean, I'm not defending what he did, but he just hauled off and just Mike Tyson, the cop, went flying off the moped. It was on the news, too.
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  And then the little anarchists will come and burn a paper-mache dragon or a puppet, and the cops leave them alone, and then 30 minutes later start arresting hundreds of innocent people.
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.000]  These little anarchists, man, they work for the government, folks. We've proven that in other cities, and I'm sure of it here.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  We try to talk to them, and they're really communists. We're in little communist armbands, and they'll threaten us and say,
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  well, oh, Stalin killed 50 million people. Why are you doing this? And they go, shut up. Too bad he didn't kill you.
[12:01.000 --> 12:10.000]  And this is the mindset of these people. So we've got the communists basically working for the Republican Party, posing as anarchists, trying to stir stuff up here.
[12:10.000 --> 12:19.000]  Yep, absolutely. Alex, tell us about Michael Moore. I didn't think you got all of that yesterday when you were talking about the confrontation with Moore at the restaurant.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  Well, how long do we have before the break, Michael?
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  We've got about five minutes.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  Okay, great. Well, again, I want to thank you for filling in for me, doing a great job.
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  Thank you.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  Just to describe this, as I said, the march, just what I saw, had broken off into eight, nine, ten groups.
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  Just the whole massive city block after block after block, jammed with hundreds of thousands of people.
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.000]  And so I'm in one tail of a march interviewing folks. Most of them, by the way, are informed about the New World Order.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  No Kerry's bad, no Bush is bad, are getting past the left-right paradigm.
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  But I'm, as usual, arguing with communists. They're threatening me, and my cell phone rings, and one of my friends in New York said,
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  listen, I'm right up here at the head of the march at 5th and 30-something.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  And he said, get over here, Michael Moore is right here. And he's being interviewed by people as he walks.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  And so by the time I got over there, just getting a few blocks to 30 minutes because of the crowds,
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  I get over there, he's gone in this taco shop, and he's in there eating.
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  And as I get there, he's going in, and they had everybody thrown out of the restaurant.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  I have video of this. So here's the man of the people, the average guy, out there, boy,
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  he's always confronting these corporate fat cats that throw people out of restaurants and have bodyguards,
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  and Michael Moore, the little man's man. And so I put my camera right up to the window.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  They wouldn't let me in, and there he is, you know, shoving food in his mouth.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  And he's got all these bodyguards, I don't know, probably 10-12 of them,
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  and they start coming out and shoving me and getting in my face and going, what are you doing?
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  Letting me don't video him to the wall or through the glass. He was way back in the back of the restaurant.
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.000]  And I said, no, I'm going to do this. So they backed off, and then I talked to Moore's manager or handler,
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  and he said, well, we might interview later this week. Of course, we called, and he won't do it.
[14:03.000 --> 14:11.000]  And all of a sudden, we're the first to be there. About 30 minutes later, there's now four or five TV cameras,
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  three or four still-camera folks from all the big newspapers, a bunch of paper reporters,
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  and we're all sitting there, and they come out, and the bodyguards just start bumping into people, ramming people.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  And this big guy rams into me, so I just rammed right back into him, and they get shocked.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  So much of this stuff is for show. He kind of crumpled back for a second and was like afraid.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  I'm not even that big of a guy, but you just rammed into me, buddy. I'm going to ram right back into you.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  And Moore, and I jump in front of Moore, and I go, why don't you talk about Norris standing down?
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  Why don't you talk about the drills on 9-11 of Hijack Jets, blah, blah, blah?
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  And then police came running up and kind of mushed him on through the barriers, and Moore went off to some waiting car,
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  because they had most streets and side streets totally blocked off, but there was his car and a side street.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  The police had let it through, and Moore drove off. So it's just very, very hypocritical.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  I mean, I've supported Moore under the First Amendment. I think his film is a whitewash.
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  It doesn't cover 2% of what really happened. It kind of acts like it's all the Republicans instead of this larger global system that's doing this.
[15:14.000 --> 15:23.000]  But overall, I mean, I don't think Michael Moore is a bad guy, but he is a complete and total hypocrite, and his bodyguards did act in a faggot fashion.
[15:23.000 --> 15:31.000]  Yeah. Alex, let me ask you this. With the Zogby Poll out, what do you think Bush is thinking with the numbers that they are?
[15:31.000 --> 15:38.000]  I mean, 40-odd-some-odd percent is nothing to be laughing at. What do you think Bush is thinking?
[15:39.000 --> 15:47.000]  Well, here's the funny thing. The 9-11 Visibility Project and the 9-11 Truth Movement paid $4,000 for the poll.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  Another $3,000 to have Zogby send it out. Zogby is one of the most, if not the most respected.
[15:53.000 --> 16:03.000]  And they did it of 850 New Yorkers, registered voters, and they called up random New Yorkers, and I've actually got the poll over here.
[16:03.000 --> 16:18.000]  41% believe that the U.S. government was behind 9-11, and then of the 50-plus percent that are left, a large portion of those believe the government at least had prior knowledge.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  It's only 8% think the government had no culpability. So, what does that say to the globalists?
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  And again, for people that say, well, that poll isn't real, again, here we are on my own syndicated radio show.
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  We beg people to call in and disagree. When they do, it's that I'm not right-wing enough or not left-wing enough or I don't think it's this group or that group.
[16:36.000 --> 16:44.000]  But we all agree it's a New World Order, it's a threat, it's a problem. Whereas five, six years ago, half the callers to my show on one station disagree with me.
[16:44.000 --> 16:53.000]  But it's not just my show, it's interviews I do. Thousands of them. And I know, Michael, you've had the same experience. We have turned a corner, and that's why the globalists are scared to death of us.
[16:53.000 --> 17:05.000]  Absolutely. Yeah, we're winning the war. We are winning the war. And again, this is a very, very good time to be out there because we are providing a place for people to get the truth.
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.000]  They know deep down inside of themselves that something is wrong. And the thing is that they are now starting to question what's going on.
[17:14.000 --> 17:26.000]  Well, they are. And look, the problem is it's kind of a catch-22 for the globalists. They can either back off with their plan, but we continue to expose them, or they can accelerate it.
[17:26.000 --> 17:36.000]  And I know that the globalists would have already carried out more staged terror attacks, government-sponsored terror attacks, if people like myself and you and others, the listeners out there, weren't getting the word out.
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.000]  We're at a crossroads, a critical juncture right now, and it's time for everybody to be more vocal, more focused, more informed.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  Right. Alex, we've got to grab the break. You want to hang over?
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  Sure.
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  Okay. We'll be right back after the break. I'm Michael Corbin with Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show. We'll be right back.
[17:51.000 --> 18:08.000]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain? Alex Jones here, America. We answer these vital questions much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.000]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem reaction solution.
[18:14.000 --> 18:33.000]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open, a nightmarish post September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged, witnesses populations begged for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft to the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[19:09.000 --> 19:25.000]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element. When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon 222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[19:25.000 --> 19:35.000]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated. Your purified water is now ready.

[21:13.000 --> 21:21.000]  Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones who is online with me right now, live from New York at the Republican National Convention.
[21:21.000 --> 21:26.000]  And I want to encourage you, get over to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  Check out the offerings that Alex has there. We're talking about what's going on in New York right now.
[21:31.000 --> 21:39.000]  It is a virtual police state and Alex has well documented all of these dynamics in his videos.
[21:39.000 --> 21:50.000]  And you can get over there and order them online or you can call till free 1-888-253-3139 against 1-888-253-3139.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  And Alex, again, I wish I was out there with you.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  I know this is all very bad but it sounds very exciting you're covering this thing.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  And nowhere else can you get the truth but here.
[22:02.000 --> 22:09.000]  Well, I really appreciate that, Michael, and I appreciate the network supporting me and coming out here to New York.
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  And I want to just thank all the New Yorkers that have been so supportive.
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.000]  But to watch the police with horses and mopeds ramming into people, I mean, what do you expect us to do when you treat us like this?
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  And the media will focus on the most clown-like, stupid protesters instead of listening to what people are really saying.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  And it's a diverse crowd. By diverse, I mean diverse opinions and ideas.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  And as I said, thousands and thousands and thousands.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  One group put out 10,000 of these 9-11 cover-up signs.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  So people really are waking up and I keep going back to that point.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  But they want confrontations. They're trying to start fights with people.
[22:45.000 --> 22:53.000]  Again, I've had a cop grab me and squeeze me real hard to try to be mean and then want me to do something with a billy club in his hand.
[22:54.000 --> 23:05.000]  Of course, I didn't fall for that. I've had him run up and threaten to arrest us and make us erase tapes right in front of him under threat of arrest for giving an old lady money.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  It's disgusting. And it's this attitude that they're God, the state is God, and we're somehow bad.
[23:11.000 --> 23:20.000]  And this whole thing in New York, what happened in Boston, it's all being used to condition us and to sell us on this model of tyranny as if it gives us security.
[23:20.000 --> 23:28.000]  Right, exactly. And that is the thing that people must really realize, that this is the game. It's a psychological warfare game. It's what it is.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  Well, it is, Michael. And I really want to thank you for filling in again.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  And I know you've got a ton of callers, so I guess you're going to be taking calls in the next hour.
[23:35.000 --> 23:45.000]  Again, I will continue with reports. I will have more details for you tomorrow of what goes on with Schwarzenegger tonight inside the convention.
[23:46.000 --> 23:56.000]  And they're saying tonight is where you're really going to have the big protests. And this is where we're hearing that the anarchists are going to try to basically provocateur things.
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.000]  They're all over the city trying to stir stuff up and basically working with the police, some of them consciously, I believe some of them unconsciously.
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  But tonight, they're at Madison Square Garden. It's a convergence of a bunch of different marches and demonstrations.
[24:09.000 --> 24:22.000]  So tomorrow, and of course on the websites, we'll also be reporting, we'll be here filling all the listeners in with an eyewitness account of actually what's going on, not with what the media is telling us is going on.
[24:22.000 --> 24:33.000]  I mean, there's so many distortions, Michael, that we've gotten from The New York Times, from The Washington Post, from Fox News. There's the worst, Neocon.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  But we'll be here deciphering that and chronicling all their different activities.
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  Excellent. Now, keep the cameras rolling. Stay safe, okay?
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  Well, I'll certainly try. And of course, that's up to God. And I want to thank the listeners for all their prayers. But it's actually a lot of fun to fight tyranny.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  And Michael, I'm going to let you go. And thank you so much.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  All right, Alex, thank you very much. And we'll see you tomorrow, okay?
[24:54.000 --> 24:54.000]  You bet.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  All right. Take care.
