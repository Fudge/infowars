[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:35.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.720]  well I'm wound up today so much show that I ended up shooting a bunch of a
[00:41.720 --> 00:46.360]  special reports that are up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com over the
[00:46.360 --> 00:52.680]  weekend shot three videos yesterday alone because I tried to tune out every
[00:52.680 --> 00:57.880]  time I turned on television to watch a little news every time I went online to
[00:57.880 --> 01:03.200]  check the news the drudge report but also other sites I saw news articles at
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.440]  the Huffington Post time magazine just everywhere going after the Bill of
[01:09.440 --> 01:13.920]  Rights and Constitution that I was walking through a store and saw one of
[01:13.920 --> 01:18.240]  the Texas papers putting down the Constitution putting down our Republic
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.920]  bashing the founding fathers and it just really illustrates the type of
[01:22.920 --> 01:27.360]  tyrants that we're dealing with and so we're obviously gonna be breaking some
[01:27.360 --> 01:35.040]  of that down today and thank God there is a real media in this country like info
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.560]  wars.com like worldnetdaily.com they're not perfect I don't agree with some of
[01:39.560 --> 01:43.320]  their pro-war views but overall they'll cover the serious subjects the drudge
[01:43.320 --> 01:49.040]  report.com and the thousands of alternative media websites and
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.680]  personalities natural news Mike Adams doing a wonderful job agree with them
[01:53.680 --> 01:59.480]  about 99% of the time that's why the system wants to come in and openly
[01:59.480 --> 02:03.280]  start censoring the alternative media that's why Google admits they've
[02:03.280 --> 02:06.440]  changed their algorithm to start restricting visits to the drudge
[02:06.440 --> 02:11.480]  report to info wars.com they wouldn't be doing this if we weren't having an
[02:11.480 --> 02:14.880]  effect against them just like they wouldn't be attacking the Bill of Rights
[02:14.880 --> 02:22.560]  and the Constitution if we weren't having an effect on these scallywax now we
[02:22.560 --> 02:25.600]  come back from break I'll start getting into all of the news I just want you to
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.080]  know we have Jeffrey Steinberg he's been the director of counterintelligence for
[02:30.080 --> 02:35.960]  the news weekly magazine EIR we'll talk about the economy they predicted all of
[02:35.960 --> 02:40.280]  this with total precision the death care known as Obamacare where that's
[02:40.280 --> 02:47.000]  going we'll just look at a host of issues where Jeffrey Steinberg coming up
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.840]  in the second hour today dr. Paul Craig Roberts who really did call this
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.760]  Dominic Strauss-Kahn situation first when I kind of halfway took the bait and
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.280]  said I hate the globalist I hate the IMF they're criminals which they are and
[03:00.280 --> 03:04.880]  this was this is how these elitist operate always raping women and it's
[03:04.880 --> 03:10.840]  true I mean it's constantly happening but I still added the caveat of but
[03:10.840 --> 03:15.360]  normally they get away with it they get away with bloody murder of its Bill
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.520]  Clinton and you know the list goes on and on with the raping so I said I am a
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.760]  little suspicious that that that that New York would go after him and why was
[03:24.760 --> 03:29.480]  Elliott Spitzer the governor who passed a law to take the property and put
[03:29.480 --> 03:32.800]  Johns in jail why was he visiting three thousand four thousand dollar a night
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.160]  hookers why was the FBI surveilling him within a month of the hooker visit and
[03:38.160 --> 03:41.400]  ready to use that against him it shows that they know the corruptions there
[03:41.400 --> 03:45.320]  they only burn you well he tried to score political points by pointing out
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.920]  that the big central banks were engaged in serious crime and so they burned
[03:49.920 --> 03:56.240]  Elliott Spitzer so this whole thing the point is that they're now reporting that
[03:56.240 --> 04:03.880]  she is a prostitute that she's connected to organized crime but the big tell with
[04:03.880 --> 04:09.960]  the Dominic Strauss con situation you know the thing that really gets my you
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.400]  know hairs on the back of my neck up is that Sarkozy's Carl Rove his chief
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.440]  political strategist and also his one of his main aides separately before con
[04:19.440 --> 04:23.680]  even been arrested or was even in the news put out tweets that he was a rapist
[04:23.680 --> 04:28.960]  and had done this and later admitted well we had spies following him around in
[04:28.960 --> 04:34.440]  the hotel we had spies in the hotel and following that's how we knew I mean right
[04:34.440 --> 04:40.080]  there that this is his big political rival but it it's a distraction a certain
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.080]  level will spend 20 30 minutes on all skin to the economy of Roberts in the
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.480]  last 30 minutes the broadcast but that's that's coming later I've got the
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.800]  incredible economic news they've gobbled up grease and they're saying oh we need
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.480]  even more money who would have thunk it we've got a lot of other incredible news

[07:04.000 --> 07:08.160]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[07:08.160 --> 07:12.480]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.440]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[07:16.440 --> 07:20.800]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:20.800 --> 07:25.120]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[07:25.120 --> 07:28.920]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.920 --> 07:33.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[07:36.760 --> 07:40.800]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.800 --> 07:43.520]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[07:59.960 --> 08:08.160]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:10.480 --> 08:16.440]  well I hope everyone had a wonderful 4th of July I hope that everybody was safe
[08:16.440 --> 08:22.740]  out there and I also hope that when you sat around with your family roasting
[08:22.740 --> 08:28.400]  hot dogs and grilling steaks and hamburgers that you talked about why the
[08:28.400 --> 08:34.400]  4th of July is so special we're gonna be discussing that today you know I didn't
[08:34.400 --> 08:38.120]  read the Declaration of Independence last Friday on air a lot of other talk
[08:38.120 --> 08:42.000]  show hosts did I didn't cover it Sunday because I figured you know people can
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.280]  read that for themselves but more and more I realized that I need to read the
[08:45.280 --> 08:48.920]  Bill of Rights on air I need to read the Constitution on air I need to read the
[08:48.920 --> 08:55.120]  Declaration of Independence July 4th 1776 on air with John Hancock's name big and
[08:55.120 --> 09:02.120]  bold up at the top along with Thomas Jefferson shining what could have been
[09:02.120 --> 09:06.480]  their death warrant many of them did have family killed or themselves killed
[09:06.480 --> 09:10.640]  their their farms burned down their their property seized they went through
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.320]  hell because they were tired of warrantless checkpoints they were tired
[09:15.320 --> 09:19.160]  of out of control bureaucracies and taxes they were tired of only the
[09:19.160 --> 09:25.760]  aristocracy only the aristocrats who had inside connections were allowed to
[09:25.760 --> 09:30.240]  engage in major commerce and business they were tired of the fraud and the
[09:30.240 --> 09:36.600]  tyranny of the British Empire and what we're facing today is nothing less than
[09:36.600 --> 09:42.200]  the vestigial remnants of that repackage in a global corporate model and
[09:42.200 --> 09:47.840]  of course at the same time many Brits also supported their countrymen in the
[09:47.840 --> 09:50.920]  colonies and realize the tyranny they were facing we're gonna be talking
[09:50.920 --> 09:56.560]  about some of that today because I shot a couple videos covering this up with a
[09:56.560 --> 10:01.440]  weekend because I was so angry about it I'd turn on talk radio I would open the
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.880]  newspaper I would visit my own websites and see all the mainstream news articles
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.320]  that we were linked to demonizing the Constitution demonizing the Bill of
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.520]  Rights demonizing our constitutional Republic the founding fathers all of
[10:17.520 --> 10:24.280]  it and and selling collectivist crony collectivist globalism you know a
[10:24.280 --> 10:29.680]  fellow when I was at the anti-TSA demonstration last Monday not this
[10:29.680 --> 10:34.440]  night yesterday but a week ago before that Monday before last to be technical
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.360]  and a fellow walked up and he said I hear you use crony capitalism and that's
[10:39.360 --> 10:44.080]  the term that most academics use for the system we live under academics that
[10:44.080 --> 10:48.320]  are being honest but he said why don't you use the term crony collectivist
[10:48.320 --> 10:52.720]  because that's really what it is and I said you're right but to try to get
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.440]  people to change that term and use a more accurate term I've got a now for
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.360]  the next few years and we'll see if we can get into widespread use via your
[11:00.360 --> 11:08.240]  recommendation start using the term crony capitalism which is again and
[11:08.240 --> 11:14.400]  then it is from the new term crony collectivism or monopoly collectivism
[11:14.400 --> 11:21.720]  fat cat collectivism fat cat monopoly collectivism I mean really the best
[11:21.720 --> 11:26.880]  term for it is corporate fascism they use socialism at the grassroots to get
[11:26.880 --> 11:30.520]  people on their payroll independent so people don't know the joys of true
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.280]  freedom and liberty and the real free market and voting with your dollars
[11:35.280 --> 11:41.000]  voting with your business choices and the incredible animating societies that
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.440]  builds the empowered societies that that builds everything the globalist does
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.160]  whether it's in schools getting rid of grades or dumbing the education down
[11:51.160 --> 11:54.240]  where they spend maybe an hour on reading writing and arithmetic now and the
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.200]  rest of the hours and diversity training and and and and environmental
[11:58.200 --> 12:03.160]  tattletale training and law enforcement classes in sixth and seventh grade
[12:03.160 --> 12:07.440]  we've gotten the curricula now ten years ago learning how to spy on your
[12:07.440 --> 12:15.240]  parents I mean this is flaming out in the open tectonic level on fire stomping
[12:15.240 --> 12:23.080]  up and down like a ogre on top of his tyranny it is fire breathing flaunting
[12:23.080 --> 12:27.640]  tyranny just running all over us in a psychological warfare and attempt to
[12:27.640 --> 12:34.680]  break our will so after I cool down a bit because I want to be focused here I'm
[12:34.680 --> 12:39.520]  going to get into the all-out assault a little bit later in the hour on the
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.240]  America on the Constitution on the Bill of Rights I shot the video yesterday
[12:43.240 --> 12:51.920]  that's gone particularly viral titled media attacks America on Independence Day
[12:51.920 --> 12:55.920]  and that's exactly what they're doing the United States is only more dirt more
[12:55.920 --> 13:02.800]  real estate another banana Republic like China or Mexico or North Korea or
[13:02.800 --> 13:10.000]  Venezuela or Nigeria it's another thug run with a bunch of plutocrats on top
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.040]  another command and control society if you don't have that Declaration of
[13:14.040 --> 13:17.280]  Independence Constitution Bill of Rights and if we don't enforce it and the
[13:17.280 --> 13:23.120]  system's great at blaming the Constitution Bill of Rights and our
[13:23.120 --> 13:28.280]  system on the tyranny and the corruption no it's since we got away from the
[13:28.280 --> 13:31.160]  Bill of Rights and Constitution Declaration of Independence and the
[13:31.160 --> 13:36.640]  spirit of 1776 and the animating contest of liberty it's a fight even when
[13:36.640 --> 13:42.040]  you're awake and do and everything you can to have freedom the founders weren't
[13:42.040 --> 13:46.200]  perfect the idea was beautiful though and ideas are bulletproof they're
[13:46.200 --> 13:51.120]  trying they are transcendent we are transient ideas are transcendent when
[13:51.120 --> 13:56.800]  they are based in truth and animated in the great contest when you put it into
[13:56.800 --> 14:03.160]  action when you will it when you begin to realize your place in human destiny
[14:03.160 --> 14:08.480]  that you are transient like the lilies of the field but that ideas and the human
[14:08.480 --> 14:14.440]  species if we don't destroy ourselves will go on forever and in the justice we
[14:14.440 --> 14:24.240]  commit today will ring throughout eternity even if our species died the
[14:24.240 --> 14:32.120]  evil you do today will ring throughout the universe Martin Luther King said
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.120]  justice that the universe bends towards justice and I see those out there in our
[14:37.120 --> 14:40.880]  society who have consciously decided to be unconscious who decided to be
[14:40.880 --> 14:45.520]  willfully ignorant and how they worship at the feet of corruption and the dark
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.080]  power of evil how they get off on laughing at those of us that care
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.080]  laughing at those of us that have a heart laughing at those of us who believe
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.360]  in justice and dignity and who know we're all in perfect but are striving for
[14:58.360 --> 15:04.680]  something better the cynics are the greatest cowards because they just go
[15:04.680 --> 15:08.680]  along with the system thinking they'll be left alone they're smart enough to
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.120]  make a subconscious and even conscious calculation to go along with the evil
[15:13.120 --> 15:19.920]  I will not be counted among those timid souls go from us in peace forget that we
[15:19.920 --> 15:24.880]  were your countrymen in fact may your chains sit lightly upon you crouch down
[15:24.880 --> 15:32.400]  and lick the hand that feeds you I know not what courts others may take but as
[15:32.400 --> 15:42.360]  for me give me liberty or give me death because slavery is a crueler master
[15:42.360 --> 15:48.280]  than death being a coward caring what people think about you being too timid
[15:48.280 --> 15:53.080]  to speak up and stand up and be involved that is a death that it has to be
[15:53.080 --> 16:00.360]  endured thousands of times and I will not live in fear I will not give into it
[16:00.360 --> 16:06.160]  it is not my master I commit my full will and everything I am in the service
[16:06.160 --> 16:11.200]  of humanity and liberty and it's animating fire
[16:17.560 --> 16:21.720]  I'm on control myself right now
[16:24.040 --> 16:29.640]  of the pantheon of news I have here in front of me here's one that particularly
[16:29.640 --> 16:38.720]  shickened me yeah he was a socialist but he meant well you go back 80 years ago
[16:38.720 --> 16:44.960]  when his thought process he's had already matured talking about Ernest
[16:44.960 --> 16:49.640]  Hemingway the choice you had was fascism and black uniforms and curtsle
[16:49.640 --> 16:54.800]  helmets and Benito Mussolini or it was socialism the banksters financing both
[16:54.800 --> 17:01.040]  sides we now know in hindsight put out that offer and many well-meaning people
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.840]  went became socialist and communist because they believe that was the system
[17:04.840 --> 17:08.640]  that was countering this later they learned about Stalin the rest of it many
[17:08.640 --> 17:12.880]  of them turned against it like George Arwell real name Eric Blair but I have
[17:12.880 --> 17:17.520]  been touched by the novels of Ernest Hemingway I read some of them when I
[17:17.520 --> 17:20.800]  was young and had enough life experiences to then read them and to know
[17:20.800 --> 17:24.720]  that he was putting a lot of real things that happened to him and things that he
[17:24.720 --> 17:30.040]  saw and things that he reported on during the Spanish Civil War as a
[17:30.040 --> 17:42.640]  reporter like for whom the Bell tolls and it was known at the time decades
[17:42.640 --> 17:49.680]  later after World War two that Hemingway was internationally respected he was
[17:49.680 --> 17:56.520]  calling for peace and the FBI began harassing him and harassing his family
[17:56.520 --> 18:02.160]  and persecuting him and when he said they were harassing him and tapping his
[18:02.160 --> 18:08.080]  phone they came and arrested him and took him and gave him shock therapy until
[18:08.080 --> 18:12.480]  he was almost a vegetable and he was so depressed that his intellect and his
[18:12.480 --> 18:18.240]  deep mind that gave him access to his soul had been burned away he committed
[18:18.240 --> 18:30.280]  suicide and they called him at the time a conspiracy theorist a conspiracy they
[18:30.280 --> 18:34.920]  took the conspiracy theorist and they strapped him down and ran blue lightning
[18:34.920 --> 18:40.200]  across his cerebral frontal lobe left and right hemispheres they ran
[18:40.200 --> 18:45.920]  electricity hundreds of times through his brain and in the hatred of his
[18:45.920 --> 18:52.600]  humanity and his heart and his soul they turned him into a zombie and then
[18:52.600 --> 18:57.520]  kicked him out on the street and it didn't matter that his family and other
[18:57.520 --> 19:01.160]  said yes we're being harassed they said you're a conspiracy theorist and they
[19:01.160 --> 19:06.080]  arrested him and they murdered his mind and now it's all been declassified the

[24:27.760 --> 24:31.960]  Hemingway and the FBI harassment in his bank accounts bugging his house his car
[24:31.960 --> 24:40.440]  other harassment they then adding committed with electro shock and of
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.520]  course now they've released FBI documents they released some in 1983 but
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.520]  it's still a conspiracy theory and now they've released more Gio and of course
[24:51.520 --> 24:56.760]  Jagger Hoover had a personal interest in the case he loved to stalk people and
[24:56.760 --> 25:01.440]  harass folks especially famous people because he was a ego maniac with no
[25:01.440 --> 25:06.000]  talent of his own I mean that's that's who peoples the psychopathic
[25:06.000 --> 25:13.920]  government and and and mega corporate crony power structures later that month
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.440]  he was committed for psychiatric care for believing the FBI was harassing him
[25:17.440 --> 25:21.480]  at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where he received electro shock treatment he
[25:21.480 --> 25:24.960]  had been suicide several times before being released a few days after
[25:24.960 --> 25:29.000]  returning home to catch him he shot himself in the head with his favorite
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.360]  shotgun at age 61 in the year since I've tried to reconcile Ernest's fear of the
[25:35.360 --> 25:40.520]  FBI which I regretfully misjudged with the reality of the FBI file wrote his
[25:40.520 --> 25:46.440]  friend the author of Papa Hemingway I now believe he truly since the
[25:46.440 --> 25:49.880]  surveillance and that it was subsequently contributed to his anguish and
[25:49.880 --> 25:55.840]  his suicide no he never tried to commit suicide till they grabbed him for
[25:55.840 --> 25:59.240]  saying he was under surveillance which is now admitted his mail being gone
[25:59.240 --> 26:04.480]  through bank accounts harassment you name it phone calls people in his yard
[26:04.480 --> 26:08.240]  all of that and so then they took him and electro shock
[26:08.240 --> 26:12.040]  therapy him for month after month after month after month after month after
[26:12.040 --> 26:18.360]  month after month after month and still even though this is all admitted they
[26:18.360 --> 26:23.360]  talk about him like he's a cuckoo even when they murder you it's your fault
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.760]  because if you faced the tyranny if you faced what a sick joke it is to have
[26:28.760 --> 26:33.120]  Obama the Nobel Peace Prize winner running all these new wars and calling
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.160]  him calling it peace and telling you it's not war if you admit you're being
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.800]  lied to brazenly and that they think you're so stupid they think you're so
[26:42.800 --> 26:48.480]  stupid that that you don't know what a war is or they call the Patriot Act
[26:48.480 --> 26:54.200]  patriotic when it guts the entire bill of rights completely got six of the ten
[26:54.200 --> 27:03.000]  amendments partially guts the other four the first ten it's all a sick joke to
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.040]  these people to have all these talking heads on the Sunday shows in one unified
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.840]  attack on the Constitution and how it's outdated in a piece of garbage and the
[27:12.840 --> 27:21.240]  the over-the-top attack on liberty and freedom going on at all of the public
[27:21.240 --> 27:25.800]  schools in this country at the colleges at the high schools demonization of
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.880]  America demonization of the founders demonization the bill of rights and
[27:29.880 --> 27:34.440]  Constitution when it was the greatest expression of human liberty that point
[27:34.440 --> 27:41.040]  and it is set up against tyranny to allow tyrants to get the mob all hyped up
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.360]  the general public to bring in tyranny and to stop dictators from coming to
[27:45.360 --> 27:49.360]  power and they've worked around it they've built giant bureaucracies they've
[27:49.360 --> 27:54.120]  done their best to erode it and now they point at it and say it's the reason
[27:54.120 --> 27:59.400]  we've got problems just like they blame free market for the banking collapses
[27:59.400 --> 28:03.400]  when it's the banks doing this by design threatening to fully collapse the
[28:03.400 --> 28:09.160]  world economy at a faster pace if we don't give in to their larceny if we
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.960]  don't give give in to their hostage-taking of the economy and then
[28:12.960 --> 28:18.160]  Greece second bailout hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars your
[28:18.160 --> 28:22.960]  tax money Germans British tax money French tax money and we're told oh it's
[28:22.960 --> 28:27.760]  for those Greeks and it's all to the private central banks that created the
[28:27.760 --> 28:31.800]  fraudulent instruments and put their people in as the finance minister and
[28:31.800 --> 28:36.200]  the prime minister two and a half years ago and publicly had meetings about how
[28:36.200 --> 28:42.600]  they were going to bring the country down open naked criminal activity against
[28:42.600 --> 28:49.400]  society on the surface and they're not going to stop until we stop them I know
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.280]  the average person working at the FBI the average police officer the average
[28:53.280 --> 28:58.320]  government bureaucrat the average corporate minion you're not bad people
[28:58.320 --> 29:03.320]  you're compartmentalized you're given fake false projections politically for
[29:03.320 --> 29:09.000]  why you do what you do but if you pull back engage what's happening in the
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.960]  context of history there's no doubt this thing stinks to high heaven I know the
[29:15.960 --> 29:21.280]  last few days I smelled something rotten something stinking I knew there was

[29:24.680 --> 29:30.320]  raccoon rotten well you can smell the stench of tyranny even if you try to
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.720]  live in denial how are you ignoring it as we accept globalism as we get further
[29:35.720 --> 29:39.880]  away from the Constitution Bill of Rights the money the liberty the private
[29:39.880 --> 29:45.520]  property the prosperity the dignity the honor the pride it's all drying up like

[35:44.760 --> 35:49.920]  you're going to learn that because men in caves had norad stand down their
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.880]  passports magically survived the World Trade Center fire and building seven fell
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.040]  on its own and the Easter Bunny flew around on a magic carpet at the same
[35:58.040 --> 36:03.520]  time as well and so now you're not going to take photos and the TSA is now
[36:03.520 --> 36:07.520]  harassing people in lying and saying you can't videotape your grope down or
[36:07.520 --> 36:12.560]  others grope down despite the fact that they're even their own policy says they
[36:12.560 --> 36:18.080]  encourage it oh but then we have Homeland Security training videos that
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.240]  they show TSA showing people taking photos and saying that's a sign of
[36:22.240 --> 36:28.560]  terrorism no a sign of terrorism is and we're all a locky and arguably the
[36:28.560 --> 36:31.640]  number three number two or number one they claim different people are number
[36:31.640 --> 36:34.880]  one or number two or number three in the top three al-qaeda hanging out
[36:34.880 --> 36:38.440]  secretly with the secretary of the army in the top brass at the Pentagon when
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.960]  he's on the most wanted list hmm or Mutala of the underwear Christmas Day
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.280]  bomber being gotten on the plane without a passport and when the State
[36:47.280 --> 36:51.720]  Department got under pressure yeah the sharp dressed man helping him get on the
[36:51.720 --> 36:57.360]  plane State Department helper so powerful they could order the people
[36:57.360 --> 37:06.120]  letting through security without the IDs the government's really nice people oh
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.960]  but everybody's so scared we need more security remember a week or so ago
[37:11.960 --> 37:17.280]  without a valid passport or identification of the man also out of
[37:17.280 --> 37:24.280]  Africa out of Nigeria he was able to get through all the security and fly
[37:24.280 --> 37:33.200]  wherever he wanted to go oh isn't that nice it's wide open it's a joke their
[37:33.200 --> 37:40.080]  people are protected so but don't you take a photo don't you do that we're
[37:40.080 --> 37:44.280]  gonna land this plane the nearest airport and throw you off and charge you
[37:44.280 --> 37:51.480]  that's right with violating federal law it's federal laws whatever we say is
[37:51.480 --> 37:59.640]  disruptive it's all part of your dog training how to be a servile slave now
[37:59.640 --> 38:07.760]  let me just stop there for a moment before I plunge into the economic news
[38:07.760 --> 38:13.920]  and just a whole smorgasbord of key information we ran a special last week
[38:13.920 --> 38:20.000]  and it was one of the most popular ever until we ran out of police state for the
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.720]  rise of FEMA my newest film and it was so popular and all I really care about
[38:26.720 --> 38:29.360]  the other day is getting the information out and being able to fund our
[38:29.360 --> 38:33.720]  operation and to be strong enough to survive different types of attacks we've
[38:33.720 --> 38:39.160]  been able to do that thanks to your support we did we held back like 50 for
[38:39.160 --> 38:42.520]  individual orders for because in a couple weeks it's coming back in but I told
[38:42.520 --> 38:46.800]  you that the special to get five of my best-selling films and Mark Dyson's book
[38:46.800 --> 38:52.200]  for $29.95 would end and it has ended but until this Friday and then it's
[38:52.200 --> 39:00.520]  completely done I am going to have a different offer you can get now dark
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.560]  secrets inside Bohemian Grove the order of death two films once an hour and a

[39:43.680 --> 39:48.000]  through Friday because the end of the day I had no idea the special it was
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.160]  just time to end the five DVD special so why not just run for another week and
[39:51.160 --> 39:54.280]  then add a free book on top and then now it was so popular we're gonna do it for
[39:54.280 --> 39:59.160]  one more week or I guess five more days and then the deal is done technically
[39:59.160 --> 40:01.960]  we'll probably run at their Saturdays people can get their orders in but the
[40:01.960 --> 40:06.640]  point is it you can now get dark secrets in fact Bohemian Grove's coming up just

[49:42.880 --> 49:46.680]  because they said it was a conspiracy theory for decades you are still bad
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.440]  even when it's admitted and even though we have the police on tape with a fake
[49:51.440 --> 49:55.080]  bomb threat it's a violation of the Patriot Act and state and other federal

[54:28.360 --> 54:32.280]  hundred million Americans died from complications this was published in the
[54:32.280 --> 54:40.200]  80s from the sv-40 cancer virus in the polio shots and then we played clips on
[54:40.200 --> 54:44.880]  cbc of the developer of it laughing and giggling about how many people are

[55:10.080 --> 55:13.920]  really get it down to terms that makes sense and really actively properly
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.000]  define what we're dealing with they are the enemies of capitalism once they use
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.040]  a fraudulent system to wreck it they then blame capitalism and say more
[55:22.040 --> 55:27.280]  globalism more serfdom more regulations that will fix it that will help you that

[55:33.520 --> 55:40.720]  look at all this economic news I mean rationing toilet paper there's money
[55:40.720 --> 55:45.160]  for every government bureaucracy for shrimp on treadmills for 15 million
[55:45.160 --> 55:51.480]  dollar Halliburton tarps in Iraq all these endless wars and you understand
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.280]  this is the gutting of the country Coney Island's making money for New York it's
[55:55.280 --> 56:02.400]  very popular but it's government run so they're like eh no toilet paper so they
[56:02.400 --> 56:06.040]  have toilet attendance that hands you your one sheet people are like what
[56:06.040 --> 56:10.680]  they'll pay somebody to make sure when you're in the toilet you don't use to
[56:10.680 --> 56:14.000]  you they can buy a hundred times more toilet paper for the cost they don't it's
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.200]  about control it's about somebody and they're watching you go to the bathroom
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.440]  TSA putting their hands on your pants it's about getting in your space getting
[56:21.440 --> 56:27.960]  in your privacy breaking your will teaching you to be a servile slave ah
[56:27.960 --> 56:34.920]  sick of it watching the tyranny close in on us
[56:35.480 --> 56:40.080]  ECB will continue to accept Greek debt and they go on to say oh yes now there
[56:40.080 --> 56:43.400]  needs to be a third bailout in Greece and then we will do with that and then
[56:43.400 --> 56:46.720]  there'll be a fourth and a fifth and then tenth and a twentieth and they're
[56:46.720 --> 56:50.520]  gonna implode all the major countries including the US and say we'll fix the
[56:50.520 --> 56:54.360]  economy just give us trillions more and you look at who owes the debt the
[56:54.360 --> 56:58.680]  banksters created the six big mega banks but that doesn't matter because the
[56:58.680 --> 57:04.480]  average American only knows about the latest murder trial the average
[57:04.480 --> 57:08.160]  American knows about the average football game because from birth they
[57:08.160 --> 57:13.800]  were set in front of a television set put into a technical medical trance on
[57:13.800 --> 57:17.880]  record look it up you want Alzheimer's you want brain damage you want lower
[57:17.880 --> 57:21.560]  cognitive ability watch television get into that suspended disbelief
[57:21.560 --> 57:25.360]  internet's not as bad because you're doing things you're moving around in it
[57:25.360 --> 57:30.240]  the study show radio is the best even better than reading go look at the
[57:30.240 --> 57:36.640]  studies for neurons and development it goes radio reading and on up it got
[57:36.640 --> 57:39.120]  covered studies with the London Telegraph last week just pull it up you
[57:39.120 --> 57:46.080]  don't believe me so so the issue here is ladies and gentlemen you probably don't
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.920]  even want to watch this on prisonplanet.tv or do it and turn away every
[57:50.920 --> 57:55.240]  few seconds because even though I'm not sending subliminals or programming or
[57:55.240 --> 58:00.760]  anything it still isn't good to lower your brainwaves it still isn't good to

[58:31.840 --> 58:37.960]  grandma and it also cuts back on neural connections a lot of other issues well
[58:37.960 --> 58:42.320]  they're right back stay with us tons of news gas it's all coming up

[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:26.600]  Alex Jones we are changed anti-New World Order pro-liberty group that's
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.600]  completely grassroots and about nine percent of the time their intel turns out
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:37.640]  to be very accurate says that the federal government along with the state
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.440]  police and others confiscated one of the cameras erase the footage but that they
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.120]  were able to get it with another camera we're getting the details right now
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:52.480]  we'll see if they pop in later a report that water is pouring into the reactor
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:58.160]  there in Nebraska now three weeks ago listeners were telling us this and the
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.400]  government said it wasn't and then in two weeks into that a week ago now they
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.640]  admitted it has flooded and it's on emergency backup power and the water
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.680]  just keeps rising there's a lot of evidence showing and the emails went
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.800]  back and forth with different government groups and the Army Corps of
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.800]  Engineers that they deliberately didn't release water in the winter and let it
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.640]  build up to crest level in the dams and they're in there engaged in this
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.600]  flooding to grab property wouldn't be the first time FEMA's done stuff like
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.240]  that and that's the Army Corps of Engineers is now under that so we're
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.640]  going to be breaking all of that down as it develops I got Aaron Dykes ferreting
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.200]  ferreting into that information right now I was getting into the economy and
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:46.560]  just got angry of course the quote bailouts which is just bankers holding
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.000]  your economy hostage to their fiat currency system designed to be impossible
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.120]  at the end of the Ponzi scheme to ever pay back but they can then hold you
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.160]  hostage to commit all of society everything to them to the point of
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.800]  they're handing over people's retirements in Europe they're now going
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.440]  after private retirements that are 100% yours oh that's welfare if you'd have
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.120]  your own retirement must go to the bankers they're slashing any type of
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.360]  social services and New York City's now rationing toilet paper at Coney Island
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.880]  even though the Coney Island makes the money now people won't go they don't
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.840]  care it's about driving the economy down you think the globalists don't know
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.960]  that air travels way down you don't think they don't know that tens of billions
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.200]  upwards of 20 billion a year now being lost because of the TSA's activity
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.560]  sources CNN of course they know they want to wreck it and then leave one or two
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.280]  big globalist companies left later this is a command and control command
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:45.280]  destruction shock therapy system as they call it
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.800]  surprise surprise Gomer Cornyn says Republicans make set many deal on
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.840]  raising US debt ceiling so don't worry the bankers will get us deeper into debt
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.200]  in their fiat system that's Bloomberg don't worry Republican leaders will do
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.640]  what they're told but Rand Paul says he's going to filibuster it and they
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.760]  got will rise his profile further he's been doing everything he said he do so
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:14.760]  far I'm very impressed no recession for Obama's 454 winehouse aides they'll
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:22.400]  make 37 million 121 thousand four hundred sixty three dollars this year and
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.200]  their their rates are going up of course they're laying off a lot of the the big
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.560]  mega six banks their customer service level people because that didn't need
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.120]  any more this is just a mopping up of the economy operation a lot of cyber
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.720]  attacks over the weekend as you know Secret Service to probe Fox News
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.360]  cyber attack right as they're trying to pass the Cyber Security Act to put in
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.440]  the kill switch and the rest of it there's all sorts of cyber attacks going
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.760]  on definitely linked into all of this continuing I want to get to this after
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.840]  our guest leaves us in about an hour media attacks America on Independence
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.680]  Day and I said I saw a lot of examples of it in the video I shot and even the
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.720]  Huffington Post did the right thing and told the truth Time magazine's Orwellian
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.280]  Constitution story refuted it's so bad even the Huffington Post even George
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.740]  Sardos's outfits against it the elite are not even trying to hide how much they
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.640]  hate the US Constitution this American dream blog article at info wars dot com
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.560]  and prison butter dot com if I have time I'd like to read the whole thing and
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.720]  they found a whole bunch of examples of the weekend of just full-on out in the
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.960]  open we want to get rid of the Constitution so we're gonna be going
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.840]  over that report also George will the Constitution is an anti-evolutionary
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.520]  device well the problem is it was the greatest evolution in political systems
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.320]  towards freedom tying down government empowering individual the new stuff they
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.440]  always hype and push to do it's better than the Constitution is just classic
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:58.520]  feudalism classic aristocracy ruling over us through their tyranny but but
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.600]  we'll be right back they're just renaming buckets as you know what Jones with
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.320]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.080]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.160]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.600]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.880]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.640]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.720]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my

[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:11.360]  is our last chance to not relive history as it finishing off this agenda that we
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.960]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.000]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I

[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:10.360]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:19.160]  coming up in the third hour in the last 30 minutes the former head of policy
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.040]  department of treasury the father of Reaganomics will be joining us to get
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:29.520]  into the economy but also the dominate Strauss con situation as they now
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.480]  announced the da is going to drop the charges da set to drop charges versus
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.760]  dominate Strauss con reportedly the media is reporting and New York Times and
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:44.600]  others that she is a mafia connected prostitute and that the police don't
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.960]  believe her story but her lawyers have another idea not saying con is a good
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.800]  guy it's just that normally globalists can rape and do whatever they want to
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.040]  anybody and not get in trouble I talked about New York police openly saying we
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.280]  are change out of bomb that they were going to frame them if they didn't leave
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.960]  saying we're going to frame you I mean hardcore super felonies committed on
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.400]  camera and they give the camera back I just committed a felony I know you have
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.600]  a media operation here's your camera leave just total confidence so that's my
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.600]  point New York is so corrupt that DSK if he was in favor with the globalist if
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:22.280]  they were you know happy with him if he was in good standing could barbecue
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.840]  children in his hotel room and he wouldn't get in trouble literally I mean
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.040]  in Europe they're constantly caught doing things a lot more depraved than
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.400]  grabbing on a woman and I'm a and that's certainly a bad thing so we're
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:38.000]  breaking down next hour media attacks America on Independence Day just a full
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.640]  on assault the American dream and info wars.com has written a key article the
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.200]  elite are not even trying to hide how much they hate the US Constitution so
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.120]  they're they're coming out of the closet and saying all our problems of the
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.280]  Constitution when you notice we've gotten away from the American system and
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.400]  everything's falling apart their answer is hey you're not feeling bad and not
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.880]  be able to hold a job because you're mainlining heroin every day and taking
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:10.040]  more and more of it you need more heroin or you're not having liver disease
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.600]  because you're drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels every night for 20 years the
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.320]  problem is you're not drinking enough Jack Daniels so New World Order
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:25.600]  globalism corporate fascism crony monopoly man collectivism whatever you
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.560]  want to call it I call it piratical corrupt mafia masquerading with 21st
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.560]  century PR programs gang raping us I mean I mean there's there's no way to
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:43.400]  describe this disgusting system with just words it's all coming to a head also
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.960]  Bill Gates of course he openly says he wants to reduce world population
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.600]  forcibly and he's got special you in vaccines for you he's also famously said
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.520]  you know we we can hire 10 to years that we kill grandma Newsweek the case for
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:59.840]  killing granny but when we say hey your Obamacare will kill people and it lets
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.000]  the insurance companies actually reduce care for big HMOs and makes you buy
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.440]  overpriced healthcare it was written by the insurance companies all on record
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.760]  their answer is just to say you're a racist you don't like black people you're
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.440]  like what does that have to do with it shut up racist and then meanwhile you
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.800]  say well it's death panels oh death panels yeah whatever meanwhile they
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.480]  admit their death panels they admit it's these federal boards in Europe in
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.560]  England they admit you wait on average 18 months to get brain cancer to get
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.920]  brain cancer surgery that is almost a hundred percent operable that's done
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.720]  within six months I've seen the debates in the House of Commons this is all
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.400]  planned out all planned out and Bill Gates gets up there and giggles about
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:48.080]  his death panels because he's the humanitarian and our next guest has
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.400]  done a lot of work exposing that you know I want to cover the waterfront with
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.520]  him today you can disagree with some of their solutions and you know the the
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.320]  Washington Post has called them extremely right-wing other media has
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:08.520]  called them Marxist I really think the best way to describe them is complex
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:14.200]  and I want to get Jeff Steinberg's own view on themselves but we had Lenin
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.680]  LaRouche on last week's and I why not have Jeff Steinberg on this week he's
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.000]  from the director of counterintelligence for news weekly magazine EIR
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.760]  found a Lenin LaRouche in 77 his investigative journalist with 30 with
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.840]  over 25 years Steinberg has written and presented lectures on subjects ranging
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:35.160]  from who runs the international dope and weapons cartels and over the years of
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:41.880]  his found out their analysis is spot-on who to whom is behind the cover-up of
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.560]  Princess Diana's murder and most recently who authored 9-11 he also has an
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.520]  in-depth knowledge of the cover-up of President John F Kennedy's assassination
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.160]  I won't talk about all of this and developed extensive knowledge on the
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.200]  inner workings of the Justice Department FBI and DEA and recent years
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.360]  Steinberg has directed a number of special investigative projects for EIR
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.600]  resulting in a series of feature packages on subjects such as the coming
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.720]  fall of the House of Windsor wood president Bob Dole well it just goes on
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.280]  from there over some of his famous treatises they broke down as a big
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:23.320]  presence key and September 11th LaRouche pack.com LaRouche pub.com are the
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.080]  websites and I want to cover the waterfront here with Jeffrey Steinberg
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:35.200]  but Jeff first in 2002 as you know over a thousand pages of IMF World Bank
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.240]  documents got released the week after Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stickles left
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.400]  he says he didn't release them wink wink and Greg Powell has put them out of
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.640]  course and in there they admit the hundred point plus plan was 112 points
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.920]  of how they go in by all politicians get them in debt have them signed over the
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:59.640]  nation's real estate and infrastructure then the corrupt dictator leaves they
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.200]  implode the country cause rioting bring an austerity which causes more rioting
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.160]  more austerity selling off the infrastructure the country never gets
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.320]  out of debt it's all fraudulent but that now they were going to do it to the
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.040]  first world nations and now they've done it and admittedly most of the dead in
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:22.880]  Iceland in Ireland in Greece in Portugal is not owed by the people on record in
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.360]  most cases over 90 percent summits down in the low 80s is is owed in Ponzi
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.240]  schemes in derivatives as you know the banksters created the big six megabanks
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.920]  with the Queen of England the Netherlands and the Rothschilds and
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:40.040]  Rockefellers shitting high atop it openly and how how painful is it for you
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:43.760]  to know this for 30 plus years to speak about it right about it to now
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.480]  watching it all come to a head as they globally conquer everyone out of their
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.360]  fraud out of their Ponzi schemes calling for a bank of the world to pay our
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:58.880]  carbon and VAT taxes to and to see them implode countries literally shut off
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.600]  the social services toilet paper and government buildings in New York you
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:08.000]  know all of this knowing that it's a black hole of debt designed to reduce
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.760]  us to absolute slaves and now it's in the news today financial times of London
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.200]  you name it up at drudgerport.com and full wars comm as well it's all up there
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.680]  today where they say oh guess what we need another bailout now or Europe will
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.840]  collapse and then you give them another bailout and then it'll collapse and
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.080]  another and another and another and the same threats we saw here three years
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.480]  ago when Henry Paulson threatened martial law they did the same thing in
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:38.240]  Europe tanks in the streets blood martial law Jeffrey Steinberg what what is
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:45.840]  going on here where when is this going to end it's gonna end when the Ponzi
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:56.440]  scheme is burst when an alternative policy is put in place and I think that
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:03.000]  we're a lot closer to accomplishing that particularly here in the United States
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.240]  than a lot of people think look you put you put the fundamental issue on the
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:14.040]  table for decades and decades we catalogued and documented the absolute
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:20.200]  genocidal looting of the developing sector whether it's Africa Latin America
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:27.920]  Southeast Asia exactly what you said creating a debt bubble going for asset
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:33.320]  stripping depriving the countries of their basic livelihood resulting in
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.160]  massive population reduction all on their agenda now they're trying to do it in
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.800]  the first world they're trying to do it in Europe and of course they're trying to
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:48.760]  do it here in the United States with the policies that really began with when
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.880]  particularly when Greenspan came in as chairman of the Fed and on behalf of J.P.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:17:00.360]  Morgan broke up the whole Glass-Steagall system that had hamstrung the banks from
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:06.240]  looting the savings of households and one out any kind of credit for
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.320]  investment in the real economy so now we're at the point where in the House of
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:17.040]  Representatives you have a Glass-Steagall reinstatement bill before the
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.440]  legislature it's HR 1489 it's got about 20 co-sponsors now and our
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:32.120]  perspective is to overwhelm the White House by having the majority of members
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:36.280]  of the House of Representatives cosponsoring the bill to where people
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.000]  like Barney Frank can't dodge the bullet and prevent it from coming up to a
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.960]  debate and vote on the floor of the House same thing in the Senate we're
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:49.560]  expecting any day now a Senate version pretty much identical to the
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:56.880]  captor bill this is a flank to bankrupt Wall Street this is not just simply a
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:03.080]  way of reconstituting commercial banking like a chargeback of an unauthorized
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:10.280]  charge on your credit card we're going to charge back at least 17 trillion
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.880]  dollars in gambling debt accrued by the big Wall Street banks and by some of
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.280]  their European friends particularly in the interalpha group of Lord Jacob
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.880]  Rothschild Jeffrey stop right there because I want you to get into Rothschild
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.800]  and all that in more detail but I don't want to just glaze over the important
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.880]  things you're you're saying they admit that customer service banks lending
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.280]  banks private sector banks are disappearing they're being gobbled up by
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.600]  the regulators run by the big six banks who put their people into all the main
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:47.080]  positions of power they admit that the customer service level of banks an
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.400]  actual lending for the economy is shutting down all over the world despite
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:56.000]  them being flush with banker bailouts and and that they're laying people off
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.200]  at banks everywhere I mean this is a planned implosion this is this is
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:06.040]  economic genocide that's exactly right and we're going to make sure that it
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:11.040]  doesn't succeed and that's the fight that we're in right now you've got a mood
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:17.080]  in the country where there is an absolute sense of betrayal by this
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:24.160]  president by Wall Street and we've been at public meetings all over the United
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.960]  States the 4th of July recess was a perfect opportunity the Progressive
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.120]  Caucus had a series of policy forums we were in Milwaukee and Detroit and
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.720]  Harlem in New York City and when our people got up our candidates in
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:44.760]  particular and raised the issue of Glass-Steagall and bankrupting Wall
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:50.400]  Street and reconstituting the viable commercial banks that are needed to
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:55.720]  protect depositors savings to issue credits into the real tell us what the
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.840]  people did when you said that when we come back Jeff Steinberg is our guest

[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.840]  okay going back to Jeffrey Steinberg I want to get into a host of other issues
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.040]  really look at who these people are but you were getting up to the point of
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.640]  speeches all over the country with your organization and when you talked about
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:03.680]  last eagle going after the banksters the response you got it was electric
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:11.120]  standing ovation and in all in all three instances that I'm referring to there
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.080]  were several members of Congress on the podium who were cosponsors including in
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.040]  one instance Marcy captor herself and there were other members of Congress who
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.120]  had not yet signed on and universally every one of them when they saw the
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.840]  reaction said count me in I'm on board and we're holding their feet to the
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.400]  fire we're gonna see what happens by the middle of this week we expect to see all
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:41.120]  of those people now on as signatures we're going for the jugular against Wall
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:47.120]  Street at a moment when they are most vulnerable they're hated by the American
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:54.200]  people the bailout is despised Geithner is in there knowing that another
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.520]  trillion dollar bailout is going to be needed to save the big six before the
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.440]  end of this year and there's no political way that that's going to be
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:09.320]  tolerated in Europe you've got literally non-stop rioting in the streets of
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:14.880]  Athens because people are just completely fed up with the sellout of their
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  government and the fact that most rich in the Lisbon Treaty is a bankers
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.400]  dictatorship straightjacket on them this is not going to go down in Europe
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:29.960]  but in particular in the United States we have a history we have a Constitution
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:35.400]  and we have a remedy for solving this problem we're going to basically take
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:42.520]  that 17 trillion dollars in bailout money and charge it back to the brokerage
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.840]  houses and insurance companies and re-establish a full wall of separation
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.760]  so that commercial banks do what they're supposed to do take the deposits and
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:59.080]  issue loans to businesses home loans for mortgages and let these gamblers
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:03.800]  basically choke to death on their own bad debt well what is their end game plan
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:08.160]  we've seen it on the third world but attempting this in the West they've
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.480]  gotten away with it so far while imploding society I mean all the
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.720]  indicators all the data is coming in on the con on the societal meters and
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.640]  control panel here the instrumentation shows we are in a serious crisis and
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.920]  they really think they're just going to run implosion after implosion looting
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.480]  and stripping after stripping with more looting on top selling us that they're
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.000]  the good guys anybody that criticizes the private Federal Reserve is some type
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.360]  of terrorist that's not gonna hold water I mean more and more the human cry is
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:47.160]  get out the guillotines that's right remember the attitude of Percy Shelley
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.120]  he said we are many they are few he was talking about the oligarchy and it's
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:57.960]  absolutely true at this moment they they selected Obama as their instrument
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:06.640]  they intend to try to go for some sort of pretext for dictatorship but the odds
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.800]  of them succeeding are very slim the real key question is not whether or not
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.960]  there's going to be a revolt there is a revolt already and it's going to get
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:22.320]  much much louder and much nastier the question is will there be an alternative
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:28.880]  policy or will the anger spill over into just uncontrolled chaos in which case
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.760]  their agenda as you mentioned earlier of massive population reduction is what's
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:39.720]  going to happen that's the key question is is their leadership is there a policy
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:47.200]  to bring about an economic recovery to basically cast off this completely
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:53.200]  illegal parasitical gambling debt from the backs of average citizens and will
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.960]  we go back to a credit system based on commercial banking federal credit to be
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:04.280]  issued through the private banking system for viable projects to create jobs
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.120]  and rebuild our economy starting with basic infrastructure but then
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.440]  meanwhile the banksters fund a lot of phony libertarian groups and I see
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.360]  myself as a real constitutional slash libertarian but I don't like labels
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.880]  they're too simplistic but meanwhile they finance all this quote free market
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.600]  stuff that oh you can't finance any public works projects because that's
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:29.120]  socialism well what is it when you give tens of trillions to offshore banks that
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:33.160]  don't pay taxes I mean I'm against socialism but I mean if you're gonna
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.200]  have a government projects there should be the people but then I get back to if
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.720]  we're gonna bail out money or we're gonna print money at least issue it to
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.520]  small businesses how about that how about just have lending how about the
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.000]  currency be controlled by the government and the Congress as it's
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.560]  supposed to as the founders said stay there Jeff we're on the March the
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:30:01.880]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very wealthy US

[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.040]  shift gears now out of what's happening economically after we cover one more
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.600]  quadrant because I got you know I'm gonna pick your brain on so much more
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.720]  dealing with their agenda I remember 15 16 years ago when I was already on air
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:31.480]  folks mailing me executive intelligence review and I'd already done a lot of
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.360]  research and it and found your analysis to be accurate but but but even
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:42.600]  going deeper and now 16 years later I know that it's even worse than you guys
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:48.040]  even report this is so off the chart where they admit in published books and
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:53.000]  documents that the health care is to deny you care and train you and kill you
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.440]  and oh you don't need glasses or eye surgery how about a cane or we're not
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.800]  gonna treat that brain tumor or we're not gonna I mean this is and then they
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.240]  they cloak it and call it liberal then they have fake Republicans like Mitt
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.040]  Romney endorsing carbon taxes and global warming and who wrote the health care
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.520]  bill in Massachusetts as the model and it shows how they control both parties
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.840]  it what is their global goal if they're not stopped what will they do what is
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.200]  their exit strategy from command destruction from a post-industrial
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:31.920]  world as Marie Strong and the head of NASA Space Center Goddard Center says
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:37.200]  Al Gore Ted Turner just a few months ago and in Cancun Mexico saying one child
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.400]  policy global tyranny endorsing and fantasize I mean people expect Hitler
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:46.320]  with a mustache on that's that that was in the 30s and 40s folks it's shown up
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:52.400]  different this time and because it masquerades with a lisping NPR affectation
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.240]  people go well you're whispering at me I'm just gonna lay it lay down and you
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.200]  can run over me who are these people what is their end game what's gonna happen
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.480]  in Europe now they're gearing up for obviously a giant new war as a smoke
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:12.520]  screen this is insanity well look the take it from the top just take a look
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:18.360]  at the British Royal Concert Prince Philip who's one of the founders of the
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:25.120]  World Wildlife Fund back in 1960-61 he just says it outright reduce world's
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:32.600]  population by 80 percent there's a top economic advisor to the German Chancellor
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:40.320]  Angela Merkel named Schellenhuber who basically spreads the whole global
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:45.000]  warming lie and says that the world population the carrying capacity is
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.800]  actually reaching the point where it's under one billion people these people
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:54.680]  reject the most fundamental thing about what it means to be a human being which
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:02.720]  is creativity the ability for scientific discovery to improve the universe and so
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.800]  for them they have a utopian fantasy that they can go back to some kind of
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:13.800]  post-modernist form of feudalism where somehow or other the world population is
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:20.160]  reduced by 80% by wars disease and famine and somehow or other they will
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:28.240]  remain unaffected Bertrand Russell wrote in 1953 that if we could perfect the
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:34.360]  method for having a black death once every generation and we could determine
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.000]  who lives and who dies in that process then we would have the kind of world
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:45.320]  that would be safe and happy place for oligarchs like him these people want to
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:51.200]  go back and read Boccaccio the Decameron which was Boccaccio's account of the
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.640]  delusions of the oligarchy in Europe at the time of the 14th century black plague
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:02.520]  where they also thought that somehow by bloodline they were immune to what was
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:09.040]  going on all around them and they're not so there's no question that they are
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:14.080]  doomed the question is whether or not the rest of mankind is going to go down
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.480]  with them that's right whether we're going to put together an alternative
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:22.000]  policy that's right the social engineers the Anglo-American eugenics
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.640]  proto-nazis I wouldn't call them neo because they Hitler of course was a
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.160]  extension of that openly funded by the projects absolutely openly funded by the
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:38.560]  Rockefellers who fund Bono now and of course Bill Gates I mean he's an open
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:42.680]  subsidiary of the Gates Foundation he doesn't pay taxes but goes around
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:47.000]  telling you that middle-classion have its taxes raised I mean these people are
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.520]  nightmares of evil and I'm glad folks are rioting in Europe whenever Mono
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.120]  excuse me Bono shows up but there's something on top of this Jeff this
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:01.760]  this this transhumanism and I don't mean all the flavors of it but the
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.960]  dominant one coined by Aldous Huxley's brother Julian Huxley when he wrote in
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.440]  1951 Hitler has disc and he can pull this up folks
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.520]  Hitler's discredited eugenics because he went too far too fast we're going to
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:20.080]  rename it transhumanism and promise that all of this tyranny and genetic
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.560]  engineering and the rest of it will extend life and may and make us
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:30.720]  transform so they sell their takeover and they sell and the elite sell the
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.120]  public going back to nature but really they're delusional as you know it's
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:42.000]  being pushed everywhere now in the transcendent man and the rest of it that
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.600]  that they're going to live forever here's the Daily Mail today dawn of a
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.160]  new age the first person to reach 150 is already alive and soon will live to be a
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.080]  thousand claims scientist dr. Aubrey de Grey and then you've got you know all
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.280]  the rest of these people pushing this so at the highest level councils of the
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.800]  globalist system this is what they're obsessed with whether it's real or not
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:08.360]  they think like some Ian Fleming book moon raker they're going to kill all of
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.880]  us and then and then inherit the earth and go up on some Mount Olympus and live
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:18.880]  forever like Zardas I mean these people are nuts please talk about it that's
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:25.240]  exactly right they are nuts they have delusions but I think it's more important
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:31.800]  to realize that basically this is the essence of the oligarchical system it's
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:38.560]  the essence of the system of money power based empire you could trace it back to
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:45.760]  Rome and even to earlier antecedents you had a phase in which Rome morphed into
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.260]  the Byzantine Empire and then into Venice and Venice relocated to the
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:55.720]  Netherlands and to England what you have is a system that says that there's an
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:02.200]  oligarchy at the top that rules through the power of money and that the rest of
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.040]  humanity is basically to live in some kind of form of animal or slave
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:14.080]  existence so it's that system that has now reached another one of those break
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:21.360]  points where the Ponzi scheme has burst and where they are desperately
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:27.560]  scrambling for a way out of it you said a few moments ago that that under these
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:31.640]  kinds of circumstances they go for war and they go for dictatorship that's
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:37.680]  exactly right we've entered into a new fiscal year as of just a few days ago on
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:46.640]  July 1st in 47 out of 50 states all of the states collectively are bankrupt to
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:52.680]  the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars and in order to basically conform
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:59.800]  to the Constitution and basically solve that indebtedness for the start of the
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:06.040]  new fiscal year they've implemented levels of genocidal austerity and now
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:12.280]  on top of that you've got this whole suey debate over the debt ceiling in
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:18.160]  which they're using it as an excuse for further slashing medical care all kinds
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:25.280]  of things the American people are looking for an alternative and we have the
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:32.120]  alternative clearly at hand it's before the house we also know that to achieve
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:37.760]  the change in policy that's urgently needed at this time President Obama
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:43.600]  needs to be removed from office through perfectly legal constitutional means
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.760]  it's a scandal in my mind that the House of Representatives has not already
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.320]  convened the equivalent of a grand jury into the president's failure to meet the
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.320]  requirements of Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution in this ongoing
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:06.480]  Libya operation it's a clear violation not just of the War Powers Act but of the
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:12.080]  most fundamental issue within the Constitution namely the fact that we
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.400]  were not to be a monarchy kings were not to have the authority to frivolously go
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:24.040]  to war it was given to the Congress precisely because we wanted to make it
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:29.800]  as difficult as possible to get involved in wars President Obama believes
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:35.880]  that under the doctrine of humanitarian intervention which in UN lingo is now
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:42.480]  called R2P responsibility to protect that he can bypass and rip up the
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:49.080]  Constitution that is intolerable well Jeff we can see the new model of 1984
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:54.320]  tyranny where they call war peace and and go around slaughtering everybody and
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.560]  that's the reason they gave him the peace prize knowing that this was the
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:04.800]  strategic blueprint it's all part of the sick joke rebranding war as peace
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:12.840]  precisely so now we've got a situation where many people in the Congress know
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:18.560]  that the president is in clear violation of the Constitution so we have an
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:23.960]  avenue prescribed by the founding fathers for removing a president from
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.040]  office if they've committed high crimes and misdemeanors and there's no doubt
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:33.480]  that President Obama crossed that threshold we also have the option of
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:38.880]  section 4 of the 25th amendment which was enacted in the aftermath of the
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:44.800]  Kennedy assassination which laid out precisely how a president may be removed
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:50.880]  from office with a checks and balances system if he's considered both physically
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.000]  and or mentally unfit to continue to serve the presidents crossed that
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.120]  threshold also and again these are issues that are not going to be fought
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:06.040]  out strictly inside the Beltway because there's a great paucity of members of
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:11.320]  Congress with the moral guts to act to defend the Constitution we have a group
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:16.600]  of ten members of the house led by people like Dennis Kucinich Walter Jones
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:23.280]  John Conyers and other who filed a federal suit against President Obama for
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.120]  failing to live up to his constitutional obligations and so the federal
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:33.200]  court now has this matter before them and this is what caused the White House to
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:39.120]  completely freak out and scramble to cover for Obama's flagrant violation of
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.280]  the current state even Nadler and of course Ron Paul but even Nadler the
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:49.560]  minion of Obama came out and said if this stands the presidency is now a king
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:54.440]  I mean he used the term Emperor and then and folks understand this is one of the
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:59.360]  most pure forms of tyranny if you go back to crossing the Rubicon with Caesar
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:04.960]  whatever it was 45 46 I forget before Christ if that we just pull up the
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.720]  Caesars crossing the Rubicon for me thanks I forget the exact year but the
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:17.040]  point is is that this is so out in the open and so ridiculous and his lie that
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.840]  it would last days not weeks and now the special forces are there they're
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.000]  preparing the ground troops the Russians have confirmed what the Israelis have
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  confirmed that what we first reported a month ago that it's on cold bloodedly
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.720]  always knowing that if they couldn't get rid of Gaddafi they'd go to ground
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:40.160]  force and calling in humanitarian now the the corporate is Empire the very
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:44.440]  dangerous new strategy and I'd like you to talk to this now all they have to do
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:48.560]  is foment some rebels in the Middle East North Africa it's al-Qaeda as usual
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.520]  same folks to use against the Russians and the Serbs have al-Qaeda blow up some
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:56.200]  police station shoot some people government fights back against it and
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.560]  then there's a full-on invasion and you don't even call it a war and our media
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.880]  now tells us we must support al-Qaeda well look let's let's be very clear
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:11.840]  though the Constitution the War Powers Act the debate that went on around the
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:18.320]  passage of the Constitution was very clear only the Congress has the
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:23.800]  authority to declare war and if you go back to the early history of our
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:29.720]  Republic and we were when we were battling the Barbary Pirates justice John
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:35.760]  Marshall of the Supreme Court was very clear that Congress lays down very
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.600]  precisely what the president is commander-in-chief can and cannot do and
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:47.040]  the minute that the president crosses the line and goes beyond that he slapped
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:52.560]  down in order to cease and desist now under even just the war powers
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:48:00.800]  resolution itself it specifies not only American troop involvement but if an
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:08.000]  American commander is involved in a military operation then that constitutes
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.280]  a requirement of the president to get congressional approval who is the
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.080]  commander-in-chief of NATO it's Admiral Stavridis who's an American naval
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:25.240]  four-star the Africa calm came out with a report last week that basically proved
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:31.760]  that the president was in contempt of Congress when he filed a 38 to a 32 page
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.600]  memo arguing why he didn't have to come to Congress for the first time I've
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:40.880]  ignored for the first time Jeff as you know three weeks ago they ignored the
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:46.600]  Pentagon's own lawyers that said you got to go to Congress that's right and this
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:52.800]  past week Africa came out and said that US planes with US pilots have carried
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:59.160]  out over 800 bombing sorties in Libya since the beginning of hostilities and
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:05.480]  that at least 160 of those resulted in bombs being dropped on targets one of
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:13.680]  the members of the Senate during the early debate last week was grilling the
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.120]  State Department General Counsel Harold Koh who's one of the big George Soros
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:25.280]  men proposing this humanitarian interventionist doctrine and one of the
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:30.400]  senators said well by your definition we could drop an atomic bomb on Tripoli
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.480]  and as long as no American soldiers are in danger that doesn't count as a war so
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:40.560]  it's preposterous and Obama should be being impeached today the first order of
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.760]  business with the reconvening of the house tomorrow afternoon ought to be
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:51.800]  canceling all other business and convening the house as a grand jury to
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:57.840]  consider the impeachment of Obama you're absolutely and that's a serious
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.880]  message that the Congress is listening to the American people and that we want
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:09.160]  a radical change in policy back to our traditions well if we don't the sky is
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:14.320]  the limit and more and more Obama wants to use troops domestically and the TSA
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.440]  against the American people Jeff we're going to break but do you agree that we're
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.600]  also seeing a domestic spy apparatus and now beginning to be turned loose
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.080]  against the population absolutely and the president would like to go for
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.360]  dictatorship if he can come up with a pretext to get away with it I want to
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:33.800]  come back and get into 9-11 false flag stage terror attacks I want to get into
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:41.160]  Obama death care Jeff can you stay 15 minutes into the next hour okay great

[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.960]  well and and and everything we've been doing so I want to thank all of your
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:16.280]  support info wars dot com or again prison planet dot TV to find out more
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.160]  about all of that I'm gonna have Jeff with us 15 minutes the next hour you
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:22.600]  know a lot of the ads are at the end in the start of the hour but we got some
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:26.680]  time we'll take a few calls for him before he leaves us but but Jeff I was
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:32.960]  getting into state sponsored terror but also because you I've seen your reports
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.600]  I've seen it myself and they're saying and I've read their books where they say
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.680]  it's for the population reduction they're gonna kill us and how the old
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:43.440]  deserve to die and then they they count on the public not reading all their
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  writings and we sit here with horror going these people aren't liberals or
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:52.360]  conservatives these are these are psychopaths Jeff Steinberg how how do
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:57.640]  you deal with this well the first the first thing that you've got to do is
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:05.200]  shed the public light on them a lot of the things that they say themselves they
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:10.400]  say out of the arrogant and false assumption that their words are only
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:17.920]  being heard and read among a very tight circle of like-minded people so there's
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:23.760]  a great deal that's to be said for simply sticking to the intensive
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:30.120]  historical research to give people a framework for understanding who these
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:37.680]  people are and what they're doing and that strengthens the population to take
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:43.040]  the necessary curative action you know you mentioned earlier Adam Smith and I
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:48.200]  had a laugh to myself because you know here was Adam Smith supposedly the
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:54.000]  great ideologue of the free market system but at the time that he wrote he
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.640]  was working for the largest cartel in the history of mankind the British East
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:02.720]  India Company he taught at the East India Company College along with people
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:08.640]  like Jeremy Bentham and James Mill and others so that is the cornerstone of the
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:14.200]  liberal ideology that's the poison that has prompted so many people in our own
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:18.560]  country to forget their responsibilities as citizens of a Republican
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:25.320]  ignore history so you know warfare has always been the instrument of the
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:31.600]  oligarchy as a way of keeping populations both reduced in numbers and
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:37.440]  dumbed down and you know you mentioned the Jeff stay there back in one minute

[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:50.200]  going to get dsk you were finishing your point and we're talking to the director
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:55.080]  of counterintelligence one of the chief and writers and researchers at eir you
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:01:00.520]  can find out more at LaRouche pack.com or LaRouche pub.com Jeffrey Steinberg
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:04.120]  I'm going to briefly get your take on dsk and then a few other issues and take
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:09.000]  calls but we were finishing up a point as we hit break go ahead sir well I think
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:15.120]  the point is just simply that that really having an understanding a grasp of
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:19.440]  history and understanding it from the standpoint that there's been a long
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:26.760]  running historic fight against this oligarchical faction that permeates the
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:32.280]  whole history particularly of Western civilization from Western Europe the
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:36.640]  migration into the United States into North America was all about getting away
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.720]  from the stranglehold of oligarchy and the United States therefore does have a
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:48.200]  unique historical mission a unique history and our job is to restore that
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:53.680]  because there's still a gut sense of that that moves around in the minds of
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.080]  the American people and you see it particularly in crisis moments like this
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.800]  well that was my next point that was my next question for you is we see the
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:08.560]  awakening accelerating evidence by just a decade ago it took four to six years
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:12.960]  for a population to wake up to the fact that a Bill Clinton or a George W. Bush
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.120]  was a fraud they woke up to Obama the polls showed in less than a year and
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:23.000]  now he's the most unpopular president in modern history and in plunging now
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.800]  when the Republicans get in with a Mitt Romney or somebody and they don't
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:32.880]  deliver they're gonna be political dog food fish food in a matter of weeks and
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:38.600]  so their little tricks aren't working very well anymore and soon aren't just
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.320]  gonna not work they're gonna blow up in their face and I'm seeing that on more
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:45.520]  and more fronts and so they're desperately coming out bashing the
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.720]  Constitution everywhere as if it's sexy and trendy I mean they're really
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:54.360]  revealing themselves and I see it all coming to a head so what can you say
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:03:01.160]  what what can you say about that the flip side is that you've got a small but
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:06.800]  growing group of patriots we see it in the Congress with things like the
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.200]  bipartisan action to reinstate Glass-Steagall like the bipartisan suit
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:17.640]  taken out against the president for violating the Constitution I think that
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:22.920]  the top leadership of both of the political parties have shown themselves
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:27.800]  to be completely bankrupt that's why you've got a majority of American voters
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:32.080]  considering themselves to be independent of the two parties so what
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.240]  happens when they betray us again we have to make sure we win before that we
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.720]  have a very short time fuse in which to win this Glass-Steagall fight because
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:47.680]  that's the way we put the onus back on Wall Street we pull the plug on their
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:55.200]  Ponzi scheme and in the cases these people ought to be being frog-marched off
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:58.640]  to jail but if we win on the Glass-Steagall fight that will be the
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:04.000]  end for the Obama presidency and we'll see a new combination coming into being
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.920]  that's based on people who put country and the survival of future generations
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:14.520]  above petty partisan politics that's what I see beginning to happen that's
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:20.040]  what the population absolutely wants they're responding to those politicians
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:25.600]  who change their stripes and take that position and you know mr. LaRouche has
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.880]  put forward very clearly the steps that have to be taken in the immediate days
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:36.680]  a week ahead and I think that the vast majority of Americans are behind it let's
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:41.080]  let's talk about what happens if we don't change course and stop the Ponzi
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:45.080]  schemes because the system admits the Ponzi scheme is a meant to gobble up all
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.440]  wealth on the planet it's hundreds of times all the real wealth on the planet
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:52.720]  they're fraud if we sign on to it it's like a lead weight of a trillion tons
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.320]  around our neck being thrown into the Mariana's trench we'll be right back
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:59.520]  with some of your phone calls some other key issues but Jeff Steinberg straight

[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.200]  the last year it's now been a year since this TSA takes one of the biggest
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:34.400]  stories in the world so that's coming up dr. Paul Craig Roberts as well I want
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:38.120]  to take a few calls for our guests we've got him until 20 after really appreciate
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:43.320]  Jeffrey Steinberg for joining us LaRouche pack.com LaRouche pub.com I
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.000]  want to go to Doug Richard Wendy Tim and Aaron at least those five calls for you
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.880]  with quick answers from you mr. Steinberg but I know something you've
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:55.960]  really looked at you've really covered and I've done a sterling job in fact I
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:00.480]  read some of your EIRs online some of the featured articles not the thick
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.200]  publication itself the quarterly or monthly whatever it is I mean I know I
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:07.400]  get them in the mail but never have time to read those I read the online stuff I
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:12.560]  saw your analysis and other people at your outfit two and a half years ago in
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:16.560]  this fight was just starting with the quotes and the and what Dashald written
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:20.640]  this book and what Bill Gates was saying and and how the insurance companies
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:25.040]  had written this to cut off care and to take control from doctors and providers
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.960]  away and let the HMOs you know control it and then I would go actually look it
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:32.880]  up or buy the book I did a lot of research I did some my own as well and
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:37.000]  found not only was it true it was even worse than you were saying because
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.080]  there's no way to cover it all and now Bill Gates has come out and said yeah we
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.440]  want to kill grandma to give ten teachers jobs selling the false idea that
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:49.760]  if you have a predatory cannibalistic economy that for you to have a job
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:54.760]  somebody's got to die selling this play us off against each other economy can
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:00.600]  you briefly speak to what this health care monstrosity really is sure well
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:08.400]  look the the the essence of Obamacare aside from the overall killer austerity
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:17.880]  is the creation of literally a death panel the independent payment advisory
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:22.400]  board is to be given life and death decision-making over what medical
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:27.080]  procedures will be allowed will be paid for and which will be basically
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:34.000]  disallowed this was what Hitler did in 1939 at the very outset of the Anschlos
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:41.040]  Hitler created a euthanasia panel at Tiergarten for it was the physical
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.360]  location in Berlin where the offices were it's identical in every respect to
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:53.480]  what Obama has created under Berwick and others so that it's a it's a Nazi
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:58.600]  policy and he'd beta tested it as early as 35 with handicapped children at
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:02.400]  government orphanages and they would send the little fake death certificate to
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:09.320]  the SS on file that's right in 39 they began it in earnest they continued the
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:14.480]  policy for two years and there was a backlash against it even during war in
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.960]  Nazi Germany in the Catholic Church among others pushed back and they had a
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:24.360]  basically temporarily walk away from it but they obviously reinstated it on a
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:28.840]  grand scale with the concentration camps the gas chambers all of the red
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:34.720]  they had the IBM machines for that all Rockefeller involved total scum right
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:41.320]  but it started out with death panels where you had a quote independent board
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:47.280]  of professionals who were using cost analysis to decide who lives and who
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:53.600]  dies that's what we have with Obamacare well yeah they have the IBM
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:58.560]  Hall of Earth machines for those death panels that's right unbelievable and now
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:03.160]  IBM again today for my research have you looked into Thomas Watson the big
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:08.120]  Nazi eugenicist and how he put a lot of IBM's money into a trust and that's why
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.240]  IBM is always involved in RFID and tracking and human genome and eugenics
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:18.600]  is because literally many of these big foundations pure mission these people
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:23.440]  are obsessed with killing people well look you had a meeting in New York City at
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.320]  Rockefeller University about six eight months ago and there was then a follow
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:35.400]  on meeting and the participants were Bill Gates George Soros Warren Buffett
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:40.920]  and a half a dozen other multi-billionaires who pledged to put all
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:46.320]  of their quote philanthropic money into the most important issue which for them
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:52.080]  was population reduction it's all right there in black and white so you've got
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:57.960]  this little wannabe oligarchy group who all made their money in one way or
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:03.000]  another in speculation and other dirty activity Soros's big deal is drug
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.200]  legalization and wandering drug money that's who he is on behalf of the
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:14.240]  British so it's a repeat of things that we've seen many times before in history
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.320]  but now we're seeing it where the real vengeance and we've got to just make
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.680]  sure these people are crushed before their plans go ahead and by the way at
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:27.200]  the end of the Times of London article from a 2009 in May that you report on
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.480]  billionaire club and bid to curb over population and at the end of this
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:35.080]  article and others they admit it's a world government to carry out the
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:40.200]  population reduction then you get the Royal Commission from from 59 49 excuse
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:45.360]  me I know you've written about they said we could industrialize and actually
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.120]  the third world wouldn't have too many children even in their view but instead
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:53.280]  we're going to cut off development let their populations explode and then have
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:58.480]  after the fact mitigating things to kill them off like war famine diet
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:03.280]  injections and injunctions so they let you be born and then kill you I mean it's
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:08.440]  it's these people make Jeffrey Dahmer look like Mother Teresa that's the
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.540]  oligarchical system that's the essence of it these are these people are beyond
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:16.720]  evil and we did put that article on screen that you mentioned ladies and
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.800]  gentlemen you cannot make this stuff up truth is indeed stranger than fiction
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:24.840]  Doug in California you're on the air with Jeff Steinberg go ahead good
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.840]  morning Jeff Alex hey I'm calling from your favorite place here in California
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:35.760]  KSEL land and Santa Cruz oh I love it and I really like the connection you've
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.920]  been drawing between the weaponization of water and how it's been used to
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:44.080]  control and what I'd like to end your guest talking about Ponzi schemes and
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:46.680]  as you might know we have one of the biggest agricultural areas in the
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:50.720]  world here if we're half billion dollars Monterey Bay it suffers 15th
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:53.840]  according to Mark Wright in the worst saltwater intrusion loss in the world
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:58.880]  through big address expropriation of our water to export our water supply or
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:02.480]  steal our water I'd like to hear your guest thoughts on how water might be
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:06.200]  used and is being used to control yeah the takeover of all commodities for
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:10.320]  artificial scarcity Jeff Steinberg say hi to everybody out there in KSCO land
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:14.840]  beautiful area if I lived in California it'd be in Santa Cruz thank you so much
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:19.720]  we want to say hi to all the listeners of KSCO like Doris Day and of course the
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:25.200]  one the only you folks you know him out there as Clint Eastwood let's go ahead
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:30.600]  and get a comment from Jeff Steinberg on that well look we've had a complete
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:35.440]  depletion of the water tables in many many parts of the country in other
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:41.520]  areas we're getting intensive snows in the winter and rain we need a fit an
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:46.960]  effective water management system it was designed in the 1960s by Parsons
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:51.440]  engineering out there in California called the North American Water and Power
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:57.720]  Alliance which would create a modern system of water capture and irrigation
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:03.400]  through dams and canals taking about 20% of the Arctic runoff in the spring
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:07.400]  funneling it down through the western states of the United States but that's
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:12.120]  development you can't have that that money's got to go to Wall Street so they
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:17.480]  can fly above our slums and their jets and helicopters and not only that this
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:24.200]  program would create immediately somewhere in the vicinity of five to nine
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:31.000]  million productive good-paying jobs because this is the largest engineering
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.640]  project that's ever been undertaken in history and it can be done you'd create
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.760]  immediate jobs in over 30 states in the country you'd have a revival of the
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:46.280]  other yes that's the American West that's the American system we're the
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:50.440]  country that had the big projects the Brooklyn Bridge the Panama Canal and the
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:54.240]  French couldn't do it that's evil that that's the American you know what I
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.920]  want to do five more minutes with you on the other side and we've got to let you
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:00.000]  go then and you've been very gracious but I want to be able to talk to Richard
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.160]  Wendy Tim Aaron Keith and others but in 30 seconds I'm gonna get one more call in
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:08.320]  how would you describe the LaRouche organization Washington Post calls you
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:13.720]  right wing other media calls you Marxist what are you really small our
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:19.160]  Republican and the American system what you what you just said in terms of our
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:24.920]  perspective that this is a nation that was founded on the basis of a credit
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:30.800]  system to get away from a monetary oligarchy if you go all the way back to
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:35.280]  the Massachusetts Bay colony we established something that had no
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:40.840]  previous history of existence on this planet a true republic based on a
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:46.200]  credit system in which it's not a private oligarchy that governments go
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:51.360]  begging empowers the individual credit doesn't create a monopoly for the
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:59.760]  oligarchs that issue the fraudulent instrument precisely precisely all right
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:02.520]  let's jam in one call get their question we'll come back and answer it
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:05.680]  Richard in California then Wendy in Hawaii and others Richard you're on the
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:11.240]  air go ahead Alex thank you for talking to me and I really enjoy your guests I
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:15.560]  have a comment and a question for Jeff Jeff thanks for everything that you're
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:20.840]  doing and here's my comment I hope that you'll take this very seriously even
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:24.480]  though it sounds unusual but I'll make your comment we're gonna go to break go
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:29.520]  ahead okay the states are not broke and they're not states their corporations
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:35.240]  and they're hiding massive money using the broke charade to take us one step
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:39.280]  closer to martial law if that could be exposed I'm looking for you're talking
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:42.520]  about comprehensive annual financial reports and the fact that we've been
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:48.640]  induced into debt by fraud he's saying technically all 50 states are bankrupt
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:52.800]  within the bailout system if we sign on to the derivatives but I'll let Jeff
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:56.760]  Steinberg answer that when we come back then Wendy Tim Aaron Keith will be right
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:03.800]  back stay with us we'll be right back will I have garlic breath after I take
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:07.360]  Ali see we get that question all the time about the world's best garlic
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:11.960]  extract Ali see and the answer is Ali see contains stabilized Allison
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:16.160]  nature's antimicrobial agent and the active ingredient in crushed garlic but
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:19.440]  will not give you garlic breath scientifically proven in double blind
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:23.560]  studies using low doses of Allison greatly reduces the number severity and
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:27.920]  duration of common colds our powerful Ali see contains 300 milligrams of
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.920]  stabilized Allison just one tablet of Ali see is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:37.560]  it's effective against asthma MRSA bacterial fungal and viral infections and
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:41.360]  helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol plus it's a natural
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:44.920]  mosquito repellent boost resistance to infection with nature's best garlic

[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:42.360]  than one guilty person go free than 10 men go better than one guilty person go
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:47.840]  free than 10 innocent men and go to prison I think is the saying I'm just I
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:52.600]  guess they raised reasonable doubt in this whole thing but that woman has
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:57.160]  definitely got a screwed up life now ahead of her but the defense raised
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:05.240]  enough of a question of guilt that now she skates and hey perhaps she's an
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:09.320]  innocent all I know is there's bigger fish to fry okay going back to our
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:13.480]  guest answering Richard's question he's talking about the comprehensive annual
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.400]  financial reports the double set of books the investments of government water
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:21.480]  districts school districts state governments federal government agencies
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:27.800]  versus their budget that we know is only one area what's your comment on that
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:32.120]  well all of that's true and of course you know Wall Street has been doing these
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:37.640]  various insurance windows that have looted a number of states and
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:42.840]  municipalities but the fundamental point is that immediately after our
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:48.720]  Constitution was ratified the country was for all practical purposes in debt and
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:55.120]  bankrupt and in an agreement that was reached between Hamilton Washington
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:59.600]  Jefferson Madison who were already sort of squabbling at that point it was
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:03.800]  agreed that the federal government would assume all of the dates of this debts of
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:09.240]  the state so that the federal government could engage in the issuance of credit
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:14.000]  converting this debt into an instrument for credit for the development of the
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.360]  economy and in return the states would not have the ability to carry forward
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:23.480]  debt from one year into the next there's all kinds of tricks that have been done
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:28.840]  by Wall Street to pervert this system but the bottom line is that as of July
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:35.240]  1st 47 out of 50 states had a basically have a balanced budget in other words
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:40.720]  they had to come up with cuts firing police firing teachers firing firemen
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:44.680]  doing other things that's the austerity and it's because we've agreed to be
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:49.760]  signed on to the derivatives frauds you're saying we're bankrupt when we're
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:54.480]  signed on to this Ponzi scheme we've got a unsigned from that Wendy and Hawaii
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:27:00.720]  you're on the air with Jeff Steinberg I hello yes Wendy welcome to the airwaves
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:05.520]  hello I think I jumped the gun I thought two headlines I had to run out to work
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:11.480]  at 4 4 a.m. it's like 8 30 in Hawaii now I just got home but I think somebody
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:15.640]  brought this up on your show the other day about the Australian Green Party
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:23.160]  Bob Brown the headline said active AU Green Party leader admits global warming
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:28.200]  is really all about world government no that's that's official Green Party in
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.720]  Australia they say it's an excuse to manage all human activity for world
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:37.640]  government and we posted those reports last Friday I appreciate your call
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:41.200]  Wendy that's just more of this continuity of agenda this global
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:49.440]  strategy what is the carbon tax Jeff Steinberg taxes it's literally an
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:55.760]  attempt to create yet one more Ponzi scheme literally out of hot air it's an
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:03.000]  attempt to basically have a new bubble that will be explicitly attacks on any
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:08.400]  kind of modernization any industrialization any improvement on the
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:13.960]  conditions of life and not surprisingly Al Gore through his blood and Gore
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:19.520]  brokerage house in London has tried to corner the market on the creation of
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:25.120]  this global carbon swaps futures market based out of Chicago and London
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:30.760]  it's a complete swindle it's based on a scientific fraud and literally it's an
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:35.560]  attempt to create one more Ponzi scheme to kick the can down the road of this
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:40.320]  vast financial bubble and it's even more evil because they selectively enforce
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.560]  it just like Obamacare where all the insiders the inner coterie of the
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:50.160]  oligarchs they don't have to pay the tax it's incredible that's right
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:55.880]  unbelievable it's not going to happen because increasingly the fraud of
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:29:01.560]  global warming the swindle is becoming more and more transparently obvious and
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:05.680]  what I'd really like to just say and urge all of your listeners all of your
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:10.800]  viewers is that we're in the process of winning this Glass-Steagall fight and
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:15.640]  the more people that get in on this and get to their congressmen and hold their
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:20.600]  feet to the fire to do something that will be vitally in the interest of the
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:25.800]  entire people of the United States this is it and I can guarantee if we get
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:30.880]  Glass-Steagall presented before the House in the Senate for an up-or-down vote
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:35.880]  Obama is doomed absolutely that puts a stake in the globalist heart big time

[02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:07.720]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:11.760]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:15.680]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:19.680]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:24.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:28.280]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:32.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:35.680]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:32.680]  tyranny loses we're going to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts here in just a moment we
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:36.600]  we need to stop being afraid but we'll just go to him right now but I do got
[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.560]  some sponsors I got a plug here before we go to this next break Dr. Roberts so
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:45.600]  much is going on so much is happening the world is really starting to wake up but
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:49.080]  at the same time the tyranny is stomping around I want to get into the economy
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:55.160]  some of the other articles you've written but but first DSK Dominic
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:58.960]  Strauss-Kahn no sooner are they announced they're gonna drop the charges
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:02.320]  against him and this woman's reportedly according to New York Post New York Times
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:09.880]  connected the mafia reportedly a prostitute you know we we have minions
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.280]  of the president Sarkozy who he was going to run against he was already 10
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:16.640]  points ahead most polls admitting that they put out the news of his arrest
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:20.680]  before he was even arrested or it was in the news because they quote had agents
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:25.200]  in the hotel I mean clearly this is political a new woman popping up with
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:30.000]  rape charges so it looks like he they are really after him I don't know if
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.360]  he's a good guy a bad guy I don't like the IMF and globalist but Dr. Paul Craig
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:38.480]  Roberts former editor of the Wall Street Journal had a policy department of
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:44.120]  Treasury father ergonomics you called this really first I mean you had the
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:50.880]  guts to come out and not defend DSK but say it's stunk to high heaven like you
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.880]  know field full of dead dead cows or something what's what's really going on
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:01.520]  here well you know Alex will never know but it certainly looks like it's a
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:08.520]  political thing it could come from various sources not just Sarkozy who was
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:14.480]  frightened by Strauss con standing in the polls in the French upcoming French
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:19.960]  presidential election but Strauss con had recently been saying things which
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:25.640]  alarmed the bankers he said you know he was meeting with the American
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:31.680]  economist Joseph Stiglitz who is a big critic of the bailouts of the bankers
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:36.520]  on the backs of the ordinary people as Strauss con was meeting with him and
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:45.120]  had began raising questions about the use of the IMF in loading the bailouts on
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:51.440]  the backs of ordinary people he also said it was necessary to re-regulate the
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:56.760]  financial system because the the deregulation which was supposed to
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:04.520]  result in self-regulation hadn't worked and he was making other noises that a
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:12.600]  member of the global ruling class is not supposed to make and so whether he
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:16.640]  actually meant them or whether he was saying it in case he decided to run on
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:22.280]  the socialist ticket for the French presidency you know PR for ordinary
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:30.080]  people we don't know but it certainly alarmed the bankers you see one of the
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:36.040]  one of the giveaways is that the New York prosecutor
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:47.080]  Syvance put him in solitary confinement in Ryker prison on suicide watch until he
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:55.440]  resigned from the IMF then they let him out well if you're a guy and you see
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:01.600]  they did all this before they have even investigated so they stick him in a
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:07.320]  notorious prison in solitary confinement on suicide watch now anything can
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:10.840]  happen to you in that certain in those circumstances with those public
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:19.240]  announcements and so he promptly resigned from the IMF well there's no many
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:26.880]  suspicious things about it it's always of course entirely possible that it was
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:37.640]  all a plot by the hotel maid prostitute whatever she was afterwards she may have
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:41.160]  said hey I can really get some money out of this guy and it could all have been
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:46.800]  her plot but it would not explain how sarcosis political operatives knew of
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:50.880]  the arrest before the New York police announced that it would it doesn't
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:57.080]  really explain the fact that the New York police they essentially raped
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:02.040]  Strauss-Kahn's reputation didn't they the way they treated this the way they
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:07.480]  handled it there's so many doled out details right up front which they
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:13.680]  wouldn't normally do to assassinate his character he was not getting a a fair
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:17.520]  lead up to a trial he was not getting proper due process and even if he was
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:26.280]  guilty better than one you know guilty man go free than ten innocent people go
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:30.200]  to prison and I get emails saying why are you defending Strauss-Kahn at first
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:34.040]  I was like well he's an IMF banker I hate these people he scum this is what
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:37.360]  they do but when I think back to Bill Clinton who had to pay off all the women
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:41.040]  for the reports of rape where he bites their faces to hold them down and all
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:45.040]  this Clinton got away with that you know and nor the New York police are
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:50.040]  historically notoriously corrupt I mean if Kahn was in good standing with the
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:54.280]  establishment he would be left alone from my research and experience so so this
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:59.560]  whole this whole array of things points towards that and his talk of forgiving
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:06.400]  debt his meeting with sticklets he talking about saying the dollar would
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:12.040]  be dead soon all of this clearly they went after him and now as soon as they
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:16.320]  announced they're gonna drop the charges up pops another woman right on time like
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:20.320]  rows of shark teeth like that torpedo didn't hit him so they're flooding
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:25.400]  chamber to fire another one I mean this is this is getting really obvious yeah
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:32.320]  I'm afraid it is actually of course there's an innocent explanation for the
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:41.760]  second case it could be that what what this woman in France thinks is attempted
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:44.160]  rape could have all been a misunderstanding it could actually have
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:50.080]  happened she agreed to meet him apparently according to French press in a
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:56.400]  apartment that wasn't his address alone and she may have sent a signal she
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:01.520]  didn't intend sent and he may have misinterpreted it so something could
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.320]  have happened but you know what is attempted rape I mean it's not right
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:09.320]  well that's this feminist thing where they teach the women in public colleges as
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:14.040]  you know Dr. Roberts now that all sex is rape and even if you didn't lie it's
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:17.720]  kind of like the WikiLeaks thing if you didn't like it afterwards if you didn't
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:27.440]  like the sex it's right I know it's all it's all ridiculous and I I agree that
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:35.280]  there's more here than we'll ever know it does smack of conspiracy it really
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:45.000]  does there are other explanations but until we can figure out how Sarkozy's
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:52.760]  operatives knew about this before it was announced publicly publicly we have to
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:42:03.080]  be suspicious now Alex this French case it probably came to light now I mean
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:10.760]  another explanation it came to light now because they had the New York case to
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:15.320]  hook it to you know when it when it first came up in France that she was
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:20.480]  going to make this case everyone was convinced that that Strauss-Kahn was
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:27.000]  guilty and we'd be convicted and so that may have given confidence to the French
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:33.560]  lawyer to believe the woman's story and and had to bring it forward but now that
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:37.280]  the New York case has collapsed we don't know what will happen to the French
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:45.240]  case unless it has a lot of independent strength and if it does have you have to
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:53.120]  wonder why it's eight years old for its surfaces as a as a charge so I don't
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:43:00.160]  think we really know about this but I certainly agree that a member of the
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:05.600]  ruling global elite would not be treated this way unless he was perceived as a
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:10.760]  threat well look at how they let Madoff for a year stay at home and be left
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:16.120]  alone we've got upwards of a hundred billion stolen in every case I mean they
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:20.200]  treat these guys like royalty even when they're forced to arrest them for
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:24.640]  something after 11 years of insiders exposing exactly what Bernie Madoff was
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:30.360]  doing so the whole thing stinks to high heaven now expanding into the economy
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:36.240]  Dr. Roberts well before he's the economy the Russian head-on void to NATO says
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:42.920]  yes the ground invasions on for September October the Israeli publications
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:46.720]  are saying the special forces are going in this month and then in the next two
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:51.800]  months full-round invasion exactly what I got from Fort Hood and I got letters
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:56.040]  from hood and calls on air when I ask military listeners about it and since a
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:59.920]  bunch of other since that a bunch of other contacts have come into us that
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:04.240]  that you've Gaddafi doesn't fall they can't assassinate him with these bombs
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:08.400]  they now admit they are trying to kill him you know if that peace action fails
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:14.600]  that a larger peace action the first cav under three core is gonna have to
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:19.360]  bring more peace and more love and more humanitarian assistance to Libya and I
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.360]  saw video that we aired live when Tarpley was on with us last Friday at first
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:26.680]  it looked like 200,000 then they pulled out it had to be a half million or more
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:34.480]  he reported grenade launchers on the street almost everyone with AK-47s now
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:40.240]  it's upwards of 2 million Kalishnikov's handed out a million RPGs rocket
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:44.960]  propelled grenades for folks that don't know what that is I mean if just 5% of
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:48.720]  those people actually aiming a target to shoot this is going to be hell on earth
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:54.400]  for the NATO troops but the man of peace though is dedicated to bringing them
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:45:00.480]  peace there you know and the whole thing is strictly illegal it's a war crime
[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:05.120]  what what the United States is doing what NATO is doing these are exactly
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:11.040]  what the Nazis were executed for after the Nuremberg trials this is naked
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:16.880]  aggression it's a war crime and they can't even claim the cover of the UN
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:24.840]  resolution because all the UN agreed to was a no-fly zone and no fly doesn't
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:34.560]  mean to attack the the Qaddafi people or to intervene militarily in order to
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:40.680]  overthrow him now that is not what they had any cover for so in the whole world
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:45.840]  just stands and takes it and it's obviously illegal it's a war crime it's
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:54.240]  an amazing thing just like everything else that happens it's all it's all
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:46:00.920]  amazing dr. Roberts why are you against peace but I mean this is a Nobel Peace
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:06.320]  laureate who lied and said they'd be their days not weeks who lied and so
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:10.200]  they weren't trying to kill Qaddafi and now NATO and the top US general admit to
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:15.200]  Congress they are trying to kill him I mean why why is lying about a war lying
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:19.520]  about how long you're there breaking international law national law trying to
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:24.360]  assassinate people arming known al-Qaeda in the East why are you against
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:32.200]  something as wonderful sir are you you're why are you so hateful yeah well
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:39.600]  you know Alex we've lost the law there's no there's no rule of law left the
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:46.440]  government is not accountable to law I mean Clinton wasn't for Serbia this
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:53.600]  really accelerated under Bush Cheney and now Obama has validated it you know
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:58.560]  because the Obama administration is ruled that there'll be no accountability
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:04.000]  for any of the crimes of the Bush administration you know the torture the
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  illegal detentions that was peace as well come on don't be a conspiracy theory
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:16.520]  oh sure that was all see what you know peace what it means I suppose is war
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:20.160]  is peace now that's more like it hey you're starting to be a little bit more
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:28.320]  sensible war is peace and we're gonna have a lot of peace and and and Dr.
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:33.720]  Roberts they've told us that the economy is a banana recession for two years as
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.480]  all the jobless numbers increase and as a lot of economists say we're in a
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:42.880]  depression but they say war is peace and they say this is a crackerjack economy
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:49.200]  right and who are you as a Forbes listed you know top economists who are you to
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:53.160]  have an opinion if you have an opinion differing from the ruling class you're a
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:58.080]  conspiracy theorist that's exactly the case that's what I wrote not long ago
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:11.960]  conspiracy theorist is anyone who pays any attention to facts or analysis but
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:18.080]  you know we can laugh but it is really serious it should be frightening to see
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:23.080]  the United States government which poses as the light of the world you know the
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:32.600]  model of the rule of law bringing democracy and freedom and it's totally
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:41.360]  lawless everything that's done is lawless and they flouted it and we've
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:52.440]  now had a case where a federal judge was lied to by by the FBI and in the court
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:58.440]  and he he read them the riot act for lying to him but did nothing about it
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:05.720]  because they claim that they don't have to tell the truth to judges because it's
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.040]  national security that they're allowed to perjure themselves right which is
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:17.280]  freedom that's right like they they can break every law they're the courts have
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:25.040]  no jurisdiction Congress has none so people really should be scared to death
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:30.280]  they should be scared to death well yeah cuz they're getting ready to launch
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:33.880]  even bigger wars the economy is imploding they're setting up domestic
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:37.760]  police state control grids that's why they're so confident because they're
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:42.200]  committed to go into a hot tyranny in this country dr. Roberts they're
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:47.840]  committed that's why they don't care I wouldn't be surprised that everything
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:55.080]  suggests that doesn't it that's well I don't think a lot of minions of this
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:58.840]  system of studied history like you and I have I don't think all the average folks
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:03.600]  that are kind of going along with this have any idea of the type of horrid
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:09.000]  creature they're releasing out of that box I mean this is this is hell that's
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:13.200]  being released that's right they have no idea I agree they they were all out
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:21.200]  waving the flags the other day and pretending that they have liberty all
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:25.800]  we've got left is the free speech and now they're openly organizing against
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:30.600]  that more and more calls to arrest conspiracy theorists look at the which
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:34.640]  means arrest the heretics the questioners look at Cass Sunstein a look
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:41.000]  at all of it dr. Roberts I know I know it's amazing that you carry on well
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.760]  we're gonna are you kidding we're really gonna a lot of folks to wake up it's
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:46.760]  just that people think they won't get up they need to wake up to just how bad it

[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:19.600]  for dr. Paul Craig Roberts but I don't know how much you watch the news this
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.840]  weekend I barely even paid attention and there was a full-out assault Kurt
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:30.560]  Nemo's got a report about it today but there was a full-out assault on the
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:37.360]  Constitution that was outmoded old bad but the Constitution is new ideas the
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:42.080]  stuff that the establishments bringing in is regurgitated ancient tyranny I mean
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:47.000]  the classic forms of tyranny human nature stays the same what do you make of
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.920]  the system coming out of the closet and saying get rid of the Constitution and
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:56.480]  you will be delivered to Valhalla well they've already gotten rid of it and we
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:01.600]  now have a Caesar and whoever the president is he's now a Caesar as long
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:07.800]  as he's at war so and it's up to the president whether or not we're at war so
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:14.120]  we have a Caesar we don't have a demy representative democracy and there's no
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:19.840]  rule of law but whatever the president does or says is what happens and there's
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:26.000]  no check on that neither from the courts and nor from the Congress and it doesn't
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:31.680]  matter who we elect because that's just a facade the person in the office the
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:37.080]  office is a Caesar so whoever's there has the power of a Caesar and that's what
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:43.640]  we have you know like you we're we're war Libya without the war powers act we're
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:52.000]  at peace with Libya well in all sense we're peace because war is peace but
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.120]  don't be an extremist here sir don't engage in critical thinking I mean
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:02.800]  conspiracy theory you know my book the attorney of good intentions which came
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:09.160]  out 11 years ago I concluded it by saying Constitution was dead and that the
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:12.760]  country would soon follow unless there was a constitutional revival and
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:18.200]  there's not been one and no one seems to care the law schools don't care the bar
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:26.440]  associations and nothing happens so we have acquiesce to a Caesar I don't think
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:31.120]  it's going back and now the question is will the economy collapse out from under
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:36.600]  them and it could well do but it may be why we're having all these wars that
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:42.000]  what they may be trying to do is to secure control over oil so that the
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:46.520]  dollar remains the reserve of currency and everyone in the world has to continue
[02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:54.360]  to pay dollars for oil and therefore use dollars to buy to fund our debt so if it
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:59.240]  may well be that how they're trying to avert economic classes by war and in
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:05.880]  the Middle East and war on the oil producing regions so that may be what's
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:12.600]  going on now your newest book is War of the Worlds how the economy was lost
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:17.560]  available all over the web amazon.com and also at the bottom of the articles you
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:22.000]  write it in full words.com we have a link to it as well dr. Paul Kirk Roberts thank
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:25.920]  you for joining us for some critical thinking some common sense historical
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:29.800]  perspective and also an economic look as the former head of policy at the
[02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:33.940]  Treasury but again the fact that you have an opinion on the economy is a
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:38.440]  conspiracy theory because your opinion differs from that of Obama that tells us
[02:58:38.440 --> 02:58:44.000]  everything is fine God bless you all see you back tomorrow 11 a.m. retransmissions
