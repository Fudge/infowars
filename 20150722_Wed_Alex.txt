[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.140]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.140 --> 00:27.840]  Texas Alex Jones all right here's what I want to do welcome folks thank you for
[00:27.840 --> 00:32.600]  joining us on this Wednesday the 22nd day of July 2015 transmission here's what
[00:32.600 --> 00:37.760]  I want to do I want to take phone calls and in the first hour I want to
[00:37.760 --> 00:44.600]  actually go to your calls early and open the phones up for a free-for-all for
[00:44.600 --> 00:51.600]  first-time callers on Jade Helm on Obama announcing outside of law that he's
[00:51.600 --> 00:58.320]  going to go after Social Security recipients firearms ownership on the
[00:58.320 --> 01:04.800]  fiat open borders on the meltdown in China and Greece on the political
[01:04.800 --> 01:10.600]  correctness getting more and more extreme on the hundreds of issues that
[01:10.600 --> 01:14.120]  are out there on the Planned Parenthood videos the latest one coming out
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.560]  yesterday and causing a firestorm in the real media online but almost no
[01:19.560 --> 01:25.880]  coverage on the controlled corporate press where the national chairman of the
[01:25.880 --> 01:32.760]  committee that runs Planned Parenthood a medical doctor haggling about the
[01:32.760 --> 01:40.880]  price of organs from babies that chilling audio and video extremely
[01:40.880 --> 01:51.920]  ghoulish we need to discuss all of this but as a central thread we need to also
[01:51.920 --> 01:58.480]  talk about why the ruling technocrats the ruling social engineers want to
[01:58.480 --> 02:05.720]  sabotage the human condition want us dumbed down and want us basically set up
[02:05.720 --> 02:15.800]  for a major fall what is the end game strategy well they are neo-eugenicist or
[02:15.800 --> 02:21.920]  what I would call transhumanist now there is a pop transhumanist movement that
[02:21.920 --> 02:29.720]  sounds very very good they even have their own presidential party here in the
[02:29.720 --> 02:40.360]  United States led by Zoltan Istavan and I'm not joking when I cover that
[02:40.360 --> 02:47.040]  headline the US presidential candidate doesn't want to be president he wants to
[02:47.040 --> 02:51.560]  live forever and he's talking about deploying all this technology to the
[02:51.560 --> 03:03.240]  general public so he's kind of like the good version of what the globalist have
[03:03.240 --> 03:11.400]  already launched but if we can't get the public to get past the latest Miley
[03:11.400 --> 03:17.600]  Cyrus hair under our arms or Jenner's wearing a dress story if we can't get
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.440]  past the latest dig up a Confederate generals body and debate and discuss
[03:22.440 --> 03:26.720]  what's already been decided we don't have any hope so I thought I'd go over
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.520]  some of this article Zoltan Istavan was among the earliest candidates to declare
[03:31.520 --> 03:35.480]  the bid for 2016 US presidential election but most Americans still won't
[03:35.480 --> 03:40.800]  know about this writer and transhumanist philosopher by the time they had to the
[03:40.800 --> 03:46.160]  polls and he knows that yet his platform is refreshing put science first
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.400]  because that is a radical which is not uncommon for third-party candidates but
[03:51.400 --> 03:55.600]  they're also appealing make college education mandatory and free create
[03:55.600 --> 04:00.440]  policies so that everyone can have designer babies not just the rich and
[04:00.440 --> 04:07.040]  discover immortality in the next 10 to 15 years or 15 20 years he represents
[04:07.040 --> 04:10.800]  the transhumanist party which claims to have its root the philosophical thoughts
[04:10.800 --> 04:15.000]  going back centuries and as a core aim of building technologies that will give us
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.280]  superhuman powers the tool
[04:20.040 --> 04:25.960]  the tools they believe that will empower us the total number of members of
[04:25.960 --> 04:31.240]  humanity plus the biggest such membership organization is only 10,000 his
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.280]  campaign which includes a bus shaped represent a coffin is run with the help
[04:36.280 --> 04:41.480]  of a group of volunteers in California so these are kind of like the porch
[04:41.480 --> 04:47.200]  mason's they're not on the inside but they know what's going on and they want
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.920]  access to what the establishment is building in its giant new world order
[04:52.920 --> 04:58.480]  plan that's about a hundred times bigger than the Manhattan project
[04:58.480 --> 05:06.960]  oh lord won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz my friends my friends all have

[05:16.440 --> 05:20.640]  Parenthoods conscience has been seared with a hot iron now the question is
[05:20.640 --> 05:26.280]  does America have a conscience back in 1922 Planned Parenthoods founder Margaret
[05:26.280 --> 05:30.440]  Sanger made it very clear she was a racist eugenicist she said we don't want
[05:30.440 --> 05:34.160]  the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population the
[05:34.160 --> 05:37.400]  minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any
[05:37.400 --> 05:42.560]  of their more rebellious members is it a surprise that an institution born out

[09:57.200 --> 10:02.000]  its dissidents that kind of society will also eventually turn on its police on
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.280]  its army on its prison guards on the quizzlings and the collaborators who
[10:06.280 --> 10:11.080]  make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult

[11:09.040 --> 11:13.800]  then a total free-for-all for everybody in the third hour I have a tendency to
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.440]  get stuck covering news and basically ranting and then don't go to your calls

[11:42.560 --> 11:53.160]  that intro that we just played has been out for about two years say intro
[11:53.160 --> 12:01.160]  piece put together by Darren McBreen here at info wars and it illustrates the
[12:01.160 --> 12:08.560]  1970s sci-fi nightmare dystopic film soylent green detailing a global
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.920]  environmental collapse as the oceans die and food production going to almost
[12:14.920 --> 12:26.640]  zero so that euthanized humans then become the main food product and then we
[12:26.640 --> 12:33.760]  juxtapose it with real headlines from today four years ago I talked about how
[12:33.760 --> 12:41.560]  elites in Asia but also throughout the world we're having babies melted down for
[12:41.560 --> 12:47.800]  their collagen for injections and for pills to be ingested and how they were
[12:47.800 --> 12:53.880]  constantly catching babies wrapped in gold foil being shipped into South
[12:53.880 --> 13:02.440]  Korean North Korean Chinese and other elites and how the practice of eating
[13:02.440 --> 13:11.160]  smoked baby was entering the West now that's mainstream news buried that's in
[13:11.160 --> 13:17.280]  FBI reports that's in Interpol reports and they probably had let's not
[13:17.280 --> 13:23.080]  exaggerate more than 20 publications mainly fake conservative fake
[13:23.080 --> 13:31.120]  libertarian come out and attack me and say that I was insane in a liar because
[13:31.120 --> 13:38.200]  while bullhorring the Bilderberg group in Virginia where they were meeting I
[13:38.200 --> 13:42.640]  pointed out it's been in the news recently that there's a traffic in baby
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.520]  parts around the world powdered babies babies wrapped in gold foil and this is
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.360]  the exact type of elite that is involved in that and they took that and said
[13:52.360 --> 13:57.720]  Alex says the Bilderberg group is eating babies in foil and made a big joke out
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.520]  of it no they're launching wars that killed over a million Iraqis they're
[14:03.520 --> 14:07.560]  launching global programs where IBM computers ration care and put veterans
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.000]  on death list they're now deploying that to Social Security Medicare Medicaid
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.640]  they're launching programs worldwide but they've disarmed every population but
[14:15.640 --> 14:20.080]  the US and Switzerland they're launching programs worldwide of forced
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.480]  inoculations that sterilize women and they've gotten caught it's been in
[14:26.480 --> 14:32.720]  mainstream Indian African and European news they're busy creating weaponized
[14:32.720 --> 14:40.960]  flues these are really villainous folks and now we have Planned Parenthood not
[14:40.960 --> 14:48.480]  one but two videos one their director of services medical services and then now
[14:48.480 --> 14:54.840]  the national director the president of Planned Parenthood's council their board
[14:54.840 --> 15:00.640]  the head of their board of directors who else headed up the board of directors
[15:00.640 --> 15:08.960]  previously Bill Gates's army intelligence father who was hired by IBM we
[15:08.960 --> 15:15.040]  know that back then Congress will still break up trust in the 70s IBM's full
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.880]  wealth is behind eugenics always has been since before the days when Thomas
[15:19.880 --> 15:27.280]  Watson was Hitler's right-hand man and so they created Microsoft as their front
[15:27.280 --> 15:32.800]  and we are now under them today Bill Gates wants to break up your family he
[15:32.800 --> 15:37.360]  wants to forcibly inoculate you he wants euthanasia he wants abortion on
[15:37.360 --> 15:42.360]  demand and you don't even hear the so-called right-wing radio ever attack
[15:42.360 --> 15:49.720]  him because he's too big to touch I have been threatened specifically to shut
[15:49.720 --> 15:54.560]  my mouth about Bill Gates his wife two years ago in Germany said those of you
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.400]  out there claiming we're running a worldwide eugenics extermination program
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.440]  better watch it if you don't shut your mouth people are going to start dying and
[16:02.440 --> 16:07.320]  the news went does she mean we're stopping her from saving people no it was a
[16:07.320 --> 16:14.280]  public death threat well somebody's got to stand up against Warren Buffett and
[16:14.280 --> 16:22.880]  Bella Melinda Gates but all the Confederate flag baloney all the in
[16:22.880 --> 16:30.000]  fighting all of it you need to understand you're idiots when you
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.080]  involve yourself in this in fighting and all this mindlessness when we're
[16:33.080 --> 16:38.600]  dealing with hardcore globalist that ghoulishly are involved in the sale of
[16:38.600 --> 16:48.640]  baby organs you name it I mean Apple is a monopolistic company that runs
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.520]  factories in China that have suicide nets around them forced abortions and
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.360]  18-hour workdays but it's okay because Bill you know Bill Clinton's involved and
[16:57.360 --> 17:00.920]  Al Gore's on their board and they've got guys wearing you know different colored
[17:00.920 --> 17:07.160]  socks at board meetings going hi we're not threatening we're liberal oh hi oh
[17:07.160 --> 17:16.360]  it's a total camouflage it's a 21st century takeover we're designed to see
[17:16.360 --> 17:21.040]  an enemy in a uniform coming over the fence coming up to the drawbridge and
[17:21.040 --> 17:27.040]  to fight back we're designed to fight tanks not banks and the banks have
[17:27.040 --> 17:31.320]  stolen the world's wealth now they need to secure it and there's no reason to
[17:31.320 --> 17:36.240]  have seven and a half billion people eating into resources they've stolen and
[17:36.240 --> 17:40.640]  you can see the argument that there are seven and a half billion destructive
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.960]  people fighting with each other dumb down being petulant why not just wipe
[17:44.960 --> 17:51.000]  them all out and start over and play God first by water then by fire the Bible
[17:51.000 --> 17:58.200]  says well first by water then by the globalist playing God with soft kill
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.760]  so first by water then by soft kill whether you believe the Old Testament
[18:02.760 --> 18:09.720]  Genesis or not the point is the globalist believe their God they're
[18:09.720 --> 18:14.160]  playing God they're in control they're already in breakaway civilization
[18:14.160 --> 18:20.880]  systems and the decision has been made to accelerate to intensify the poisoning
[18:20.880 --> 18:29.640]  of your food and water the dumbing down that the weaponization of media there is
[18:29.640 --> 18:35.480]  this giant program going on that no kidding is at least I've been thinking
[18:35.480 --> 18:39.840]  about this a lot and looking at the numbers a hundred times bigger than the
[18:39.840 --> 18:46.880]  Manhattan Project they've spent over a hundred billion dollars in PR for global
[18:46.880 --> 18:52.120]  warming taxes since 1992 look up the numbers that's the UN zone numbers a
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.200]  hundred and twelve billion last time I checked a year ago that's a hundred and
[18:56.200 --> 19:00.840]  twelve billion just for propaganda to get you to believe you're bad you're

[24:30.200 --> 24:35.160]  hundreds of news articles all incredibly important incredibly entertaining
[24:35.160 --> 24:42.000]  incredibly riveting imminent mass earthquakes for San Francisco USGS it's
[24:42.000 --> 24:49.480]  all off the chart but we have the future being stolen by the globalist they
[24:49.480 --> 24:53.840]  think we're so dumb they write white papers about it 50 years ago they've
[24:53.840 --> 24:59.280]  done everything they said they would do so far and the next step it gets really
[24:59.280 --> 25:06.880]  nasty the extermination of the world population done under the guise of natural
[25:06.880 --> 25:11.680]  plagues bio weapon plagues released by shadowy terror groups that are really the
[25:11.680 --> 25:19.920]  globalist huge wars food shortages as the West gives up its liberty during the
[25:19.920 --> 25:25.920]  coming to Talitarianism as a way of maintaining safety and people pledge
[25:25.920 --> 25:34.280]  themselves to the corporate Borg to do anything to have access to the life
[25:34.280 --> 25:42.160]  extension technologies and that's why they've got to have a total shadow world
[25:42.160 --> 25:47.600]  government that is above the law diplomatically immune with unlimited taxes
[25:47.600 --> 25:56.480]  100 trillion every decades what they're asking for day one all public the elite
[25:56.480 --> 26:00.040]  just everywhere in their white papers just laugh and and just say try to stop
[26:00.040 --> 26:04.760]  us we'll step on you like a bug and then people want me to fight with them over
[26:04.760 --> 26:09.640]  what color they are or that I'm closed-minded because I don't like an
[26:09.640 --> 26:17.040]  old Olympic athlete in drag I just don't care it's a weapon system to
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.520]  psychologically distract us from the scientific technological military
[26:22.520 --> 26:26.560]  takeover taking place the humans are all gonna be replaced the military the
[26:26.560 --> 26:33.120]  next 10 to 15 years they're going to implode the military which is had its
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.720]  own problems but at least was a human institution they're destroying the
[26:37.720 --> 26:41.680]  family successfully they're destroying our health they're destroying our physical
[26:41.680 --> 26:46.480]  IQ they are annihilating everyone right now I mean we're watching people being
[26:46.480 --> 26:53.840]  torn to pieces in slow motion and so all this other news is just window dressing
[26:53.840 --> 26:59.120]  but just in my facts today not one not two not three not four not five not six
[26:59.120 --> 27:03.920]  there's like eight different articles announcing how ugly and bad humans are
[27:03.920 --> 27:08.440]  and how much better will be when we're all dead that's their philosophy being
[27:08.440 --> 27:14.960]  projected onto us so we lay down and other articles about how yes they've
[27:14.960 --> 27:22.120]  already got life extension but we can't give it to the general public I mean why
[27:22.120 --> 27:27.520]  not admit what's going on be honest build-up humanity create giant human
[27:27.520 --> 27:35.680]  endeavors for space colonies in near-Earth orbit why not really empower
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.000]  humanity instead of keeping folks in the dark and trying to dump humanity down
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.680]  and remove it and then you look at the elites who they are they're very wicked
[27:43.680 --> 27:50.920]  evil hateful people and I don't know how I'm not supposed to just talk about
[27:50.920 --> 27:55.720]  this because this is what's really going on why do I call it a giant Manhattan
[27:55.720 --> 28:01.000]  project David Rockefeller famously in 1991 and heavy on France and this was
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  released the BBC thanked the media for keeping their organization for world
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.800]  government secret and said our goals would have been impossible if we would
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.000]  have had the light of publicity on it but now the end of the nation state and
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.800]  the end of individual determination is over and the dawn of a world government
[28:19.800 --> 28:23.920]  run by policy makers international bankers is now here I mean go read his
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.800]  quote this is a man who praised when Mao Zedong died in the New York Times
[28:28.800 --> 28:33.640]  communism and what Mao Zedong did Mao Zedong killed 84 million people if you
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.280]  believe the Chinese government our government says 60 plus mill I mean do
[28:38.280 --> 28:43.720]  you understand this guy founded over a hundred world government organizations
[28:43.720 --> 28:47.800]  the Carnegie the Ford the Rockefeller foundations are all under their control
[28:47.800 --> 28:54.920]  and everything you see being done is from them Microsoft IBM all of it
[28:54.920 --> 29:01.520]  everything the global rollout global standardization it's been decided by
[29:01.520 --> 29:08.040]  them and I guess people just want to be ruled in a sci-fi nightmare take it over
[29:08.040 --> 29:13.200]  dumb down and then euthanized by these people while they openly got drink wine
[29:13.200 --> 29:20.560]  and got a baby parts Lamborghini's I mean my father was in the top six
[29:20.560 --> 29:25.080]  smartest people in Texas tested by UT when he was a junior in high school and
[29:25.080 --> 29:32.920]  they called little David Jones in and basically told him a bunch of this when
[29:32.920 --> 29:39.000]  he was 16 years old he didn't even tell me about it until I was like 30 years
[29:39.000 --> 29:46.000]  old that's how ubiquitous this is that even my dad almost joined this cult and
[29:46.000 --> 29:53.000]  never even told me about it we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones
[29:53.000 --> 30:01.680]  and the GCN radio network wired magazine demonstrated how 470,000
[30:01.680 --> 30:06.240]  Chrysler Fiat vehicles in this case a Jeep could be wirelessly remotely hacked
[30:06.240 --> 30:10.240]  and driven into a ditch of course it'll only be five to ten years before someone
[30:10.240 --> 30:14.520]  else the government will be driving your car all the time the National Highway
[30:14.520 --> 30:18.400]  Traffic Safety Administration plans to issue a v2v mandate that's vehicle to
[30:18.400 --> 30:23.200]  vehicle communication this year instead of 2016 as originally planned these
[30:23.200 --> 30:27.240]  mandates will be expensive new additions for your safety just like the safety
[30:27.240 --> 30:30.160]  systems that allowed hackers to turn off the steering turn off the brakes
[30:30.160 --> 30:34.520]  accelerate the Jeep and drive it into a ditch mainstream media scoff when we
[30:34.520 --> 30:37.680]  talked at length about hacking a vehicle in conjunction with a car bomb to make
[30:37.680 --> 30:40.880]  it look like reckless driving when Michael Hastings was killed two years
[30:40.880 --> 30:46.480]  ago they will rarely use this new technology to take someone's life but
[30:46.480 --> 30:50.680]  it is designed to take your liberty if you want to know the implications of

[33:15.680 --> 33:27.680]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[33:35.680 --> 33:40.680]  So there's a revolution against common sense a revolution against due process a
[33:40.680 --> 33:45.440]  revolution against the common person's private property rights your rights to
[33:45.440 --> 33:50.960]  live your life as you see fit whether it's illegal NSA spying or the GMO
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.120]  crops all of it is designed to undermine the individual and to atomize
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.600]  communities and to break us down so we can't stand up against intensified
[34:01.600 --> 34:11.040]  oppression that's coming this is the globalist system and there is a giant
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.240]  quasi-secret planetary government being established and people don't ask what's
[34:16.240 --> 34:21.520]  the philosophy of the world government what's the philosophy of the group
[34:21.520 --> 34:28.360]  involved well they go and this has been declassified we've had insiders on we've
[34:28.360 --> 34:37.480]  had historians from Congress on going over every angle of it but basically they
[34:37.480 --> 34:43.280]  recruit all the top test score people all the top mathematicians all the top
[34:43.280 --> 34:49.480]  writers top philosophers from every discipline and tell them you're smart
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.800]  you're part of the elite the general public are a bunch of scum we're gonna
[34:53.800 --> 34:59.440]  save the earth by bringing in a global tyranny a global authoritarianism and
[34:59.440 --> 35:04.720]  you're going to be part of the leadership of it that's very alluring and
[35:04.720 --> 35:12.960]  most people go along with it and that's where we are today and then as you get
[35:12.960 --> 35:18.880]  higher up in it into the 6,000 superclass estimated by the Kissinger group and I
[35:18.880 --> 35:24.360]  agree with that number then you're led into the larger design of basically total
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.520]  exterminism luciferianism we are gods we are merging with the machines to
[35:29.520 --> 35:40.160]  transcend and the profane did not deserve to transcend and so we must see a
[35:40.160 --> 35:48.680]  falling away a culling and this is what Prince Philip the Queen of England's
[35:48.680 --> 35:56.640]  husband talked about earlier this week another statement about getting rid of
[35:56.640 --> 36:05.840]  people another statement of when do we start killing everybody a creepy 90
[36:05.840 --> 36:15.440]  something-year-old man in a science fiction ask military uniform but you
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.560]  know what I guess they kind of deserve to wear those I mean they funded the
[36:19.560 --> 36:24.240]  science of the total takeover they run the whole system and they put poison in
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.160]  you and your children's water and they make money off global flesh and organ
[36:30.160 --> 36:35.440]  trafficking narcotics trafficking they own Dutch Royal Shell with their cousin
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.960]  the Queen of the Netherlands and British petroleum and they have married in with
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.080]  the Rothschilds it's their planet it's their club and you and I as George
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.920]  Carlin said ain't in it and let me tell you why the test scores never get
[36:50.920 --> 36:55.760]  better because they want us dumb we're gonna get stupider and stupider because
[36:55.760 --> 37:00.840]  the owners the owners don't want you thinking so we were able to interview
[37:00.840 --> 37:08.080]  George Carlin before he died our reporters he said not all by 9-11 looks
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.600]  like a stage to me take our freedoms and I'm done talking to you because what's
[37:12.600 --> 37:21.760]  it gonna do anyways public doesn't care next person for me to sign my book
[37:21.760 --> 37:32.760]  George Carlin he's smart guys dab is one of the top PR men in New York City for
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.280]  some of the biggest publications in the country he grew up learning all about BS
[37:36.280 --> 37:41.440]  but how do you then get that information to the public that doesn't want to
[37:41.440 --> 37:51.720]  believe it and then Fox News attacked George Carlin of course it's come out
[37:51.720 --> 37:54.560]  now that Saudi Arabia quarterback the entire attack I said that within a
[37:54.560 --> 37:59.040]  week of 9-11 and then our government stood down bare minimum that means they
[37:59.040 --> 38:03.360]  ended in a bet of the attacks we're proven right yet again because it's not
[38:03.360 --> 38:08.560]  just they don't care about your lives it's a religion of hating you and thinking
[38:08.560 --> 38:15.240]  of you as trash thinking of you as a commodity and if you won't stand up for
[38:15.240 --> 38:18.600]  yourself and get aggressive if you won't stand up for veterans being put on
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.000]  don't treat list and death list if you won't stand up for unborn nobody is
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.600]  gonna stand up for you and I'll just say it again the God of this universe is
[38:28.600 --> 38:32.440]  not gonna stand up for you either it's just gonna say hey listen I don't know
[38:32.440 --> 38:40.360]  who you are you don't resonate with what I'm about go be with other people like
[38:40.360 --> 38:45.520]  yourself let your spirit let your energy let your soul go be with other people
[38:45.520 --> 38:49.840]  like you that place has a name interdimensionally you could use a
[38:49.840 --> 38:55.040]  Superman-esque thing that the the the phantom zone that's where you people get
[38:55.040 --> 39:01.600]  to go let's see they tell the general public oh there's no such thing as God of
[39:01.600 --> 39:08.080]  the devil but then you study globalist they themselves are seriously occultic to
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.080]  a man to a woman and they believe they serve the God of this world who is the
[39:13.080 --> 39:18.200]  real Christ who is going to deliver them with technology and make them live
[39:18.200 --> 39:29.080]  forever with heaven on earth they are a whacked out eugenics proto-nazi
[39:29.080 --> 39:39.240]  neo eugenics death cult and they have White House run publications you don't
[39:39.240 --> 39:43.640]  make jokes about that when I come out and I say the UN's a space cult well my
[39:43.640 --> 39:53.000]  full quote was Ian Fleming moon raker cult I mean heavens gate hail bop cult
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.120]  put on their Nike tennis shoes took the barbiturates drank their vodka suited up
[39:58.120 --> 40:01.840]  to send their spirits up to join the flying saucer and they all had chopped
[40:01.840 --> 40:06.360]  their their genitals off because the space aliens one of those chopped off in
[40:06.360 --> 40:10.280]  their fruitcake land and I look at what the UN and the globalist push it's
[40:10.280 --> 40:14.360]  basically the same thing we're all gonna drink kool-aid and then go to the
[40:14.360 --> 40:17.560]  mothership we're gonna join with the world government and then we're gonna
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.920]  live forever no you're not it's a giant deception how do you get people to join
[40:22.920 --> 40:28.960]  with the devil to join with death to join with a god that wants to kill
[40:28.960 --> 40:34.320]  everybody on the earth to save the earth as you merge with machines and
[40:34.320 --> 40:39.320]  become gods do you think the elite are gonna take this old woman the the the
[40:39.320 --> 40:44.360]  head of the Planned Parenthood board who's out haggling over bodies drinking
[40:44.360 --> 40:50.440]  expensive wine haggling over baby organs getting sick look center on when she
[40:50.440 --> 40:56.000]  talks about Lamborghinis do you really think the elite her bosses are gonna
[40:56.000 --> 41:02.200]  give her access to the life extension fully no they're gonna wipe you out and
[41:02.200 --> 41:08.360]  by the way to the actual controllers in your gut in your soul in your spirit do
[41:08.360 --> 41:14.000]  you really think the god of this world the old serpent the deceiver the
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.800]  betrayer is gonna give you this power over the earth you think you're gonna
[41:18.800 --> 41:24.720]  get you're only given limited power to bring this thing in and once you bring
[41:24.720 --> 41:30.840]  this in you are gonna be the most despised hated people and it says you're
[41:30.840 --> 41:36.360]  gonna hide under the mountains and beg for death but you won't be able to die
[41:36.920 --> 41:44.880]  because see you didn't want to die did you did you right here the Genesis
[41:44.880 --> 41:52.560]  engine wired magazine special report it's like 30 pages long we now have the
[41:52.560 --> 41:57.800]  power to quickly and easily alter DNA it could eliminate disease it could solve
[41:57.800 --> 42:02.200]  world hunger it could provide unlimited clean energy it could really get out of
[42:02.200 --> 42:09.120]  hand by Amy Waxman it needs to be specially controlled the life extension
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.480]  and then once deployed to the public we'll have Trojan horses in it and will
[42:13.480 --> 42:21.200]  not be the real grail because just as the elite are betrayed by their masters
[42:21.200 --> 42:26.080]  and their master they do the same trick to those below them and then that group
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.640]  betrays those below them as well as above so below follow your own rules your
[42:31.640 --> 42:37.360]  own alchemy and realize what you've done you will not attain the next level of
[42:37.360 --> 42:43.640]  human development by trying to hold other people back universal galactic rule
[42:43.640 --> 42:49.080]  that cannot be controverted that's written on my heart I don't believe it
[42:49.080 --> 42:57.040]  I know it you have proven yourself to be cosmic conars like your father you have
[42:57.040 --> 43:01.480]  proven yourself to be failures and cheats you are failing your boot camp
[43:01.480 --> 43:11.320]  inspection on this rock you're a joke now I said I take a bunch of calls first
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.640]  time callers in the shower the next and as usual I'm not doing it because I get
[43:14.640 --> 43:18.560]  so obsessed with the info but just look at these headlines these super humans
[43:18.560 --> 43:23.000]  are real and their DNA could be worth billions Bloomberg that's why they've
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.400]  been taking your blood at birth and stockpiling it mass producing it and then
[43:26.400 --> 43:29.320]  telling you later they've patented your DNA so you can't even have access to it
[43:29.320 --> 43:35.240]  and yes there are X-Men type qualities in people out there not not like in the
[43:35.240 --> 43:38.800]  movies where you're shooting fireballs out of your hands but people that can go
[43:38.800 --> 43:43.000]  underwater longer people that have higher IQs people that can defeat cancer
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.480]  quicker it's all there but believe me that's not going to be given to the
[43:46.480 --> 43:50.080]  general public you notice the more of this technology we get the more sick we
[43:50.080 --> 43:55.960]  get we'll get to the new transhumanist party and what they want it's all
[43:55.960 --> 44:03.400]  coming up the bionic eye that could cure blindness and the push for euthanasia
[44:03.400 --> 44:10.040]  dr. deaths Edinburgh fringe 2015 show we'll see right today campaigner gas the
[44:10.040 --> 44:17.640]  audience it's like Bill Gates was releasing mosquitoes on his audience
[44:17.640 --> 44:22.160]  so right as we're told we have all this life extension we're told but we got to
[44:22.160 --> 44:26.080]  go ahead and kill old people because you kill grandma you get ten jobs as teachers
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.320]  no you take care of grandma and build an economy around caring about people and
[44:30.320 --> 44:34.000]  now you have an economy instead they're removing everything where you don't have
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.200]  jobs saying that creates an economy we can have any economy we want we could
[44:38.200 --> 44:44.720]  already have space bases on record totally feasible ring cities with
[44:44.720 --> 44:51.840]  gravity designed exactly like Elysium that's a 1920s Werner von Braun design
[44:51.840 --> 44:56.720]  you see in that movie the same guy in the 30s came up with the space shuttle
[44:56.720 --> 45:05.160]  diagram when he wasn't sitting at Hitler's knee but that's what we're
[45:05.160 --> 45:09.960]  dealing with here people this is the issue and this broadcast the fact that
[45:09.960 --> 45:12.760]  we understand what's going on notice we were talking about this before this was
[45:12.760 --> 45:16.200]  in the news because they're getting ready to go more and more operational with
[45:16.200 --> 45:26.080]  all this all right I want to go to your phone calls very briefly here we have

[45:35.960 --> 45:39.680]  you go past that one or two in the morning sometimes on the road or doing
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.480]  coast to coast to in whatever then I can't turn it off can't go to sleep and
[45:42.480 --> 45:46.160]  melatonin works a little bit valerian some but if I took them together I'd
[45:46.160 --> 45:49.400]  notice it was a lot more powerful so then I said I want something called
[45:49.400 --> 45:53.440]  knockout this is over a year ago that has everything that's known to work
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.760]  safely together organic to absolutely poleax somebody within an hour of

[55:34.520 --> 55:38.360]  globalist on a daily basis and your team thank you um i just had a quick
[55:38.360 --> 55:41.320]  question um we're seeing i'm hispanic and we're
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.600]  seeing all these attacks against donald trump and
[55:44.600 --> 55:47.720]  basically these institutions that have been
[55:47.720 --> 55:53.480]  you know have built this country uh work you know marriage school with your
[55:53.480 --> 55:56.680]  kids just everywhere we're being attacked everywhere
[55:56.680 --> 55:59.640]  and i just want to i wanted to ask you do you think that we
[55:59.640 --> 56:04.760]  as a people in the u.s now are in the new world order
[56:04.760 --> 56:09.000]  yes yes we are now under world government and then it just gets worse
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.560]  from here i mean that's the thing people think like world
[56:11.560 --> 56:15.560]  governments like star trek everybody's kumbaya no the new world order is the
[56:15.560 --> 56:18.760]  board literally i mean it is the takeover of the
[56:18.760 --> 56:21.960]  machines and the globalist and then once they have their world
[56:21.960 --> 56:24.760]  government in place which is about 90 in place
[56:24.760 --> 56:28.440]  then they ban the cash then they set up the taxes and regulations
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.800]  where it's impossible to be independent i was talking to a banker
[56:31.800 --> 56:34.920]  yesterday who runs a good-sized texas bank
[56:34.920 --> 56:38.840]  he said you're absolutely right since 2008 the big banks that caused the
[56:38.840 --> 56:41.720]  crisis have set up stuff where we're out of housing
[56:41.720 --> 56:45.800]  loans we're out of everything now they're just shutting down all small
[56:45.800 --> 56:48.760]  banks well that's what it is on every front
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.400]  it's a consolidation a takeover not to just have a monopoly
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.520]  but to be able to then dictate behavior to everyone go ahead
[56:58.520 --> 57:02.760]  yeah now it's just it's insane you need to hit the nail right on the head there
[57:02.760 --> 57:05.800]  everything now is racist donald trump saying we don't
[57:05.800 --> 57:09.720]  you know no country runs with open borders in the world
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.320]  i'm from cuba and they don't have gay marriage there
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.000]  and here now we have it and everybody's acting like if it's all great and
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.160]  and lovely but these countries that people like obama and others
[57:21.160 --> 57:25.800]  want to bring us towards don't even have what we have here and then they call us
[57:25.800 --> 57:29.160]  bad it's crazy yeah you can't go to cuba as an
[57:29.160 --> 57:32.280]  american and have your baby for free and get free welfare they laugh at you
[57:32.280 --> 57:35.480]  they work people super hard in cuba from what i've read and
[57:35.480 --> 57:40.520]  talking to cuban refugees but see it's all sold as happy in a wonderland
[57:40.520 --> 57:44.280]  for the public i mean imagine saying you can come here we're going to give you
[57:44.280 --> 57:46.920]  everything free
[57:47.880 --> 57:51.160]  it's only designed to drive down wages but again i don't dislike the people
[57:51.160 --> 57:55.400]  that are coming in i realize they're being used as a tool
[57:55.400 --> 57:59.000]  i mean like water i love water i love a lake i love to take a shower
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  but the tens of millions of illegals pouring in are like a broken dam it can
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.160]  also overturn your house and kill you so i don't hate water
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.080]  but it's a very powerful force like a fire hose crammed down your throat will
[58:11.080 --> 58:14.120]  kill you and basically they've got a fire hose
[58:14.120 --> 58:18.280]  of illegal immigration and some of the worst immigrants you could get now
[58:18.280 --> 58:22.440]  shove down our throat blowing our guts out god bless you where do you think
[58:22.440 --> 58:27.400]  it's all going tony um i really am not sure i
[58:27.400 --> 58:31.560]  i just told my family hey if this if we are starting to go towards cuba i'm
[58:31.560 --> 58:34.440]  just gonna go ahead and move back there because we're all going to be the same
[58:34.440 --> 58:38.120]  anyway so i'd rather go where i was born but i hear you abs you may have to go
[58:38.120 --> 58:41.000]  don't tell jerry and country it'll be better than here i was talking to a guy
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.720]  about that last night we'll be back with more calls visit gcnlive.com
[58:45.720 --> 58:48.840]  today
[58:48.840 --> 58:52.280]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as
[58:52.280 --> 58:56.040]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[58:56.040 --> 58:59.640]  info wars.com because the companies i've been approached by
[58:59.640 --> 59:04.120]  were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be
[59:04.120 --> 59:07.800]  so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers

[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.800]  non-hero john mccain but for some reason no one's going after him for his
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.000]  real record world net daily is published an excellent article breaking
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.040]  it all down but before we get into any of that
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.360]  i want to go back to your phone calls right now uh let's go ahead and talk to
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.040]  david in michigan thanks for holding
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.080]  hi alex uh i got a couple things to want to bring up
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.000]  first off i'm about 55 to 60 miles from camp grayland
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  and we've had a lot of activity a lot of flying over now we're getting a patch
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.840]  he's coming over uh chinook's flying in formation
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.680]  especially over our rivers and all our farmland up here i'm with the amish i'm
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.960]  near the amish and it's just been increasingly
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.720]  going for the last uh i don't know 60 days now
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.240]  and uh now they got troops that hanging out the sides on some of these things
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.440]  and and to me they had different insignias but
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.280]  it's weird about the apaches they're all black no insignias on the tail or
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.320]  anywhere but the chinooks that's all military you could tell us
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.400]  the second thing i want to bring up is all these estate auctions that are
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.720]  going on here in michigan we have guys that are a couple people
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.240]  that we confronted that have been buying up all the rifles from all the other
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.120]  people and we believe that they're federal agents they're not ladies and
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.760]  people buy guns they're buying anything it shoots projectile
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.720]  and i think that's very odd we try to confront one of the guys because he was
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.800]  at the same box at different places you know in three weeks so i don't know
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.960]  what your take is on that or if you heard anything i mean we know that
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.560]  there have been billions of rounds of ammunition that have been bought
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.400]  by the federal government the last four years over three billion now total
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:23.640]  and hundreds of millions of them were every weird caliber weird mouser stuff
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:30.680]  from world war one uh 44 45 30 odd six that's not
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.280]  used by nato it's 308 on and on and on just just 100
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.880]  kick down sort of story about it last year just hundreds of just every
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.560]  caliber you can imagine buying it up and that's meant to drive up prices
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.640]  they're also buying up just massive loads of of different
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.360]  calibers they've been caught shipping them over to the free syrian army
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.040]  they've been caught outfitting other groups there's a whole bunch of weird
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.600]  clandestine operations going on while obama had the last
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.880]  lead smelting facility in the us shut down last year
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.040]  and now they're restricting chinese shipping lead in uh so they're just
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.760]  hitting the gun industry in the right to self defense
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:16.680]  at every level but the big shoot a drop is the fact that we had a daily caller
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.320]  a reporter on yesterday the fb i memo said they're going to use
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.960]  the system the va uses to where if you even do automatic money transfer of
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.720]  your social security check they're going to then restrict your second
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.760]  amendment they're going to test it out and see if people get upset but you're
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.600]  about to see if they follow the past model tens of thousands a month
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.520]  of social security recipients this is the deal with the va
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.280]  denied their guns and then if that gets to be a big enough controversy they may
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.760]  back off if it doesn't then it'll be hundreds of thousands
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.960]  a month as clinton did right before he left office
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.280]  now obama has started this again hundreds of thousands of vets a month
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.680]  can't buy guns now and they won't even tell them just like a no fly list
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.000]  why their record says that they can't have a gun now the law doesn't say that
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.320]  they haven't been adjudicated mentally ill or incompetent they're just doing it
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.880]  just like they're shutting the power plants down or they're opening the
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.160]  borders by fiat this is the essence of living under a
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.400]  dictatorship and we're now seeing it
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.320]  like like like smelly's nerve gas entering a building
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.720]  wiping on our second amendment it's creeping death brother
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.920]  oh yeah and i like i said i see them mapping i mean there's the only reason
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.040]  they'd be going over this lake on this day and then the next day at another
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.640]  lake over in the same area but you know a mile apart from each
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.920]  other it's just weird it's well look the military's
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.040]  good men and women on average they're training them to engage us
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.600]  they're training them so when they use them against us they'll say well we've
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.040]  been doing this for years i mean we took guns in katrina big deal we're just
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.720]  following orders by the way in the third hour i'm gonna
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.400]  open the phones up for folks with jade helm intel whatever happened to jade
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.560]  helm wired magazine demonstrated how 470 000
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.240]  Chrysler fiat vehicles in this case a jeep could be wirelessly
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.480]  remotely hacked and driven into a ditch of course it'll only be five to ten years
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.680]  before someone else the government will be driving your car
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.040]  all the time the national highway traffic safety administration plans to
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.560]  issue a v2v mandate that's vehicle to vehicle communication
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.800]  this year instead of 2016 as originally planned these mandates will be
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.640]  expensive new additions for your safety just like the safety systems that
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.680]  allowed hackers to turn off the steering turn off the brakes accelerate
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.600]  the jeep and drive it into a ditch mainstream media scoff when we talked
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.640]  at length about hacking a vehicle in conjunction with a car bomb to make it
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.600]  look like reckless driving when michael hastings was killed two years ago
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.120]  they will rarely use this new technology to take someone's life
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.520]  but it is designed to take your liberty if you want to know the implications of
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:54.120]  this dangerous new control grid being superimposed on your life

[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:19.160]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:23.400]  the modern environmentalists are really a
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.680]  death cult a power cult so they keep saying the earth's going to collapse
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.640]  you're going to starve you're not going to have any food because of
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.040]  global warming now climate change but then they move politically
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.280]  to shut off resources at a planetary level i'm going to cover some of this
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.960]  at the bottom of the hour continue with calls i'm going to calls right now
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.720]  jerry brown's climate warning we are talking about extinction
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.240]  that's coming up this is big news house republican obama administration won't
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:59.640]  release full iran deal to congress congress has to approve treaties and
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.400]  agreements congress is supposed to control the purse but
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.000]  more and more from open borders to our power plants being turned off to
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.120]  executive action against the second amendment
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.960]  that's not happening the presidency is becoming truly
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.400]  dictatorial truly imperial and that's what the special interest want so we're
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.120]  going to be going over that report what's really going on with donald
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.000]  trump uh... he's right about john mccain
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.680]  there's a world that daily article that shows mccain covering up the p o w
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.320]  situation that's what the p o w is hating
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.560]  so p o w is that we're with him at the hanoi hilton said he was never tortured
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.880]  he was kept in a nice area as a trustee was given women
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:47.480]  uh... was lavish meals uh... and they just turned him into this big hero
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.400]  we know he's an anti-gun open border keating five scam artist criminal
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:58.440]  piece of health so why isn't donald trump going after him on the real issues
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.920]  they say donald trump is headed towards the texas border
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.640]  i want to send joe bigs or jacari jackson or somebody down there to cover
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.360]  that that's going to be a three-ring circus but
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.400]  why would trump come out and say oh if you get shot down
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.360]  you know you capture you're not a hero i don't want you to get captured
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.880]  no people that fly into dangerous areas and get shot down and
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.960]  to areas they know where you're tortured
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.600]  that's pretty heroic trumps really savvy really smart
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.920]  he said that because he was getting too high on the polls he was the leader
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.680]  and he is being directed by top republican strategist p r people
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:37.080]  that's come out and uh... trump trump is is is is is
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.920]  really making me angry and i told you got a bad feeling about him
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.000]  he's super smart he knows exactly what he's doing
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.680]  and so just watch he gets back in the lead again he'll do more
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:55.800]  of the same on purpose he knows all about mccain
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:01.320]  mccain is well known for all of his criminal activity
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:10.920]  and trump has to be watched very very closely
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.800]  so i'm going to be getting to all of that uh let me just hit this now on the
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.000]  near calls because it's so important i mentioned it earlier
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.760]  cbs news we have a link to it with the maps up on info wars dot com
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:28.680]  us gs scientist say major quake on hayward fault expected any day now
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.880]  the fault that produced a 4.0 magnitude earthquake in
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:38.840]  fermont early tuesday morning is expected to produce a major earthquake
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.320]  any day now and bury a residency prepared a us geological survey scientists
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.240]  said and here's the issue the only area
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:51.000]  and we've had seismologists and experts on but it's mainstream news it's not
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.560]  debated the only area of the pacific
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.320]  rim ring of fire that has not triggered
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.840]  in the last eight years since the tsunami started
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.680]  uh... that hit japan other countries since we've seen all this devastation
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.000]  just unparalleled earthquakes from india to pakistan to
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.200]  you name it just just the entire ring of fire
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:19.400]  that rings the pacific ocean the west coast of latin america
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.160]  the west coast of united states canada uh... the uh... east coast uh... of uh
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:33.080]  asia europe russia unprecedented in that
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:39.960]  trigger area from the bahá up to seattle has not triggered
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.600]  and there are more than fifty major points
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:53.080]  on that area from northern mexico up into canada
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:59.160]  that have not triggered yet and so it's just going to go off like a string of
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.200]  firecrackers and when it does it's two years overdue
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:11.000]  two years overdue and talk about sitting on top of time bomb
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.760]  and by the way you notice that the ring of fire extends inland
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:20.120]  over to the area of yellowstone underground with those plates
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.960]  and it is rising and lowering dramatically in different areas of the
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:27.960]  park and that is a super caldera a super volcano
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.000]  the last time it erupted it covered eighty percent
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.880]  of what is the united states in molten ash
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.800]  so we talk about the biggest threats humanity poses to humanity
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.720]  in a report with rex jones yesterday but what about the biggest threats we're
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:50.440]  not in control of and then you get the pentagon jacking
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.680]  around with seismic weapons they've got which are declassified that they have
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.840]  them the specifics are classified and just who knows what's going on
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.800]  basically they have been testing magnetic systems out
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.400]  that are just like the movie the core
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.600]  and other films you know where it shows the military in alaska
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.120]  testing stuff and then it ends up causing a huge earthquake
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.800]  that's what secretary of defense william cohen talked about in 1997
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.880]  in the army times he admitted that we have earthquake weapons tectonic
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.160]  weapons and so do other governments and then you've got all the geo
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:29.080]  engineering i saw a comment yesterday on rex's video
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.800]  from youtube going of course jones refuses to cover geo engineering
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.880]  and is covering it up because i didn't put it in that report oh come on
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.120]  well you're gonna cover the federal reserve being private jones uh uh uh
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.480]  i mean i just love these strawman arguments when you're gonna cover the
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.760]  federal reserve buddy i actually have people in person
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.000]  confront me and i'm like what are you are you kidding
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.480]  what are you going to defend the second amendment trader
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.920]  you'll be like i mean i i guess middle midgets do that where they like
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.200]  build a strawman or they tune in for an hour and don't hear you cover
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.760]  something and so they don't know you covered it the day before it's just
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.240]  bizarre
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.240]  okay that's some of the news i want to go to your phone calls now uh we're going
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.040]  to go to a cameron we're going to go to alex we're
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.240]  going to go to chris brandon christopher and others uh cameron thanks
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.880]  for holding her on the air hi hi it's uh cameron i'm from
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.280]  orange county california and um first of all i wanted to say that i know
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.800]  like we're portrayed as a bunch of lunatics out here but there's like
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.680]  so many of us that are awake it's um not even funny
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.560]  are you there i'm sorry i can't even hear anything absolutely i mean i'll
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.960]  interrupt you if you want oh no no no that's okay um and um
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.720]  i didn't know if you knew this but um uh good
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.760]  what's his name his name is tony mohammed from the lewis farrakhan he
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.360]  represents him on the west coast he's been at like a couple different
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:59.560]  rallies for the sp-277 and said that he's going to address it
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.640]  and the uh million man march coming up in october and also this listed march to
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:09.080]  the cdc um headquarters in georgia afterwards or yeah in georgia to um
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.560]  talk about this and said that they're not going to let this go through they're
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.960]  really all against this whole thing too and i'm not a big fan of that or anything
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.840]  but whatever it no you're listen you're a great call because that's why i love
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.480]  taking calls you bring up something i meant to say weeks ago and never
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.000]  covered uh and i wasn't trying to be smart now people always start talking
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.440]  and then if i don't interrupt them then they say hey are you there and then i'm
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.160]  bad about interrupting so i try to not interrupt uh but long story short
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:39.400]  the nation of islam puts out a lot of really great information
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.520]  they're a paradox because lewis farrakhan says some really horrible things
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.440]  like blaming asians because they come and build stores in the black community
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.440]  will build your own stores and then lewis farrakhan says no we should shop at our
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.280]  own stores and build our community up i'm all for that i don't think it's racist
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.280]  to support your community and try to empower yourselves by
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:04.680]  shopping locally uh shopping with local farmers but also if you're in a depressed
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:09.720]  black area you should try to support black businesses
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.720]  so they say support your local businesses create your own community
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.080]  don't take the inoculations they're putting poison in it
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.480]  i've read their trumpet newspaper it's full of so much good stuff
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.080]  uh lewis farrakhan talks about the government shipping drugs in that's
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.920]  true but then
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.640]  he'll get up and and and just really push
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.120]  for racial confrontation when that's exactly what the globalist want
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.240]  i mean i hear stuff out of farrakhan's mouth that i know
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.920]  george soros is basically financing other people to say
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:49.160]  and i know george soros is really a bad guy and and i really know most white
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.040]  people are not racist they might be uncomfortable and
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.480]  scared of black people because of the media just like black folks get scared
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.920]  of cops because of the media even though statistically
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.640]  you're not any more likely to be attacked if you're black than if you're
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.360]  white i do think black people get pulled over more that's been
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.320]  statistically proven so there is profiling going on
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.160]  but it's like this lady they finally released the whole squad car video
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.560]  and i appreciate your call great point uh camera
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.240]  of this black lady who put out a video over self up in illinois saying i'm
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.280]  depressed i'm freaked out i'm having panic attacks
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:27.240]  i'm freaking out well the state police pull her over in texas
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.000]  and the guy writes her a warning and she just blows up at him
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:37.240]  won't shut up he says okay get out of the car then she starts
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.040]  running around he freaking out he tries to put her in handcuffs she
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.560]  resisting and then she goes and dies in police custody
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.320]  now do some of these departments beat people to death in the jail absolutely
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.240]  it goes on it's terrible but if you watch the state policeman
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:58.520]  i mean he's a good cop a good trooper compared to some of the ones i've seen
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.760]  and the media and they're having marches and everything else saying she was
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.960]  murdered and then it turns out that she had serious
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.640]  psychiatric problems and had a victim
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.520]  psychology and i'm not saying this is what happened
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.280]  but i'd say about an 80% chance she did kill herself
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:23.080]  as a whole way to make herself the victim because she was already suicidal
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.600]  but i'm not gonna play the whole 14 minutes the raw video is on info wars
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.520]  dot com i i i sent it to nico so i don't know they posted it we
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.360]  should post it but video released of traffic stop
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:39.240]  in sandra bland case and i mean she is just freaking out
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:46.440]  on the trooper on and on and on and the average out of control cop would
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.440]  attest her right away i mean compared to a lot of cops where
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.880]  they just punch you in the face for no reason they need to be arrested
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.560]  but in her case i think she committed suicide that's what my god tells me
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:02.040]  it's a tragedy you know about rvs you've heard about bunkers
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:07.560]  but surviving is not recreation and men wasn't made to live underground

[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:30.680]  praying on everyone i mean a perfect microcosm of this is
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.640]  Planned Parenthood tens of millions aborted at their hands
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.840]  the eugenics league basically changed their name to
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.760]  Planned Parenthood they helped found and fund
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.400]  fascist movements the nazi party you can read their quotes and they are
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.720]  worshiped as the very oxygen of liberal
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:54.840]  trendiness and then behind closed doors are like
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.400]  yeah we want to kill blacks yeah we sell body parts yeah we
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.200]  i mean all these tapes have been coming out for years and they're going to
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.400]  release more tapes now they're warning Planned Parenthood
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.520]  the new racist ones well you know what it's all racist
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.440]  against innocent children it devalues human life
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.480]  to say they're black babies or they're white babies
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.960]  but see now that politician running for president
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.280]  O'Malley he said no you know what black lives white lives all lives
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.880]  that's a classical liberal statement no no they're like no no
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.200]  because it's racially based but then it doesn't even do anything for
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:38.600]  that race-based group it's the federal reserve screwing over black people
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:42.120]  it's napkin gas screwing over black people it's open border screwing over
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.400]  black people it's the vaccines the fluoride and

[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:20.520]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:36.520]  of the info war
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:44.520]  so
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:52.360]  imagine what's going to happen out on the west coast
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.880]  if another big earthquake hits along these fault lines where they built
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:01.880]  nuclear power reactors and we get a new fukushima type situation in fact up on
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.760]  info wars dot com we have some of the photos
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:10.440]  that have gone viral in japan of mutated daisies
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.280]  and we have mutated butterflies and record numbers of children
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:17.800]  just collapsing dead of heart failure that's what happens with children
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:24.440]  and radiation and their answer is just to say oh the radiation safe it's no
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.360]  problem why would they build six reactors
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:33.960]  on a fault line in a tsunami area and then say it was impossible for it to
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:38.520]  melt down and then five of the six reactors got damaged
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:45.080]  three of them completely blew up then they covered that up
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.240]  i went and looked at the design of the mox reactor the big one that was
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.600]  plutonium and uranium that blew up the second one to explode
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.840]  with a hydrogen explosion and i went and looked at the design of it and
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.440]  blueprints that were online and then i blew up the video we put out
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:05.560]  articles back when it happened four years ago and said it appears
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:09.800]  that the entire reactor was shot
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:15.080]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of yards into the air
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.400]  we even measured how high the communication towers were around there
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.160]  we see it was three times higher and i said it looks like it may have
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.960]  injected what appears to be fuel rods up to a mile away
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:32.760]  three years after the new york times published a report
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.480]  where the japanese government admitted that fuel rods were ejected a mile and
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.400]  a half away and indeed it had blown completely up
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:46.280]  it had achieved fission a small atomic explosion
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.040]  and had shot them further than i even thought
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:54.440]  now i'm not bragging it's just that the media knew what they were seeing
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.880]  physicists knew what they were seeing nuclear engineers knew what they were
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:00.440]  seeing i had nuclear and chemical engineers on
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:05.400]  saying basically the same thing but where is the survival instinct of the
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:11.000]  species to not even care about this now there's
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.960]  triple the radiation in the northern hemisphere than there is in the southern
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.040]  hemisphere what's going on why is there a death
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.960]  wish by the elite because if they don't care about little babies or
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.680]  veterans they don't care about themselves
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.440]  that's why i was haunted yesterday and last night and
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:37.800]  currently by the video of the planned parenthood national
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:43.320]  council director the head of their council the head of their board
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.960]  haggling over baby organs
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:53.880]  and i think about the denial
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.080]  where 20 years ago on air i would talk about china selling political
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.520]  dissonance organs when it was in the british news
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:07.080]  and us news would write articles saying i was lying
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:11.240]  the state department put out a report about 14 years ago
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.480]  dispelling conspiracy theories that there was an organ trade in china
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.520]  the chinese government advertises they sell
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.000]  political dissonance organs it's in japanese newspapers
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.080]  public executions where they then announced that
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.160]  minutes after they're killed they have their organs taken
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:36.520]  now they have mobile execution vans 14 per major city
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:41.080]  where they keep you alive and do a vivisection
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.720]  removing your heart finally and sucking your blood out
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:49.000]  so they can take each organ properly on the runway
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.240]  pack them an ice and fly them out people say why are you covering this macabre
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.240]  because i couldn't get people to admit it when it was in foreign news
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.280]  18 19 20 years ago how am i going to get people to admit they're putting
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:07.080]  cancer viruses in the vaccines and fluoride in the water i mean harvard
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.720]  admits it's lowering our IQs over 10 points
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:15.960]  they admit it's giving us bone cancer their own scientists aren't bad
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:19.320]  at the fda they say take it out but the elites say
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:25.160]  no but we've reached a breaking point where so many lawsuits have been filed
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:28.040]  they're now cutting the amount of fluoride in the water by half
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.080]  my point is we're so close to beating these people
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:37.720]  i can feel it we've known for decades that Planned Parenthood
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:41.560]  sells baby parts the problem is chopping them up they have
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:45.080]  trouble keeping the organs so they mainly sell them for blood
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:49.720]  product for stem cell research and for cosmetics the
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.280]  collagen
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.320]  but now we can force the debate about this
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.920]  now we can admit it's going on notice the first week this came out
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.520]  they had a whole bunch of publications just say it wasn't real
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:10.200]  then when it turned out it was real msnbc said big deal
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.080]  it's research
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.040]  and now that videos are going to be released they were smart
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.920]  with them talking about getting rid of the minorities
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:26.360]  and how they're a big problem and you're going to see the real face of msnbc
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.440]  and cnn i predict they're going to ignore it no matter how bad it is
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:36.840]  because they can't face it a vampire can't face high noon
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.000]  out in the town square that's all i want to do is haul these people out of
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.280]  their pits where they want to hide they want to creep out at night
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.400]  politically they want to have their way with us in the dead of night no you're
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.360]  going to have it out in front of god and everybody
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.040]  we're going to drag you out of your crypts right up in the middle of the
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.760]  town square and everything you've been doing is going to be brought out in the
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.160]  open because you love hurting innocent people you enjoy it
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:07.160]  your ghouls all these allegories all these legends have a basis in
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:12.040]  reality the greeks 2 500 years ago in
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:17.320]  major cities would have vampire hunting days
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.120]  look this up and they would go out into the crypts
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:26.120]  into the caves into the areas and it was mainly psychopathic
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.360]  mentally ill people who would creep around at night and grab
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:34.200]  folks and and drag them off and eat them
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.160]  in major greek cities they had psychopaths that would
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.520]  that that believe they were vampires that would do this and people go out and
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.160]  hunt them and kill them
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.200]  now these people run Planned Parenthood and if you go out
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.040]  doing a mortuary and they know you're going to be there people in black will
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:55.080]  arrive with totally white skin if they're black they look
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.280]  like vampires they're totally white and they just and they literally show up
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.040]  and start going because that's who they are
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.400]  and i know it sounds over the top but i'm telling you folks
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.560]  i'm telling you they're possessed demons and people
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.880]  over at the white house run you know uh publications and go ahead and make your
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.080]  jokes all day people know what i'm saying is true
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:22.040]  look at the texas house i talked about it yesterday
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.400]  last year we're trying to pass a bill or two years ago
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:31.240]  the last session they're back in session now they were trying to ban
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.280]  partial birth abortion but those are the prizes where you they get all the
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.320]  organs you know babies that could live and just
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:43.080]  spontaneously dozens of women started hissing i love
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:46.680]  satan hell satan sticking their tongues out and hissing like snakes
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:51.000]  i don't know what's going on folks but i can't handle it anymore
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.600]  these people literally crawl out from under rocks they run and hide in trash
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.680]  cans right in front of you why are we ruled by a bunch of
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.440]  trash can dwelling vampires
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.400]  the one guy that grabbed my microphone and attacked me and all that
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.000]  literally had the widest skin i've ever seen everybody said that i was like a
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.080]  ghoul like a vampire and he wasn't acting he was bumping into people it was
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.040]  like he wasn't even alive and he was just had this satanic
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:21.640]  looking as i was going
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:26.040]  what do you expect to be attracted to a place where they're butchering babies
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.960]  while we were outside women were driving in to have their babies killed
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:35.160]  so of course showing up to defend it is the demons
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.080]  don't you understand it's not a game i don't know whether it's interdimensional
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.800]  creatures whether it's demons whether it's some kind of
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.160]  mental illness whatever they're still a demon
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:49.320]  whatever it is they got to be dealt with
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:55.480]  in ancient Greece those folks would be hanging out in the caves and you know
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:00.840]  i guess they had i just can't even handle anymore
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:09.240]  they had like green skin my dad calls those people glow in the dark people
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.680]  and i i've seen this over and over again our enemies
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:18.840]  literally have green skin i mean they love death they love their father
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.360]  and so good go have death go jump off a cliff
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.440]  don't hurt anybody else just get out of our way we want to get off the planet
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.760]  we want space bases we want clean energy we want to maintain human dignity we
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.240]  want to maintain goodness we want to be honorable
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:36.920]  we don't like the devil we don't want to be around you
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:40.200]  i'm sorry let's go to calls got frogo in england and

[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:21.560]  hey how's it going all right brother go ahead
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.800]  so uh interesting thing happened this morning um i thought the whole marine
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.200]  core thing was like the just one cracked out meth head that decided to go
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.280]  shoot marines but then when you guys reported that it was nationwide threats
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:37.080]  or whatever um i decided to go to my local
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:41.800]  recruiter's office this morning and so i show up and i'm not
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:45.880]  outwardly um showing any weapons or anything like that and then
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:49.240]  there are some marines outside and i asked them if they'd seen any oath
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:52.600]  keepers they put out a national call or anybody like that and they're like yeah
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.680]  one person or something and the guy told me the the
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:00.680]  the i guess the head marine recruiter told me that the marine
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:03.880]  core recruiting command put out a directive
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:09.960]  today that if anybody shows up armed to protect the marine that the marine
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:15.960]  recruiter in charge has to uh call the local police file a police report
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:21.400]  um call the army corps of engineer and turn those people into them for trespassing
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.880]  on federal property with guns and uh press charges and there's a
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:29.800]  bunch of other paperwork that they have to do so the marine core is pushing back
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.440]  real hard when at least at the local level here in
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.760]  georgia it shows on the local news um you know the marine recruiters or
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.120]  whatever branch the recruiters coming out and taking pictures with everybody and
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:42.600]  they appreciate it but at a federal level
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.360]  they're pushing back really hard i had a few opinions about it but uh
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.120]  this is huge news and i believe you sound very credible
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.800]  the marine core i guess under obama thinks it owns these marines
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:56.680]  and thinks they're allowed to just set them out there as sitting ducks
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.360]  we've confirmed threats and pouring in all over the country
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.480]  especially but if it's a shopping center and it's an open carry state
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:09.400]  uh and if the owner of the shopping center is cool with you sitting across
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.800]  in the grass uh you know or whatever and protecting it then i don't see how that
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.560]  could happen but that's amazing don't even threaten them with trespass
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.680]  i guess they want to get these patriots in jail as fast as possible
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:24.280]  that is just incredible was the marine was the head marine that you talked to
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:29.240]  upset by this or did he love it no he was not well he was real
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:34.600]  um you know i i guess you see it a lot and then federal employees matter of
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:39.000]  fact don't care yeah he was like you know what i i asked i asked him i said
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.200]  hey do you mind these people coming out do you appreciate it do you not want
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.400]  them here and he was like you know what i just don't want to have to call the
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:48.440]  police and i really don't want to do paperwork you said if anybody's gonna
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:52.840]  come shoot they're gonna come shoot so he's what a cowardly
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.800]  resigned attitude yeah um and you know i have a i have a
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.560]  couple feelings about it um at least at a federal level
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:05.800]  there is a possibility that the next crisis
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.800]  could be averted by americans carrying weapons
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:16.680]  as opposed to the next crisis used to stop americans carrying weapons you just
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.560]  said it they want more of these to happen so they can blame the second
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.320]  amendment they have a major stake in demonizing common sense
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.560]  they don't want a patriot to stop a crazy islamist
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.520]  and so that's they're already upset about garland
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.240]  uh they're upset by the response of citizens wanting to protect these
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.440]  facilities and you're absolutely right go ahead
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.520]  let's let's spitball it for a second what happens if
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.080]  it were a nationwide threat there was another attack and
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.840]  an oath keeper somebody stopped it what would happen is
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:52.040]  that makes the oath keeper's heroes that makes the second amendment a hero they
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.560]  don't want that and even further when was the last
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.760]  time americans walked away from their uh you know good employment
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.960]  good hardworking americans dropped what they were doing
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:07.640]  and picked up a gun for a common cause because i can tell you
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:12.840]  1776 that's right and if that were to happen
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.600]  and soccer moms and business men and
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.680]  and college students all showed up at recruiting centers and national guard
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:23.480]  centers at least outside metropolitan areas like
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:27.080]  atlanta you would have thousands of armed people
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.960]  easily quickly i mean within an hour and what would those people think
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:36.200]  they would immediately understand the power that they hold
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:39.640]  and uh you know even if nothing happened
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.480]  okay the next the next national emergency that happened would those people
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.880]  say where's the national guard no they'd say well hell we can all go down
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:51.720]  there we have more people than the national guard
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.480]  you need to have your own radio show bro the way you just crystallized that
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:58.920]  boiled it down so simply succinctly with pure rational
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.720]  knowledge and then i'm up here bumbling around trying to explain it
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:05.400]  exactly that's why they don't want the troops armed themselves
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.080]  because it's this idea that well then citizens could be their own security
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:12.040]  and then that ends the need to take all of our freedoms
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:16.040]  to counter these manufactured threats we've got to take this little piece
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:20.520]  that you just put out live and post it with a title
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:26.600]  saying the mystery of why they want the recruiting centers disarmed revealed
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:31.480]  and explain uh why this could become 1776 part two
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:38.120]  it all began uh in mitra con one state in mexico
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:41.640]  where just a few farmers fought back against uh having their
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:46.520]  employees killed at lime uh farms and then that spread all over the state
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:49.960]  then to other states till the army came in and disarmed them
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:53.400]  because the army works with the drug dealers openly in mexico
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.160]  and it's the same story just one person stands up
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.840]  and then defeats the enemy or even is defeated it doesn't matter that
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:05.320]  act of defiance is infectious and they don't want that humanity there it's
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.520]  why they're getting rid of contact sports it's why they're getting rid of dodgeball
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.120]  while they're getting rid of tag while there are resting kids for their free
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:17.080]  speech is to just create total ninnies that will submit to anything and
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.880]  everything for total enslavement uh so chris excellent points i really

[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:24.040]  hundred different products plus they don't call it a ghost or a stealth
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:29.240]  they use the special forces term for being able to buy most of the firearm
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.160]  except for the lower receiver tell folks about their low profile series

[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:36.840]  they've already been using a va system to confiscate guns with no evidence no
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:41.000]  reason now they admit in the la times they're
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.560]  moving with that model we had the reporter on yesterday that broke it
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.800]  all at the daily caller two weeks ago
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:51.480]  and they're now coming after four plus million retirees
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:54.280]  that they say fit the bill to have their guns taken
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:58.120]  well then now is the time for people to get accessories

[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.200]  and some of the other accessories available well this is an important thing
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:15.160]  to have you know this is untraceable you anybody can get this kit right here you
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:19.000]  don't have to go through a federal firearms license place
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.400]  you can have it shipped right to your house this is what the traders have been
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:24.600]  trying to shut down absolutely absolutely so you basically have
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:27.240]  everything you need besides a lower receiver because that's what's traceable
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:30.520]  that's what's serialized and that's what the federal government's after
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:34.280]  but uh you can get this right here get your own lower receiver any way you
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:36.840]  want there's different programs all you gotta do is your own research and you
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:40.760]  can find out how to get a lower receiver so you can put it on this
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:43.880]  maybe you already have a lower receiver from an ar from way back
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.840]  that you just don't quite use anymore it's old something like that you can
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.880]  throw it on this you basically have a brand new rifle and you save money by
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:52.920]  putting together yourself and buying this kit right here which is cheaper than
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:56.040]  the actual rifle and they've got the highest quality barrels the highest
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:01.400]  quality triggers we're not just saying that go look at the third party reviews
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:05.720]  this is not hype when we talk about their 556 now
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:09.320]  tell me about the new rifle they're producing was getting amazing reviews
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:15.000]  and then i just got one this 308 yes that is very arcadious arcadious that's
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.440]  very exciting they just came out with their own line of um ar-10 platforms
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:23.000]  which is basically an ar-15 but instead of it being a 556 it shoots a 308
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.960]  round which i know you personally like shooting a 308
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:28.680]  i like them both and i mean just to be clear they've always for years been
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:30.840]  making this for the big manufacturers the high end
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.480]  they're just now not private labeling they're putting out their own guns
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.320]  yes well the one they sent you i'm actually jealous of is a beautiful gun
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:40.200]  um it's set up and configured for long range shooting
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:44.120]  marksmanship type things um it's right here in front of us
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.320]  just the scope alone is something to snuggle with
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:51.240]  yeah it's a vortex 4 by 16 scope which you can get it head down as well their
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:54.360]  distributor um and and i think things for people to
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:57.960]  remember is that if you want a 308 you don't have to get the 18 inch barrel you
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.360]  don't have to get the 22 inch barrel you don't have to get it set up for
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:03.800]  marksmanship you can get one with a 16 inch barrel that's set up for more of
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.320]  an assault weapon type you know uh uh configuration
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:10.920]  so anything you want people just call head down you can get anything you want
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.200]  made there and any configuration you might want on your rifle
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:18.520]  they're they're able to do that and they have 100 perfect customer service
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.640]  ratings there it really is amazing and again they
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.760]  support the broadcast so this is where folks should get their high
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:30.600]  quality 556 or 308 or their basically stealth low
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.680]  pro type systems triggers accessories uh you name it just
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:41.080]  the highest quality cutting edge battle tested a lot of major units are
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:44.680]  actually using this in special ops so they're continually getting
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:48.600]  feedback and upgrading what they're doing when you buy these products with
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:52.280]  the rifle or just some accessories it's superior craftsmanship
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.280]  and it's competitive pricing you can't get these type of products
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.880]  uh anywhere cheaper you know what i mean they they basically have the most
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:02.760]  competitive pricing and it's superior craftsmanship
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:05.960]  and it's all made in america two things right here that i have
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:09.480]  that's simple that you could upgrade your ar-15 or your ar-10
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:14.200]  at home pv's uh it's a pvx muzzle brake it's one of the top of the line things
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:16.760]  you can buy if your rifle helps with the muzzle rise
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:19.640]  gives it more accuracy simple put it on right there it works
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:23.000]  this is a head down developed and designed single stage trigger
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.680]  you can get it in a three and a half inch pound or four inch pound uh trigger
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:30.440]  and i dropped one of these in one of my old ar-15s that i use it just
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:33.800]  as what you call a truck gun you just beat it up i've had it forever
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.400]  um i also have a head down rifle which i love even more but i dropped this in it
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:42.200]  it's shot like a dream just dropping this trigger in
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:46.360]  bottom line it's not just firearms a ton of accessories

[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:01.320]  welton economic upheaval has enveloped the european union
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:04.680]  this year as a result of bailout practices that have done nothing but
[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:08.280]  make these countries more insolvent well french president french while haland
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:11.160]  has proposed a solution he recently suggested that every
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:14.760]  member of the eurozone transfer all their sovereignty to a newly created federal
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:17.800]  government in other words it would essentially be a united states of europe
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:20.600]  the government would have a prime minister a parliament a federal budget
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:22.920]  and a federal treasury that's a pretty good suggestion
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:26.680]  since your original eurozone bureaucracy and parliament didn't do anything to
[02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:29.880]  help these financial crises except make the banks richer let's create
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:33.640]  another big bureaucracy that we can feed money into therefore kicking the can
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:36.600]  down the road just a little bit farther michael schneider notes that during
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:39.640]  times of emergency the elites are often able to push through things that they
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:42.920]  would never be able to accomplish under normal circumstances
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:47.720]  and for those of you keeping score a year ago the euro to dollar ratio was 1.35
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:52.440]  today it's come down to 1.08 clearly the european union is faltering

[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:24.440]  well this music isn't fitting for plan parenthood caught in the second video
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:28.760]  with their national director the the the chairperson of their
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:32.360]  their board of directors talking about if you want lamborghini's
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:35.880]  and wants the lowest prices on baby parts for sale
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:39.400]  while she drinks wine and cackles and looks like
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:42.600]  a vampire queen
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:47.480]  it just illustrates the truth the strange of the fiction
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:50.840]  and it's everything i've been telling you you got to get out of these fake
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:54.920]  churches get out of your houses turn off the american idol or whatever's on
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:58.280]  tv now and go out and engage the globalist and you
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:04.120]  will run into the lowest forms of scum
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:07.160]  so you just want to go have your own life and don't want to run anything
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:10.600]  they do and they're in charge and now they're announcing they want to get
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:13.880]  rid of our free speech now they're announcing that our kids belong to
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:18.520]  them no no no
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:21.080]  yeah if the cops pull you over and they're not trying to take you to a
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.280]  fema camp in the future it's best to just comply even if
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:27.000]  you disagree with the unconstitutional laws or whatever
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.440]  because the average cop isn't a terrorist isn't a bad person
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:34.200]  and if you get in a fight with them you're going to end up going to jail
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:37.480]  getting killed even if you kill them they're going to hunt you down
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:40.360]  it's pointless
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:43.960]  but when it comes to not complying with the schools trying to forcibly
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:46.840]  inoculate your kids when it comes to the system trying to put
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:49.640]  floor on your water when it comes to the system trying to bankrupt our
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.320]  dollars trying to get rid of cash and trying to get rid of our jobs
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.880]  that's the real assault so they want us to instead with the
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.480]  Ford Foundation and others funding it and Soros
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:05.640]  make the whole revolution about rioting and attacking local police
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.720]  because that'll just destabilize things further
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:13.640]  now at the bottom of the hour i'm going to go into a complete news connection
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:16.360]  that there's there's probably let's not exaggerate probably a hundred articles
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:19.480]  haven't gotten to probably covered 50 already
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:24.600]  and i said i'd get back into this big wired magazine article about
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:27.560]  well we can't let the public have the life extension
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:31.320]  who will get it so there's that whole debate
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:34.920]  and and by forcing a debate about this it's the beginning of the end of the
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.640]  globalist using national security and global
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:41.560]  security to keep all this stuff secret for themselves
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:44.920]  so that's why we're here exposing it just like
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:51.880]  four plus million in the FBI memo are set to now have their guns taken
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:56.280]  and they're using the VA program of secrecy to take veterans guns
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:02.440]  now for social security recipients and i can't believe i'm not even more freaked
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:04.920]  out we should send out jacari jackson or leon
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:09.960]  macadoo or darin mcbrain or john bounder rex jones
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:16.200]  whoever one of our reporters to go out in austin and say hey
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:19.480]  now here's the FBI memo here's the daily caller article
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:23.880]  it says that if you take a money transfer a direct wire of your social
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:28.120]  security that means you must be inept you're incompetent to own guns
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:34.440]  no judge no jury the 68 gun control act says you're a felon or mentally incompetent
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:39.000]  it's not in the law they're just doing it that's why it's so dangerous it's such
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.640]  a big deal
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:47.480]  atf works with fbi and va to get veterans guns taken away
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:51.560]  i told you it was coming and the old people
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:54.440]  are dependent on that check so they think they're going to call them up and go
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:58.520]  house the atf and i've had the atf call me before that's how it works
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:03.080]  we'd like you to come down to our office or we'll drop by over there
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:08.680]  we'll discuss a firearm with you and then the atf shows up near your
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:12.840]  i mean i i was not rude and i was like well
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:19.640]  atf busy these days or the b atf i was like whoa dude don't bow up to me
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:22.600]  well why you think you know this is just and they had like some other guy
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.400]  casing around the parking lot while this was going on with these vests on with
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:30.440]  their guns already and another time at the gun show
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:34.280]  the atf walked up to me so i later talked with like oh that's the atf
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:39.000]  and it's like jones we're so sick of you and they had some other guy pop up and
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.280]  go hey alex buy buy this gun with me i don't have my license uh
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:47.560]  buy it buy it buy it and i saw ati and i was like i'm gonna do that and then i
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:50.920]  looked and was atf just just waiting that's what like if i go to the gun
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:56.120]  show it's just atf just don't even come over and bow up
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:03.320]  just bizarre behavior but you know agencies if they begin criminal they
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:06.440]  always stay criminal and the atf was founded as
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:10.360]  revenuers who would run around the country
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:14.680]  there were several whiskey rebellions and poor people out west and up north
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:17.640]  down south everywhere didn't have a lot of ways to make money and one one thing
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:24.360]  you could do was set up a still and and make whiskey or make moonshine
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.760]  and there were federal and and other taxes on it
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:32.760]  and people said we're not going to pay your whiskey tax
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:36.120]  and so the revenuers would go around and blow up the stills and arrest the
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.760]  people i'm not talking about duke's a hazard folks
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:42.760]  or where nascar came from from liquor running vehicles
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:46.840]  i'm talking about you know in you know in the 1800s i'm talking about
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:50.920]  200 years ago 150 years ago there were huge wars
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:56.680]  over all of this and insurrections and the atf is the oldest federal law
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.760]  enforcement agency the texas rangers is the oldest
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:04.520]  continual law enforcement agency if you want to call it that
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:09.480]  but but for federal it's the atf and a lot of times they would get paid off not
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.920]  to shut down your whiskey or your your moonshine
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:18.120]  or they just come into your still kill you and then sell the liquor themselves
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:23.160]  i mean they are a hardcore group they bombed oklahoma city they were
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.400]  intimately involved they love going after patriots with no criminal record
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:30.920]  who are at the gun range and they in the ar-15 shoots two rounds
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:33.960]  and a tattletale calls them and then they take you to jail and then
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:37.800]  and then they tell the jury if we admit he knew it didn't mean to shoot twice
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:43.560]  was still a felony and that jury will send you up the river with pleasure
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:47.960]  i mean they hate this country they ship guns into mexico
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.480]  to blame the second amendment they are a terrorist organization
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:56.680]  they torched waco i've known good people at the fbi
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:59.800]  i've known good people in the state police i've known good people
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:03.720]  in the federal marshals good people in the cia the atf and i'm
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:07.880]  i'm sure there are some good people that blow the whistle on fast and furious
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:12.280]  the point is the atf is a incarnate
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:15.960]  anti-american criminal organization and needs to be abolished before they
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:18.920]  stage more terror attacks brandon and alabama
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:22.680]  then we'll go to christopher and john and mike and others i'm gonna move quick
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.760]  now i'm gonna try my best brandon and alabama go ahead
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:30.600]  alex listen great show today and i just wanted to say you have been on a role
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:34.520]  today addressing things as far as the spiritual nature of what's going on in
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:38.040]  our world and the point is this is that we have to
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:42.360]  understand that nothing happens on a world level on a geopolitical level
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:47.320]  that is not being orchestrated and uh and strings being pulled behind the
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:51.320]  scenes do we think it's a coincidence that we see the pope the largest of the
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:55.480]  uh... the leader of the world's largest quote christian religion calling for a
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:58.920]  one-world government calling that people who own or
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:01.240]  manufacture firearms can't be christian
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:05.320]  and you can go on and on down the list it's all concerted world government
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.600]  takeover it's been launched we're now entering the new world order
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:12.360]  notices approval rating has dropped massively with american catholics
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:16.680]  it doesn't matter he's he's got a billion third world followers
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:20.680]  that really think he's their papa when the guy is a snake
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.120]  leading them straight to hell is it not biblical
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:27.880]  it is all biblical if not a coincidence at 99 percent of your
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:31.880]  american megachurch pastors are preaching peace and love and happiness
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:35.320]  and don't worry about anything because starbucks is open in the united states
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:38.440]  and we're sitting in a air conditioned church i'm glad you just said that i'm
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:41.880]  glad you just said that because i went and looked it up this morning and
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.840]  checked some major christian websites and things
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:48.200]  and and googled some of the sermons of top preachers in fact i meant to give us
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:53.480]  the reporters to the story on it nothing has been said by joel olstein
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:57.720]  or any of these people uh i'll give it to uh reverend graham he's
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:00.120]  talked about it and he's talked about the open borders
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:03.080]  none of these so-called preachers he's glitter bugs
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:06.600]  have talked about it's all feel good follow me
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:10.840]  and you're gonna get rich no you're gonna get persecuted what's gonna happen
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:13.720]  and and they're just up there and i don't want to attack joel olstein
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:16.440]  he says some things that are good as well but
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:21.880]  where imagine if joel olstein came out against planned parenthood
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:25.000]  imagine what that would do that would save millions of babies but he won't do
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.040]  it and i'm not picking on him just just any of them i went and looked at their
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:32.200]  websites nothing out of these people they need to get
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:35.240]  involved for these children i'm sorry go ahead
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:38.440]  no the bottom line is that we are fighting a spiritual battle alex and i
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.480]  know you said you didn't want this to turn into a preacher fast book if we call
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:45.400]  ourselves a christian we have to wake up and realize that everything in our world
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.680]  is of a spiritual nature and we have to fight that
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:52.520]  battle through spiritual eyes and listen you're exactly right the
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:56.360]  preachers are not addressing this they're a handful of men franklin gray and
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.840]  being one who are willing to confront the big issues
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:04.040]  jonathan conne joel richarton uh carl gallops uh mark bill those are all
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:07.400]  guys that write for world net daily they're addressing these issues but see
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:11.320]  they aren't dobson dobson's been doing it he's getting harassed by the irish
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:15.320]  and in their facility shot up that's exactly right in the
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:19.400]  bottom line is we have to realize that there are spiritual things going on in
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:22.040]  this world and that our battle is not against flesh
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.440]  and blood they're being played out through people
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:27.960]  but there are powers bigger than these people that are orchestrating and you
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:31.560]  said it earlier they are being demonically influenced or possessed or
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:34.440]  whatever it is and my word of encouragement to you is
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:37.960]  don't worry about it turn into a preacher fast brother we have to address
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:41.400]  things from a spiritual standpoint in the spiritual nature if we call ourselves
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:47.560]  christian well it's just beyond that i the church has been taken over to turn
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:52.040]  people off from it because it's one of the main command bases of this system
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:55.400]  but when you really research this and you go to behemian grove that's going on
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:59.800]  right now in california and you cover all of this
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:03.880]  you come to the realization that it is a satanic takeover
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:08.360]  and and and again i say to the atheists and everybody
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:12.040]  call it a sci-fi movie whatever you want you know angels or
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:14.840]  you know demons or aliens or whatever i don't know
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:19.000]  i just know the elite believe they're directed by entities
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.280]  they they believe they're being given all this knowledge they're doing all this
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:24.920]  evil stuff and if you start praying at the
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.080]  capital or at a uh a mortuary people show up in black
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:33.960]  and start screaming hail satan i mean this stuff's going on
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:38.040]  and believe me just imagining you know that your demon possessed doesn't give
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:41.080]  you green skin i mean when you get around
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:44.360]  these people you are looking at another creature
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.640]  and then that's all i can say is i've been around it too much
[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:51.320]  i'm telling you folks it's like avatar or something like there's
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:54.840]  aliens up there piling these people around i mean you know that's an allegory
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:58.600]  of christianity i don't it's just pure evil

[02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:16.520]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:20.200]  you know katlin jenner is actually the real l choppo
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:23.800]  the problem is he hasn't actually done the chopping so i say he's a fraud
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:28.760]  but me i've gone and i've had surgery and i've had these prosthesis ears added
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:34.680]  i am now choosing to be trans zoological i believe is the term i may
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:38.120]  have to be trans able to chop my arms and legs off and be known as a biscuit and
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.720]  live in a box to take care of and if you don't accept it you're hateful in fact
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.840]  if you don't adopt my lifestyle and wear dirty brown socks on your ears
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:51.640]  after you work out you're a racist you're a homophobe you're an anti zoological
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:25:04.760]  fub you're a piece of filth so now i become my new self and folks it's the
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:10.200]  proper term uh is trans species uh paul watson decided to become a duck and you
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:13.800]  need to honor it and honor the courage or you're in big trouble
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:16.120]  and again we're not attacking people that have made the decision to change or
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:19.320]  something else the point is it being the number one issue in the world is an
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:22.920]  example of faux rights versus all of our basic human rights being taken
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.760]  so one of the crew members one of the smaller crew members has decided to go
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:34.760]  from being a human to a gorilla and so uh mr gorilla what do you have to say
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:39.880]  okay there you go ladies and gentlemen
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:44.120]  i'm trying to have some fun it's such a serious show that my daughters are here
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:47.880]  today they got in the proper room even though we had a gorilla outfit
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:53.080]  and uh she put it on so i thought of a way to tie that in
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:56.840]  and she actually shot that video yesterday too at the house
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:59.400]  i'd worked out and i'd use dress socks because i don't have any clean white
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:02.760]  socks uh it was actually hiking socks brown hiking socks
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:05.880]  and i took them off and stuck them on my ears like i was a hound dog
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:09.560]  and i was joking around with the girls and they said shoot a video daddy shoot a
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:12.280]  video i thought well how do i make it political
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:18.360]  so uh that's how things tend to happen around the house uh but alex shones comes
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:24.360]  out of the closet i am a blue tech hound actually a blood hound macadamia
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:28.360]  nuts pine nuts okay let's go ahead and take some calls i
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.480]  apologize i will just continue with your phone calls christopher in colorado

[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:41.000]  hey alex uh long time supporter here uh so many things to talk about i mean
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.360]  there's so many things facing us right now whether it's the environment
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.400]  you know the economy politics the attack on um
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:51.160]  to arise the attack on sex the attack on marriage the attack on
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:55.240]  the family whatever you know i did there's so many things it's hard to
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:59.000]  it's hard to choose the social engineers can take all of our money
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.600]  and use it against us and they control the dinosaur media that puts out the
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:06.680]  talking points so this is what it's like to be dominated and run by a bunch of
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:10.440]  mentally ill people oh and they just unlimited resources
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:14.840]  you know just unlimited just uh it just it's crazy and um
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.440]  this is the first time i've called and uh i they they asked me what i wanted to
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:21.480]  talk about and i and i was thinking you know i've been thinking uh
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:25.160]  over the past several weeks like what is the biggest
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.080]  um thing facing us you know uh regardless of everything else that's
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:31.240]  going on i think it's the color of katlyn jenner's
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:35.400]  lipstick oh oh yeah oh that's great that's great
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:40.760]  and um the uh whether anything collapses whether anything uh
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:44.840]  you know anytime soon if everything just continues
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:49.480]  in a normal uh path of evolution with with technology and
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:53.400]  technology and everything with computers and in 10 15 years
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:57.640]  it's all going to be exactly the way they want just based on uh just based on
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.800]  the evolution of that technology you can and they're now telling us right now
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:05.400]  exactly they're going from what was in white papers 30 40 years ago
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:09.640]  to what was near reality 10 years ago but it was all white paper it wasn't put
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:13.640]  out popularly so i sounded crazy covering it myself and a few others
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:17.400]  now they're all putting it out positively selling it like it's a good
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:20.360]  thing going we'll be obsolete we'll be phased out
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:23.640]  the robot humans will probably kill all of us isn't it wonderful
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:26.520]  it's it's just part of evolution get ready to die
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:30.600]  they're just mainlining their plan now i mean i've got like
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:34.360]  nine articles today where they're admitting it
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:39.000]  oh yeah no and it's like it's like we were waiting for this merging of of
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.920]  technology and uh humans start to happen but in a way
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:47.240]  it's already happened i mean you walk around anywhere and everyone is
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:51.400]  literally merged with you know their phones and
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:54.440]  and their computers i'm not one i'm not one to take
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:58.520]  to take off that list i mean without computers without the internet
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:02.040]  we wouldn't even be able to know any of this stuff so it's kind of a catch 22
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:06.280]  but um we we're we're already jacked into
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:10.680]  into the matrix you know we're already they are we carry around bugs
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.600]  with us every day in our pockets you know uh our phones and it's just the
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:18.600]  beginning and now they say they have the blueprint of of total life
[02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:21.320]  with the computers and the dna and they're just rolling out all these new
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:25.240]  species and then they're all abominations they all
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:29.000]  i'd be forward if it worked and was empowering it it dumps us down all the
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:32.040]  technology makes us sicker and then creates
[02:29:32.040 --> 02:29:35.720]  horrible mutations so that they don't really have control
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:39.160]  of the global genome they're just able to mess with it
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:43.720]  and then create monstrosities it's exactly what i would expect again for the
[02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:47.640]  devil to do it is straight out of the bible
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:51.560]  we're on the march the empire is coming on stay with us
[02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:56.360]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:03.080]  wired magazine demonstrated how 470 000 Chrysler fiat vehicles
[02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:07.880]  in this case a jeep could be wirelessly remotely hacked and driven into a ditch
[02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:11.320]  of course it'll only be five to ten years before someone else the government
[02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:15.160]  will be driving your car all the time the national highway traffic safety
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:18.680]  administration plans to issue a v to v mandate that's vehicle to vehicle
[02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:22.920]  communication this year instead of 2016 as originally planned
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:26.760]  these mandates will be expensive new additions for your safety just like the
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:29.800]  safety systems that allowed hackers to turn off the steering turn off the
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:32.920]  brakes accelerate the jeep and drive it into a ditch
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:36.280]  mainstream media scoffed when we talked at length about hacking a vehicle in
[02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:39.320]  conjunction with a car bomb to make it look like reckless driving when michael
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:44.200]  pastings was killed two years ago they will rarely use this new
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:48.120]  technology to take someone's life but it is designed to take
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:51.640]  your liberty if you want to know the implications of this dangerous new
[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:54.200]  control grid being superimposed on your life

[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:02.920]  it's kind of important stuff because uh precise choices of words and forms of
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:08.920]  words uh have power is both magical and
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:15.400]  psychological um something has been bothering me for quite a while
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:20.600]  uh is the use of the term isis for a bunch of firm
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.760]  cia inspired terrorist scum in the middle east
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:34.440]  yes now isis is a goddess from ancient egypt
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:37.800]  pretty nice character i should know because i'm a neo pagan
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:44.120]  i'm a member of the fellowship of isis and we are to be a lot less rude than i
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:48.360]  was about to be when i heard a mention of the grand witch uh really pissed off
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:55.640]  about it it's not good to call that
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:59.560]  let's see i sense these things now no seriously getting back to this
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:02.440]  yes i would say isis has the traits that are the
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:06.200]  opposite of the ancient isis and i think it all is a big
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:10.680]  western cia joke yes there's no doubt about it when like
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.120]  when they first announced on television what was that in june last year
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:19.800]  yes i immediately thought there is no way that's an accident
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:23.480]  next thing i thought is also there is no way that those people are muslims
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:27.560]  because muslims would never touch anything pagan
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:32.200]  then shortly after that they kind of dropped it they modified it to
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:38.360]  isil replacing syria with the livant
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:41.720]  now obama has had rather a lot to say about them
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:46.760]  notice something he invariably called them isil
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:50.840]  and i know why they did it because he doesn't want to call down an extra
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:56.680]  curse upon himself uh so after that that's interesting
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:00.360]  because that would be if you're into the occult uh to be sitting there using
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.360]  that deity's name for another separate group obama thinks it's bad luck i've
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:09.160]  wondered why he'll never call it is or isis he does call it isle
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.920]  which is another main up name wow that's a really interesting theory
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:18.200]  um yeah i see it as being a little more than a theory i mean like
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:25.080]  i'm into occult stuff uh and i know i know the things that can
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:28.040]  happen when you scroll around with it i mean like
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:34.200]  long years ago um let's see i lived in earls court
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:41.160]  i and someone else um did a ritual in nothing dale
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:45.000]  when we were finished i got up walked home
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:50.120]  and there was weird stuff going on behind it around me for
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:53.560]  about three quarters of an hour and then it suddenly clicked that we hadn't
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:58.120]  closed the circle properly um so right there in earls court
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.200]  row unfortunately there was no one about the place
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:04.680]  i um got back into ceremonial mode closed the circle
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:08.920]  and all the weird stuff stopped straight away
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:12.760]  uh there's no doubt the elite are obsessed with what i you
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:16.840]  call ancient pagan rituals um and then they're trying to tell the public
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.680]  though that none of this is going on as a neo
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:25.880]  pagan let me ask your your view then what do you think spiritually is going on
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:32.440]  on this planet uh what's going on on this planet uh you cosmic
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:35.960]  struggle between good and evil
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:42.440]  what we see is only a little bit of reality
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:49.960]  uh it's a bit like an iceberg and there is so much of it
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:53.800]  uh let's get to the really relevant bit um
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.080]  mankind indeed all life on earth has been managed by
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:03.480]  demons for uh well since life on earth got going
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:09.000]  since the creator was able to establish certain this kind of life
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:13.960]  the other side uh i like to call them tenor bray
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:19.800]  which is Latin for darkness uh do not like life
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:26.440]  uh they have been attacking life for millions upon millions of years
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:33.640]  and they must regard it as a series of defeats because there is more and more
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:38.840]  life then at some point human life arrived and
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:43.400]  they must have thought a load of really unprincipled stuff because
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:49.480]  quite frankly um for all the animal loonies and
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:53.720]  think what how nice the world would be if we weren't here loonies
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:58.680]  the fact is that the best form of life for anyone can be a human
[02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:05.640]  and if you doubt that just think how long you could play with your iPhone if
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:08.280]  you're a frog
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:12.040]  well this is what it comes down to is that i mean if you look at the cosmology
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:14.360]  of christianity or any other ancient culture
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:17.240]  can with the basic same tenets that there are
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:20.600]  interdimensional forces good and evil there's the master
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:23.880]  creating system that gives you all the good things the life
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:27.800]  the the regeneration kinsmanship all of it
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:31.240]  and then you've got forces that love to mutate things destroy things and kill
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:34.520]  things because they hate the creation and if these
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.000]  demons as you're calling them hated what god had created before
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.280]  then imagine how much they really hate man
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:45.640]  which is made in a image of the creator
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:49.960]  and able to envision and create we are light years ahead of the animals in
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:53.240]  many ways and so that's what makes the demons so
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:58.280]  upset and why they want to demonize life and demonize the highest order of life
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:02.520]  while pulling down that highest order of life to then create the self-fulfilling
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:06.840]  prophecy that we're trash because the demons cannot destroy the life
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:11.000]  giver they can only try to destroy the creation
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.960]  that god made and that is what you come down to and then
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:17.400]  separate that from the occult or which just means hidden for folks that don't
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:22.840]  know and christianity and all of it the elite at skull and bones at bohemian
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.200]  grove and all these places they have been given dominion
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:30.600]  they pray to the false light because when you get higher up
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:33.720]  they pray to the darkness they're they're outside initiates think they're
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:37.400]  praying to the light and they're praying to the false
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:42.120]  light and at the higher levels they want to kill everybody
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:46.360]  and they're being promised by their god worlds of their own they're going to
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:49.080]  merge with the machines and be gods forever
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:53.160]  if they simply betray god's creation and try to destroy it
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:57.400]  and and it's it's heavy information and you know i've gotten into it a lot
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.440]  because when you look at it what are the churches
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:04.280]  are preaching this but then if you bring science into it and all that's been
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:07.720]  proven and the sixth sense and everything oh my god that that's
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:10.760]  that's you know that's kooky that's weird because they don't want people to
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:14.520]  know how real it is what i'm getting in is this the globalist are
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:18.440]  occult obsessed everything that is obsessed with it
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:23.880]  obama all of them and then though their practitioners get out and tell people
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:27.800]  there's nothing spiritual you see everything you're not conscious
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:32.040]  you don't have free will you're ugly you're nothing just don't just just watch
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:36.040]  what we say our little limited reality watch television
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:41.160]  watch our spectrum of false reality their hack of the system
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:46.040]  so that they can then go on in their words and be the wizards
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:49.080]  who can operate and live and control the world
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:52.440]  they're threatened by any other sentient humans
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:56.280]  being in there being able to control reality with what we build and what we
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:42:59.720]  do so they just want us gone so they can play god
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:06.280]  do you agree with that statement yeah well a little bit of modification
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:11.400]  about a month ago i thought they the demons the globalist want to kill
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:14.840]  everyone and then then the horrible truth
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:19.000]  sank in no actually they wanted to amend us
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:25.960]  they want to kill all humans uh because humans are able to resist them
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:30.680]  they would rather that we come back as inferior forms of life
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:36.120]  so um identifying as the gorillas a little bit previous
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:42.360]  uh and then well predation can take off like it where it was still in the water
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:45.720]  the jurassic well it is true they want to kill us slowly mutate us
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:48.680]  towards you it's like a psychopath and interesting points i appreciate your
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:52.200]  call call back in again thank you uh frogo thanks for working so hard to get
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:57.720]  on the show they do enjoy taking beautiful
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:00.840]  perfect creations of god and making them ugly and failed and
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:04.360]  have them spew pus out i mean that they really like that
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:09.400]  and they like to torment uh and uh people that only believe in god people
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:14.440]  that don't even are total atheist they take dmt which i don't take hard drugs
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.040]  haven't taken don't take illegal drugs but they take it and they go oh my god i
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:22.920]  believe in god now you know i was on a spaceship for a hundred years with
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:27.880]  demons torturing people and then you go give it to somebody from india somebody
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:31.640]  from mexico somebody from germany somebody who's an atheist and
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:35.240]  they either it seems the smarter you are the more hellish it is people i've
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:37.960]  talked to i mean if you're really smart and
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:42.440]  tuned in you see it and it's like oh my god and and it's just it's just
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:47.080]  unbelievable hell that's going on because you're tuned into their level
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:51.160]  and if you're kind of stupid and trendy it's like all wonderful and happy and
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:55.480]  they want to be your friend um again i don't know
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:45:00.200]  let's say it's not real in a carl yung way it's it's a shared human archetype
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:04.040]  what is that programming that you take dmt that you release a little bit of
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:08.840]  during deep sleep during vivid dreams and a ton of when you die
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:11.880]  that's why your life does flash before you i've talked to a lot of folks family
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.640]  but no people die and and the last day while they're dying it's just they're
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:19.000]  just it's incredible everything's replaying back their
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.760]  recounting things their memories perfect their eyes just fire up
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:26.200]  that's because dmt starting to be slowly released and then when they die a bunch
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:29.160]  of it's released and their whole life flashes before you
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:33.240]  well you take that stuff and i've talked to people that have taken it
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:37.160]  in fact somebody somebody very close that i wish would go on air and talk
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:41.320]  about it and it was like an eternity on a prison
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:45.960]  space station with demons doing brain surgeries torturing people and let me
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:49.720]  tell you the person said it was real
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:53.320]  and i thought oh yeah that's that's what you see i mean folks and that's what
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:56.760]  all the ancient cultures talked about what they put on cave walls what the
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:00.600]  Aztecs kind of bought into it started doing i mean it is just
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:05.560]  whacked out folks whacked out call it evil energy whatever you want it's
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:09.560]  imposing itself on the planet it wants to chop babies up why are we
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:12.600]  letting it see i said i take calls and i took that one call it was very
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:14.440]  interesting and now there's other calls and

[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:52.120]  or are they genetically modified and we have to put a stop to it they bought
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:55.320]  out some congressman from kansas i think his name is paula

[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:12.120]  why i love taking calls john as you brought up something we covered earlier
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:15.480]  in the week we've never seen such facebook censorship that we try to post
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:19.080]  articles about this they just shut it down and censor it
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.400]  and you're absolutely right imagine they want to force gmo
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.080]  known to kill honey bees known to kill the bugs that eat it known to cause serious
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:30.200]  gut problems on us and not even let it be labeled
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:37.400]  and not even let monsanto be sued it's house resolution 1599 now if you have
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:42.120]  a minute i'll tell you a few more things about john mccain the so-called hero
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:45.400]  john mccain tried to shut down all the gun shows
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:50.040]  he was co-sponsor of mccain fine gold he was co-sponsor with
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:55.560]  with ted kennedy on that sham nesty bill he signs on to kiyoto which will cost
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:59.800]  us an extra 60 cents a gallon he met with the isis commanders and helped fund
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:03.000]  the free syrian army that's now al-qaeda running around
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:07.800]  uh... he uh... he says will be in iraq another 50 to 100 years
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:13.160]  he's a decades-long member of the cfr he opposed the bush tax cuts
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:17.160]  he was heavily involved in the s and l scandals in the late 80s
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.360]  and in order to buy a simple bottle of vitamins
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:24.760]  he wants you to be required to get a doctor's prescription
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:29.720]  to buy a simple bottle of vitamins yet you and i being adults can walk in the
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:34.600]  any store in the country and buy alcohol or tobacco which can kill us
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:38.920]  without a doctor's prescription incredible but mccain doesn't want you to be able
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:41.640]  to buy any vitamins without a doctor's prescription
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:45.720]  hey can i say this john john churian candidate he is a manchurian candidate
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:49.400]  can we can we hire you as a correspondent
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:53.800]  why not you have a great voice and you're even smarter and i just am so
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:57.000]  honored i'm not kissing your butt it's true you guys sit on hold forever i'm up
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:01.320]  or babbling about space platforms and demons and you're just so smart
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:05.400]  nailed everything on mccain you're the type of guy
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:09.400]  that are you internet savvy where you could like file audio reports to a
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:13.560]  portal or something alex i'm old school i'm 69
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:17.640]  years old so i was one of those guys who grew up without the internet
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.320]  but i have unlimited local and long distance
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.000]  so i guess there's so many great characters out there that are so smart
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.040]  and and you know i would love to have it where
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:31.240]  maybe you could we could find somebody in Wyoming in the town you're in
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:34.200]  who could work with you as a team and have you go out and do reports and stuff
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:37.480]  because this is the power of the people my big dream
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:41.400]  would be to turn loose all these great americans of every race color creed
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:45.240]  from every region to be filing reports for us i don't have a ton of money
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:48.760]  uh well most of us wouldn't even want to work for money just to coordinating
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:51.960]  somebody like Wayne madson it's great we don't have him working with us but i
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:55.400]  got to tell him where i want him to go and talk to him you know it's a hassle
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:58.840]  but i want to have all these great minds involved with us you call in
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:04.040]  maybe once a year and always just absolutely knock it out of the park
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:09.240]  and i would like more and more to have people like you be able to maybe we
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:12.920]  sent you a dat machine with a recorder and you could record
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:15.720]  commentaries and mail it back to us but that's just
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:19.800]  i mean there's so many i really want to turn loose a citizen core of reporters
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:22.920]  that way we'd have people in every corner of the country very very exciting
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:25.640]  i'm going to skip this network break so we have more time
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:29.080]  on this wednesday edition other points you want to make about mccain i go
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:31.960]  ahead well for five years by the way i've
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:34.920]  been fighting these criminals here in sheridan on water
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:39.160]  fluoridation and we had a corrupt mayor before who
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:42.760]  got appointed uh in the uh state house of
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:46.600]  representatives here and then he got a formerly
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:51.880]  anti-fluoride city council member to become pro-fluoride so he would be
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:56.040]  appointed mayor so they have some of the most corrupt you think
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:00.440]  the politics are corrupt in texas remember i was born in texas city
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:06.040]  so i know all about texas politics and you think corrupt politics or
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:10.040]  evident in texas and louisiana you should come up to wyoming and see how
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:13.480]  corrupt they are up here they're awful but i've been fighting the
[02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:17.160]  fluoridation of our water which began earlier
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:20.200]  this year began around the first of the year that's right haven't i seen you in
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:22.920]  some of the local papers i think we've covered it
[02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:26.600]  because i mean look harvard admits it's deadly they've ordered the amount of
[02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:30.280]  fluoride in the water cut by half i bet if you go investigate the water
[02:51:30.280 --> 02:51:33.320]  department i bet they haven't cut it yet
[02:51:33.320 --> 02:51:37.160]  no they haven't as a matter of fact we need one more
[02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:42.520]  new member of city council to replace the old fluoride junkies
[02:51:42.520 --> 02:51:45.800]  one more member of city council and then we will have enough to
[02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:51.080]  shut down the water fluoridation here the force medicating us with a deadly
[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:53.560]  poison that they now admit is brain damaging us
[02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:57.720]  and we wonder why the icu points have dropped in the last 30 years 14 points
[02:51:57.720 --> 02:52:02.920]  one decade of regular fluoride use reduces icu by 10 points on average
[02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:06.840]  i mean these people are sick freaks john i'm going to start getting the name a
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:10.680]  number of folks that i think could be correspondence or
[02:52:10.680 --> 02:52:15.880]  people that give us commentary or people that give us their take on things
[02:52:15.880 --> 02:52:19.320]  i don't know what i'm going to do with this core of people but the guy called
[02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:22.840]  earlier i think it was from georgia talking about going to the marine core
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:26.360]  recruiting thing and he had breaking news people like you
[02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:32.280]  it'd be so good to be able to have folks out there that
[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:36.920]  could be filing reports to info wars dot com and writing articles and just
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:40.200]  really having boots on the ground everywhere very very exciting so if you
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:43.720]  want to give us your name and number john i'm going to get that and then put it
[02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:46.840]  do create some type of file or something because i want to start
[02:52:46.840 --> 02:52:50.600]  getting these great callers and people i mean like david night entered one of
[02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:54.200]  our contest the hired him he's now hosting the show
[02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:58.120]  reaching tens of millions of people every week jacari jackson was in college and
[02:52:58.120 --> 02:53:01.640]  you know didn't make in great grades and rtf and already had a job but we
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:03.960]  convinced him to move down here he's doing a great job
[02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:06.360]  you know people like mac brain was already working for what was the script
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:08.840]  sourd new service we convinced him to quit his job and come here
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:14.120]  because he entered the contest uh you know i but i'm out of money
[02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:17.720]  at a certain point skipping breaks not plugging like i'm doing now
[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:21.080]  uh to where i wish i could go out and just hire a whole bunch of reporters
[02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:24.600]  the problem is you hire an establishment reporter most of the time
[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:28.280]  they just want you to tell them what to say i've tried it before and you're i'm
[02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:32.280]  like i'm not going to tell you what to say go out and investigate you know
[02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:36.280]  they're like well i'm not liberal or conservative well neither are we
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:40.280]  we're just common sense and that's my dream
[02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:45.480]  this is all these smart concise people out there that listen and i'm so humbled
[02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:49.080]  that you listen to me because half the time i'm exhausted i mean i i got a
[02:53:49.080 --> 02:53:52.840]  lot of work i'm not complaining it's just that uh
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:56.680]  it's kind of like i'm on the field after playing 18 innings of baseball
[02:53:56.680 --> 02:54:00.440]  and and sometimes i'm a little tired and i'm going to swing wide and i'm going to
[02:54:00.440 --> 02:54:03.160]  stumble around sometimes though i'm going to get a better hit than i would
[02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:07.400]  have got in the second inning but i'm kind of cross-eyed sometimes i'll be
[02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:10.920]  honest with you uh i can't believe the stress i can put up with god's really
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:14.840]  blessed me with stamina and people only knew the stuff
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:18.600]  i'm not whining about it it's just crazy so
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:21.880]  believe me folks i know it's a train wreck sometimes but i'm doing the best i
[02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:25.240]  can and i got a great crew and they're just getting better and better so i'm
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:29.080]  so blessed and the world's getting so dark right now
[02:54:29.080 --> 02:54:34.840]  that i just fall back on god and it's not like it's a psychological blanket
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:39.320]  it's it's it's where i get my strength
[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:44.280]  i can be exhausted and i just think about god and and and and and god wants us
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:47.480]  to protect the innocence and god wants us to help
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:51.960]  uh life on this planet and then just the strength fills me
[02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:56.360]  uh it's just so epic the battle we're in i just can't believe
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:00.680]  we're so prominent in this fight there are so many well-spoken
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:05.880]  smart incredible people uh who we need to be involved and i know you're involved
[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:09.400]  but i want to see you involved on a bigger level
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:13.080]  i wish there were another dozen outfits like info wars
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:17.640]  i wish there were so many successful articulate neat people
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:21.720]  that showed up on the scene that i was made obsolete
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:25.720]  and i could just maybe do polished books or videos
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:29.000]  fighting the globalist and and and and really contributing that way
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:33.080]  because i'm so busy i can't do a lot of polished stuff i would pretty much
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:37.160]  sit back uh if if people show up that have got what it takes
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:41.720]  to take the globalist on but i know this so many good people don't take action
[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:45.960]  because you're humble like i am as well it doesn't matter if you've got a
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:49.640]  speech impediment it doesn't matter of your handicap it doesn't matter of your
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:53.000]  black or white it doesn't matter what matters is you
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.440]  recognize the evil you don't want to put up with it
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:56:00.840]  you don't want to go along with it you're not going to stand for it
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:04.040]  i mean folks they're beginning gun confiscations on
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.720]  social security recipients right now
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:12.760]  and i feel like i'm losing my soul because my soul stronger than ever in
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:17.400]  many ways but in others i'm so marinated in this evil
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:22.120]  that i know they were coming after the social security recipients
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:24.600]  they're gonna do the same thing they've done in australia and europe take away
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:28.200]  your tax write-off for kids that you desperately need to pay the bills if
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:32.040]  you haven't inoculated them they're going to use our dependence
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:36.600]  in the managed economy because even if you work 60 hours a week
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:40.840]  you're dependent on the government to get to get those little tax
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:45.720]  write-offs for your kids so that you can buy them clothes
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:51.160]  and take them to the movies or take them to play golf or whatever
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:53.960]  and now they're going to get rid of that and shoot them up so they can have
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:56.600]  seizures and be mentally retarded i mean
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:00.440]  they're just ghouls folks they want to hurt us
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:04.600]  and i understand it takes me a lot to get my mind around
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:08.200]  we're really dealing with demons
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:12.840]  but i've had globalist at meetings events off record on record
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:17.320]  tell me we're gonna destroy you you'll never stop us they're like villains in
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:19.800]  movies i grew up and we'll go see movies about
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:22.760]  villains and and the villain would laugh and say i'm going to get you
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:25.560]  haha here's my plan i think you know why does the
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:28.520]  villain give the plan why not just kill them why do they cackle and do all
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:31.080]  this i didn't realize that was criminology
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:34.360]  i didn't realize people like stan lee understood that they were doing these
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:36.920]  comics and that's what villains really do they really go
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:40.760]  haha i'm gonna get you here's how i did it and you didn't know it i mean i have
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:44.120]  to sit there and watch them do this and then the
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:51.480]  public's too dumb to even read what they've said or what they've done
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:53.960]  we're gonna go to break and come back and take a few calls and overdrive i've

[03:00:09.240 --> 03:00:15.400]  and the gcn radio network. Mike in Canada thanks for holding her on the air
[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:19.240]  well just wanted to uh hey alex i wanted to make uh two quick comments and a
[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:22.840]  review on x2 but two quick comments are when it
[03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:27.160]  comes to john mccain there's video footage of him saying laying on a bed
[03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:30.600]  in a cast that he broke his shoulders when he
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:34.280]  ejected from his plane we're led to believe that he
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:38.680]  he hurt his shoulders from being tortured another thing is is if you look
[03:00:38.680 --> 03:00:42.600]  at other video of the prisoners being released
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:46.760]  most the prisoners in the background are looking at john mccain with disdain
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:50.440]  and john mccain is placed nice in front and center for the camera
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:53.640]  but the guys in the background like i said none of them are smiling they're all
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:57.160]  kind of looking away and looking disgusted to be honest with you i've
[03:00:57.160 --> 03:01:00.520]  talked to some of the people i mean i've done shows years ago most of them are
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:05.160]  dead now they say he was a trustee his dad was the head of the pacific fleet
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:09.000]  and he gave away all the codes and just everything i've seen that footage
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:12.040]  when uh he's getting released after five years and they all look at him what
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:16.280]  they want to kill him uh and that's why he always says i'm no hero i'm no
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:20.920]  big i mean john mccain is a demon look at everything he's done in his life
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:27.240]  he reportedly started the fire on the forest hall i mean he is a train wreck
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:31.320]  that's why it's it's sort of strange how americans define heroes nowadays
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:35.720]  uh before when america was strong and everybody tried to model it
[03:01:35.720 --> 03:01:39.800]  they actually uh they put up heroes that didn't kill people
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:43.000]  they put up heroes that did everything they could not to kill people even the
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:47.160]  bad person you know so it's strange how now a hero is actually
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:49.720]  someone who gets the most kills like uh
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:53.240]  kyle uh the gentleman that's killed the sniper
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:56.760]  uh you guys don't really worship heroes like you used to it's it's different
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:02:01.000]  now um now my x2 review i've been trying to actually get
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.920]  get it out to you for a while um i've been taking x2 for about a year and
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:09.080]  maybe two months i stopped smoking in april
[03:02:09.080 --> 03:02:13.960]  and i had tried quit smoking before i'm 33 i've smoked since i was 13
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:17.960]  and uh i tell you when i tried to quit before i would see a cigarette on the
[03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:21.960]  street and want to smoke it now since i've been on nascent iodine and i
[03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:25.160]  didn't take it to quit smoking but since i've been on it
[03:02:25.160 --> 03:02:29.000]  and i've stopped smoking i've stopped smoking since april and i haven't
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:33.160]  touched it at all i mean my best friend quit smoking at
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:37.560]  the same time with me he's not a fan of yours but i got him on the nascent iodine
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:41.320]  and he's also not smoking let me ask you a question
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:44.520]  because it does change the whole chemical physiology when you're
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:48.600]  deficient in it but a lot of folks go through detox within two to three weeks
[03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:53.880]  did you have any detox effects that's also strange too because i i had
[03:02:53.880 --> 03:02:58.680]  nothing noticeable and if you think about it i've smoked since i was 13
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:02.120]  you'd think something would happen but what i did notice was
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:07.160]  my attitude i wouldn't get upset about certain things days didn't seem so long
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:10.120]  your monotonous schedule of over and over wasn't
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:13.640]  wasn't nearly as terrifying as it was before
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:17.400]  well i mean look without iodine you die and most the iodine's out of the soils
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:21.080]  out of the foods a lot of the seafood iodine's been contaminated
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:24.760]  and you get really pure clean iodine in your body
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:27.800]  i mean my self group said when i went on it two years ago he goes watch you're
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:31.160]  going to tan better he goes those sunspots you have a lot of those are
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:34.200]  going to go away and they did and he said he explained to me
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:37.960]  physiologically how your body and your skin needs it to even be able to tan
[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:41.320]  and that's why now i mean i barely go out the sun and i look
[03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:44.520]  you know coconut brown which i like i mean i think it looks good
[03:03:44.520 --> 03:03:48.200]  i just tan really easy really good like i did when i was a kid
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:52.280]  and it was because i was deficient but i felt like crap two weeks into it for
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:56.440]  about a week and then after it i described it like
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:59.640]  when my kids were smaller i'd put one on my shoulders to say go up a hill or a
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:01.880]  mountain and when you take them off your
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:04.760]  shoulders it feels you feel like you're flying
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:09.160]  that's what it felt like after a month was but i mean i don't want to get
[03:04:09.160 --> 03:04:11.480]  gross all this oil i never have a lot of
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:15.800]  whiteheads and stuff like that but just all just it just like just came out
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:19.160]  and i mean it was good it's it's it's dramatic and a lot of folks
