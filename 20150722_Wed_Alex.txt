[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-offs. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  Alright, here's what I want to do. Welcome, folks. Thank you for joining us on this Wednesday, the 22nd day of July 2015 transmission. Here's what I want to do.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  I want to take phone calls. And in the first hour, I want to actually go to your calls early and open the phones up for a free-for-all for first-time callers.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  On Jade Helm, on Obama announcing outside of law that he's going to go after Social Security recipients, firearms ownership, on the fiat open borders, on the meltdown in China and Greece, on the political correctness getting more and more extreme.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  On the hundreds of issues that are out there, on the Planned Parenthood videos, the latest one coming out yesterday and causing a firestorm in the real media online but almost no coverage on the controlled corporate press, where the national chairman of the committee that runs Planned Parenthood, a medical doctor haggling about the price of organs from babies.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  That chilling audio and video. Extremely ghoulish.
[00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:53.094]  We need to discuss all of this, but as a central thread, we need to also talk about
[00:01:53.094 --> 00:02:01.734]  why the ruling technocrats, the ruling social engineers want to sabotage the human condition,
[00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:08.414]  want us dumbed down and want us basically set up for a major fall. What is the end
[00:02:08.414 --> 00:02:18.094]  game strategy? Well, they are neo eugenicist or what I would call transhumanist. Now there
[00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:23.294]  is a pop transhumanist movement that sounds very, very good.
[00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:30.708]  They even have their own presidential party here in the United States.
[00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:55.548]  Led by Zoltan Istvan, and I'm not joking when I cover that headline, the US presidential candidate doesn't want to be president, he wants to live forever, and he's talking about deploying all this technology to the general public, so he's kind of like
[00:02:55.574 --> 00:03:08.714]  the good version of what the globalists have already launched. But if we can't get the public to get past the latest
[00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:38.755]  Miley Cyrus hair under her arms or Jenner's wearing a dress story, if we can't get past the latest dig up a confederate general's body and debate and discuss what's already been decided, we don't have any hope.
[00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:48.755]  But if we can't get past the latest dig up a confederate general's body and discuss what's already been decided, we don't have any hope.
[00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:16.755]  We have at its root the philosophical thoughts going back centuries and as a core aim of building technologies that will give us superhuman powers.
[00:04:17.593 --> 00:04:26.713]  The tools they believe that will empower us. The total number of members of humanity plus
[00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:32.473]  the biggest such membership organization is only 10,000. His campaign which includes a
[00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:39.593]  bus-shaped represented coffin is run with the help of a group of volunteers in California.
[00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:45.813]  So these are kind of like the porch masons. They're not on the inside but they know
[00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:51.653]  what's going on and they want access to what the establishment is building in its
[00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:56.533]  giant new world order plan that's about a hundred times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:09.173]  Oh lord won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz. My friends all have Lambos. I must make amends.
[00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:14.613]  We've established what the doctors of Planned Parenthood are. We're just haggling over the
[00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:20.933]  price. Clearly Planned Parenthood's conscience has been seared with hot iron. Now the question is
[00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:26.853]  does America have a conscience? Back in 1922 Planned Parenthood's founder Margaret Sanger made it very
[00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:31.573]  clear she was a racist eugenicist. She said we don't want the word to go out that we want
[00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:36.533]  to exterminate the negro population. The minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it
[00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:41.893]  ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members. Is it a surprise that an institution
[00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:47.893]  born out of a genocidal vision has gone full mercenary. For Infowars I'm David Knight.
[00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:57.733]  I wait for delivery each day until three so oh lord won't you buy me a color TV.

[00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:38.853]  from dead babies some people believe they can cure disease because of its enormous popularity
[00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:45.413]  Soylent Green is in short supply remember Tuesday is Soylent Green day the supply of
[00:08:45.413 --> 00:08:49.653]  Soylent Green has been exhausted you must evacuate the area
[00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:57.973]  the family court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo big builder bird group company
[00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:03.893]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we already
[00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:09.333]  know so enjoy the flavor we're going to get the real solution which is going to be a combination
[00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:15.492]  of death panels and and sales taxes i'm consistently pro-death i'm for assisted suicide i'm for
[00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:19.653]  regular zoicin i'm for whatever gets the freeway movement is spending a million dollars
[00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:25.492]  on that last three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the
[00:09:25.492 --> 00:09:31.013]  those 10 teachers and to make that trade-up in medical costs but that's called the death
[00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:35.973]  panel uh and you're not supposed to have that discussion they told me to uh to say that
[00:09:35.973 --> 00:09:40.533]  they were sorry but that you had become unreliable
[00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:52.773]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this
[00:09:52.773 --> 00:09:58.773]  to its children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents that
[00:09:58.773 --> 00:10:04.453]  kind of society will also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the
[00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:10.613]  quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult
[00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:18.373]  the scoops are on their way the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way

[00:10:53.492 --> 00:10:59.893]  and we have cleared the deck of guests yet again because there's so much breaking news
[00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:07.013]  we need to cover it all or at least try i also want to open the phones in this first hour into
[00:11:07.013 --> 00:11:11.173]  the second hour for first-time callers and then a total free for all for everybody in the
[00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:18.453]  third hour i have a tendency to get stuck covering news and basically ranting and then
[00:11:18.453 --> 00:11:24.053]  don't go to your calls in the first hour so on any issue you want to raise any question
[00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:30.533]  any comment agree disagree i'd want to hear from you if you're a first-time caller
[00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:40.613]  the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[00:11:40.787 --> 00:11:54.707]  That intro that we just played has been out for about two years. It's a intro piece put together by
[00:11:54.707 --> 00:12:05.267]  Darren McBreen here at Infowars and it illustrates the 1970s sci-fi nightmare dystopic film Soylent
[00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:14.627]  Green detailing a global environmental collapse as the oceans die and food production going to
[00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:22.387]  almost zero so that euthanized humans then become the main food product.
[00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:31.842]  And then we juxtapose it with real headlines from today.
[00:12:31.842 --> 00:12:38.742]  Four years ago I talked about how elites in Asia but also throughout the world were having
[00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:47.162]  babies melted down for their collagen for injections and for pills to be ingested and
[00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:54.402]  how they were constantly catching babies wrapped in gold foil being shipped into South Korean,
[00:12:54.402 --> 00:13:03.922]  North Korean, Chinese and other elites and how the practice of eating smoked baby
[00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:34.061]  was entering the West. Now that's mainstream news buried. That's in FBI reports, that's in Interpol reports. And they probably had, let's not exaggerate, more than 20 publications, mainly fake conservative, fake libertarian come out and attack me and say that I was insane and a liar.
[00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:34.561]  Yeah.
[00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:42.251]  Where they were meeting, I pointed out, it's been in the news recently that there's a traffic
[00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:45.251]  in baby parts around the world, powdered babies.
[00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:51.211]  Babies wrapped in gold foil, and this is the exact type of elite that is involved in that.
[00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:56.731]  And they took that and said, Alex says the Bilderberg group is eating babies in foil
[00:13:56.731 --> 00:13:58.331]  and made a big joke out of it.
[00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:03.450]  No, they're launching wars that killed over a million Iraqis.
[00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.611]  They're launching global programs where IBM computers rationed care and put veterans on
[00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:08.611]  death lists.
[00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:12.670]  They're now deploying that to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.
[00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.731]  They're launching programs worldwide where they've disarmed every population but the
[00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:18.451]  US and Switzerland.
[00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:23.690]  They're launching programs worldwide of forced inoculations that sterilize women, and they've
[00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.930]  gotten caught.
[00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.330]  It's been in mainstream Indian, African, and European news.
[00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.851]  They're busy creating weaponized flus.
[00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:39.211]  These are really villainous folks.
[00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:42.411]  And now we have Planned Parenthood, not one but two videos.
[00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:47.851]  One, their director of services, medical services.
[00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:54.290]  And then now the national director, the president of Planned Parenthood's council,
[00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.531]  their board, the head of their board of directors.
[00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:02.170]  Who else headed up the board of directors previously?
[00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:10.731]  Bill Gates's army intelligence father, who was hired by IBM, we know that.
[00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:14.611]  Back then Congress would still break up trust in the 70s.
[00:15:14.611 --> 00:15:19.771]  IBM's full wealth is behind eugenics, always has been since before the days when Thomas
[00:15:19.771 --> 00:15:21.690]  Watson was Hitler's right hand man.
[00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:30.626]  And so they created Microsoft as their front, and we are now under them today.
[00:15:30.626 --> 00:15:32.705]  Bill Gates wants to break up your family.
[00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:34.906]  He wants to forcibly inoculate you.
[00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:36.425]  He wants euthanasia.
[00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:38.465]  He wants abortion on demand.
[00:15:38.465 --> 00:15:44.626]  And you don't even hear the so-called right-wing radio ever attack him because he's too big
[00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:45.825]  to touch.
[00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:51.226]  I have been threatened specifically to shut my mouth about Bill Gates.
[00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:56.786]  His wife two years ago in Germany said, those of you out there claiming we're running a worldwide
[00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:59.665]  eugenics extermination program, better watch it.
[00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:03.146]  If you don't shut your mouth, people are going to start dying.
[00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:06.705]  And the news went, does she mean we're stopping her from saving people?
[00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:09.825]  No, it was a public death threat.
[00:16:09.825 --> 00:16:16.106]  Well, somebody's got to stand up against Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:16:16.215 --> 00:16:24.015]  But all the Confederate flag baloney, all the infighting, all of it.
[00:16:24.074 --> 00:16:31.554]  You need to understand you're idiots when you involve yourself in this infighting and
[00:16:31.554 --> 00:16:36.993]  all this mindlessness, when we're dealing with hardcore globalist that ghoulishly are
[00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:42.274]  involved in the sale of baby organs, you name it.
[00:16:42.274 --> 00:16:45.434]  I mean Apple is a monopolistic company.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:53.260]  That runs factories in China that have suicide nets around them, forced abortions and 18-hour
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.520]  work days.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.280]  But it's okay because Bill Clinton's involved and Al Gore's on their board and they've got
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.260]  guys wearing different colored socks at board meetings going, hi, we're non-threatening,
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.020]  we're liberal, oh hi, oh.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.180]  It's a total camouflage.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.100]  It's a 21st century takeover.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:20.220]  We're designed to see an enemy in a uniform coming over the fence, coming up to the drawbridge
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.380]  and to fight back.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.340]  We're designed to fight tanks, not banks.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.380]  And the banks have stolen the world's wealth, now they need to secure it and there's no
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.980]  reason to have seven and a half billion people eating into resources they've stolen.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.560]  And you can see the argument that there are seven and a half billion destructive
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.000]  people fighting with each other, dumbed down, being petulant.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  Why not just wipe them all out and start over and play God?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.840]  First by water, then by fire the Bible says, well, first by water, then by the globalist
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.520]  playing God with soft kill.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.640]  So first by water, then by soft kill, whether you believe the Old Testament Genesis or not.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:11.820]  The point is the globalists believe they're God, they're playing God, they're in control,
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.780]  they're already in breakaway civilization systems, and the decision has been made to
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.820]  accelerate to intensify the poisoning of your food and water.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.420]  The dumbing down of the weaponization of media.
[00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:35.390]  There is this giant program going on that, no kidding, is at least, I've been thinking
[00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:40.190]  about this a lot and looking at the numbers, a hundred times bigger than the Manhattan
[00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.670]  Project.
[00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:49.350]  They've spent over a hundred billion dollars in PR for global warming taxes since 1992.
[00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.070]  Look up the numbers, that's the UN's own numbers, 112 billion last time I checked a
[00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.710]  year ago.
[00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:01.030]  That's 112 billion just for propaganda, to get you to believe you're bad, you're killing
[00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:07.430]  the earth, so you accept being basically taken out, being restricted, being enslaved.
[00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:12.270]  So the toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99231.
[00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.370]  Just today, I have stacks of news going, the end of humanity is here, it's going
[00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:21.590]  to be wonderful, the end of our species is nigh, oh, humans are horrible, oh, with
[00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:27.350]  competing transhumanist propaganda, so we accept this takeover as if we're going to get part
[00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.950]  of it.
[00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.670]  We're going to be tested on, we're going to be given the leavings of all of this,
[00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:38.330]  but here it is, Wired magazine, a huge report, the Genesis Engine.
[00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:43.710]  We now have the power to quickly and easily alter DNA, it could eliminate disease, it
[00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.930]  could solve world hunger, it could provide unlimited clean energy, it could really get
[00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:48.930]  out of hand.
[00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.330]  Well, they're not going to let it get out of hand, that's what world government's about,
[00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.730]  you're not getting access, I'm not getting access, this is what shadow world government's
[00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.730]  all about.

[00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:25.210]  So, here's the big enchilada, then we're going to break, I'm coming back and checking
[00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.210]  your calls.
[00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:31.970]  I'm going to say it again, it's just an emergency alert, I've got hundreds of news articles,
[00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:39.090]  all incredibly important, incredibly entertaining, incredibly riveting, imminent mass earthquakes
[00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.970]  for San Francisco, USGS, it's all off the chart.
[00:24:43.050 --> 00:25:13.050]  But we have the future being stolen by the globalists. They think we're so dumb, they write white papers about it 50 years ago. They've done everything they said they would do so far. And the next step, it gets really nasty. The extermination of the world population. Done under the guise of natural plagues, bioweapon plagues released by shadowy terror groups that are really the globalists.
[00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:36.050]  Huge wars, food shortages, as the West gives up its liberty during the coming totalitarianism as a way of maintaining safety. And people pledge themselves to the corporate borg to do anything to have access to the life extension technologies.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:45.340]  And that's why they've got to have a total shadow world government that is above the law, diplomatically
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:51.979]  immune with unlimited taxes, 100 trillion every decade is what they're asking for day
[00:25:51.979 --> 00:25:53.060]  one.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.139]  All public.
[00:25:56.139 --> 00:26:00.659]  The elite just everywhere in their white papers just laugh and just say, try to stop us.
[00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:02.580]  We'll step on you like a bug.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.780]  And then people want me to fight with them over what color they are or that I'm close
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.219]  minded because I don't like an old Olympic athlete in drag.
[00:26:12.219 --> 00:26:14.459]  I just don't care.
[00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:21.899]  It's a weapon system to psychologically distract us from the scientific technological
[00:26:21.899 --> 00:26:24.540]  military takeover taking place.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.740]  The humans are all going to be replaced the military in the next 10 to 15 years.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:34.679]  They're going to implode the military, which has had its own problems, but at least was
[00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:37.000]  a human institution.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]  They're destroying the family successfully, they're destroying our health, they're destroying
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.600]  our physical IQ, they're annihilating everyone right now.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:51.320]  I mean, we're watching people being torn to pieces in slow motion.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.479]  And so all this other news is just window dressing.
[00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:59.620]  But just in my facts today, not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, there's
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.639]  like eight different articles announcing how ugly and bad humans are and how much better
[00:27:04.639 --> 00:27:07.159]  we'll be when we're all dead.
[00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:12.939]  That's their philosophy being projected onto us, so we lay down.
[00:27:12.939 --> 00:27:17.000]  And other articles about how, yes, they've already got life extension, but we can't
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.159]  give it to the general public.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:27.840]  I mean, why not admit what's going on, be honest, build up humanity, create giant human
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.180]  endeavors for space colonies in near-Earth orbit?
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:39.360]  Why not really empower humanity instead of keeping folks in the dark and trying to dumb
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.879]  humanity down and remove it?
[00:27:40.879 --> 00:27:44.960]  And then you look at the elites, who they are, they're very wicked, evil, hateful people.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:53.040]  And I don't know how I'm not supposed to just talk about this, because this is what's really
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.040]  going on.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.780]  Why do I call it a giant Manhattan Project?
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:03.160]  David Rockefeller, famously in 1991 in Evian, France, and this was released to the BBC,
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.580]  thanked the media for keeping their organization for world government secret and said, our
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.740]  goals would have been impossible if we would have had the light of publicity on it.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:18.340]  But now the end of the nation state and the end of individual determination is over.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.860]  And the dawn of a world government run by policy makers, international bankers is now
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.860]  here.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.860]  I mean, go read his quote.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.820]  This is a man who praised when Mao Zedong died in the New York Times, communism and
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.020]  what Mao Zedong did.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.660]  Mao Zedong killed 84 million people, if you believe the Chinese government, our government
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.060]  says 60 plus mil.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:44.420]  I mean, do you understand that this guy founded over 100 world government organizations,
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.420]  the Carnegie, the Ford, the Rockefeller foundations are all under their control.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.020]  And everything you see being done is from them.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:29:00.379]  Microsoft, IBM, all of it, everything, the global rollout, global standardization, it's
[00:29:00.379 --> 00:29:01.879]  been decided by them.
[00:29:01.879 --> 00:29:08.600]  And I guess people just want to be ruled in a sci-fi nightmare, taken over, dumbed
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.879]  down and then euthanized by these people, while they openly got drink wine and go,
[00:29:13.879 --> 00:29:21.280]  baby parts, Lamborghinis, I mean, my father was in the top six smartest people
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.440]  in Texas tested by UT when he was a junior in high school and they called little David
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:35.440]  Jones in and basically told him a bunch of this when he was 16 years old, he didn't
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.120]  even tell me about it until I was like 30 years old.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:46.400]  That's how ubiquitous this is, that even my dad almost joined this cult and never
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.560]  even told me about it.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.240]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:30:02.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network wired magazine demonstrated how 470,000 Chrysler
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.840]  Fiat vehicles, in this case, a Jeep could be wirelessly, remotely hacked and driven
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840]  into a ditch.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.580]  Of course, it'll only be five to 10 years before someone else, the government will be
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.840]  driving your car all the time.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.760]  The national highway traffic safety administration plans to issue a VTV mandate.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.080]  This vehicle to vehicle communication this year instead of 2016 as originally planned,
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.440]  these mandates will be expensive new additions for your safety.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.680]  Just like the safety systems that allowed hackers to turn off the steering, turn off
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.159]  the brakes, accelerate the Jeep and drive it into a ditch.
[00:30:33.159 --> 00:30:36.760]  Mainstream media scoffed when we talked at length about hacking a vehicle in conjunction
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.240]  with a car bomb to make it look like reckless driving when Michael Hastings was killed
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.840]  two years ago.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.620]  They will rarely use this new technology to take someone's life, but it is designed
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.620]  to take your liberty.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:53.500]  If you want to know the implications of this dangerous new control grid being superimposed
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.260]  on your life, go to infowars.com.

[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:16.760]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the info Wars lifeline because they

[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.840]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:44.280]  Introducing the all new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, experience the benefits of
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:50.240]  combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]  science.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.240]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.840]  That's infowarslife.com.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.840]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.840]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.840]  So there's a revolution against common sense.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:43.840]  A revolution against due process, a revolution against the common person's private property
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.840]  rights, your rights to live your life as you see fit.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.840]  Whether it's illegal NSA spying or the GMO crops, all of it is designed to undermine
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:59.840]  the individual and to atomize communities and to break us down so we can't stand up
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.840]  against intensified oppression that's coming.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.840]  This is the globalist system.
[00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:31.190]  And there is a giant quasi-secret planetary government being established, and people don't ask, what's the philosophy of the world government? What's the philosophy of the group involved? Well, they go, and this has been declassified, we've had insiders on, we've had historians from Congress on,
[00:34:31.210 --> 00:35:01.210]  going over every angle of it, but basically they recruit all the top test score people, all the top mathematicians, all the top writers, top philosophers from every discipline, and tell them you're smart, you're part of the elite, the general public are a bunch of scum, we're going to save the earth by bringing in a global tyranny, a global authoritarianism,
[00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:07.210]  and the leadership of it. That's very alluring, and most people go along with it.
[00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:33.660]  And that's where we are today, and then as you get higher up in it, into the 6000 superclass, estimated by the Kissinger group, and I agree with that number, then you're let into the larger design of basically total Exterminism, Luciferianism, we are gods, we are merging with the machines to transcend, and the profane do not deserve to transcend.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.359]  Thank you.
[00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:53.390]  And so we must see a falling away, a culling, and this is what Prince Philip, Queen of England's husband, talked about earlier this week.
[00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:57.390]  Another statement about getting rid of people.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.320]  Another statement of when do we start killing everybody.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.480]  A creepy 90 something year old man in a.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:16.740]  Science fiction ask military uniform but you know what I guess they kind of deserve
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:23.020]  to wear those I mean they funded the science of the total takeover they run the whole system
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:29.440]  and they put poison in you and your children's water and they make money off global flesh
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:35.339]  and organ trafficking narcotics trafficking they own Dutch royal shell with their cousin
[00:36:35.379 --> 00:36:41.740]  the queen of the Netherlands and British petroleum and they have married in with the Rothschilds
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:49.580]  it's their planet it's their club and you and I as George Carlin said ain't in it and let me
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.140]  tell you why the test scores never get better because they want us dumb we're gonna get
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:37:00.259]  stupider and stupider because the owners the owners don't want you thinking so we were
[00:37:00.259 --> 00:37:08.020]  able to interview George Carlin before he died our reporters he said no I don't buy a 9-11 looks
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.779]  like a stage to me take our freedoms but I'm done talking to you because what's it gonna
[00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:16.940]  do anyways public doesn't care next person for me to sign my book
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:23.299]  George Carlin
[00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:32.970]  He's a smart guy. His dad was one of the top PR men in New York City for some of the
[00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:37.450]  biggest publications in the country. And he grew up learning all about BS. But how do
[00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:41.850]  you then get that information to the public that doesn't want to believe it?
[00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:47.730]  And then Fox News attacks George Carlin.
[00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:53.810]  Of course, it's come out now that Saudi Arabia quarterbacked the entire attack.
[00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:58.650]  I said that within a week of 9-11, and then our government stood down bare minimum.
[00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.450]  That means they hated and abetted the attacks.
[00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:05.589]  We're proven right, yet again, because it's not as if they don't care about your lives.
[00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:11.450]  It's a religion of hating you and thinking of you as trash, thinking of you as a commodity.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:17.340]  And if you won't stand up for yourself and get aggressive, if you won't stand up for
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:22.220]  veterans being put on don't treat list and death list, if you won't stand up for unborn,
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.340]  nobody is going to stand up for you.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.120]  And I'll just say it again, the God of this universe is not going to stand up for
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.120]  you either.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.620]  It's just going to say, hey, listen, I don't know who you are.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.220]  You don't resonate with what I'm about.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.740]  Go be with other people like yourself.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.460]  Let your spirit, let your energy, let your soul go be with other people like you.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.420]  That place has a name interdimensionally.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.500]  You can use a Superman-esque thing, the Phantom Zone.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.500]  That's where you people get to go.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:03.940]  But see, they tell the general public, oh, there's no such thing as God of the devil.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.540]  But then you study globalist.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.640]  They themselves are seriously occultic to a man, to a woman.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:14.860]  And they believe they serve the God of this world, who is the real Christ, who is going
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:20.700]  to deliver them with technology and make them live forever with heaven on earth.
[00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:27.390]  They are a whacked out, eugenics, proto-nazi.
[00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:39.669]  Neo-eugenics death cult, and they have White House-run publications, you know, make jokes
[00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:43.149]  about that when I come out and I say, the U.N.'s a space cult.
[00:39:43.149 --> 00:39:49.669]  Well, my full quote was Ian Fleming Moonraker cult.
[00:39:49.669 --> 00:39:56.230]  I mean Heaven's Gate Hale-Bopp cult put on their Nike tennis shoes, took their barbiturates,
[00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:01.149]  drank their vodka, shoot it up to send their spirits up to join the flying saucer, and
[00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:06.430]  they all had chopped their genitals off, because the space aliens, one of those, chopped off
[00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:10.290]  in their fruitcake land, and then I look at what the U.N. and the globalists push,
[00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.509]  it's basically the same thing.
[00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:15.350]  We're all going to drink Kool-Aid and then go through the mothership.
[00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.589]  We're going to join with the world government, and then we're going to live forever.
[00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:19.669]  No you're not.
[00:40:19.669 --> 00:40:21.669]  It's a giant deception.
[00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:25.189]  How do you get people to join with the devil?
[00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:26.609]  To join with death?
[00:40:26.609 --> 00:40:31.410]  To join with a god that wants to kill everybody on the earth?
[00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.310]  To save the earth as you merge with machines and become gods?
[00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:40.270]  Do you think the elite are going to take this old woman, the head of the Planned
[00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:45.990]  Parenthood board, who's out haggling over bodies, drinking expensive wine, haggling
[00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:51.990]  over baby organs, getting sick looks in her eye when she talks about Lamborghinis?
[00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:59.990]  Do you really think the elite, her bosses are going to give her access to the life extension
[00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.990]  fully?
[00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.990]  No.
[00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.990]  They're going to wipe you out.
[00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:08.270]  And by the way, to the actual controllers, in your gut, in your soul, in your spirit,
[00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:14.910]  do you really think the god of this world, the old serpent, the deceiver, the betrayer,
[00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:19.509]  is going to give you this power over the earth you think you're going to get?
[00:41:19.509 --> 00:41:23.830]  You're only given limited power to bring this thing in.
[00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:30.350]  And once you bring this in, you are going to be the most despised, hated people, and
[00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.750]  it says you're going to hide under the mountains and beg for death, but you won't
[00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.750]  be able to die.
[00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:41.229]  Because, see, you didn't want to die, did you?
[00:41:41.229 --> 00:41:43.229]  Did you?
[00:41:43.229 --> 00:41:51.830]  Right here, the Genesis engine, Wired magazine, special report, it's like 30 pages long.
[00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:56.229]  We now have the power to quickly and easily alter DNA.
[00:41:56.229 --> 00:42:00.270]  It could eliminate disease, it could solve world hunger, it could provide unlimited clean
[00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.950]  energy, it could really get out of hand.
[00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.870]  By Amy Waxman.
[00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:11.549]  It needs to be specially controlled, the life extension, and then once deployed to the public,
[00:42:11.549 --> 00:42:17.770]  we'll have Trojan horses in it and it will not be the real grail.
[00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:23.189]  Because just as the elite are betrayed by their masters, and their master, they do
[00:42:23.189 --> 00:42:27.229]  the same trick to those below them, and then that group betrays those below them
[00:42:27.229 --> 00:42:33.049]  as well, as above, so below, follow your own rules, your own alchemy, and realize
[00:42:33.049 --> 00:42:34.390]  what you've done.
[00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:39.950]  You will not attain the next level of human development by trying to hold other people
[00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:40.950]  back.
[00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:47.790]  The official galactic rule that cannot be controverted, that's written on my heart,
[00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.310]  I don't believe it, I know it.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:43:05.440]  You have proven yourself to be cosmic con-ars like your father. You have proven yourself to be failures and cheats. You are failing your boot camp inspection on this Brock. You're a joke.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:13.459]  Now I said I take a bunch of calls. First time callers in this hour or the next. And as usual
[00:43:13.459 --> 00:43:17.819]  I'm not doing it because I get so obsessed with the info. But just look at these headlines.
[00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:22.240]  These super humans are real. And their DNA could be worth billions. Bloomberg. That's
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.279]  why they've been taking your blood at birth and stockpiling it and mass producing it.
[00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:29.299]  And then telling you later they've patented your DNA so you can't even have access to
[00:43:29.299 --> 00:43:35.560]  it. And yes, there are X-Men type qualities in people out there. Not like in the movies
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.140]  where you're shooting fireballs out of your hands. But people that can go underwater longer.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.580]  People that have higher IQs. People that can defeat cancer quicker. It's all there.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.779]  But believe me, that's not going to be given to the general public. You notice
[00:43:47.779 --> 00:43:52.819]  the more of this technology we get, the more sick we get. We'll get to the new transhumanist
[00:43:52.819 --> 00:43:58.100]  party and what they want. It's all coming up. The bionic eye that could cure blindness.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:07.459]  And the push for euthanasia. Dr. Death's Edinburgh Fringe 2015 show will see right
[00:44:07.459 --> 00:44:14.339]  to die campaigner gas the audience. It's like Bill Gates was releasing
[00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:15.580]  mosquitoes on his audience.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:22.140]  So right as we're told we have all this life extension, we're told that we've got to go
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.140]  ahead and kill old people because you kill grandma, you get 10 jobs as teachers.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:30.820]  No, you take care of grandma and build an economy around caring about people and now you have
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.820]  an economy.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.400]  Instead, they're removing everything where you don't have jobs, saying that creates
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.400]  an economy.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.960]  We can have any economy we want.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:45.960]  We could already have space bases on record, totally feasible, ring cities with gravity
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.580]  designed exactly like Elysium.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:53.640]  That's a 1920s Wernher von Braun design you see in that movie.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.360]  The same guy in the 30s came up with the space shuttle diagram.
[00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:04.270]  When he wasn't sitting at Hitler's knee.
[00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:06.790]  But that's what we're dealing with here, people.
[00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:08.470]  This is the issue.
[00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.230]  And this broadcast, the fact that we understand what's going on.
[00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.350]  Notice, we were talking about this before this was in the news, because they're getting
[00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.750]  ready to go more and more operational with all this.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:25.820]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls very briefly here.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.640]  We have the new formula from Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.180]  I have trouble sleeping sometimes, especially when I'm up working late and then I just can't
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.180]  go to sleep.
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.860]  Once you go past that one or two in the morning, sometimes on the road or doing coast
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.980]  to coast stay in, whatever, then I can't turn it off, can't go to sleep.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.380]  And melatonin works a little bit, valerian some, but if I took them together, I noticed
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.660]  it was a lot more powerful.
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:52.760]  So then I said, I want something called Knockout, this is over a year ago, that has everything
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:58.540]  that's known to work safely together, organic, to absolutely pole-ax somebody within an hour
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:45:59.540]  of taking it.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.420]  It takes me about 45 minutes to be uncontrollably sleepy.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:14.660]  It's got gamma, aminobutyric acid, L-theanine, power, hops, flour extract, lemon balm and
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:23.300]  leaf extract, valerian root extract, calomel flour extract, L-tryptophan, melatonin.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.460]  And it is a very good dose of each one of these.
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.660]  Consult your physicians or healthcare providers before you give it to any young people or
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.300]  teenagers.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.980]  But it is certainly a game changer.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:43.540]  It's available at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.500]  We did sell out of super male vitality.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.660]  It won't be back in for a while.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.399]  Super female is still available and basically it's the same thing, it's just got a couple
[00:46:54.399 --> 00:46:57.660]  different ingredients in it and does pretty much the same thing.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.580]  I think it works better than the super male but group disagrees.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.779]  It varies person to person.
[00:47:01.779 --> 00:47:03.480]  So that's great if you want to try it.

[00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.210]  about.
[00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:26.370]  The fact that he's been absolutely instrumental covering up and not getting P.O.W.'s returned,
[00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.630]  that's been his job all along.
[00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:28.790]  He's such a traitor.
[00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:32.990]  But they used somebody who they've sold as this hero to then betray the military, as
[00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.990]  we know.
[00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:40.090]  He's also from open borders, an anti-gunner, a total globalist, a new NASA study lays

[00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:56.910]  We had an investigative journalist on yesterday from Daily Caller who got the FBI memo and
[00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:02.470]  he's published it where it says if you do automatic wire transfers for your Social Security check,
[00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:05.290]  they're going to say you're inept and take your guns.
[00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.290]  Just any reason.
[00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:10.250]  They're now going to use the model they've used on vets for retirees and they've got
[00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:12.450]  the major retiree organizations working with them.
[00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:17.330]  So just a massive line in the sand being crossed on that front.

[00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:40.310]  They also scan the RFID on the products in your trash, which I told folks they
[00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:46.670]  would do a decade ago, and then fine you massively without a warrant.
[00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:50.870]  Feds spend $125,000 studying sexist adjectives.
[00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:54.590]  They want to basically restrict the word aggressive when describing a woman.
[00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:58.250]  You're not allowed to say a woman's bossy or aggressive or anything.
[00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:02.690]  It is sexist and is criminal, basically, if they have their way.

[00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:26.630]  And again, this whole gay marriage thing, I'm not against people individually.
[00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:28.750]  Everybody knows that.
[00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:32.510]  It's about breaking up the family and then coming in and saying you can't have single
[00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:37.310]  family dwellings and we're going to have tax increases on people that have kids.
[00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.310]  And that's what we see now.
[00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:41.670]  Can't have the name mother or father, boy or girl's hateful, you got to be purple

[00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.850]  You know, the ghost AR-15, 80% rifle kits, ghost?
[00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:06.850]  What's a ghost gun?
[00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.570]  He says, uh, duh, they kill ghosts.
[00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:09.570]  I said, really?
[00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:10.570]  Ghosts?
[00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:11.570]  He said, yeah.
[00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:15.130]  I said, matter of fact, they're guaranteed to kill ghosts, Sasquatch, space aliens and
[00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:18.070]  any other paranormal force that might come your way.
[00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.930]  So they just appropriately named them ghost guns.
[00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.090]  And I said, okay, that's a big problem in my neighborhood.
[00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:24.090]  So where do I get one?
[00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.090]  He said, guns80.com.
[00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:27.090]  I said, where guns80.com.
[00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:29.290]  Okay then I'm headed to guns80.com.

[00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.350]  It's a take over
[00:54:50.650 --> 00:55:02.650]  And so my broadcast, more than anything, is designed to get people talking about the real architecture of the global system and where it's going.
[00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:12.650]  Now I'm going to stop talking about it until the third hour. I'm going to actually get into this amazing Wired magazine article, The Genesis Engine.
[00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:16.650]  And I want to go to your calls now. Better late than never. I'm going to them, Tony and others.
[00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:23.650]  And we'll just take calls on all the different wild card issues right through the next hour. No guest today.
[00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:29.650]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Florida. Thanks for holding your the first caller.
[00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:35.650]  Hey, how you doing Alex? I want to thank you for what you do fighting the globalists on a daily basis and your team.
[00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:36.650]  Thank you.
[00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:39.650]  Thank you. I just had a quick question.
[00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:50.650]  We're seeing I'm Hispanic and we're seeing all these attacks against Donald Trump and basically these institutions that have been, you know, have built this country.
[00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:56.650]  You know, marriage, school with your kids, just everywhere. We're being attacked everywhere.
[00:55:56.650 --> 00:56:04.650]  And I just want to I wanted to ask you, do you think that we as a people in the U.S. now are in the new world order?
[00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:09.650]  Yes, yes, we are now under world government and then it just gets worse from here.
[00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:13.650]  I mean, that's the thing. People think like world governments like Star Trek, everybody's kumbaya.
[00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:20.650]  No, the new world order is the board, literally. I mean, it is the takeover of the machines and the globalist.
[00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:25.650]  And then once they have their world government in place, which is about 90 percent in place, then they ban the cash.
[00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:30.650]  Then they set up the taxes and regulations where it's impossible to be independent.
[00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:34.650]  I was talking to a banker yesterday who runs a good sized Texas bank.
[00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:41.650]  He said, you're absolutely right. Since 2008, the big banks that caused the crisis have set up stuff where we're out of housing loans.
[00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:46.650]  We're out of everything now. They're just shutting down all small banks.
[00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:56.650]  Well, that's what it is on every front. It's a consolidation, a takeover, not to just have a monopoly, but to be able to then dictate behavior to everyone.
[00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:02.650]  Go ahead. Yeah. Now it's just it's insane. You hit the nail right on the head there.
[00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:09.650]  Everything now is racist. Donald Trump's saying we don't you know, no country runs with open borders in the world.
[00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:14.650]  I'm from Cuba and they don't have gay marriage there. And here now we have it.
[00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:17.650]  And everybody's acting like it's all great and and lovely.
[00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:24.650]  But these countries that people like Obama and others want to bring us towards don't even have what we have here.
[00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:30.650]  And then they call us bad. It's it's crazy. Yeah. You can't go to Cuba as an American and have your baby for free and get free welfare.
[00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:36.650]  They laugh at you. They work people super hard in Cuba from what I've read and talking to Cuban refugees.
[00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:40.650]  But see, it's all sold as happy in a wonderland for the public.
[00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:44.650]  I mean, imagine saying you come here, we're going to give you everything free.
[00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:51.330]  It's only designed to drive down wages, but again, I don't dislike the people that are
[00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:52.330]  coming in.
[00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.530]  I realize they're being used as a tool.
[00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:56.170]  I mean, like water.
[00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.170]  I love water.
[00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:58.170]  I love a lake.
[00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:01.830]  I love to take a shower, but the tens of millions of illegals pouring in are like a
[00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:02.830]  broken dam.
[00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.530]  It can also overturn your house and kill you.
[00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:10.370]  So I don't hate water, but it's a very powerful force like a fire hose crammed down
[00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:12.070]  your throat will kill you.
[00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:16.630]  And basically, they've got a fire hose of illegal immigration and some of the worst immigrants
[00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:21.250]  you could get now shoved down our throat, blowing our guts out.
[00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.250]  God bless you.
[00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:24.910]  Where do you think it's all going, Tony?
[00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.710]  I really am not sure.
[00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:31.830]  I just told my family, hey, if we are starting to go towards Cuba, I'm just going
[00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.670]  to go ahead and move back there because we're all going to be the same anyway.
[00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:36.790]  So I'd rather go where I was born.
[00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:37.790]  I hear you.
[00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:38.790]  You may have to go to a totalitarian country.
[00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:39.790]  It'll be better than here.
[00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.790]  I was talking to a guy about that last night.
[00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:43.510]  We're back with more calls.

[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.180]  We're into hour number two. I want to take a ton of calls this hour. We've canceled
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.940]  some of the guests, so I wanted to have time to get everybody's phone calls. We're going
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.660]  to get into the latest on the police state, the latest on the election, the latest on
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:39.580]  the crucifixion of Donald Trump and what's really behind the traitor, not just the non-hero,
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:44.540]  John McCain. But for some reason, no one's going after him. For his real record, World
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:49.020]  Net Daily has published an excellent article breaking it all down. But before we get into
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.820]  any of that, I want to go back to your phone calls right now. Let's go ahead and
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:59.980]  talk to David in Michigan. Thanks for holding. Hi, Alex. I got a couple of things I want
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:05.420]  to bring up. First off, I'm about 55 to 60 miles from Camp Grayland. And we've had
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:11.260]  a lot of activity, a lot of flying over. Now we're getting Apaches coming over, Chinooks
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:16.140]  flying in formation, especially over our rivers and all our farmland up here. I'm with the
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:21.660]  Amish. I'm near the Amish. And it's just been increasingly going for the last, I don't
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:26.780]  know, 60 days now. And now they got troops that hanging out the sides on some of these
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.820]  things. And to me, they had different insignias. But it's weird about the Apaches. They're
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:36.620]  all black. No insignias on the tail or anywhere. But the Chinooks, that's all
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:42.380]  military. You could tell US. The second thing I want to bring up is all these
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.340]  estate auctions that are going on here in Michigan. We have guys that are a couple
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:51.180]  of people that we confronted that have been buying up all the rifles from all the other
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.700]  people. And we believe that they're federal agents. They're not letting the people buy
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:59.980]  guns. They're buying anything that shoots projectile. And I think that's very odd. We
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.660]  tried to confront one of the guys because he was at the same auction, different places,
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.420]  you know, in three weeks. So I don't know what your take is on that or if you heard
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:12.220]  anything. Well, I mean, we know that there have been billions of rounds of ammunition
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:16.380]  that have been bought by the federal government the last four years, over three billion now
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:23.740]  total. And hundreds of millions of them were every weird caliber, weird Mauser stuff from
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:31.580]  World War One. Forty four, forty five, thirty odd six. That's not used by NATO. It's
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.660]  three oh eight on and on and on. Just just a kit down for story about it last year.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:41.340]  Just hundreds of just every caliber you can imagine buying it up. And that's meant to
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:48.140]  drive up prices. They're also buying up just massive loads of different calibers.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.620]  They've been caught shipping them over to the Free Syrian Army.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.860]  They've been caught outfitting other groups. There's a whole bunch of weird clandestine
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:02.620]  operations going on while Obama had the last lead smelting facility in the U.S. shut down
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:08.380]  last year. And now they're restricting Chinese shipping lead in. So they're just hitting
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:13.260]  the gun industry and the right to self-defense at every level. But the big shoe to drop
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:19.100]  is the fact that we have the Daily Caller, a reporter on yesterday, the FBI memo said
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:25.420]  they're going to use the system the V.A. uses to where if you even do automatic money
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:30.380]  transfer of your Social Security check, they're going to then restrict your second amendment.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.740]  They're going to test it out and see if people get upset. But you're about to see
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.140]  if they follow the past model, tens of thousands a month of Social Security recipients,
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:43.260]  just as they did with the V.A., denied their guns. And then if that gets to be a big enough
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:49.500]  controversy, they may back off. If it doesn't, then it'll be hundreds of thousands a month,
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.860]  as Clinton did right before he left office. Now Obama has started this again. Hundreds of
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:59.100]  thousands of vets a month can't buy guns now. And they won't even tell them, just like a
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:04.940]  no fly list, why their record says that they can't have a gun. Now, the law doesn't say that.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.660]  They haven't been adjudicated mentally ill or incompetent. They're just doing it, just like
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.860]  they're shutting the power plants down or they're opening the borders by fiat.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:20.780]  This is the essence of living under a dictatorship. And we're now seeing it like like like
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:25.020]  smell-less nerve gas entering a building, wiping out our Second Amendment.
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:30.220]  It's creeping death, brother. Oh, yeah. And like I said, I see them mapping. I mean,
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.580]  there's the only reason they'd be going over this lake on this day and then the next day
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.820]  or another lake over in the same area. But, you know, a mile apart from each other,
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.060]  it's just weird. Well, look, the military is good men and women on average.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.820]  They're training them to engage us. They're training them so when they use them against us,
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:49.180]  they'll say, well, we've been doing this for years. I mean, we took guns in Katrina.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:53.420]  Big deal. We're just following orders. By the way, in the third hour,
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:57.660]  I'm going to open the phones up for folks with Jade Helm Intel. Whatever happened to Jade Helm?
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.020]  Wired magazine demonstrated how four hundred and seventy thousand Chrysler Fiat vehicles,
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:07.740]  in this case, a Jeep, could be wirelessly, remotely hacked and driven into a ditch.
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.540]  Of course, it'll only be five to 10 years before someone else,
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:15.020]  the government, will be driving your car all the time. The National Highway Traffic Safety
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:20.300]  Administration plans to issue a VTV mandate that's vehicle to vehicle communication this year
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:25.500]  instead of 2016 as originally planned. These mandates will be expensive new additions for your
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:29.180]  safety, just like the safety systems that allowed hackers to turn off the steering,
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.060]  turn off the brakes, accelerate the Jeep and drive it into a ditch. Mainstream media scoffed
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.340]  when we talked at length about hacking a vehicle in conjunction with a car bomb to
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.020]  make it look like reckless driving when Michael Hastings was killed two years ago.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:47.980]  They will rarely use this new technology to take someone's life, but it is designed to take
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.500]  your liberty. If you want to know the implications of this dangerous new
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:56.780]  control grid being superimposed on your life, go to Infowars.com. I'm David Knight.

[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:19.380]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:26.340]  The modern environmentalists are really a death cult, a power cult.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:30.100]  So they keep saying the Earth is going to collapse, you're going to starve, you're not going to
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:34.420]  have any food because of global warming, now climate change.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:38.940]  But then they move politically to shut off resources at a planetary level.
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.620]  I'm going to cover some of this at the bottom of the hour and continue with calls.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.020]  I'm going to calls right now.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.980]  Jerry Brown's climate warning, we are talking about extinction.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:49.700]  That's coming up.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.820]  This is big news.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:56.660]  House Republican Obama administration won't release full Iran deal to Congress.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:01.220]  Congress has to approve treaties and agreements.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.300]  Congress is supposed to control the purse.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:07.540]  But more and more from open borders to our power plants being turned off to executive
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:10.220]  action against the Second Amendment.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.300]  That's not happening.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:17.100]  The presidency is becoming truly dictatorial, truly imperial.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.180]  And that's what the special interests want.
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:22.900]  So we're going to be going over that report.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.900]  What's really going on with Donald Trump?
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.100]  He's right about John McCain.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:31.740]  There's a WorldNet Daily article that shows McCain covering up the POW situation.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.420]  That's why the POWs hate him.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:37.660]  The POWs that were with him at the Hanoi Hilton said he was never tortured.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:45.540]  He was kept in a nice area as a trustee, was given women, was lavish meals, and
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.580]  they just turned him into this big hero.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:52.060]  We know he's an anti-gun, open border, Keating 5, scam artist, criminal, piece of filth.
[01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:58.610]  So why isn't Donald Trump going after him on the real issues?
[01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:01.070]  They say Donald Trump is headed towards the Texas border.
[01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:04.370]  I want to send Joe Biggs or Jocari Jackson or somebody down there to cover that.
[01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:05.650]  That's going to be a three-ring circus.
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:10.410]  But why would Trump come out and say, oh, if you get shot down and get captured, you're
[01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:11.410]  not a hero.
[01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:12.410]  I don't want you to get captured.
[01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:16.589]  No, people that fly into dangerous areas and get shot down and to areas they know
[01:10:16.589 --> 01:10:20.629]  where you're tortured, that's pretty heroic.
[01:10:20.629 --> 01:10:22.750]  Trump's really savvy, really smart.
[01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:25.129]  He said that because he was getting too high on the polls.
[01:10:25.129 --> 01:10:27.209]  He was the leader.
[01:10:27.209 --> 01:10:30.929]  And he is being directed by top Republican strategists, PR people.
[01:10:30.929 --> 01:10:32.450]  That's come out.
[01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:38.730]  And Trump is really making me angry.
[01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:41.129]  And I told you I got a bad feeling about him.
[01:10:41.129 --> 01:10:42.250]  He's super smart.
[01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:45.209]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:10:45.209 --> 01:10:50.349]  And so just watch, he gets back in the lead again, he'll do more of the same.
[01:10:50.349 --> 01:10:52.169]  On purpose.
[01:10:52.169 --> 01:10:55.889]  He knows all about McCain.
[01:10:55.889 --> 01:10:58.610]  McCain is well known for all of his criminal activity.
[01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:01.670]  And...
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:08.880]  Trump has to be watched very, very closely.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.880]  So I'm going to be getting to all of that. Let me just hit this now and then to your calls because it's so important. I mentioned it earlier.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.880]  CBS News, we have a link to it with the maps up on Infowars.com.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:27.880]  USGS scientists say major quake on Hayward Fault expected any day now.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.880]  The fault that produced a 4.0 magnitude earthquake in Fairmont.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:40.200]  Early Tuesday morning is expected to produce a major earthquake any day now, and Bay Area
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.200]  residents should be prepared, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist said.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.000]  And here's the issue, the only area, and we've had seismologists and experts on, but it's
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.680]  mainstream news, it's not debated.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:12:00.040]  The only area of the Pacific Rim Ring of Fire that has not triggered in the last eight
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:05.120]  years since the tsunami started, that hit Japan and other countries, since we've seen
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:12.000]  all this devastation, just unparalleled earthquakes from India to Pakistan to you name it, just
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.680]  the entire Ring of Fire that rings the Pacific Ocean.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:23.080]  The West Coast of Latin America, the West Coast of the United States, Canada, the East
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:37.800]  Coast of Asia, Europe, Russia, unprecedented, and that trigger area from the Baja up to
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:47.480]  Seattle has not triggered, and there are more than 50 major points on that area from
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:57.400]  Northern Mexico up into Canada that have not triggered yet.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.000]  And so it's just going to go off like a string of firecrackers.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.920]  And when it does, it's two years overdue, two years overdue, and talk about sitting
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.140]  on top of a time bomb.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:16.280]  And by the way, you notice that the Ring of Fire extends inland over to the area
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:23.120]  of Yellowstone, underground with those plates, and it is rising and lowering dramatically
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.080]  in different areas of the park, and that is a super caldera, a super volcano.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.600]  The last time it erupted, it covered 80% of what is the United States in molten ash.
[01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:43.510]  So we talk about the biggest threats humanity poses to humanity in a report with Rex Jones
[01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:47.590]  yesterday, but what about the biggest threats we're not in control of?
[01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:53.510]  And then you get the Pentagon jacking around with seismic weapons they've got, which are
[01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:58.110]  declassified, that they have them, the specifics are classified, and just who knows what's
[01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:59.110]  going on.
[01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:02.830]  Basically, they have been testing magnetic systems out that are just like the movie
[01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:03.470]  The Core.
[01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:11.570]  And other films, you know, where it shows the military in Alaska testing stuff and then
[01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:14.389]  it ends up causing a huge earthquake.
[01:14:14.389 --> 01:14:18.889]  That's what Secretary of Defense William Cohen talked about in 1997 in the Army Times.
[01:14:18.889 --> 01:14:23.370]  He admitted that we have earthquake weapons, tectonic weapons, and so do other governments.
[01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:26.650]  And then you've got all the geoengineering.
[01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:31.809]  I saw a comment yesterday on Rex's video from YouTube going, of course Jones refuses
[01:14:31.809 --> 01:14:36.570]  to cover geoengineering and is covering it up, because I didn't put it in that report.
[01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:37.570]  Oh, come on.
[01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:40.330]  When are you going to cover the Federal Reserve being Private Jones?
[01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:41.330]  Huh?
[01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:42.330]  Huh?
[01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:43.330]  Huh?
[01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:44.330]  I mean, I just love these straw man arguments.
[01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:46.690]  When are you going to cover the Federal Reserve, buddy?
[01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:50.410]  I've actually had people in person confront me and I'm like, what?
[01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:51.410]  Are you kidding?
[01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:55.210]  When are you going to defend the Second Amendment, traitor?
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:02.880]  I mean, I guess mental midgets do that where they like build a straw man or they tune in
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.759]  for an hour and don't hear you cover something and so they don't know you covered it the
[01:15:05.759 --> 01:15:06.759]  day before.
[01:15:06.759 --> 01:15:07.360]  It's just bizarre.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:13.400]  Okay. That's some of the news. I want to go to your phone calls now. We're going to
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.719]  go to Cameron. We're going to go to Alex. We're going to go to Chris, Brandon, Christopher
[01:15:17.719 --> 01:15:20.679]  and others. Cameron, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:15:20.679 --> 01:15:27.280]  Hi. Hi. It's Cameron. I'm from Orange County, California. And first of all, I wanted to
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.360]  say that I know like we're portrayed as a bunch of loons kicked out here, but there's
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:38.000]  like so many of us that are awake. It's not even funny. Are you there? I'm sorry. I can't
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.400]  even hear anything. Absolutely. I mean, I'll interrupt you if you want.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.120]  Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. And I didn't know if you knew this, but
[01:15:47.679 --> 01:15:51.519]  what's his name? His name is Tony Muhammad from the Louis Farrakhan. He represents him on
[01:15:51.519 --> 01:15:58.160]  the West Coast. He's been at like a couple of different rallies for the SB277 and said that
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.480]  he's going to address it in the Million Man March coming up in October. And also,
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.879]  they're supposed to march to the CDC headquarters in Georgia afterwards.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.200]  Yeah. In Georgia to talk about this and said that they're not going to let this go through.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.839]  They're really all against this whole thing too. And I'm not a big fan of that or anything,
[01:16:15.839 --> 01:16:19.040]  but whatever it takes. No, listen, you're a great call because that's why I love taking
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.799]  calls. You bring up something I meant to say weeks ago and never covered. And I want to
[01:16:22.799 --> 01:16:26.160]  try to be smart now. People always start talking and then if I don't interrupt them,
[01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:30.400]  then they say, hey, are you there? And then I'm bad about interrupting, so I try to not interrupt.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:37.920]  But long story short, the nation of Islam puts out a lot of really great information.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:45.759]  They're a paradox because Louis Farrakhan says some really horrible things like blaming Asians
[01:16:45.759 --> 01:16:49.519]  because they come and build stores in the black community. Well, build your own stores.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.280]  And then Louis Farrakhan says, no, we should shop at our own stores and build our
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.160]  community up. I'm all for that. I don't think it's racist to support your community and try to
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:03.920]  empower yourselves by shopping locally, shopping with local farmers. But also,
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.000]  if you're in a depressed black area, you should try to support black businesses.
[01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:14.240]  So they say, support your local businesses. Create your own community. Don't take the
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.759]  inoculations. They're putting poison in it. I've read their Trumpet newspaper. It's full of
[01:17:19.759 --> 01:17:25.360]  so much good stuff. Louis Farrakhan talks about the government shipping drugs in, that's true.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:36.400]  But then he'll get up and just really push for racial confrontation when that's exactly
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.559]  what the globalists want. I mean, I hear stuff out of Farrakhan's mouth that I know
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.639]  George Soros is basically financing other people to say, and I know George Soros is really a bad
[01:17:46.639 --> 01:17:52.240]  guy. And I really know most white people are not racist. They might be uncomfortable and scared
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.160]  of black people because of the media, just like black folks get scared of cops because of the
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:01.120]  media, even though statistically you're not any more likely to be attacked if you're black
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.879]  than if you're white. I do think black people get pulled over more. That's been statistically
[01:18:04.879 --> 01:18:09.440]  proven. So there is profiling going on, but it's like this lady, they finally released the
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.000]  whole squad car video. And I appreciate your call. Great point, Cameron.
[01:18:15.519 --> 01:18:19.599]  Of this black lady who put out a video of herself up in Illinois saying I'm depressed,
[01:18:19.599 --> 01:18:24.639]  I'm freaked out, I'm having panic attacks, I'm freaking out. Well, the state police pull
[01:18:24.639 --> 01:18:31.519]  her over in Texas and the guy writes her a warning and she just blows up at him, won't shut
[01:18:31.519 --> 01:18:32.080]  up.
[01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:40.750]  He says, okay, get out of the car, then she starts running around, freaking out.
[01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:44.990]  He tries to put her in handcuffs, she resists him, and then she goes and dies in police
[01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.990]  custody.
[01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:48.870]  Now, do some of these departments beat people to death in the jail?
[01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:49.870]  Absolutely.
[01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:50.870]  It goes on.
[01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:51.870]  It's terrible.
[01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:56.610]  But if you watch the state policeman, I mean, he's a good cop, a good trooper compared
[01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:58.830]  to some of the ones I've seen.
[01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:04.150]  And the media, and they're having marches and everything else saying she was murdered, and
[01:19:04.150 --> 01:19:12.950]  then it turns out that she had serious psychiatric problems and had a victim psychology.
[01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:16.550]  And I'm not saying this is what happened, but I'd say about an 80% chance she did
[01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:23.309]  kill herself as a whole way to make herself the victim because she was already suicidal.
[01:19:23.309 --> 01:19:24.670]  But I'm not going to play the whole 14 minutes.
[01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:27.190]  The raw video is on infoawars.com.
[01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:32.870]  I sent it to Nico, so I don't know if they posted it, we should post it, but video released
[01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:36.470]  of traffic stop in Sandra Bland case.
[01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:44.309]  And I mean, she is just freaking out on the trooper, on and on and on.
[01:19:44.309 --> 01:19:49.190]  And the average out of control cop would have tasered her right away.
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:52.470]  I mean, compared to a lot of cops where they just punch you in the face for no reason,
[01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:53.470]  they need to be arrested.
[01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:56.630]  But in her case, I think she committed suicide.
[01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.309]  That's what my gut tells me, it's a tragedy.
[01:19:59.309 --> 01:20:04.950]  You know about RVs, you've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation.
[01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:10.309]  And man wasn't made to live underground introducing survivalist camps, the ultimate

[01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.130]  It's true.
[01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:07.870]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.

[01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:00.610]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:05.570]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:09.849]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're
[01:23:09.849 --> 01:23:11.330]  making it easy for them.
[01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:16.250]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:17.250]  The phone line.
[01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:22.410]  You shell out 1,500 bucks, get locked into a long-term contract and think you're safe.
[01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:26.450]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:29.930]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:10.690]  My son, Rex Jones, was in the studio live with us for the first time ever.
[01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:15.370]  He's done some tape reports over the last three years, and my daughters are here with
[01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:16.370]  me today at work.
[01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:21.170]  We're not going to show them on TV, but they wanted to come in the studio and be
[01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:22.170]  a little part of it.
[01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:24.370]  So this is their maiden voyages.
[01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:28.690]  I love you girls.
[01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:29.690]  So there are those little sweethearts.
[01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:30.690]  Thanks, guys.
[01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:31.690]  All right.
[01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:32.969]  There they go.
[01:24:32.969 --> 01:24:35.969]  They're looking through the window in here into the studio.
[01:24:35.969 --> 01:24:38.190]  And you know, that's really what it's all about.
[01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:42.930]  The globalists wish that, which they're out of the room, go ahead and close the
[01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:43.930]  door.
[01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:44.930]  I love you.
[01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:45.930]  The globalists wish they'd never been born.
[01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:46.930]  Well, guess what?
[01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:47.930]  They were.
[01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:48.930]  And they've never had any vaccines.
[01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:50.450]  They eat non-GMO almost all the time.
[01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:53.889]  It's hard to not let them eat some because it's everywhere.
[01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:55.730]  They drink non-fluorinated water.
[01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:56.730]  They're healthy.
[01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:57.730]  They're happy.
[01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:00.610]  They're full of vibrant energy.
[01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:02.450]  And I just thank God for them.
[01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:05.530]  And that's the reason I'm not backing down is my children.
[01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:08.130]  Some people will say back down, go along for your kids.
[01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:12.290]  There is no future for the species if we don't stop the globalists.
[01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:15.389]  It's that simple.
[01:25:15.389 --> 01:25:17.969]  And the Nation of Islam's got it right.
[01:25:17.969 --> 01:25:19.370]  Don't take the vaccines.
[01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:26.410]  And we need to organize these different communities around, hey, don't abort your babies, black
[01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:31.809]  people, white people, anybody, all lives matter, something the governor got in trouble
[01:25:31.809 --> 01:25:32.809]  for.
[01:25:32.809 --> 01:25:36.250]  We need to organize around realizing the vaccines are social experiments.
[01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:37.250]  We're being manipulated.
[01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:38.410]  We're being dumbed down.
[01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:40.570]  The IQ is physically dropping.
[01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:43.330]  They've been caught putting cancer viruses in them.
[01:25:43.330 --> 01:25:44.410]  This isn't rhetoric.
[01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.290]  This is real.
[01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:51.809]  This is epic, legendary, covert soft kill going on.
[01:25:51.809 --> 01:25:54.889]  And if it ever starts to come out, that's it for the new world order.
[01:25:54.889 --> 01:26:00.730]  I see a black family, a quote mixed family, white family, Hispanic family, walking down
[01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:03.290]  the street, Asians, whatever.
[01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:06.250]  I want them to be healthy, successful, happy.
[01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.650]  I want to see their art.
[01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:09.330]  I want to read their literature.
[01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.809]  I want to listen to their music.
[01:26:10.809 --> 01:26:12.330]  I want to go eat their food.
[01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:13.730]  I like diversity.
[01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:15.090]  I like different cultures.
[01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:16.769]  I like the mix of cultures.
[01:26:16.769 --> 01:26:19.090]  I believe in people.
[01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:24.250]  That's what makes me so mad when I see sicko globalists sitting there trying to get us
[01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:27.170]  all fighting with each other when they're preying on everyone.
[01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:32.610]  I mean, a perfect microcosm of this is Planned Parenthood.
[01:26:32.610 --> 01:26:35.730]  Tens of millions aborted at their hands.
[01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:40.210]  The Eugenics League basically changed their name to Planned Parenthood.
[01:26:40.210 --> 01:26:46.030]  They helped found and fund fascist movements, the Nazi Party.
[01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:53.610]  You can read their quotes and they are worshipped as the very oxygen of liberal trendiness.
[01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:56.250]  And then behind closed doors, they're like, yeah, we want to kill blacks.
[01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:58.130]  Yeah, we sell body parts.
[01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:02.130]  Yeah, we, I mean, all these tapes have been coming out for years and they're going
[01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:04.790]  to release more tapes now.
[01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:08.650]  They're warning Planned Parenthood, the new racist ones.
[01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:09.650]  Well, you know what?
[01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:12.930]  It's all racist against innocent children.
[01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:17.090]  It devalues human life to say they're black babies or they're white babies.
[01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:23.690]  But see, now that politician running for president, O'Malley, he said, no, you know
[01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:24.690]  what?
[01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:26.530]  Black lives, white lives, all lives.
[01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:28.010]  That's a classical liberal statement.
[01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:32.010]  No, they're like, no, no, because it's racially based.
[01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:36.490]  But then it doesn't even do anything for that race based group.
[01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:38.849]  It's the Federal Reserve screwing over black people.
[01:27:38.849 --> 01:27:41.010]  It's a napkin gas screwing over black people.
[01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:43.570]  It's open borders screwing over black people.
[01:27:43.570 --> 01:27:45.410]  It's the vaccines, the fluoride.
[01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:46.410]  And guess what?
[01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:48.650]  It's screwing everybody else over.
[01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:53.090]  And when you make it about one group, you limit the real scope.
[01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:54.930]  All right, I'm gonna stop ranting.
[01:27:54.930 --> 01:27:56.250]  Alex in Michigan.
[01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:58.250]  Thanks for holding your on the air worldwide.
[01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:01.290]  Hey Alex, how's it going, bro?
[01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.290]  Good, my friend.
[01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:03.290]  Go ahead.
[01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:04.290]  Your family.
[01:28:04.290 --> 01:28:05.290]  Thank you.
[01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:08.849]  I just had a question, wanted to talk to you about a few things going on.
[01:28:08.849 --> 01:28:11.809]  I like the previous caller from Michigan.
[01:28:11.809 --> 01:28:17.370]  There's a lot of spy planes here in Kalamazoo, over my area at least.
[01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:20.210]  There was a chem trail operation too, and now it's all cloudy out.
[01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:24.450]  It was perfectly sunny when I woke up.
[01:28:24.450 --> 01:28:25.450]  But I had a question.
[01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:27.930]  I'm trying to start up a small business.
[01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:30.450]  What's the best way to do that?
[01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:35.410]  You know, you gotta study your local market and see what is gonna work best.
[01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:37.330]  But a lot of it's marketing.
[01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:42.969]  One of the most successful things I've seen, if you're in the right area, is mowing
[01:28:42.969 --> 01:28:45.170]  people's lawns.
[01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:49.570]  And then once you make enough money, get people under you, have quality, respond to
[01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:54.769]  people well, customer service, and you'll have 40 people working for you in a couple
[01:28:54.769 --> 01:28:55.969]  of years.
[01:28:55.969 --> 01:28:58.410]  You'll have a headache of dealing with it, and it's a lot of work.
[01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:06.290]  But I know people that have lawn care crews, and that have gardening crews.
[01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:08.730]  People that make more money than I do.
[01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:15.389]  I mean, upper middle class, living in mansions, basically, living in six, seven bedroom houses
[01:29:15.389 --> 01:29:19.090]  with two boats and a big pool, and their kids all going to college, and they own
[01:29:19.090 --> 01:29:20.730]  a lawn company.
[01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:27.330]  I know so many people that own pool companies, lawn companies, service companies, construction
[01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:31.330]  companies that do quality work, who are doing very, very well.
[01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:32.330]  But I mean, who needs to be rich?
[01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:34.450]  I mean, the big thing is just being self-sufficient.
[01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:38.769]  And so, I don't, I mean, Kalamazoo is a beautiful area, a lot of the Dutch folks
[01:29:38.769 --> 01:29:44.210]  up there take care of themselves, but, you know, I'd have to be specific in that area
[01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:47.370]  to know what to tell you, my friend, but there's just a lot of things out there
[01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:48.370]  to do.
[01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:49.370]  We're gonna come back with more calls.
[01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:50.370]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:52.050]  Who's on the run?
[01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:55.450]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.450 --> 01:30:05.250]  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
[01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:07.969]  My friends all have Lambos.
[01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:09.490]  I must make amends.
[01:30:09.490 --> 01:30:13.370]  We've established what the doctors of Planned Parenthood are.
[01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:15.730]  We're just haggling over the price.
[01:30:15.730 --> 01:30:19.849]  Clearly, Planned Parenthood's conscience has been seared with hot iron.
[01:30:19.849 --> 01:30:23.889]  Now the question is, does America have a conscience?
[01:30:23.889 --> 01:30:27.650]  Back in 1922, Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, made it very clear she was
[01:30:27.650 --> 01:30:29.370]  a racist eugenicist.
[01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:33.210]  She said, we don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro
[01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:34.210]  population.
[01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:37.610]  The minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of
[01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:39.969]  their more rebellious members.
[01:30:39.969 --> 01:30:45.650]  Is it a surprise that an institution born out of a genocidal vision has gone full mercenary?
[01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.969]  For Infowars, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:47.969 --> 01:30:52.610]  I wait for delivery each day until three.
[01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:58.809]  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
[01:30:58.809 --> 01:31:03.969]  Introducing Secret 12, the new Infowars Life Vitamin B12 Formulation.

[01:31:31.889 --> 01:31:36.610]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth
[01:31:36.610 --> 01:31:40.450]  factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:45.730]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:08.530]  bar none.

[01:32:10.969 --> 01:32:16.530]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfowarsLife line because they are
[01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:21.530]  not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they
[01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:27.170]  don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at
[01:32:27.170 --> 01:32:28.170]  InfowarsLife.com.
[01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:33.130]  Whether it's survival shield, nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super
[01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:38.010]  female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.
[01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:43.370]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands
[01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:48.930]  of other customers that have visited InfowarsLife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:56.769]  edge, hardcore products.
[01:33:03.130 --> 01:33:20.570]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines
[01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:21.570]  of the Infowar.
[01:33:21.570 --> 01:33:48.809]  Imagine what's
[01:33:48.809 --> 01:33:55.370]  gonna happen out on the west coast if another big earthquake hits along these fault lines
[01:33:55.370 --> 01:34:00.690]  where they built nuclear power reactors and we get a new Fukushima type situation.
[01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:05.969]  In fact, up on InfowarsLife.com we have some of the photos that have gone viral
[01:34:05.969 --> 01:34:14.330]  in Japan of mutated daisies, and we have mutated butterflies and record numbers of children
[01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:16.530]  just collapsing dead of heart failure.
[01:34:16.530 --> 01:34:18.809]  That's what happens with children and radiation.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:42.169]  And their answer is just to say, oh, the radiation is safe. It's no problem. Why would they build six reactors on a fault line in a tsunami area and then say it was impossible for it to melt down? And then five of the six reactors got damaged. Three of them completely blew up. Then they covered that up.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.019]  I went and looked at the design of the MOX reactor, the big one that was plutonium and uranium that blew up, the second one to explode with a hydrogen explosion. And I went and looked at the design of it and blueprints that were online. And then I blew up the video. We put out articles back when it happened four years ago and said it appears that the entire reactor was shot
[01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:38.170]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of yards into the air. We even measured how high the communication towers were around there. We see it was three times higher. And I said it looks like it may have
[01:35:38.170 --> 01:36:08.170]  been in play. And indeed it had blown completely up. It had achieved fission, a small atomic explosion, and had shot them further than I even thought. Now I'm not bragging. It's just that the media knew what they were seeing. Physicists knew what they were seeing. Nuclear engineers knew what they were seeing. I had nuclear and chemical engineers on saying basically the same thing.
[01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:24.170]  Now there's triple the radiation in the northern hemisphere than there is in the southern hemisphere. What's going on? Why is there a death wish by the elite? Because if they don't care about little babies or veterans, they don't care about themselves.
[01:36:25.110 --> 01:36:35.990]  That's why I was haunted yesterday and last night and currently by the video of the Planned
[01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:41.469]  Parenthood National Council Director, the head of their council, the head of their board.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:46.180]  Haggling over baby organs.
[01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:58.750]  And I think about the denial where 20 years ago on air I would talk about China selling
[01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:04.350]  political dissonance organs when it was in the British news and US news would write articles
[01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:07.190]  saying I was lying.
[01:37:07.190 --> 01:37:12.990]  The State Department put out a report about 14 years ago dispelling conspiracy theories
[01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:15.630]  that there was an organ trade in China.
[01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:21.110]  The Chinese government advertises they sell political dissonance organs.
[01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:27.710]  It's in Japanese newspapers, public executions, where they then announce that minutes after
[01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:31.230]  they're killed they have their organs taken.
[01:37:31.230 --> 01:37:39.230]  Now they have mobile execution vans, 14 per major city, where they keep you alive and
[01:37:39.230 --> 01:37:46.390]  do a vivisection, removing your heart finally and sucking your blood out so they can take
[01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:50.470]  each organ properly on the runway, pack them in ice and fly them out.
[01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:53.490]  People say, why are you covering this macabre?
[01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:58.390]  Because I couldn't get people to admit it when it was in foreign news 18, 19, 20
[01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:59.910]  years ago.
[01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:04.870]  How am I going to get people to admit they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and
[01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:06.110]  fluoride in the water?
[01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:11.870]  I mean, Harvard admits it's lowering our IQs over 10 points.
[01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:14.190]  They admit it's giving us bone cancer.
[01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:17.070]  Their own scientists aren't bad at the FDA.
[01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:22.270]  They say take it out, but the elites say no.
[01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:25.270]  But we've reached a breaking point where so many lawsuits have been filed.
[01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:28.190]  They're now cutting the amount of fluoride in the water by half.
[01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:31.990]  My point is we're so close to beating these people, I can feel it.
[01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:39.510]  We've known for decades that Planned Parenthood sells baby parts.
[01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:43.870]  The problem is, chopping them up, they have trouble keeping the organs, so they mainly
[01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:50.269]  sell them for blood product, for stem cell research, and for cosmetics, the collagen.
[01:38:50.330 --> 01:39:01.530]  But now we can force a debate about this, now we can admit it's going on. Notice the
[01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:06.410]  first week this came out, they had a whole bunch of publications just say it wasn't real.
[01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:11.210]  Then when it turned out it was real, MSNBC said, big deal, it's research.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:19.400]  And now that videos are going to be released, they were smart, with them talking about getting
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:23.400]  rid of the minorities and how they're a big problem.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:27.679]  And you're going to see the real face of MSNBC and CNN.
[01:39:27.679 --> 01:39:32.519]  I predict they're going to ignore it no matter how bad it is because they can't face it.
[01:39:32.519 --> 01:39:34.840]  A vampire can't face high noon.
[01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:39.389]  Out in the town square.
[01:39:39.389 --> 01:39:42.790]  That's all I want to do is haul these people out of their pits where they want to hide,
[01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:46.110]  they want to creep out at night politically, they want to have their way with us in the
[01:39:46.110 --> 01:39:47.110]  dead of night.
[01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:50.510]  No, you're going to have it out in front of God and everybody.
[01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:54.630]  We're going to drag you out of your crypts right up in the middle of the town square
[01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:58.230]  and everything you've been doing is going to be brought out in the open.
[01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:03.110]  Because you love hurting innocent people, you enjoy it, you're ghouls.
[01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:09.410]  All these allegories, all these legends have a basis in reality.
[01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:18.110]  The Greeks 2,500 years ago in major cities would have vampire hunting days.
[01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:23.750]  Look this up and they would go out into the crypts, into the caves, into the areas
[01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:29.790]  and it was mainly psychopathic, mentally ill people who would creep around at night
[01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:34.430]  and grab folks and drag them off and eat them.
[01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:39.230]  In major Greek cities they had psychopaths that believed they were vampires that would
[01:40:39.230 --> 01:40:44.550]  do this and people would go out and hunt them and kill them.
[01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:50.110]  Now these people run Planned Parenthood and if you go out to an abortuary and they
[01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:54.269]  know you're going to be there, people in black will arrive with totally white skin,
[01:40:54.269 --> 01:40:57.910]  if they're black they look like vampires, they're totally white and they literally show
[01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:04.309]  up and start going because that's who they are.
[01:41:04.309 --> 01:41:08.349]  And I know it sounds over the top but I'm telling you folks, I'm telling you they're
[01:41:08.349 --> 01:41:10.790]  possessed demons.
[01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:16.910]  And people over at the White House run publications, go ahead and make your jokes all day.
[01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:22.309]  People know what I'm saying is true, look at the Texas house, I talked about it yesterday.
[01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:26.710]  Last year we're trying to pass a bill or two years ago, the last session, they're
[01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:29.349]  back in session now, they were trying to ban.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.080]  Partial birth abortion.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:39.120]  But those are the prizes where you get all the organs, you know, babies that could live.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:44.519]  And just spontaneously, dozens of women started hissing, I love Satan, Hail Satan, and sticking
[01:41:44.519 --> 01:41:46.719]  their tongues out and hissing like snakes.
[01:41:46.719 --> 01:41:51.200]  I don't know what's going on, folks, but I can't handle it anymore.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.040]  These people literally crawl out from under rocks, they run and hide in trash cans right
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.040]  in front of you.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.639]  Why are we ruled by a bunch of trash can dwelling vampires?
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:08.059]  The one guy that grabbed my microphone and attacked me and all that, literally had the
[01:42:08.059 --> 01:42:12.480]  lightest skin I've ever seen, everybody said that guy looks like a ghoul, like a vampire,
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:16.580]  and he wasn't acting, he was bumping into people, it was like he wasn't even alive, and he
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:21.900]  was just, had this satanic look in his eye, he was going, ugh, ugh, ugh, I mean what
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:26.540]  do you expect to be attracted to a place where they're butchering babies, while we were
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:31.380]  outside, women were driving in to have their babies killed, so of course showing up to
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:38.260]  defend it is the demons, don't you understand it's not a game, I don't know whether it's
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:42.139]  inter-dimensional creatures, whether it's demons, whether it's some kind of mental
[01:42:42.139 --> 01:42:47.460]  illness, whatever, there's still a demon, whatever it is, they gotta be dealt with.
[01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:55.929]  In ancient Greece, those folks would be hanging out in the caves and, you know, I guess they
[01:42:55.929 --> 01:42:57.929]  had, I just can't even handle it anymore.
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:05.220]  I had like green skin.
[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:07.420]  My dad calls those people glow in the dark people.
[01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:14.050]  And I've seen this over and over again, our enemies literally have green skin.
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:19.020]  I mean, they love death, they love their father.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:24.400]  And so good, go have death, go jump off a cliff, don't hurt anybody else, just get out
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.400]  of our way.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:29.880]  We want to get off the planet, we want space bases, we want clean energy, we want to maintain
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:34.660]  human dignity, we want to maintain goodness, we want to be honorable, we don't like the
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:35.660]  devil.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.900]  We don't want to be around you.
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.460]  I'm sorry, let's go to calls.
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:45.360]  We've got Froggo in England and Chris in Georgia and Brandon and Christopher, let's go to Froggo
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.360]  in England.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.580]  I mean, I don't mean this show to turn into a complete preacher fest.
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:50.580]  I'm just so freaked out.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:52.660]  I'm just telling you what's on my mind.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.340]  Go ahead, Froggo, you're on the air.
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:57.380]  Hi, preacher.
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.580]  Welcome, your Skype or whatever it is is breaking up.
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:01.580]  Go ahead.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:04.620]  Oh, I'll get closer to the source.
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.620]  Any better?
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:07.620]  It's okay, go ahead.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:13.500]  I'm going to put you on hold while you try to fix it.
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:14.500]  We're going to come back to you.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.500]  I want to hear from you.
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:16.500]  Chris in Georgia.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:17.500]  You're on the air.
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.700]  All right, brother, go ahead.
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:24.740]  So interesting thing happened this morning.
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:29.500]  I thought the whole Marine Corps thing was like the just one cracked out mess head that
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:30.940]  decided to go shoot Marines.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:36.460]  So then when you guys reported that it was nationwide threats or whatever, I decided to
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:39.700]  go to my local recruiter's office this morning.
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:45.540]  And so I show up and I'm not outwardly showing any weapons or anything like that.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.860]  And then there are some Marines outside and I asked them if they'd seen any oath keepers.
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.140]  They put out a national call or anybody like that.
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.500]  And they're like, yeah, one person or something.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:45:00.680]  And the guy told me the, I guess the head of Marine recruiter told me that the Marine
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:08.560]  Corps recruiting command put out a directive today that if anybody shows up armed to protect
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:14.440]  the Marine, that the Marine recruiter in charge has to call the local police, file
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:20.560]  a police report, call the Army Corps of Engineer and turn those people into them
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:25.680]  for trespassing on federal property with guns and press charges.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.600]  And there's a bunch of other paperwork that they have to do.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.840]  So the Marine Corps is pushing back real hard when, at least at the local level here in Georgia,
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:38.160]  it shows on the local news, you know, the Marine recruiters or whatever branch, the recruiters
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:41.240]  coming out and taking pictures with everybody and they appreciate it.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.520]  But at a federal level, they're pushing back really hard.
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:50.120]  I had a few opinions about it, but this is huge news and I believe you sound very credible.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.520]  The Marine Corps, I guess under Obama, thinks it owns these Marines and thinks they're
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.720]  allowed to just set them out there as sitting dogs.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.040]  We've confirmed threats pouring in all over the country, especially.
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:06.840]  But if it's a shopping center and it's an open carry state, and if the owner of the
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.880]  shopping center is cool with you sitting across in the grass, you know, or whatever,
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.720]  and protecting it, then I don't see how that could happen.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.760]  But that's amazing.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.640]  Don't even threaten them with trespass.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.720]  I guess they want to get these patriots in jail as fast as possible.
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:21.920]  That is just incredible.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.800]  Was the Marine, was the head Marine that you talked to upset by this or did he love it?
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.720]  No, he was not.
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:35.280]  Well, he was real, you know, I guess you see it a lot and then federal employees don't
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280]  care.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.280]  Yeah.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.920]  He was like, you know what I asked, I asked him, I said, Hey, do you mind these
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920]  people coming out?
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.920]  Do you appreciate it?
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.920]  Do you not want them here?
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.400]  And he was like, you know what?
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.000]  I just don't want to have to call the police.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.240]  And I really don't want to do paperwork.
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:51.040]  He said, if anybody's going to come shoot, they're going to come shoot.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:54.960]  So what a cowardly resigned attitude.
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:55.960]  Yeah.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:59.240]  And you know, I have a, I have a couple of feelings about it.
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:07.560]  At least at a federal level, there is a possibility that the next crisis could be averted by
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:15.640]  Americans carrying weapons as opposed to the next crisis used to stop Americans carrying
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.640]  weapons.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:17.640]  You just said it.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:20.480]  They want more of these to happen so they can blame the second amendment.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.460]  They have a major stake in demonizing common sense.
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:27.860]  They don't want a Patriot to stop a crazy Islamicist.
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:30.860]  And so that's, they're already upset about Garland.
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:34.300]  They're upset by the response of citizens wanting to protect these facilities.
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:35.380]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:36.380]  Go ahead.
[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:39.020]  Let's, let's spit ball it for a second.
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:43.180]  What happens if it were a nationwide threat?
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:48.020]  There was another attack and an oath keeper, somebody stopped it.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:50.540]  What would happen is that makes the oath keepers heroes.
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.060]  That makes the second amendment a hero.
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:53.720]  And they don't want that.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:59.220]  And even further, when was the last time Americans walked away from their, uh, you
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:04.180]  know, good employment, good, hardworking Americans dropped what they were doing and
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:10.140]  picked up a gun for a common cause, because I can tell you 76 oil.
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:11.200]  That's right.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:18.100]  And if that were to happen and soccer moms and businessmen and, and college students
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:22.780]  all showed up at recruiting centers and national guard centers, at least outside metropolitan
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:28.980]  areas like Atlanta, you would have thousands of armed people easily, quickly, I mean,
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.220]  within an hour.
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:32.100]  And what would those people think?
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:36.500]  They would immediately understand the power that they hold.
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:42.260]  And you know, even if nothing happened, okay, the next, the next national emergency
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:45.060]  that happened with those people say, where's the national guard?
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:48.060]  No, they'd say, well, hell, we can all go down there.
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:52.420]  We have more people than the national guard.
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:55.780]  You need to have your own radio show, bro, the way you just crystallized that boiled
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:56.780]  it down.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:00.380]  So simply succinctly with pure rational knowledge, and then I'm up here bumbling
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:02.560]  around trying to explain it exactly.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:07.100]  That's why they don't want the troops armed themselves because it's this idea that, well,
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.280]  then citizens can be their own security.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.900]  And then that ends the need to take all of our freedoms to counter these manufactured
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:14.900]  threats.
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:20.460]  You got to take this little piece that you just put out live and post it with a title
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:28.700]  saying the mystery of why they want the recruiting centers disarmed revealed and explain why
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:31.640]  this could become 1776 part two.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:40.060]  It all began in Mitricon, one state in Mexico, where just a few farmers fought back
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:45.300]  against having their employees killed at lime farms.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.820]  And then that spread all over the state and to other states till the army came in and
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:53.640]  disarmed them because the army works with the drug dealers openly in Mexico.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.660]  And it's the same story.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:00.120]  Just one person stands up and then defeats the enemy or even is defeated.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:05.180]  It doesn't matter that act of defiance is infectious and they don't want that humanity
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:06.180]  there.
[01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:08.820]  It's why they're getting rid of contact sports, why they're getting rid of dodgeball, why
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:13.140]  they're getting rid of tag while they're arresting kids for their free speech is to
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:19.720]  just create total ninnies that will submit to anything and everything for total enslavement.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.500]  So Chris, excellent points.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.860]  I really appreciate you doing that.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:24.980]  And you're a citizen journalist.
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:28.040]  You ought to go back with a camera and see if they'll talk to you because we can't
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:29.040]  do it all.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.980]  We need articulate, smart folks like you to be out there in the info war.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:34.380]  So great job, Chris.
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:38.220]  You took the first step, went out and talked to folks, discovered huge news.
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:43.340]  We're going to get on this case now, finding out if you're in the military and you have
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:49.100]  one of these orders and it's not classified telling you to call the police on folks that
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:53.100]  are coming to try to give you security, please send that info to show tips at info
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.100]  wars.com.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:56.460]  We are all in this together.
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:59.580]  We're all on team humanity.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:03.860]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US politicians
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:06.620]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:08.180]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:11.780]  Firm your American body at infidel body armor.com.
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:14.420]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:17.220]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:32.900]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:34.460]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:37.260]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:39.500]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:43.380]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:44.380]  case.
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:48.180]  Call 800-34-NOTAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:03.700]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.700]  It's true.
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.420]  Our municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.900]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:15.580]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:21.620]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines,
[01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:27.700]  pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:28.700]  more.
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:32.220]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:37.760]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last for years at less than two
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:39.260]  cents per gallon.
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:43.780]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:45.520]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:07.620]  It could be making you its next victim right now at the gas pump, bank or store where you
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.180]  shop with your credit card.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:13.940]  Bad guys with RFID scanners can peer into your wallet or purse from a short distance
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:14.940]  away.
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:19.700]  Stealing information from your RFID enabled credit or debit cards, passports, room keys
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:22.900]  and ID cards without you even knowing it.
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:27.460]  Stop the bad guys now with an RFID blocking wallet from ID Stronghold.
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.580]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID blocking industry over 10 years ago.

[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:58.060]  IDStronghold, the original RFID wallet company.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:30.180]  Break the trance, pull back.
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:35.540]  The globalists are a scientific technological group of parasites using high-tech systems
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:38.300]  of control on the population.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:44.100]  They are the vampires, the social vampires, the psychic vampires, the cultural vampires
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:49.380]  waging war on anything free and independent and anything that is self-replicating that
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:51.720]  they don't control.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:56.400]  It is a great monopoly that they are bringing to the fore.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:00.580]  And when you pull back from that with all these mounting problems, you can see them
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:04.080]  engaged in classical divide and conquer.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.920]  Are we smart enough to transcend this?
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.040]  Because once you know you're under attack, you're not worried about looking cool before
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.040]  your neighbors anymore.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:15.920]  You're not feeling insecure because you don't have the new truck.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:23.760]  All the Madison Avenue, PR, Wall Street, Hollywood brainwashing.
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:26.800]  You realize it's about taking care of yourself, your family.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:27.960]  It's about being strong.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.740]  It's about being independent.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:33.200]  It's about having a mission-based life.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.440]  That's what's fulfilling.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.640]  Third hour, jam-packed with the news coming up.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:44.220]  We'll go to Brandon in Alabama, Christopher in Colorado, John in Wyoming, Mike and so
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.340]  many others.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:49.540]  But I wanted to bring Weldon Henson in here briefly, because we have a great sponsor.
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:55.700]  And boy, I've sure been enjoying the firearms that I've gotten from them, hdfirarms.com.
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:58.540]  That's head down firearms.
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:04.460]  They have super high quality 223s, 308, you name it.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:13.260]  It's called 556, technically, in the 223 that are guns that would be $3,000 or $1,500.
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:16.900]  Guns that would be $1,500 or $900, and even lower.
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:23.580]  But I never really talked about everything else they've got at hdfirarms.com.
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:24.580]  You can just call them.
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:27.380]  They can ship the gun right to a dealer in your area, or ask your dealer to order
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.380]  some of them.
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:29.460]  You can see them there.
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:30.460]  They're patriots.
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:32.060]  They're involved in the Second Amendment.
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:35.020]  They're involved nationally, lobbying to defend the Second Amendment.
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:39.920]  This is the type of firearms company you want to support, plus it's the highest quality.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:40.920]  And they support this broadcast.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.340]  It's a 360 win.
[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:49.820]  But separately, they've got a bunch of super high quality customization services, holsters,
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:51.220]  accessories.
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:55.820]  Weldon Henson, tell us about some of the great accessories available at hdfirarms.com.
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:00.020]  Well, the important thing to remember is that if you're not in the market to buy a brand
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:05.580]  new rifle, you have an AR-15, you have an AR-10 platform, 308 rifle.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:07.360]  They've got everything you need to upgrade it.
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.660]  Buy a new part, buy a new trigger, buy a new muzzle brake, buy a new handrail.
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:14.780]  It's all an upgrade for your rifle, because these are all superior, top-of-the-line quality
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:17.140]  products made in America.
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:18.140]  That's another point.
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:21.960]  I mean, there's literally, it's got to be close to 100 different products, plus they
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:24.200]  don't call it a ghost or a stealth.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:29.620]  They use the special forces term for being able to buy most of the firearm, except
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:30.900]  for the lower receiver.
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:33.280]  Tell folks about their low profile series.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.420]  They just came out with these, what we call Project Lowepro do-it-yourself rifle
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:38.420]  kits.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.420]  Basically, you buy this whole kit.
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:41.980]  It's got everything you need besides a lower receiver.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:43.980]  It's up to you how you want to get your lower receiver.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:47.940]  There's all certain ways to do that, but you basically get a brand new rifle right
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:48.940]  here.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:50.740]  Save money, do it yourself, put it together.
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:54.180]  Find your own lower receiver so it's not traceable, whatever you've got to do.
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:56.700]  This is a complete package, and it's top-of-the-line quality.
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:00.540]  So it's not confiscatable, because we know they're doing that unlawfully now.
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:01.540]  They're specially announced.
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:03.780]  They're going after the Social Security recipients.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:07.280]  If you take an automatic transfer, they're going to claim that you've advocated your
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.080]  responsibility as a fiduciary and take your guns.
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:13.160]  Also with disabled veterans, they're trying to take their guns as well.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.160]  Absolutely.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.380]  I've been telling you, the main assault of the Second Amendment is here.
[01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:22.320]  Get these high-quality firearms before the next rush starts, or they may just confiscate
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.400]  guns by stealth, and we just give up.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:28.440]  I mean, I guess that's because we're here ringing the alarm, hdfirearms.com.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:31.800]  Weldon, do five more minutes with us, then we're going to come back and take calls.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.920]  But I want you to talk about some of the other accessories and their new .308 that I tell
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:36.920]  you is a true beauty.
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:38.760]  Well, that one came in yesterday.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.240]  I was actually pretty jealous about that.
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:41.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:42.240]  Well, we're going to go to the break, and we're going to talk about it.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.240]  Stay right there.
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:48.920]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:23.960]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:29.000]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.800]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:41.040]  new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:59:48.200 --> 02:00:04.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.679]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.679 --> 02:00:10.679]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.679 --> 02:00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:23.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:25.920]  We knew it was coming.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:27.559]  Incremental gun confiscations.
[02:00:27.559 --> 02:00:32.000]  How tyrants always operate, they target the old, the vets.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:39.040]  They've already been using a VA system to confiscate guns with no evidence, no reason.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:42.040]  Now they admit in the LA Times they're moving with that model.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.880]  We had the reporter on yesterday that broke it all at the Daily Caller two weeks ago.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.840]  And they're now coming after four-plus million retirees that they say fit the bill to have
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.400]  their guns taken.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.240]  Weldon, now is the time for people to get accessories.
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:02.160]  Now is the time for people to get backups, to get extra parts.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.679]  Tell us more about the Low-Pro Low-Profile series from HDFirearms.com and some of the
[02:01:07.679 --> 02:01:08.840]  other accessories available.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.160]  Well, this is an important thing to have.
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:13.400]  You know, this is untraceable.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:15.179]  Anybody can get this kit right here.
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:18.380]  You don't have to go through a federal firearms license place.
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.380]  You can have it shipped right to your house.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.380]  This is what the traders have been trying to shut down.
[02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:23.380]  Absolutely.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:24.380]  Absolutely.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:26.860]  So you basically have everything you need besides a lower receiver because that's what's
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:30.700]  stressful, that's what's serialized, and that's what the federal government's after.
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:32.880]  But you can get this right here.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.660]  Get your own lower receiver any way you want.
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:35.660]  There's different programs.
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:39.320]  All you gotta do is your own research and you can find out how to get a lower receiver
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:41.019]  so that you can put it on this.
[02:01:41.019 --> 02:01:44.660]  Maybe you already have a lower receiver from an AR from way back that you just don't
[02:01:45.139 --> 02:01:46.139]  quite use anymore.
[02:01:46.139 --> 02:01:47.139]  It's old, something like that.
[02:01:47.139 --> 02:01:48.139]  You can throw it on this.
[02:01:48.139 --> 02:01:51.059]  You basically have a brand new rifle and you save money by putting it together yourself
[02:01:51.059 --> 02:01:53.660]  and buying this kit right here, which is cheaper than the actual rifle.
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:57.300]  And they've got the highest quality barrels, the highest quality triggers.
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:58.300]  We're not just saying that.
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:01.580]  Go look at the third-party reviews.
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:04.099]  This is not hype when we talk about their 5.56.
[02:02:04.099 --> 02:02:09.059]  Now tell them about the new rifle they're producing that's getting amazing reviews.
[02:02:09.059 --> 02:02:11.980]  And then I just got one, this .308.
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:13.620]  Yes, that is very...
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:14.620]  Arcadius.
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:16.580]  That's very exciting.
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:20.540]  They just came out with their own line of AR-10 platforms, which is basically an AR-15,
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:24.340]  but instead of it being a 5.56, it shoots a .308 round, which I know you personally
[02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:25.900]  like shooting a .308.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:26.900]  I like them both.
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:29.380]  I mean, just to be clear, they've always, for years, been making this for the big
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:31.059]  manufacturers, the high end.
[02:02:31.059 --> 02:02:33.660]  They're just now not private labeling, they're putting out their own guns.
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:34.660]  Yes.
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:37.860]  Well, the one they send you, I'm actually jealous of, is a beautiful gun.
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:42.639]  It's set up and configured for long-range shooting, marksmanship-type things.
[02:02:42.639 --> 02:02:44.340]  It's right here in front of us.
[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:47.300]  Just the scope alone is something to snuggle with.
[02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:53.220]  Yeah, it's a Vortex 4x16 scope, which you can get at Head Down as well, their distributor.
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:57.099]  And things for people to remember is that if you want a .308, you don't have to get
[02:02:57.099 --> 02:02:59.660]  the 18-inch barrel, you don't have to get the 22-inch barrel, you don't have to
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:01.580]  get it set up for marksmanship.
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:04.740]  You can get one with a 16-inch barrel that's set up for more of an assault weapon-type
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:07.500]  configuration.
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:11.840]  So anything you want, people just call Head Down, you can get anything you want made there.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:16.320]  And any configuration you might want on your rifle, they're able to do that.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:20.360]  And they have 100% perfect customer service ratings there.
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:21.360]  It really is amazing.
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:25.360]  And again, they support the broadcast, so this is where folks should get their high-quality
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:35.960]  5.56 or .308, or their basically stealth, low-pro-type systems, triggers, accessories,
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:41.040]  you name it, just the highest quality, cutting-edge, battle-tested, a lot of major units are
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.139]  actually using this as special ops, so they're continually getting feedback and upgrading
[02:03:46.139 --> 02:03:47.519]  what they're doing.
[02:03:47.519 --> 02:03:50.480]  When you buy these products, whether it's the rifle or just some accessories, it's
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:54.240]  superior craftsmanship and it's competitive pricing.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:59.080]  You can't get these type of products anywhere cheaper, you know what I mean?
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:03.059]  They basically have the most competitive pricing and it's superior craftsmanship and it's
[02:04:03.059 --> 02:04:04.360]  all made in America.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:08.519]  Two things right here that I have that's simple that you could upgrade your AR-15
[02:04:08.519 --> 02:04:10.639]  or your AR-10 at home.
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.800]  It's a PVX muzzle brake, it's one of the top-of-the-line things you can buy for your rifle, helps with
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.860]  the muzzle rise, gives it more accuracy, simple, put it on there, it works.
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:23.160]  This is a head-down-developed and designed single-stage trigger.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:27.380]  You can get it in a three-and-a-half-inch-pound or a four-inch-pound trigger, and I dropped
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:31.360]  one of these in one of my old AR-15s that I use to just, it's what you call a truck
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:35.280]  gun, you just beat it up, I've had it forever, I also have a head-down rifle, which
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:40.280]  I love even more, but I dropped this in it, it shot like a dream, just dropping this trigger
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:41.280]  in.
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:47.960]  Bottom line, it's not just firearms, a ton of accessories, very affordable, and it supports
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:48.960]  the Infowar.
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:53.760]  If you're not shopping at HDFirearms.com, you're not helping the Infowar, I mean,
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.760]  this is a win-win.
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:59.240]  Thank you all for your support, check them out today, thank you, Weldon.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:03.680]  Economic upheaval has enveloped the European Union this year as a result of bailout practices
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:07.400]  that have done nothing but make these countries more insolvent, while French President
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.680]  Francois Hollande has proposed a solution.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.559]  He recently suggested that every member of the Eurozone transfer all their sovereignty
[02:05:13.559 --> 02:05:15.280]  to a newly created federal government.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:18.000]  In other words, it would essentially be a United States of Europe.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.120]  The government would have a prime minister, a parliament, a federal budget, and a federal
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:22.120]  treasury.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:23.120]  That's a pretty good suggestion.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:27.040]  Since your original Eurozone bureaucracy and parliament didn't do anything to help these
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:31.080]  financial crises, except make the banks richer, let's create another big bureaucracy
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:34.639]  that we can feed money into, therefore kicking the can down the road just a little
[02:05:34.639 --> 02:05:35.639]  bit farther.
[02:05:35.639 --> 02:05:38.760]  Michael Schneider notes that during times of emergency, the elites are often able to
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:43.120]  push through things that they would never be able to accomplish under normal circumstances.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:47.900]  And for those of you keeping score, a year ago, the euro to dollar ratio was 1.35.
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:49.840]  Today it's come down to 1.08.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:52.480]  Clearly the European Union is faltering.
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:58.880]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars Nightly News and Infowars.com.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:05.000]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000]  of silver.

[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:03.160]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:04.639]  and enhance overall health.
[02:07:04.639 --> 02:07:10.280]  Introducing the new InfowarsLife.com, Oil of Oregano Formulation, a highly advanced
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:15.000]  nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.200]  for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:22.440]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:28.480]  sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:31.320]  extracted directly from the wild herb.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:35.719]  And sealed in easy to use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning
[02:07:35.719 --> 02:07:37.760]  of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:41.559]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the
[02:07:41.559 --> 02:07:44.240]  most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:48.599]  This winter season is more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of
[02:07:48.599 --> 02:07:49.599]  oregano.
[02:07:49.599 --> 02:07:54.440]  Now available in our limited first run at InfowarsLife.com, that's InfowarsLife.com

[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:24.639]  Well, this music isn't fitting for Planned Parenthood caught in the second video with
[02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:31.000]  their national director, the chairperson of their board of directors.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.400]  Talking about how she wants Lamborghinis and wants the lowest prices on baby parts
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:44.480]  for sale while she drinks wine and cackles and looks like a vampire queen.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:47.120]  It just illustrates the truth that's stranger than fiction.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:49.559]  And it's everything I've been telling you.
[02:08:49.559 --> 02:08:54.040]  You got to get out of these fake churches, get out of your houses, turn off the American
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:59.680]  Idol or whatever is on TV now and go out and engage the globalist and you will run
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:03.160]  into the lowest forms of scum.
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:07.240]  So you just want to go have your own life and don't want to run anything.
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:09.420]  They do and they're in charge.
[02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:12.320]  And now they're announcing they want to get rid of our free speech.
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:14.680]  Now they're announcing that our kids belong to them.
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.480]  No, no, no.
[02:09:16.590 --> 02:09:21.790]  Yeah, if the cops pull you over, and they're not trying to take you to a FEMA camp in the
[02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:26.310]  future, it's best to just comply, even if you disagree with the unconstitutional laws
[02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:27.310]  or whatever.
[02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:31.790]  Because the average cop isn't a terrorist, isn't a bad person, and if you get in a fight
[02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:35.070]  with them, you're going to end up going to jail, getting killed.
[02:09:35.070 --> 02:09:37.750]  Even if you kill them, they're going to hunt you down.
[02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:43.950]  It's pointless, but when it comes to not complying with the schools, trying to forcibly
[02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:47.990]  inoculate your kids, when it comes to the system trying to put fluoride in your water,
[02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:51.750]  when it comes to the system trying to bankrupt our dollars, trying to get rid of cash, and
[02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:55.790]  trying to get rid of our jobs, that's the real assault.
[02:09:55.790 --> 02:10:01.670]  So they want us to instead, with the Ford Foundation and others funding it, and Soros,
[02:10:01.670 --> 02:10:06.430]  make the whole revolution about rioting and attacking local police, because that'll just
[02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:08.670]  destabilize things further.
[02:10:08.670 --> 02:10:13.990]  Now at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go into a complete news conniption.
[02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:17.230]  There's probably, let's not exaggerate, probably 100 articles I haven't gotten, I've probably
[02:10:17.230 --> 02:10:23.630]  covered 50 already, and I said I'd get back into this big Wired magazine article about
[02:10:23.630 --> 02:10:30.030]  well, we can't let the public have the life extension, who will get it?
[02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:34.310]  So there's that whole debate, and by forcing a debate about this, it's the beginning
[02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:39.590]  of the end of the globalist using national security and global security to keep all this
[02:10:39.590 --> 02:10:41.670]  stuff secret for themselves.
[02:10:41.670 --> 02:10:48.830]  So that's why we're here exposing it, just like four plus million in the FBI memo are
[02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:54.750]  set to now have their guns taken, and they're using the VA program of secrecy to
[02:10:54.750 --> 02:11:00.270]  take veterans' guns now for Social Security recipients.
[02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:03.190]  And I can't believe I'm not even more freaked out.
[02:11:03.190 --> 02:11:09.030]  We should send out Jacari Jackson or Leanne McAdoo or Darren McBreen or John Bowne or
[02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:16.710]  Rex Jones, whoever, one of our reporters, to go out in Austin and say, hey, now here's
[02:11:16.710 --> 02:11:19.590]  the FBI memo, here's the Daily Caller article.
[02:11:19.590 --> 02:11:24.470]  It says that if you take a money transfer, a direct wire of your Social Security, that
[02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:28.230]  means you must be inept, you're incompetent to own guns.
[02:11:28.230 --> 02:11:29.510]  No judge, no jury.
[02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:32.350]  The 68 Gun Control Act says you're a felon or mentally incompetent.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:37.280]  It's not in the law, they're just doing it.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:39.800]  That's why it's so dangerous, it's such a big deal.
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:47.560]  ATF works with the FBI and VA to get veterans' guns taken away.
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:53.600]  I told you it was coming, and the old people are dependent on that check, so they think
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:56.960]  they're going to call them up and go, hi, this is the ATF, and I've had the ATF call
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.400]  me before, this is how it works, we'd like you to come down to our office and we'll
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:07.720]  drop by over there, we want to discuss a firearm with you, and then the ATF shows
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:14.400]  up, and I was not rude, and I was like, well, ATF busy these days?
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:15.400]  We're the B-ATF!
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:23.320]  I was like, whoa, dude, don't bow up to me, and they had some other guy casing around
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:28.200]  in the parking lot, while this was going on with these vets gone with their guns already,
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:32.840]  and then another time at the gun show, the ATF walked up to me, I let her talk to
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:38.040]  me, I was like, oh, that's the ATF, and I was like, Jones, we're so sick of you, and
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.800]  they had some other guy pop up and go, hey, Alex, buy this gun with me, I don't have
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:46.680]  my license, buy it, buy it, buy it, and I saw ATF, and I was like, I'm not going
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:50.600]  to do that, and I looked and was ATF just waiting, that's what it's like if I go
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.200]  to the gun show, it's just ATF, they'll even come over and bow up.
[02:12:55.470 --> 02:13:04.730]  Just bizarre behavior. But, you know, agencies, if they begin criminal, they always stay criminal.
[02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:11.050]  And the ATF was founded as revenuers who would run around the country. There were several
[02:13:11.050 --> 02:13:15.890]  whiskey rebellions and poor people out west and up north, down south, everywhere didn't
[02:13:15.890 --> 02:13:17.090]  have a lot of ways to make money.
[02:13:17.090 --> 02:13:25.130]  And one thing you could do was shut up a still and make whiskey or make moonshine. And there
[02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:32.970]  were federal and other taxes on it. And people said we're not going to pay your whiskey tax.
[02:13:32.970 --> 02:13:37.010]  And so the revenuers would go around and blow up the stills and arrest the people. I'm not
[02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:42.770]  talking about Dukes of Hazzard folks or where NASCAR came from, from liquor running vehicles.
[02:13:42.770 --> 02:13:48.690]  I'm talking about, you know, in the 1800s, I'm talking about 200 years ago, 150 years
[02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:53.770]  ago, there were huge wars over all of this and insurrections.
[02:13:53.770 --> 02:14:02.090]  And the ATF is the oldest federal law enforcement agency. The Texas Rangers is the oldest continual
[02:14:02.090 --> 02:14:07.250]  law enforcement agency, if you want to call it that. But for federal, it's the ATF.
[02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:11.510]  And a lot of times they would get paid off not to shut down your whiskey or your
[02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:18.210]  moonshine or they just come into your still, kill you, and then sell the liquor themselves.
[02:14:18.210 --> 02:14:24.930]  I mean, they are a hardcore group. They bombed Oklahoma City. They were intimately involved.
[02:14:24.930 --> 02:14:29.130]  They love going after patriots with no criminal record who are at the gun range. And the
[02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:33.570]  AR-15 shoots two rounds and a tattletale calls them. And then they take you to jail
[02:14:33.570 --> 02:14:38.050]  and then they tell the jury, we admit he knew it didn't mean to shoot twice.
[02:14:38.050 --> 02:14:44.090]  Was still a felony. And that jury will send you up the river with pleasure. I mean,
[02:14:44.090 --> 02:14:49.210]  they hate this country. They ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment. They
[02:14:49.210 --> 02:14:56.770]  are a terrorist organization. They torched Waco. I've known good people at the FBI.
[02:14:56.770 --> 02:15:00.850]  I've known good people in the state police. I've known good people in the federal marshals,
[02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:06.050]  good people in the CIA. The ATF, and I'm sure there are some good people that blew
[02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:07.970]  the whistle on Fast and Furious.
[02:15:07.970 --> 02:15:15.570]  The point is, the ATF is a incarnate anti-American criminal organization and needs to be abolished
[02:15:15.570 --> 02:15:20.730]  before they stage more terror attacks. Brandon in Alabama, then we'll go to Christopher
[02:15:20.730 --> 02:15:23.970]  and John and Mike and others. I'm going to move quick now. I'm going to try my best.
[02:15:23.970 --> 02:15:25.810]  Brandon in Alabama, go ahead.
[02:15:25.810 --> 02:15:31.170]  Alex, listen, great show today. And I just want to say you have been on a roll today
[02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:35.650]  addressing things as far as the spiritual nature of what's going on in our world.
[02:15:35.650 --> 02:15:40.650]  And the point of this is that we have to understand that nothing happens on a world level, on
[02:15:40.650 --> 02:15:47.250]  a geopolitical level, that is not being orchestrated and strings being pulled behind
[02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:52.530]  the scenes. Do we think it's a coincidence that we see the Pope, the leader of the
[02:15:52.530 --> 02:15:57.710]  world's largest, quote, Christian religion, calling for a one world government, calling
[02:15:57.710 --> 02:16:02.090]  that people who own or manufacture firearms can't be Christian? And you can go on and
[02:16:02.090 --> 02:16:03.090]  on down the list.
[02:16:03.090 --> 02:16:07.650]  The whole concerted world government takeover. It's been launched. We're now entering the
[02:16:07.650 --> 02:16:12.510]  new world order. Notice his approval rating has dropped massively with American Catholics.
[02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:17.370]  It doesn't matter. He's he's got a billion third world followers that really think
[02:16:17.370 --> 02:16:22.470]  he's their papa when the guy is a snake leading them straight to hell. Is it not
[02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:23.470]  biblical?
[02:16:23.470 --> 02:16:28.430]  It is all biblical. It's not a coincidence that ninety nine percent of your American
[02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:32.730]  mega church pastors are preaching peace and love and happiness and don't worry about
[02:16:32.730 --> 02:16:36.170]  anything because Starbucks is open in the United States and we're sitting in an air
[02:16:36.170 --> 02:16:37.170]  conditioned church.
[02:16:37.170 --> 02:16:41.170]  I'm glad you just said that. I'm glad you just said that because I went and looked
[02:16:41.170 --> 02:16:45.970]  it up this morning and checked some major Christian websites and things and Googled
[02:16:45.970 --> 02:16:48.770]  some of the sermons of top preachers. In fact, I meant to give us the reporters
[02:16:48.770 --> 02:16:55.410]  to a story on it. Nothing has been said by Joel Osteen or any of these people.
[02:16:55.410 --> 02:17:00.370]  I'll give it to Reverend Graham. He's talked about it. He's talked about the open borders.
[02:17:00.370 --> 02:17:06.010]  None of these so-called preachers. He's glitter bugs have talked about. It's all feel good.
[02:17:06.010 --> 02:17:09.930]  Follow me and you're going to get rich. No, you're going to get persecuted. What's
[02:17:09.930 --> 02:17:13.910]  going to happen? And they're just up there. And I don't want to attack Joel Osteen.
[02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:19.330]  He says some things that are good as well. But where imagine if Joel Osteen came out
[02:17:19.330 --> 02:17:23.850]  against Planned Parenthood. Imagine what that would do. That would save millions
[02:17:23.850 --> 02:17:27.410]  of babies, but he won't do it. And I'm not picking on him. Just just any of them.
[02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:32.730]  I went and looked at their websites. Nothing out of these people. They need to get involved
[02:17:32.730 --> 02:17:37.090]  for these children. I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, the bottom line is that we are fighting
[02:17:37.090 --> 02:17:39.970]  a spiritual battle, Alex. And I know you said you didn't want this to turn into a
[02:17:39.970 --> 02:17:44.150]  preacher fest, but if we call ourselves a Christian, we have to wake up and realize
[02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:49.130]  that everything in our world is of a spiritual nature. And we have to fight that battle
[02:17:49.130 --> 02:17:53.770]  for spiritual life. And listen, you're exactly right. The preachers are not addressing
[02:17:53.770 --> 02:17:58.130]  this. There are a handful of men, Franklin Gray and being one, who are willing to confront
[02:17:58.130 --> 02:18:04.330]  the big issue. Jonathan Cahn, Joel Richardson, Carl Gallups, Mark Biltz. Those are all guys
[02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:07.770]  that write for World Net Daily. They're addressing these issues. But see, they are
[02:18:07.770 --> 02:18:11.970]  Dobson. Dobson's been doing it. He's getting harassed by the IRS and getting their
[02:18:11.970 --> 02:18:17.610]  facility shot up. That's exactly right. And the bottom line is we have to realize
[02:18:17.610 --> 02:18:21.490]  that there are spiritual things going on in this world and that our battle is not
[02:18:21.490 --> 02:18:25.170]  against flesh and blood. They're being played out through people. But there are
[02:18:25.170 --> 02:18:28.690]  powers bigger than these people that are orchestrating. And you said it earlier,
[02:18:28.690 --> 02:18:32.370]  they are being demonically influenced or possessed or whatever it is. And my
[02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:36.010]  word of encouragement to you is, don't worry about it turning into a preacher
[02:18:36.010 --> 02:18:39.810]  fest, brother. We have to address things from a spiritual standpoint and
[02:18:39.810 --> 02:18:42.210]  a spiritual nature if we call ourselves Christian.
[02:18:42.210 --> 02:18:48.210]  Well, it's just beyond that. The church has been taken over to turn people off
[02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:52.450]  from it because it's one of the main command bases of the system. But when
[02:18:52.450 --> 02:18:55.650]  you really research this and you go to Bohemian Grove, it's going on right
[02:18:55.650 --> 02:19:01.210]  now in California, and you cover all of this, you come to the realization
[02:19:01.210 --> 02:19:06.450]  that it is a satanic takeover. And and and again, I say to the
[02:19:06.450 --> 02:19:10.930]  atheist, everybody, call it a sci fi movie, whatever you want, you know,
[02:19:10.930 --> 02:19:15.330]  angels or, you know, demons or aliens or whatever. I don't know. I just
[02:19:15.330 --> 02:19:20.050]  know the elite believe they're directed by entities. They believe
[02:19:20.050 --> 02:19:22.290]  they're being given all this knowledge. They're doing all this
[02:19:22.290 --> 02:19:26.730]  evil stuff. And if you start praying at the Capitol or at a
[02:19:26.730 --> 02:19:30.210]  mortuary, people show up in black and start screaming, Hail
[02:19:30.210 --> 02:19:35.730]  Satan. I mean, this stuff's going on. And believe me, just
[02:19:35.730 --> 02:19:38.210]  imagining, you know, that you're demon possessed doesn't give you
[02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:42.210]  green skin. I mean, when you get around these people, you are
[02:19:42.210 --> 02:19:45.890]  looking at another creature. And then that's all I can say is
[02:19:45.890 --> 02:19:49.410]  I've been around it too much. I'm telling you, folks, it's like
[02:19:49.570 --> 02:19:52.690]  Avatar or something like there's aliens up there piling
[02:19:52.690 --> 02:19:54.970]  these people around. I mean, that's an allegory of

[02:23:56.780 --> 02:24:08.400]  From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:18.900]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. You know, Caitlyn Jenner is actually the real
[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:23.980]  El Chapo. The problem is he hasn't actually done the chopping, so I say he's a fraud.
[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:29.460]  Me, I've gone and I've had surgery and I've had these prosthesis years added. I am now
[02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:35.580]  choosing to be trans zoological, I believe is the term. I may just have to be trans-abled
[02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:39.060]  and shot my arms and legs off and I'd be known as a biscuit and live in a box. I'm
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:40.060]  taking care of it.
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:43.940]  If you don't accept it, you're hateful. In fact, if you don't adopt my lifestyle
[02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:49.500]  and wear dirty brown socks on your ears after you work out, you're a racist. You're
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:53.460]  a homophobe. You're an anti zoological phobe. You're a piece of filth.
[02:24:53.460 --> 02:25:08.660]  So now I become my new self. And folks, the proper term is trans species. Paul Watson
[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:11.900]  decided to become a duck and you need to honor it and honor the courage or you're
[02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:16.020]  in big trouble. And again, we're not attacking people that have made the decision to change
[02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:17.020]  to something else.
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:20.780]  The point is it being the number one issue in the world is an example of foe rights
[02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:24.580]  versus all of our basic human rights being taken. So one of the crew members, one of
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:31.700]  the smaller crew members has decided to go from being a human to a gorilla. And so Mr.
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:34.700]  Gorilla, what do you have to say?
[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:41.180]  Okay, there you go, ladies and gentlemen. I'm trying to have some fun. It's such
[02:25:41.180 --> 02:25:46.060]  a serious show that my daughters are here today. They got in the prop room. They know
[02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:53.300]  we had a gorilla outfit and she put it on. So I thought of a way to tie that in. And
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:57.700]  she actually shot that video yesterday too at the house. I'd worked out and I'd
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.940]  used dress socks because I didn't have any clean white socks. It was actually
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:04.580]  hiking socks, brown hiking socks. And I took them off and stuck them on my ears
[02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:05.580]  like I was a hound dog.
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:09.580]  And I was joking around with the girls and they said, shoot a video, daddy, shoot a
[02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:15.460]  video. I thought, well, how do I make it political? So that's how things tend to
[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:20.260]  happen around the house. But Alex Jones comes out of the closet. I am a blue
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:27.420]  tech hound, actually a blood hound. Macadamia nuts, pine nuts. Okay, let's go
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:29.860]  ahead and take some calls. I apologize. I will just continue with your phone
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:32.860]  calls. Christopher in Colorado, thanks for holding. You want to talk about
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:35.860]  transhumanism? Go ahead.
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:41.100]  Hey, Alex, a long time supporter here. So many things to talk about. I mean,
[02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:44.740]  there's so many things facing us right now, whether it's the environment, the
[02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:49.540]  economy, politics, the attack on civil rights, the attack on sex, the attack on
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:53.420]  marriage, the attack on the family, whatever, you know, I did. There's so
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:58.180]  many things. It's hard to it's hard to choose social engineers can take all
[02:26:58.180 --> 02:27:02.100]  of our money and use it against us. And they control the dinosaur media
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:05.740]  that puts out the talking points. So this is what it's like to be dominated
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:09.700]  and run by a bunch of mentally ill people on a just unlimited
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:15.620]  resources, you know, just unlimited, just it just it's crazy. And this is the first
[02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:19.420]  time I've called and they asked me what I wanted to talk about. And I
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:22.380]  was thinking, you know, I've been thinking over the past several weeks,
[02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:28.220]  like, what is the biggest thing facing us, you know, regardless of
[02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:30.860]  everything else that's going on. I think it's the color of Caitlyn
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:38.380]  Jenner's lipstick. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's great. That's great. And the whether
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:42.860]  anything collapses, whether anything, you know, anytime soon, if
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:47.900]  everything just continues in a normal path of evolution with with
[02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:51.740]  technology, and technology and everything with computers in 10,
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:55.820]  15 years, it's all going to be exactly the way they want just
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:59.340]  based on just based on the evolution of that technology, you can
[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.900]  they're now telling us right now, exactly, they're going from what
[02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:07.060]  was in white papers 3040 years ago, to what was near reality 10 years
[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:10.700]  ago, but it was all white paper wasn't put out popularly. So I
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:14.220]  sounded crazy covering it myself and a few others. Now they're all
[02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:17.580]  putting it out positively, selling it like it's a good thing
[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:20.980]  going, we'll be obsolete, we'll be phased out. The robot
[02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:24.020]  humans will probably kill all of us. Isn't it wonderful? It's
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:27.020]  just part of evolution, get ready to die. They're just
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:31.500]  mainlining their plan now. I mean, I've got like nine articles
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:32.500]  today where they're admitting it.
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:37.420]  Oh, yeah, no, and it's like, it's like, we were waiting for
[02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:42.420]  this merging of technology and humans start to happen. But in
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:45.500]  a way, it's already happened. I mean, you walk around
[02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:49.660]  anywhere, and everyone is literally merged with, you know,
[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:53.380]  their phones and, and their computers. I'm not one, I'm not
[02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:56.940]  one to take to take off that list. I mean, without computers
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:28:59.740]  without the internet, we wouldn't even be able to know
[02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:03.700]  any of this stuff. So it's kind of a catch 22. But we
[02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:07.060]  look, we're we're already jacked into it into the matrix,
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:10.940]  you know, we're already they are we carry around bugs with
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:14.260]  us every day in our pockets, you know, our phones, and it's
[02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:16.060]  just the beginning. And now they say they have the
[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:20.060]  blueprint of total life with the computers and the DNA. And
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:22.700]  they're just rolling out all these new species. And then
[02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:26.180]  they're all abominations. They all I'd be forwarded it
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:29.020]  worked and was empowering. It dumbs us down all the
[02:29:29.020 --> 02:29:32.460]  technology makes us sicker, and then creates horrible
[02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:36.020]  mutations, so that they don't really have control of the
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:39.500]  global genome. They're just able to mess with it, and then
[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:42.980]  create monstrosities. It's exactly what I would expect
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:46.540]  again for the devil to do. It is straight out of the
[02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:50.980]  Bible. We're on the march. The Empire calls coming on stay
[02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:54.380]  with us, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:03.020]  Wired magazine demonstrated how 470,000 Chrysler Fiat vehicles,
[02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:06.340]  in this case, a Jeep could be wirelessly remotely hacked
[02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:09.100]  and driven into a ditch. Of course, it'll only be five to
[02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:12.020]  10 years before someone else, the government will be driving
[02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:15.140]  your car all the time. The National Highway Traffic Safety
[02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:18.300]  Administration plans to issue a VTV mandate that's vehicle to
[02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:22.100]  vehicle communication this year, instead of 2016 as
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:24.580]  originally planned. These mandates will be expensive new
[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:27.660]  additions for your safety, just like the safety systems
[02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:29.820]  that allowed hackers to turn off the steering, turn off the
[02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:32.900]  brakes, accelerate the Jeep and drive it into a ditch.
[02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:35.340]  Mainstream media scoffed when we talked at length about
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:37.780]  hacking a vehicle in conjunction with a car bomb to make it
[02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:40.300]  look like reckless driving when Michael Hastings was killed
[02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:44.860]  two years ago. They will rarely use this new technology
[02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:48.460]  to take someone's life, but it is designed to take your
[02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:50.820]  liberty. If you want to know the implications of this
[02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:53.820]  dangerous new control grid being superimposed on your
[02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:56.980]  life, go to infowars.com. I'm David Knight.

[02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:43.700]  stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out
[02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:46.660]  in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally

[02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:08.300]  website info wars.com because the companies I've been
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:11.580]  approached by were not the highest quality and they
[02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:14.900]  weren't as affordable as they should be. So I refused
[02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:17.980]  probably 3040 firearms manufacturers over the years

[02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:21.820]  You know, I should give the number out more than once in
[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:31.780]  the entire show 802-599-2231. Frogo in England had a
[02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:34.860]  bad digital connection. So he had to hang up. He's called
[02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:37.460]  back. Let's try one more time. Then I'm gonna go to
[02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:40.860]  john, Mike, Adam and Amy, then I'm gonna hit news and
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:43.140]  then back to calls. But I've got to try to now move
[02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:46.100]  quick through these callers. Frogo, thanks for trying
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:50.540]  again, from all beyond from her Britannic Majesties
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:52.460]  abode. Welcome, sir.
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:57.380]  Hi, Alex, but a bit less of her Britannic Majesty, I have
[02:33:57.380 --> 02:33:59.780]  to restrain myself from using a very rude words.
[02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:05.460]  What? And I mean, call her the grand witch or what would you
[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:05.860]  call her?
[02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:12.220]  You're talking. God damn it. I do not like royalty. And
[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:14.900]  this is not what I intended to talk about.
[02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:17.100]  I don't either. But I really like your voice. You got a
[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:18.740]  cool voice. You should do voiceovers.
[02:34:19.860 --> 02:34:21.860]  Alright, you want me to do voiceover as well?
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:27.500]  Just say this is qm74 entering the main quadrant preparing to
[02:34:27.580 --> 02:34:32.420]  drop our payload over c seven three vector. This is
[02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:34.900]  well, I didn't get a lot of that. But we're preparing to
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:36.100]  drop our payload.
[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:44.860]  We've got a group of folkwolf 109 coming in from the
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:46.420]  northeast at 11 o'clock.
[02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:50.220]  Right, we don't go that much time. Let's quit goofing.
[02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:53.140]  All right, I'll quit screwing around, brother. Go ahead,
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:53.740]  make your point.
[02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:59.100]  Right, then terminology. It's kind of important stuff,
[02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:05.220]  because precise choices of words and forms of words have
[02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:12.340]  powers, both magical and psychological. Something has
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:16.820]  been bothering me for quite a while, is the use of the
[02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:23.700]  term ISIS for a bunch of CIA inspired terrorist scum in the
[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:25.260]  Middle East. Yes.
[02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:26.700]  Now,
[02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:35.020]  Isis is a goddess from ancient Egypt. Very nice
[02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:38.220]  character, I should know because I'm a neo pagan, a
[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:43.220]  member of the fellowship of Isis. And we are to be a lot
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:45.780]  less rude than I was about to be when I heard a mention
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:49.060]  of the Grand Witch really pissed off about it.
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:51.260]  It's not good to call her that.
[02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:58.380]  But see, I sense these things now. No, seriously,
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:36:01.380]  getting back to this. Yes, I would say Isis has the
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:04.940]  traits that are the opposite of the ancient Isis. And
[02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:08.060]  I think it all is a big Western CIA joke. Yes.
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:11.380]  There's no doubt about it. And like, when they first
[02:36:11.380 --> 02:36:13.460]  announced on television, what was that in June last
[02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:17.180]  year? Yes, I immediately thought there is no way
[02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:18.260]  that's an accident.
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:22.580]  Next thing I thought is also there is no way those
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:24.900]  people are Muslims because Muslims would never touch
[02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:25.700]  anything pagan.
[02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:31.100]  Then shortly after that, they kind of dropped it,
[02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:36.540]  they modified it to ISIL, replacing Syria with
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:40.780]  Levant. Now, Obama has had rather a lot to say
[02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:44.100]  about them. Notice something. He invariably called
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:45.340]  them ISIL.
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:49.380]  And I know why they say it's because he doesn't
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:52.060]  want to call down an extra curse upon himself.
[02:36:52.580 --> 02:36:57.860]  So that's interesting, because that would be if you're
[02:36:57.860 --> 02:37:00.540]  into the occult, to be sitting there using that
[02:37:00.540 --> 02:37:03.100]  deity's name for another separate group. Obama
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:05.020]  thinks it's bad luck. I've wondered why he'll
[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:08.380]  never call it is or Isis. He does call it
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:12.420]  Israel, which is another main up name. Wow, that's
[02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:13.540]  really interesting theory.
[02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:17.260]  Yeah, I see it as being a little more than a
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:19.540]  theory. I mean, like, I'm into occult stuff.
[02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:25.060]  Uh, and I know, I know the things that can
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:27.540]  happen when you screw around with it. I mean,
[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:32.660]  like long years ago, um, let's see, I lived
[02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:36.940]  in Earl's Court and I and someone else did a
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:42.300]  ritual in Nottingdale. When we were finished,
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:46.020]  I got up, walked home and there was weird
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:50.420]  stuff going on behind and around me for about
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:52.700]  three quarters of an hour. And then it suddenly
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:54.380]  clicked that we hadn't closed the circle
[02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:58.540]  properly. So right there in Earl's Court Road,
[02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:00.100]  fortunately, there was no one around the place,
[02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:03.620]  I got back into ceremonial mode, closed the
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:06.580]  circle, and all the weird stuff stopped straight
[02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:06.980]  away.
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:11.980]  There's no doubt the elite are obsessed with
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:15.900]  what you call ancient pagan rituals. And then
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:17.060]  they're trying to tell the public, though,
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:21.140]  that none of this is going on. As a neo pagan,
[02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:24.500]  let me ask you your view then, what do you
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:26.620]  think spiritually is going on on this planet?
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:32.340]  What's going on on this planet? A cosmic
[02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:38.860]  struggle between good and evil. What we see
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:43.340]  is only a little bit of reality. It's a bit
[02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:49.340]  like an iceberg. And there is so much of it.
[02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:54.420]  Let's get to the really relevant bits. Mankind
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:56.260]  and indeed all life on Earth has been
[02:38:56.260 --> 02:39:01.540]  menaced by demons for, well, since life on
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:05.260]  Earth got going, since the creator was able to
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:11.380]  establish this kind of life. The other side, I
[02:39:11.420 --> 02:39:14.620]  like to call them Tenebrae, which is a lesson
[02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:20.980]  for darkness, do not like life. They have
[02:39:20.980 --> 02:39:24.420]  been attacking life for millions upon millions
[02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:30.580]  of years. And they must regard it as a series
[02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:33.580]  of defeats, because there is more and more
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:37.900]  life. Then at some point, human life arrived
[02:39:37.940 --> 02:39:40.860]  and they must have thought a load of really
[02:39:40.860 --> 02:39:44.260]  non-principal stuff, because, quite frankly,
[02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:50.660]  for all the animal loonies, and think how
[02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:52.700]  nice the world would be if we weren't here
[02:39:52.700 --> 02:39:55.300]  loonies, the fact is that the best form of
[02:39:55.300 --> 02:40:00.420]  life anyone can be is human. And if you
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:04.860]  doubt that, just think how long you could play
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:06.580]  with your iPhone if you were a frog.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:10.900]  Well, this is what it comes down to, is that,
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:12.140]  I mean, if you look at the cosmology of
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:14.140]  Christianity or any other ancient culture,
[02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:16.900]  come with the basic same tenets that there
[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:19.780]  are interdimensional forces, good and evil.
[02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:21.860]  There's the master creating system that gives
[02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:24.340]  you all the good things, the life, the
[02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:28.180]  regeneration, kinsmanship, all of it. And then
[02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:30.180]  you've got forces that love to mutate things,
[02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:32.420]  destroy things and kill things because they
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:35.140]  hate the creation. And if these demons, as
[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:37.420]  you're calling them, hated what God had
[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:40.500]  created before, then imagine how much they
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:44.780]  really hate man, which is made in a image
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:46.860]  of the Creator and able to envision and
[02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:49.420]  create. We are light years ahead of the
[02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:52.020]  animals in many ways. And so that's what
[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:54.580]  makes the demons so upset and why they
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:56.940]  want to demonize life and demonize the
[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:59.380]  highest order of life, while pulling down
[02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:01.700]  that highest order of life to then create
[02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:03.740]  the self-fulfilling prophecy that we're
[02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:06.220]  trash, because the demons cannot destroy
[02:41:06.220 --> 02:41:08.500]  the life giver. They can only try to
[02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:12.300]  destroy the creation that God made. And
[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:13.660]  that is what you come down to. And then
[02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:16.220]  separate that from the occult, which just
[02:41:16.220 --> 02:41:17.700]  means hidden for folks that don't know,
[02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:20.820]  and Christianity and all of it. The elite
[02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:23.220]  at Skull and Bones, at Bohemian Grove and
[02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:25.140]  all these places, they have been given
[02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:28.660]  dominion. They pray to the false light,
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:31.020]  because when you get higher up, they pray
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:32.860]  to the darkness. They're outside
[02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:34.140]  initiates, think they're praying to the
[02:41:34.140 --> 02:41:37.380]  light and they're praying to the false
[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:39.460]  light. And at the higher levels, they
[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:42.540]  want to kill everybody. And they're
[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:45.660]  being promised by their God, worlds of
[02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:46.820]  their own. They're going to merge with
[02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:49.340]  the machines and be God's forever if
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:52.180]  they simply betray God's creation and
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:54.580]  try to destroy it. And it's heavy
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:56.740]  information. And, you know, I've gotten
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:58.580]  into it a lot because when you look at
[02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:01.140]  it, what are the churches are preaching
[02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:03.660]  this? But then if you bring science into
[02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:05.180]  it, and all that's been proven and the
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:06.940]  sixth sense and everything, oh, my God,
[02:42:06.940 --> 02:42:08.420]  that's, that's, you know, that's
[02:42:08.420 --> 02:42:09.700]  kooky. That's weird, because they
[02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:11.340]  don't want people to know how real it
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:13.740]  is. What I'm getting at is this, the
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:16.980]  globalist are occult obsessed, everything
[02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:19.340]  that is obsessed with it, Obama, all
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:21.740]  of them. And then, though, their
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:23.860]  practitioners get out and tell people,
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:25.780]  there's nothing spiritual, you see
[02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:27.980]  everything, you're not conscious, you
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:29.820]  don't have free will, you're ugly,
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:31.700]  you're nothing, just don't just just
[02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:33.940]  watch what we say, our little limited
[02:42:33.940 --> 02:42:36.660]  reality, watch television, watch our
[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:39.780]  spectrum of false reality, their hack
[02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:42.460]  of the system, show that they can
[02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:44.940]  then go on in their words and be the
[02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:47.860]  wizards who can operate and live and
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:50.100]  control the world. They're threatened by
[02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:53.020]  any other sentient humans being in
[02:42:53.020 --> 02:42:55.260]  there being able to control reality
[02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:56.580]  with what we build and what we do.
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:58.780]  So they just want us gone so they can
[02:42:58.780 --> 02:43:00.300]  play God. Do you agree with that
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:00.700]  statement?
[02:43:01.940 --> 02:43:03.980]  Yeah, well, a little bit of
[02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:07.380]  modification. Till about a month ago, I
[02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:10.420]  thought they, the demons, the
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:11.980]  globalist want to kill everyone. And
[02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.580]  then, then the horrible truth sank in.
[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:17.260]  No, actually, they wanted to
[02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:20.100]  torment us. They want to kill all
[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:23.580]  humans, because humans are able to
[02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:27.660]  resist them. They would rather that we
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:31.260]  come back as inferior forms of life. So
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:34.380]  identifying as a gorilla is a little
[02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:38.780]  bit previous. And then, well,
[02:43:38.900 --> 02:43:41.260]  predation can take off like it where
[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:42.540]  it was still in the water, the
[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:43.020]  Jurassic.
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:44.420]  Well, it is true. They want to kill
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:46.340]  us slowly, mutate us, torture us like
[02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:48.180]  a psychopath. And interesting points. I
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:49.420]  appreciate your call. Call back in
[02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:51.460]  again. Thank you, Frogo. Thanks for
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:52.780]  working so hard to get on the show.
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:44:00.900]  They do enjoy taking beautiful, perfect creations of God and making them ugly and failed and
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:02.200]  have them spew pus out.
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:04.640]  I mean, they really like that.
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:07.160]  They like to torment.
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:11.480]  And people that don't even believe in God, people that don't even, or total atheists,
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:13.920]  they take DMT, which I don't take hard drugs.
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:16.720]  I haven't taken, don't take illegal drugs.
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:20.360]  But they take it and they go, oh my God, I believe in God now.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:25.800]  You know, I was on a spaceship for a hundred years with demons torturing people.
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:29.920]  And then you go give it to somebody from India, somebody from Mexico, somebody from Germany,
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:31.160]  somebody who's an atheist.
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:35.200]  And they either, it seems the smarter you are, the more hellish it is, people I've
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:36.200]  talked to.
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:41.520]  I mean, if you're really smart and tuned in, you see it and it's like, oh my God.
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:45.520]  And it's just, it's just unbelievable hell that's going on because you're tuned into
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:47.440]  their level.
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:51.360]  And if you're kind of stupid and trendy, it's like all wonderful and happy and they
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:53.360]  want to be your friend.
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:55.680]  Again, I don't know.
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:57.080]  Let's say it's not real.
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:00.400]  In a Carl Jung way, it's a shared human archetype.
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.240]  What is that programming that you take DMT that you release a little bit of during
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:09.060]  deep sleep, during vivid dreams and a ton of when you die?
[02:45:09.060 --> 02:45:10.640]  That's why your life does flash before you.
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:14.140]  I've talked to a lot of folks, family, been there when people die and the last day
[02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:17.980]  while they're dying, it's just, they're just, it's incredible.
[02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:18.980]  Everything's replaying back.
[02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:19.980]  They're recounting things.
[02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:20.980]  Their memory's perfect.
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:23.060]  Their eyes just fire up.
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:26.220]  That's because DMT starting to be slowly released and then when they die, a bunch
[02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:29.020]  of it's released and their whole life flashes before you.
[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:32.820]  Well, you take that stuff and I've talked to people that have taken it.
[02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:38.240]  In fact, somebody, somebody very close that I wish would go on air and talk about it.
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:44.480]  It was like an eternity on a prison space station with demons doing brain surgeries,
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:45.480]  torturing people.
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:47.720]  And let me tell you, the person said it was real.
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:53.880]  And I told them, yeah, that's that's what you see. I mean, folks, that's what all the ancient
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:58.439]  cultures talked about, what they put on cave walls, what the Aztecs kind of bought into
[02:45:58.439 --> 02:46:04.720]  and started doing. I mean, it is just whacked out, folks, whacked out. Call it evil energy,
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:09.279]  whatever you want. It's imposing itself on the planet. It wants to chop babies up. Why
[02:46:09.279 --> 02:46:10.279]  are we letting it see?
[02:46:10.279 --> 02:46:13.300]  I said I'd take calls and I took that one call. It was very interesting. And now there's
[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:17.539]  other calls. John in Wyoming, thanks for holding. You're a trooper. You're on the air.
[02:46:17.539 --> 02:46:24.220]  Yeah, Alex, I need to remind all of your listeners that tomorrow the House is voting
[02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:31.939]  on that Monsanto Protection Act. It's House Resolution 1599. And if this thing passes
[02:46:31.939 --> 02:46:35.740]  now, you need to call your congressman today, people, because they're voting on
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:41.859]  this tomorrow. If this thing passes, then your individual states will not be able to
[02:46:41.859 --> 02:46:47.560]  require food processors to label their foods. Are they wholesome and natural or are they
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:53.240]  genetically modified? And we have to put a stop to it. They bought out some congressman
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.599]  from Kansas. I think his name is Paul Amaro. And this guy is introducing the legislation.
[02:46:58.599 --> 02:47:04.000]  It's going to be voted on tomorrow in the House. And if it passes, you can say goodbye
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.840]  to wholesome and natural foods and hello to nothing but GMOs.
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:12.980]  That's why I love taking calls, John, as you brought up something we covered earlier in the week.
[02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:16.920]  We've never seen such Facebook censorship that we try to post articles about this.
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:21.599]  They just shut it down and censor it. And you're absolutely right. Imagine they want
[02:47:21.599 --> 02:47:26.279]  to force GMO known to kill honey bees, known to kill the bugs that eat it, known
[02:47:26.279 --> 02:47:31.000]  to cause serious gut problems on us and not even let it be labeled and not even let
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.640]  Monsanto be sued.
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:38.779]  It's House Resolution 1599. Now, if you have a minute, I'll tell you a few more
[02:47:38.779 --> 02:47:44.199]  things about John McCain. The so-called hero John McCain tried to shut down all the
[02:47:44.199 --> 02:47:51.019]  gun shows. He was co-sponsor of McCain-Feingold. He was co-sponsor with with Ted Kennedy
[02:47:51.019 --> 02:47:57.019]  on that Chamnesty bill. He signs on to Kyoto, which will cost us an extra 60 cents
[02:47:57.019 --> 02:47:58.019]  a gallon.
[02:47:58.019 --> 02:48:01.779]  He met with the ISIS commanders and helped fund the Free Syrian Army that's now Al-Qaeda
[02:48:01.779 --> 02:48:02.779]  running around.
[02:48:02.779 --> 02:48:09.420]  And he says, we'll be in Iraq another 50 to 100 years. He's a decades-long member
[02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:15.740]  of the CFR. He opposed the Bush tax cuts. He was heavily involved in the S&L scandals
[02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:20.980]  in the late 80s. And in order to buy a simple bottle of vitamins, he wants you
[02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:27.619]  to be required to get a doctor's prescription to buy a simple bottle of vitamins. Yet you
[02:48:27.619 --> 02:48:33.099]  and I, being adults, can walk into any store in the country and buy alcohol or tobacco,
[02:48:33.099 --> 02:48:38.980]  which can kill us without a doctor's prescription. But McCain doesn't want you to be able to
[02:48:38.980 --> 02:48:41.340]  buy any vitamins without a doctor's prescription.
[02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:46.779]  Hey, can I say this, John? John, he is a Manchurian candidate. Can we can we hire
[02:48:46.779 --> 02:48:49.500]  you as a correspondent?
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:51.060]  Why not?
[02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:54.300]  You have a great voice and you're even smarter. And I just am so honored. I'm not
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:57.820]  kissing your butt. It's true. You guys sit on hold forever. I'm up here babbling about
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:03.240]  space platforms and demons. And you're just so smart. Nailed everything on McCain. You're
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:09.140]  the type of guy that are you Internet savvy, where you could like file audio reports
[02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:11.099]  to a portal or something?
[02:49:11.099 --> 02:49:16.320]  Alex, I'm old school. I'm 69 years old. So I was one of those guys who grew up without
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:22.519]  the Internet. But I have unlimited local and long distance. So I guess there's so
[02:49:22.519 --> 02:49:27.279]  many great characters out there that are so smart. And, you know, I would love to have
[02:49:27.279 --> 02:49:31.519]  it where maybe you could we could find somebody in Wyoming in the town you're in who could
[02:49:31.519 --> 02:49:34.380]  work with you as a team and have you go out and do reports and stuff.
[02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:38.640]  Because this is the power of the people. My big dream would be to turn loose all
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:43.640]  these great Americans of every race, color, creed from every region to be filing reports
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:47.880]  for us. I don't have a ton of money. Most folks wouldn't even want to work for money
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:51.599]  just to coordinating something like Wayne Madsen. It's great. We don't have working
[02:49:51.679 --> 02:49:53.759]  with us, but I got to tell him where I want him to go and talk to him.
[02:49:53.759 --> 02:49:57.720]  You know, it's a hassle, but I want to have all these great minds involved with
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:03.199]  us. You call in maybe once a year and always just absolutely knock it out of the
[02:50:03.199 --> 02:50:09.199]  park. And I would like more and more to have people like you be able to maybe we
[02:50:09.199 --> 02:50:13.920]  sent you a DAT machine with a recorder and you could record commentaries and mail
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:17.800]  it back to us. But that's just I mean, there's so many I really want to turn loose
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.480]  a citizen corps of reporters. That way, we have people in every corner of the
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:24.640]  country. Very, very exciting. I'm going to skip this network break so we have
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:28.279]  more time on this Wednesday edition. Other points you want to make about
[02:50:28.279 --> 02:50:32.560]  McCain? Go ahead. Well, for five years, by the way, I've been fighting
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:37.599]  these criminals here in Sheridan on water fluoridation. And we had our
[02:50:37.599 --> 02:50:43.679]  corrupt mayor before who got appointed in the State House of Representatives
[02:50:43.679 --> 02:50:50.039]  here, and then he got a formerly anti fluoride City Council member to become
[02:50:50.039 --> 02:50:54.840]  pro fluoride, so he would be appointed mayor. So they have some of the most
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:59.000]  corrupt you think the politics are corrupt in Texas. Remember, I was born
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:04.320]  in Texas City. So I know all about Texas politics. And you think corrupt
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:09.439]  politics are evident in Texas and Louisiana, you should come up to Wyoming
[02:51:09.439 --> 02:51:13.240]  and see how corrupt they are up here. They're awful. But I've been fighting
[02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:18.400]  the fluoridation of our water which began earlier this year began around
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:20.480]  the first of the year. That's right. Haven't I seen you in some of the
[02:51:20.480 --> 02:51:24.720]  local papers? I think we've covered it. Because I mean, look, Harvard
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:27.519]  admits it's deadly. They've ordered the amount of floor on the water cut
[02:51:27.519 --> 02:51:31.039]  by half. I bet if you go investigate the water department, I bet they
[02:51:31.039 --> 02:51:31.920]  haven't cut it yet.
[02:51:33.359 --> 02:51:38.000]  No, they haven't. As a matter of fact, we need one more new member of
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:43.400]  City Council to replace the old fluoride junkies. One more member of
[02:51:43.400 --> 02:51:46.880]  City Council and then we will have enough to shut down the water
[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:48.119]  fluoridation here.
[02:51:49.119 --> 02:51:52.400]  The force medicating us with a deadly poison that they now admit is
[02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:55.439]  brain damaging us. And we wonder why the IQ points have dropped in
[02:51:55.439 --> 02:52:00.320]  the last 30 years. 14 points. One decade of regular fluoride use
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:04.359]  reduces IQ by 10 points on average. I mean, these people are sick
[02:52:04.359 --> 02:52:07.279]  freaks. John, I'm going to start getting the name and number of
[02:52:07.279 --> 02:52:11.160]  folks that I think could be correspondence or people that
[02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:14.840]  give us commentary or people that give us their take on
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:18.199]  things. I don't know what I'm going to do with this core of
[02:52:18.199 --> 02:52:20.759]  people. But the guy called earlier, I think it was from
[02:52:20.759 --> 02:52:23.720]  Georgia, talking about going the Marine Corps recruiting thing
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:27.119]  and he had breaking news. People like you, it'd be so
[02:52:27.119 --> 02:52:32.920]  good to be able to have folks out there that can be filing
[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:37.279]  reports to mfoldwars.com and writing articles and just really
[02:52:37.279 --> 02:52:40.000]  having boots on the ground everywhere. Very, very exciting.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:41.880]  So if you want to give us your name and number, John, I'm
[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:44.720]  going to get that and then put it. Do create some type of
[02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:47.199]  file or something because I want to start getting these
[02:52:47.199 --> 02:52:50.400]  great callers and people. I mean, like David Knight entered
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:53.160]  one of our contests, we hired him, he's now hosting the
[02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:55.800]  show, reaching tens of millions of people every week.
[02:52:55.800 --> 02:52:59.400]  Jakari Jackson was in college and, you know, making
[02:52:59.400 --> 02:53:02.000]  great grades and RTF and already had a job. We convinced
[02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:04.199]  him to move down here. He's doing a great job. You know,
[02:53:04.199 --> 02:53:06.119]  people like McBreen was already working for what was
[02:53:06.119 --> 02:53:07.720]  the Scripps Tower news service. We convinced him to
[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:09.560]  quit his job and come here because he entered the
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:14.679]  contest. You know, but I'm out of money at a certain
[02:53:14.679 --> 02:53:17.279]  point, skipping breaks, not plugging like I'm doing now
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.240]  to where I wish I could go out and just hire a whole
[02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:22.160]  bunch of reporters. The problem is you hire an
[02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:25.279]  establishment reporter most of the time. They just want
[02:53:25.279 --> 02:53:27.960]  you to tell them what to say. I've tried it before
[02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:29.439]  and I'm like, I'm not going to tell you what to
[02:53:29.439 --> 02:53:32.720]  say. Go out and investigate. You know, they're like,
[02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:34.480]  well, I'm not liberal or conservative. Well, neither
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:39.279]  are we. We're just common sense. And that's my
[02:53:39.279 --> 02:53:43.599]  dream is there's all these smart, concise people
[02:53:43.599 --> 02:53:45.840]  out there that listen and I'm so humbled that you
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:48.400]  listen to me because half the time I'm exhausted. I
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:50.920]  mean, I got a lot of work. I'm not complaining. It's
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:54.320]  just that it's kind of like I'm on the field after
[02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:58.199]  playing 18 innings of baseball and sometimes I'm a
[02:53:58.199 --> 02:54:00.199]  little tired and I'm going to swing wide and I'm
[02:54:00.199 --> 02:54:02.199]  going to stumble around. Sometimes, though, I'm going
[02:54:02.199 --> 02:54:03.640]  to get a better hit than I would have got in the
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:07.080]  second inning. But I'm kind of cross-eyed sometimes.
[02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:09.880]  I'll be honest with you. I can't believe the stress
[02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:11.400]  I can put up with. God's really blessed me with
[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:15.240]  stamina. People only knew this stuff. I'm not
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:19.240]  whining about it. It's just crazy. So believe me,
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:21.240]  folks, I know it's a train wreck sometimes, but I'm
[02:54:21.240 --> 02:54:23.640]  doing the best I can and I got a great crew and
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:25.400]  they're just getting better and better. So I'm so
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:29.000]  blessed and the world's getting so dark right now
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.599]  that I just fall back on God and it's not like
[02:54:32.599 --> 02:54:36.840]  it's a psychological blanket. It's where I get my
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:39.240]  strength.
[02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:45.660]  I can be exhausted and I just think about God and God wants us to protect the innocents
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:52.020]  and God wants us to help life on this planet and then just the strength fills me.
[02:54:52.020 --> 02:54:57.560]  It's just so epic, the battle we're in, I just can't believe we're so prominent in
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:54:58.560]  this fight.
[02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:05.140]  There are so many well-spoken, smart, incredible people who we need to be involved and I know
[02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:09.500]  you're involved but I want to see you involved on a bigger level.
[02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:12.980]  I wish there were another dozen outfits like InfoWars.
[02:55:12.980 --> 02:55:19.780]  I wish there were so many successful, articulate, neat people that showed up on the scene that
[02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:26.060]  I was made obsolete and I could just maybe do polished books or videos fighting the
[02:55:26.060 --> 02:55:30.340]  globalist and really contribute in that way because I'm so busy I can't do a lot of
[02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:31.820]  polished stuff.
[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:37.580]  I would pretty much sit back if people show up that have got what it takes to take the
[02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:42.580]  globalist on but I know this, so many good people don't take action because you're humble
[02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:44.580]  like I am as well.
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:48.220]  It doesn't matter if you've got a speech impediment, it doesn't matter if you're
[02:55:48.220 --> 02:55:51.700]  handicapped, it doesn't matter if you're black or white, it doesn't matter.
[02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:56.900]  What matters is you recognize the evil, you don't want to put up with it, you don't
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:56:00.300]  want to go along with it, you're not going to stand for it.
[02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:05.700]  I mean, folks, they're beginning gun confiscations on Social Security recipients right now.
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:13.280]  And I feel like I'm losing my soul, because my soul is stronger than ever in many ways,
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:18.920]  but in others, I'm so marinated in this evil, that I know they were coming after the Social
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:20.040]  Security recipients.
[02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:29.100]  They're going to do the same thing they've done in Australia and Europe, take away your tax write-off for kids that you desperately need to pay the bills if you haven't inoculated them.
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:49.100]  They're going to use our dependents in a managed economy, because even if you work 60 hours a week, you're dependent on the government to get those little tax write-offs for your kids so that you can buy them clothes and take them to the movies or take them to play golf or whatever.
[02:56:48.900 --> 02:57:06.480]  And now they're going to get rid of that and shoot them up so they can have seizures and be mentally retarded. I mean, they're just ghouls, folks. They want to hurt us. And I understand it takes me a lot to get my mind around, we're really dealing with demons.
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:13.620]  But I've had globalists at meetings, events, off record, on record, tell me we're going
[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:16.260]  to destroy you, you'll never stop us.
[02:57:16.260 --> 02:57:18.220]  They're like villains in movies.
[02:57:18.220 --> 02:57:22.180]  I grew up and would go see movies about villains and the villain would laugh and say, I'm
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:23.180]  going to get you.
[02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:24.180]  Ah ha ha.
[02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:25.180]  Here's my plan.
[02:57:25.180 --> 02:57:26.540]  And I think, you know, why does the villain give the plan?
[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:27.540]  Why not just kill them?
[02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:28.780]  Why do they tackle and do all this?
[02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:31.220]  I didn't realize that was criminology.
[02:57:31.220 --> 02:57:34.940]  I didn't realize people like Stan Lee understood that when they were doing these comics and
[02:57:34.940 --> 02:57:36.340]  that that's what villains really do.
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:37.340]  They really go, ha ha ha.
[02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:38.340]  I'm going to get you.
[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:39.340]  Here's how I did it.
[02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:40.340]  And you didn't know it.
[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:43.960]  I mean, I have to sit there and watch them do this.
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:47.620]  And then the public's too dumb to even read what they've said or what they've done.
[02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:54.300]  We're going to go to break and come back and take a few calls in overdrive, I've done my
[02:57:54.300 --> 02:57:55.300]  best.
[02:57:55.300 --> 02:58:01.460]  Briefly, like I mentioned, hdfirearms.com, that's a sponsor, great quality products.

[02:59:50.940 --> 02:59:53.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:08.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:15.000]  Mike in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  Well, I just wanted to, hey Alex, I wanted to make two quick comments and a review on X2.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  Two quick comments are, when it comes to John McCain, there's video footage of him saying, laying on a bed in a cast, that he broke his shoulders when he ejected from his plane.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:37.000]  We're led to believe that he hurt his shoulders from being tortured.
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  Another thing is, if you look at other video of the prisoners being released, most of the prisoners in the background are looking at John McCain with disdain.
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  John McCain is placed nice and front and center for the camera, but the guys in the background, like I said, none of them are smiling.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  They're all kind of looking away and looking disgusted, to be honest with you.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  I've talked to some of the people, I mean, I've done shows years ago, most of them are dead now.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  They say he was a trustee, his dad was the head of the Pacific Fleet, and he gave away all the codes and just everything.
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  I've seen that footage when he's getting released after five years and they all look at him like they want to kill him.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  That's why he always says, I'm no hero, I'm no... I mean, John McCain is a demon.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  Look at everything he's done in his life.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  He reportedly started the fire on the forest stall. I mean, he is a train wreck.
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  That's why it's sort of strange how Americans define heroes nowadays.
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  Before, when America was strong and everybody tried to model it, they actually put up heroes that didn't kill people.
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  They put up heroes that did everything they could not to kill people.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  Even the bad person.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  It's strange how now a hero is actually someone who gets the most kills, like Kyle, the gentleman who killed the sniper.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  You guys don't really worship heroes like you used to, it's different now.
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  Now, my X2 review, I've been trying to actually get it out to you for a while.
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  I've been taking X2 for about a year and maybe two months.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  I stopped smoking in April and I had tried quit smoking before.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  I'm 33, I've smoked since I was 13.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  And I tell you, when I tried to quit before, I would see a cigarette on the street and want to smoke it.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  Now, since I've been on nascent iodine, and I didn't take it to quit smoking,
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:30.000]  but since I've been on it and I've stopped smoking, I've stopped smoking since April and I haven't touched it at all.
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  I mean, my best friend quit smoking at the same time with me.
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  He's not a fan of yours, but I got him on the nascent iodine and he's also not smoking.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  Let me ask you a question, because it does change the whole chemical physiology when you're deficient in it,
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  but a lot of folks go through detox within two to three weeks.
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  Did you have any detox effects?
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  That's also strange too, because I had nothing noticeable.
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  And if you think about it, I've smoked since I was 13.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  You'd think something would happen, but what I did notice was my attitude.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  I wouldn't get upset about certain things.
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  Days didn't seem so long.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  Your monotonous schedule of over and over wasn't nearly as terrifying as it was before.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  Well, I mean, look, without iodine you die, and most of the iodine is out of the soils and out of the foods.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  A lot of the seafood iodine has been contaminated, and you get really pure, clean iodine in your body.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  I mean, myself, group seven, I went on it two years ago.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  He goes, watch, you're going to tan better.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  He goes, those sunspots you have, a lot of those are going to go away, and they did.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  And he explained to me physiologically how your body and your skin needs it to even be able to tan.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  And that's why now, I mean, I barely go out in the sun, and I look, you know, coconut brown, which I like.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  I mean, I think it looks good.
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  I just tan really easy, really good, like I did when I was a kid.
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  And it was because I was deficient.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  But I felt like crap two weeks into it for about a week.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  And then after it, I described it like when my kids were smaller, I'd put one on my shoulders to, say, go up a hill or a mountain.
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.000]  And when you take them off your shoulders, you feel like you're flying.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  That's what it felt like after a month was, but I mean, I don't want to get gross.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  All this oil, I never have a lot of whiteheads and stuff like that, but it just came out.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  I mean, it was good.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  It's dramatic, and a lot of folks experience that.
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  Infowarslife.com, God bless you.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  Thank you for your testimonial.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  I've got to go, and I apologize to the other callers for keeping them on hold.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  I want to hear from Burt and Adam and Wild, Mormon and Amy.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  If you guys can get back in tomorrow at the front of the line, I'm going to do open phones again tomorrow.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  I promise you'll be first.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  John, I always do this and never do it.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  Will you remind me tomorrow and get their numbers if they want?
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  We'll call them back tomorrow.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  Thank you.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  You're the best, John Harmon, for doing that.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  So we'll do that tomorrow and hear from those callers.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  Nightly News is tonight at 7 o'clock Central, Lord willing.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  Please don't take this place for granted.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  I know I don't.
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  We're not that special, but believe me, they want to shut us down.
