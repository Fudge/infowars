[00:38.720 --> 00:45.360]  Sunday transmission I am your host Alex Jones best-selling author and investigative reporter
[00:45.360 --> 00:49.120]  Jim Mars is going to be in studio with us he's already here just arrived minutes ago
[00:49.680 --> 00:53.840]  to break down a lot of key intel on the development of global government
[00:53.840 --> 01:00.880]  and where the new world order wants to take us 50 years after the murder of JFK as well
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.480]  and we're just going to cover the NSA scandal Obamacare the eugenics agenda the global awakening
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.840]  that's happening and take your phone calls with Jim Mars coming up in the second hour in the first
[01:11.840 --> 01:17.200]  hour I intend to get to the news and there is a lot of it and try to open the phones up and
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.520]  start going to calls by the last segment of this hour we're to begin if you go up to info
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.440]  wars.com then after the break we'll talk about some of the news it's up on drudgereport.com
[01:30.480 --> 01:36.800]  but before we get to that if you go to info wars.com we have a lot of news we're going to be
[01:36.800 --> 01:42.800]  breaking down today Texas police assault legal gun owners amazing video from downtown Austin
[01:42.800 --> 01:49.120]  that our reporter Jacare Jackson shot just yesterday Captain America battles DHS terrorist
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.920]  in the new film amazing new plot of that we'll be hearing that special report the really big news
[01:53.920 --> 02:03.120]  NSA propaganda video among highest downvoted percentages in YouTube history 8900 to just
[02:03.120 --> 02:09.840]  100 and something likes I've never seen anything like that pun intended also the big news leaked
[02:09.840 --> 02:17.280]  video FEMA preparing military police for gun confiscation and martial law and more importantly
[02:17.280 --> 02:26.080]  also on the video suspension of the constitution that's coming up also massive barge on san francisco
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.840]  bay likely secret google facility there's no likely about it I made some phone calls this morning
[02:31.840 --> 02:38.000]  to my sources in san francisco they said it's well known the google employees are out there passing
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.120]  through government security to board the barge so google is at least in there and it's hooked into
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.920]  google glasses they're doing it off the coast claiming it doesn't violate a law to spy on us
[02:49.920 --> 02:56.480]  from an offshore base admiralty letter of mark and NSA surveillance of Merkel's phone may have
[02:56.480 --> 03:02.560]  been monitored for 10 years well it's admitted it's been monitored all that and more coming up today
[03:02.560 --> 03:09.280]  and then I'm also going to deal with the deniers that they denied obama care was a giant screw job
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.320]  they denied the black boxes were going in the cars it's actually by the mile the department of
[03:14.320 --> 03:21.600]  transportation said that 15 years ago I covered it on air like 1997 however many years 15 16 years
[03:21.600 --> 03:29.280]  ago it's all on record they're establishing a private corporate world government it's on record
[03:29.280 --> 03:33.600]  our government created al-qaeda and funds them and protects them I mean look at drudgereport.com
[03:33.600 --> 03:40.320]  states moved to tax miles black boxes and cars tell trips oh my goodness who could have imagined
[03:40.320 --> 03:46.160]  the black boxes once they got in by law last year we're going to track us by the mile when they were
[03:46.160 --> 03:53.760]  designed for that germany already does it I mean that's what's so frustrating is that I sit here
[03:53.760 --> 03:58.000]  and go here's all these pentagon press releases and articles about other training to take on the
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.920]  tea party and gun owners and veterans here's ap Reuters fox news CNN here's the document by the way
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.160]  we broke it and people and people are in the youtube comments on the videos going this is
[04:08.160 --> 04:12.720]  ridiculous fear mongering none of this is going to happen and then when it happens it's like well
[04:12.720 --> 04:21.280]  we need to take the guns there is a criminal takeover going on we're going to cover all of it
[04:21.280 --> 04:25.680]  here today and give you the news behind the news the story behind the story the good the bad and
[04:25.680 --> 04:30.480]  the ugly because it is truly the best of times the worst of times a lot of great things are happening
[04:30.480 --> 04:36.240]  but we're seeing the heights of evil not just the heights of liberty and the heights of resistance
[04:36.240 --> 04:45.360]  against tyranny so big transmission lined up today and a valiant member of the military police
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.280]  because in a world of universal deceit and cowardice not being a coward is a universal act
[04:51.280 --> 04:56.560]  to paraphrase George Arwell we've got the video of fema preparing to confiscate your guns
[04:59.360 --> 05:04.880]  Alex Jones here and i want to tell you about a long time friend of the show my patriot supply
[05:04.880 --> 05:11.200]  as you might remember this is the company that stood up to the dhs and exposed fema's secret plan
[05:11.200 --> 05:17.840]  to begin hoarding emergency survival food it has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind

[05:50.080 --> 05:56.160]  rapid advances on every front it is essential to prepare with my patriot supply today
[06:04.640 --> 06:10.640]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[06:10.640 --> 06:17.600]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex in dallas texas three shots were
[06:17.600 --> 06:23.440]  fired at president kennedy's motorcade in downtown dallas the first report to say that president
[06:23.440 --> 06:31.280]  kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting it is a big idea a new world order
[06:31.280 --> 06:39.280]  it was almost as if it were a planned employment it just pancakes
[06:41.600 --> 06:47.280]  either you were with us or you were with the terrorists
[06:47.280 --> 06:57.280]  so
[06:58.560 --> 07:03.680]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in hands of soldiers not in the
[07:03.680 --> 07:07.280]  hands of criminals
[07:12.400 --> 07:16.880]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an american
[07:16.880 --> 07:22.320]  city global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all
[07:22.320 --> 07:28.880]  just living and dying from what the central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death
[07:31.360 --> 07:38.880]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones thank you for joining us on this live
[07:38.880 --> 07:43.920]  sunday edition the 27th day of october 2013 i am your host alex jones jim mars the best
[07:43.920 --> 07:49.920]  again journalist will be in studio with us coming up in about 53 minutes from now in studio to cover
[07:49.920 --> 07:54.480]  a lot of breaking news as well as 50 years after the assassination by the shadow government
[07:54.480 --> 08:00.640]  of john f kennedy coming up we're going to get into the story that's the top article on drudge
[08:00.640 --> 08:11.040]  report dot com from the los angeles times states move to tax miles black boxes and cars tell trips
[08:11.040 --> 08:15.440]  i remember reading the department of transportation and mit
[08:16.720 --> 08:22.000]  documents that were public but but but not in the news 15 years ago on air and being made fun of
[08:23.600 --> 08:28.560]  where they said we're going to mandate worldwide not just here at these black boxes are put in
[08:28.560 --> 08:35.440]  and then when you go get your inspection you'll be given a yearly fee as to how far you've driven
[08:35.440 --> 08:41.200]  them and then they're also talking about doing it by your insurance company making you put a box
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.240]  in the car and these boxes also track how fast you go where you go the things you do
[08:46.800 --> 08:51.280]  and there's other systems as well but now it's being announced that indeed they're going ahead
[08:51.280 --> 08:57.520]  with this ladies and gentlemen you've got to understand something i knew 10 years ago from
[08:57.520 --> 09:07.520]  david steel a retired cia individual and others that google was really a complete above nasa
[09:07.520 --> 09:14.720]  above space command because that's where the shadow government resides tip of the iceberg
[09:14.720 --> 09:22.400]  of a huge submerged spy system and of course now it's out that they've got barges off the coast
[09:22.400 --> 09:27.040]  to google to spy on everything because they're already preparing for laws to be passed to stop
[09:27.040 --> 09:31.600]  spying they're just going to do it off the coast through the devices inside the country this is
[09:31.600 --> 09:40.400]  an offshore globalist operation quite literally the globalists are above the law they have diplomatic
[09:40.400 --> 09:47.600]  immunity and you have to understand that these are social engineers whose ideology
[09:47.600 --> 09:56.400]  if aliens attacked the planet you would hear on the news why they attacked us if we knew
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.440]  and what their ideology was and what made them tick and what they stood for how do we ever expect
[10:01.440 --> 10:07.680]  to beat the globalist if we don't know who they are what they stand for and and they've told us
[10:07.680 --> 10:13.200]  they think so little of the general public and have such little faith in humanity
[10:13.200 --> 10:20.320]  that they are completely public about how they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and
[10:20.320 --> 10:25.040]  design gmos to reduce fertility and wreck our genetics within three generations and
[10:25.680 --> 10:31.280]  how they're destroying society by design they were quite public about how obama care wasn't
[10:31.280 --> 10:35.920]  designed to work it was only to double and triple the profits for offshore insurance companies and
[10:35.920 --> 10:40.640]  shut down their competition and set up death panels and reduce care and fully bankrupt the
[10:40.640 --> 10:47.280]  old system and bring in total fascism we knew obama care wouldn't work we knew healthcare.gov
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.640]  wasn't going to work it was designed to fail so that you're just keep begging for something free
[10:52.640 --> 10:58.640]  and all you get is the bank levy all you get is your tax-free fund kept all you get is your wages
[10:58.640 --> 11:04.640]  garnished and that's all being announced just like we told you and people still say fix it obama
[11:04.640 --> 11:09.760]  you're going to give me something free all i'm getting's a big a big corporate tax and the supreme
[11:09.760 --> 11:15.760]  court rules it's a tax to private corporations offshore it's globalism it's world government
[11:15.760 --> 11:21.600]  just like if you go to all these countries looted by the globalist like like like spain and portugal
[11:21.600 --> 11:29.040]  and and and greece and all these other countries they pay their money to foreign banks they are
[11:29.040 --> 11:35.120]  captured they are third world nations now they are deader nations by fraud they don't even owe the
[11:35.120 --> 11:41.840]  money most of it and and you know i open almost every broadcast with that basic statement in one
[11:41.840 --> 11:47.360]  permutation or another because if you don't understand that you don't understand anything
[11:48.800 --> 11:56.400]  this is corporate anti-free market monopoly capitalism using socialism and communism
[11:56.400 --> 12:04.000]  in the grassroots compartmentalized to make us dependent and poor and dumb down and not virile
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.200]  and and aggressive in business and life it's domestication and then above that you've got the
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.440]  corporate management class and select groups that get the contracts from the government
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.400]  that are controlled by a super corporate group above that so super corporate group on top of
[12:18.400 --> 12:25.120]  pyramid a government layer that controls and extracts the funds of the population sends it to
[12:25.120 --> 12:31.600]  the top to be distributed back down the mid and lower levels for social control and none of this
[12:31.600 --> 12:38.240]  is even debated if you watch devos or read their reports every year it's all public world government
[12:38.240 --> 12:45.040]  end of the family rations to have food for sterilization hell on earth if you get a club
[12:45.040 --> 12:49.520]  of rum document that's public same thing or a presidential decision directive or a
[12:50.640 --> 12:56.800]  state department memorandum like 200 it's all there or eco science 1100 pages written by
[12:56.800 --> 13:01.040]  the white house science are about the sterilants in the water and why they do it 1974 the year
[13:01.040 --> 13:06.960]  i was born he's now white house science are i mean here's the deal here's what i want to say
[13:06.960 --> 13:14.000]  before i get into all the news i am right i have been correct i'm sorry it's been scary for you
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.840]  all i've done as a history uh bookworm will study history discover what's happening currently 20
[13:19.840 --> 13:25.680]  years ago get involved and i've been accurate i've been right about 95 percent because i'm only
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.240]  covering what they say let me explain this to you again for all you in denial or who live in
[13:30.240 --> 13:35.200]  fantasy land and he's and and and who think you can choose what reality you want to believe and
[13:35.200 --> 13:41.920]  you can choose what facts you want and twist things i am telling you from a perspective of
[13:41.920 --> 13:48.960]  total research at a level probably not surpassed by anybody else in the opposition to tyranny
[13:48.960 --> 13:55.360]  the people in the tyranny system have like 180 200 iqs and but are totally ruthless and are way
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.640]  above me i mean let's just i'm not saying i'm real smart here but as for the general rabble the
[14:00.640 --> 14:07.840]  unwashed masses i am the best there is i spend the most hours the most time in focus research
[14:07.840 --> 14:11.920]  and really studying history and the globalist and i know their plan so i want to get this
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.400]  message across to all of you listening today you are under scientific globalist attack there is no
[14:18.400 --> 14:24.800]  doubt about it world planetary technocracy in their own words is being established to carry out
[14:24.800 --> 14:32.800]  worldwide ultra hitlerion beyond hitler extermination of the population now once they've got their
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.360]  digital grid in place it is not to empower humanity or even control humanity it is to
[14:37.360 --> 14:42.880]  selectively restrict resources for total social engineering at a level you've never imagined
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.520]  and so you have a decision to make do you want humanity to go to space do you want your children
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.720]  to have a future and grandchildren do you not want to be run by totally cold-blooded technocrats
[14:56.720 --> 15:03.040]  who think you're subhuman need to be killed if if if you decide that you don't want to be phased
[15:03.040 --> 15:08.160]  out you may want to go watch football have a good time eat drink be merry just say i don't care
[15:08.160 --> 15:12.640]  whatever sign your kids over to the new world order go ahead and comply you might survive
[15:12.640 --> 15:19.520]  20 30 years maybe if you're if you're mid-level go ahead and make the conscious decision or make
[15:19.520 --> 15:25.120]  the decision to fight this because i want to explain something to you maybe one percent of people
[15:25.120 --> 15:29.520]  are going to be allowed to live under this okay and that's in their own literature they tell their
[15:29.520 --> 15:33.360]  low-level minions they're only going to reduce population by 80 percent no it's it's about
[15:33.360 --> 15:39.600]  99 so i want to explain to you this might as well be an alien species coming and landing
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.960]  and taking over to do this to us it's the same deal but it's a group of psychopaths and sociopaths
[15:44.960 --> 15:52.000]  and inbred elites who are developing and perfecting a scientific total takeover system now we're

[20:18.560 --> 20:22.560]  it's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must
[20:22.560 --> 20:27.280]  mean that we're running up our debt raising the debt ceiling which has done been done over a hundred
[20:27.280 --> 20:35.360]  times does not increase our debt it does not somehow promote profligacy all it does is it says
[20:35.360 --> 20:38.720]  you got to pay the bills that you've already racked up congress
[20:44.080 --> 20:46.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:46.720 --> 20:50.160]  so
[20:55.280 --> 21:00.160]  all right let me try to bore down to the news here instead of just breaking down the big picture
[21:00.160 --> 21:07.120]  for everybody but just listen to that propaganda coming in here raising the debt ceiling doesn't
[21:07.120 --> 21:12.800]  raise the debt diane feinstein came out this week and said spying on you without warrants is not
[21:12.800 --> 21:21.600]  surveillance it is the very essence of illegal surveillance and as i predicted federal courts
[21:21.600 --> 21:30.480]  are now using warrantless wiretaps in court see before they would tell the dea or others
[21:30.480 --> 21:35.280]  okay you've got all this data now go start a fake investigation to claim you got it some other way
[21:35.840 --> 21:40.240]  now they're using the coming out of it to say you know what we're going to use illegally obtained
[21:40.240 --> 21:46.720]  information there's the new york times federal prosecutors in policy shift cite warrantless
[21:46.720 --> 21:53.040]  wiretaps as evidence and that's what my incredibly high level government sources have said they said
[21:53.040 --> 21:59.920]  look this whole nsa thing it's just a rollout publicly in your face and then i was basically
[21:59.920 --> 22:05.840]  laughed at it's all very funny to these people and then folks say well why don't you tell us who
[22:05.840 --> 22:13.040]  laughed at you well then i won't have those sources but i've had generals kernels admirals it's high
[22:13.040 --> 22:18.160]  level people across the board and you can't tell whose side they're on they're just telling you
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.160]  stuff that's going on at the time laughing about it but you know what i think they're laughing about
[22:22.160 --> 22:27.120]  it because deep down they know it's so evil that they laugh about it because that makes them feel
[22:27.120 --> 22:32.240]  like at a subconscious level they have power over it and why do i know that because that's what i do
[22:32.240 --> 22:37.520]  you the more evil something is the more i laugh about it because i'm really freaked out i'm really
[22:37.520 --> 22:44.960]  upset because i know this is all pointed at good people now let me show you an article that's the
[22:44.960 --> 22:52.000]  top story on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com it's leaked video fema preparing military
[22:52.000 --> 22:59.280]  police for gun confiscations and martial law us army mp told constitution may be suspended
[22:59.280 --> 23:04.480]  by homeland security we're going to play this unedited except for the two cuss words that are
[23:04.480 --> 23:11.440]  that are that are paused we cut the audio out on two cuss words unedited and then he started his
[23:11.440 --> 23:18.800]  camera his iphone this member of the military police army military police in arizona once it
[23:18.800 --> 23:24.400]  started and he called into the show friday he indeed we gave marco to one of our youtube channels he
[23:24.400 --> 23:29.360]  uploaded it we checked his name his info checked out who he was confirmed he's a member of the
[23:29.360 --> 23:33.920]  military police that just got out after a certain number of years honorably discharged we'll leave
[23:33.920 --> 23:41.200]  it at that and was ready to release this info and imagine you're in a meeting and they go we're here
[23:41.200 --> 23:45.840]  to brief you on the new command structure fema is now over the army in domestic operations and the
[23:45.840 --> 23:51.600]  national guard and under our mission we will suspend the constitution and we will help them
[23:51.600 --> 23:56.960]  disarm we won't take the guns but fema will he starts taping at that point he goes repeat that
[23:58.400 --> 24:02.400]  and they go well we won't take the guns but we'll be there to aid fema while they do it just like
[24:02.400 --> 24:06.480]  katrina they went to the high and dry rich neighborhoods people their own generators happy
[24:06.480 --> 24:11.200]  doing well put them in handcuffs took their guns any chance they can the beta test that's all on
[24:11.200 --> 24:17.040]  record and then you've got all the mainstream news reporting that they're training to take on gun
[24:17.040 --> 24:22.960]  owners veterans returning veterans christians i mean it's all over the news and billions of
[24:22.960 --> 24:30.320]  bullets and and and the homeland's pretty much two million targets of the tea party to shoot
[24:31.360 --> 24:36.880]  this is all mainstream news almost all of it is sent to us we publish it drudgereport.com picks it
[24:36.880 --> 24:43.920]  up and then mainstream media is forced to cover it but the point is is that let me just show you
[24:43.920 --> 24:48.160]  some articles of your tv viewer at info wars.com for slash show there's a free video feed right
[24:48.160 --> 24:52.240]  there if you're ready illiterate you can go pull all these up i want to show you a few articles
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.600]  though just from this week in context with this newest article that broke yesterday we got the
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.920]  video friday the article went up saturday army halts program that labeled christians radical
[25:01.920 --> 25:08.960]  extremist briefings characterized conservatives as terror threat fox news ap others after we covered
[25:08.960 --> 25:15.360]  it got the memo by the secretary of the army saying suspend the program suspend the program
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.800]  but the point here is is it's worse than even the article Watson wrote at info wars or it's
[25:20.800 --> 25:28.160]  worse than even what fox did because this is over the chart they said in the memo you can go read it
[25:28.800 --> 25:34.160]  that if you give money to any tea party or republican group or the libertarian party
[25:34.160 --> 25:40.240]  or if you give money to an evangelical group by the way i looked it up uniform crime statistics
[25:40.240 --> 25:47.520]  do you know what religious group has the lowest crime rate of any group guess what it is it is
[25:47.520 --> 25:51.840]  evangelicals and then buddhist because they don't see it as like all the christian groups
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.960]  is separate it's like you know they break them down in little subgroups so it's evangelical
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.280]  you can pull this up and then buddhist after that and then baptist after that but the whole point is
[26:01.280 --> 26:08.960]  is imagine a totally legal lawful groups they're telling the military you will be arrested if you
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.840]  are part of these groups or give them money and then we made a big deal out of it so the mainstream
[26:13.840 --> 26:18.000]  media had to cover it the army had to respond and say okay we're going to stop there should be
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.840]  congressional investigations nixon got him well began to get impeached now to step down over having
[26:23.840 --> 26:30.720]  100 fbi files on people and spying on them a couple hundred people this is this is thousands
[26:30.720 --> 26:37.520]  millions of times that actually in the total spine and nothing's happening so here's that article at
[26:37.520 --> 26:43.760]  info wars dot com here's the fox news article that breaks down the same thing fox news exclusive
[26:43.760 --> 26:50.960]  army halts training program that lists christians as terrorists mainline christians okay now here's
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.000]  some other articles on the same subject here's forbs how the us military would crush a tea party
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.640]  rebellion who they see as their number one enemy okay now i wanted to cover all that because here's
[27:02.640 --> 27:07.120]  a youtube comment on our video that went up yesterday that has 155 thousand views probably
[27:07.120 --> 27:11.360]  got about 10 million when it's done military police leak fema gun confiscation plan we're
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.200]  going to come back and actually play that audio for fox idiots it's called preparation dumb
[27:17.200 --> 27:22.320]  bleepers thank god you're out now he says the military police person that just got out they
[27:22.320 --> 27:28.560]  are taking worst case they are teaching you you're going into those scenarios without training
[27:28.560 --> 27:34.240]  there are the same idiots that voted for bush are creating panic i didn't vote for bush i'm a
[27:34.240 --> 27:40.320]  constitutionalist not a republican or democrat folks let me explain something the default position
[27:40.320 --> 27:44.400]  if there's an earthquake in los angeles is to go to the rich neighborhoods and take the gods
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.320]  the default position in new orleans with the areas in the hills the 10 20 million
[27:50.320 --> 27:55.040]  dollar houses literally is to go confiscate your guns and then leave the looters mainly the police
[27:55.040 --> 28:00.720]  looting uh operating down in the flooded areas in the ninth ward the default position the police
[28:00.720 --> 28:08.240]  stood down in the riots in la 20 years ago 20 years ago 21 years ago it was the koreans with
[28:08.240 --> 28:14.640]  their guns that stopped the burning of los angeles so the default in the training we're about to
[28:14.640 --> 28:20.800]  come back and play you the exclusive audio and video of the default is well we're getting ready
[28:20.800 --> 28:25.840]  to suspend the constitution if we're given the order we're going to suspend the constitution
[28:25.840 --> 28:30.960]  we're going to take the guns we're going to shoot anybody they actually talk about anybody that
[28:30.960 --> 28:37.440]  didn't turn their guns in cold dead hands and one military police guy goes this is crazy i don't
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.480]  like to start taping it and literally a minority of people who by the way i looked up this guy's
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.200]  account is military police are like well yeah we need to be ready to take the guns really during

[33:19.040 --> 33:27.200]  and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show i'm having trouble talking
[33:27.200 --> 33:31.360]  right now because during the breaks i'm on info wars dot com look at different articles and photos
[33:31.360 --> 33:39.440]  and videos and now when they just have a checkpoint that's illegal or a shooting anywhere in la they
[33:39.440 --> 33:46.160]  will set up checkpoints and his family's drive through they will aim m4s right at people's heads
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.680]  even if the person doesn't look like the suspect as an act of domination and that's what this country
[33:53.680 --> 33:58.320]  is going under everywhere is this idea that everyone's a criminal but the state everyone's a criminal
[33:58.320 --> 34:03.680]  but big corporations and the and the criminal politicians with their taxpayer paid for jets
[34:03.680 --> 34:10.960]  and red carpets we are being prepared politically to be absolutely raped up one side and down the
[34:10.960 --> 34:18.880]  other but the video and the photos i've got it on screen right now of people pulling up to checkpoints
[34:20.160 --> 34:26.320]  and you pull up and they literally shove a gun in your face and then the next car pulls up
[34:26.320 --> 34:32.000]  and they shove a gun in your face i mean the people say well how did nazi germany happen
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.040]  look at what's happening now and and the more compliant the public is
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.400]  the more horrible things they're going to get i was uh jogging yesterday and ran into a guy i see
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.480]  out there routinely he was talking about how cops were giving people tickets a week ago because it
[34:46.480 --> 34:49.760]  was raining on the green belt they say you can't go down there when it's raining didn't used to do
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.560]  that but it's nanny state and he said well listen i get the nanny state's bad and i know autism's
[34:54.560 --> 34:58.560]  up and i know all vaccines have a lot of bad stuff in them but you know i actually work for the state
[34:59.680 --> 35:07.280]  and run the whole mapping system uh for the vaccines and he said i talked a lot of scientists
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.320]  who've got autistic kids they admit the vaccines are bad but it's a cost benefit analysis we think
[35:12.320 --> 35:16.880]  it does more harm than good so it's like russia and roulette well it does paralyze you and does
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.760]  kill you and does but statistically we think it helps overall so we do it and then you lie to the
[35:21.760 --> 35:26.640]  public and tell them everything's okay and i went on to say yeah but what about the secret
[35:26.640 --> 35:31.760]  testing i believe in vaccine technology the problem is you can't trust this system because
[35:31.760 --> 35:35.840]  they've been caught putting stuff in it he goes he and his girlfriend go no we agree with you that's
[35:35.840 --> 35:41.040]  actually true i even shot video this interview but he said don't air it you don't have permission so
[35:41.040 --> 35:49.360]  i won't but the point is is the people running it no it's horrible they see the adverse reaction
[35:49.360 --> 35:54.240]  reports said adverse reaction and tiskegee they would tell them those vaccines and
[35:54.240 --> 36:00.960]  share them up with syphilis they're like well that's in the past man come on come on cancer's
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.840]  up 3000 on average we lead the world they're killing us and i've got their own admissions doing it
[36:06.400 --> 36:11.600]  i think ted turner and david rockefeller and all these people that are pushing this you line up
[36:11.600 --> 36:18.240]  and you do it oh but they're the stewards of humanity they're the enlightened ones and more
[36:18.240 --> 36:22.480]  and more i say they're not the enlightened ones they just like doing people but the general public
[36:23.280 --> 36:28.880]  has been warned and it does kind of go to their argument i gotta be honest that this is all public
[36:28.880 --> 36:34.480]  and you don't care i mean if i could talk to top level state health department people and they're
[36:34.480 --> 36:40.800]  like yeah i know i know there's an agenda yeah i know and they know they're targeted but it's
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.000]  it's still okay well then that kind of begs the question doesn't it does the general public deserve
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.240]  what's happening my thing is i can't join the elite especially after all the stuff i've done to them
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.440]  actually that's when they actually come out and try to get you the point is i can't join them
[36:57.440 --> 37:00.880]  i can't be part of shooting newborn babies up with stuff to lower their IQ
[37:01.520 --> 37:05.120]  so they're too stupid to know they're being soft killed i mean i just cannot be part of this
[37:05.120 --> 37:11.600]  but then the howling mass of the population hates me even more than the elite do so it's just like
[37:11.600 --> 37:19.200]  what do i do i i'm here giving them absolute veritas and they just want to kill me they want to be
[37:19.200 --> 37:25.840]  brain damage they want to be robbed by obama care they want to be hurt and i have a loving soul
[37:25.840 --> 37:32.640]  i'm not a sociopath and i'm freaked out by it i'm having a moment of clarity here excuse me
[37:35.840 --> 37:38.640]  i mean i read the people who are enlisted military
[37:38.640 --> 37:44.320]  going oh big deal we're trained to take the guns that might need to happen someday you don't take
[37:44.320 --> 37:51.200]  the guns during a breakdown of society guns in society secure during crises and everyone knows
[37:51.200 --> 37:58.880]  that it's just like you'll you'll do any middle gymnastics to deny the situation we're in your
[37:58.880 --> 38:06.400]  own mainline army manuals that are given to even recruits and that are given to people in boot camp
[38:06.400 --> 38:11.360]  badmout the founding fathers the constitution the bill of rights it's confirmed that
[38:12.160 --> 38:19.600]  forward hood and other bases in general orders from the head generals the major generals told them
[38:19.600 --> 38:24.800]  you will not be in a evangelical group or give money to it will arrest you i mean the the whole
[38:24.800 --> 38:29.600]  government should be impeached right there i mean that is just even crazier than i thought it would
[38:29.600 --> 38:35.520]  be this early in i mean this is just insane reports all over the country that families can't pack
[38:35.520 --> 38:42.640]  their kids their own lunches under bozo's wife's system under the health and human services with
[38:42.640 --> 38:47.440]  michelle food garbage eat the gmo but your mom can't pack your lunch i mean we're this country
[38:47.440 --> 38:52.560]  turning into a huge prison and you got these crooks parading around in front of us and i'm just
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.480]  here trying to say this is not a good road we're going down and so let me tell you yuppies and
[38:58.480 --> 39:04.720]  trendies and sports fans something if you don't get up off your giant whale butts that don't even
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.920]  mean you're fat physically i mean you're spiritually lethargic job of the hut spiritually we're
[39:09.920 --> 39:15.680]  going to lose everything let me go to this clip by a member of the military police in the army
[39:15.680 --> 39:22.160]  in september getting a briefing on the new fema orders you can see the video of your radio listener
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.240]  it's red linked up on info wars dot com and and and this is what's going on during an emergency
[39:28.240 --> 39:34.560]  to come take your guns and to kill you if you don't turn them in during a suspension of
[39:34.560 --> 39:37.360]  the constitution okay here here's the clip
[39:47.120 --> 39:50.960]  so you said that uh martial law suspends their second amendment so we
[39:50.960 --> 39:54.160]  i'm not going to but would you say we would take weapons for people
[39:55.200 --> 40:00.480]  yeah that's what they do but i'm sorry i wanted to agree with that either i'm second
[40:00.480 --> 40:05.120]  but okay this next bring a moment mark for you we've lost all control
[40:05.120 --> 40:07.920]  what do you want to say to the military when the military losing on your street
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.080]  they are now to say you have no right for what you're going to do that's like the worst case
[40:12.080 --> 40:16.720]  scenario so i'm saying when the the way they're not okay they're going to put the barbie shoes
[40:16.720 --> 40:20.640]  that's how it's going to be used yeah we're not going to be off to the street corner and be like
[40:20.640 --> 40:24.480]  hey you know we're here let's feel like you're a symptom of some kind of event you're not going to
[40:24.480 --> 40:29.440]  be involved in a riot if not really happening you know you're not going to go knock down door
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.400]  like all right i need shocking here you're not going to go up to each house and say well they
[40:34.400 --> 40:38.480]  did that in Katrina that's why i'm asking and if we're talking about hitting the fan i'm not going
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.720]  to do it but they're not going to do that necessarily more or less like take it when you're
[40:42.720 --> 41:01.040]  in your house and you're not going to stay there okay because the reason they have much more places is for those conditions like you said there are things where we broke it down there's things the last ones who change pretty much your last
[41:01.040 --> 41:20.240]  effort yeah which i think is perfect but that's enough the full video is up on info wars.com and
[41:20.240 --> 41:25.440]  presentplanet.com right now but you notice the commander's like well we did it in Katrina so
[41:25.440 --> 41:32.080]  it's okay like Jeffrey Dahmer killed kids in the neighborhood earlier on it's okay they went we
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.920]  have the video from abc news and fox they went to rich areas walked up knocked on doors people had
[41:37.920 --> 41:43.920]  their own power and said and they would even blow the doors off safe to get their guns because the order
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.800]  was given by FEMA that all the guns will be taken no one will be allowed to be armed in fact i want to
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.720]  come back in the next segment of that clip for folks in denial go to youtube and type in gun
[41:52.720 --> 41:57.680]  confiscation Katrina the first video is an nra video with like a million 400 000 views i know
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.800]  because i put it in the article yesterday with kit it's right at the first the police chief saying
[42:02.800 --> 42:07.120]  all the guns will be taken no one will be allowed to be armed while the police were robbing walmart
[42:07.120 --> 42:11.360]  and all the jewelry stores in the poor areas the wealthy and middle class were all sitting in their
[42:11.360 --> 42:17.040]  houses with generators sitting back doing totally fine and here comes the u.s army and the big red
[42:17.040 --> 42:22.400]  wine to take their guns and arrest them and then steal them and by the way they never got them back
[42:22.400 --> 42:27.440]  they had congressional hearings about all this but the issue is during an emergency this isn't
[42:27.440 --> 42:33.840]  just from arizona it's in the news we've got the training manuals the system is training
[42:34.480 --> 42:39.520]  that what you do to restore order is go kick down doors he goes we're going to kick down doors
[42:39.520 --> 42:45.120]  and take their shotguns he goes yes to restore order so they'll use a a riot in one area of your

[47:05.440 --> 47:17.520]  to the alex jones broadcasting network network we are on the march the empire is on the run
[47:17.520 --> 47:26.560]  alex jones and the gcn radio network no one will be able to be on we'll take all weapons
[47:28.240 --> 47:37.040]  if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states for an outright ban picking up
[47:37.040 --> 47:44.080]  every one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in i would have done it i could not do that
[47:44.080 --> 47:55.280]  that vote word here ladies and gentlemen that's the reality of what we face and i see countless
[47:55.280 --> 48:01.520]  army manuals that are public bad-mouthing freedom the family gun ownership returning veterans
[48:02.640 --> 48:08.080]  i see the military training for gun confiscation and carrying it out every chance they can get
[48:08.080 --> 48:15.440]  it and then members of the military including a highly decorated navy seal veteran and others
[48:16.320 --> 48:22.320]  came on my show this week not just the whistleblower from the army and said high level brass is now
[48:22.320 --> 48:28.800]  telling the non-commissioned officers there is a litmus test for gun confiscation will you confiscate
[48:28.800 --> 48:35.920]  the american people's firearms and if we don't have a debate about this the average coward out there
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.960]  thinks that if you deny bad things are happening they go away or if you accept the bad things it
[48:40.960 --> 48:47.360]  makes it okay no you resist and speak out against the bad things then they have to back off just
[48:47.360 --> 48:55.360]  like a week after we and others started covering the army teaching that evangelicals or terrorists
[48:55.360 --> 49:00.000]  don't give money to them or you'll be court-martialed the entire tea party's illegal you'll be arrested
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.680]  if you're part of it or give money to it we stood up and pointed out how incredibly illegal that is
[49:07.200 --> 49:12.080]  the folks giving those orders should be arrested not the people engaging in the first amendment
[49:12.080 --> 49:18.320]  i mean if nixon would have done anything near this he'd be in jail not just having to resign i mean
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.600]  this is light years ahead of anything i could even imagine at this point and it shows how
[49:23.600 --> 49:29.680]  wicked the opposition to this republic truly is now i have some other clips i want to play here
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.640]  dealing with several other issues we're going to do that captain america review
[49:35.200 --> 49:39.360]  here in just a minute because that's actually some positive news and then in the next hour
[49:39.360 --> 49:46.640]  we're going to get into arrest of people carrying guns legally in downtown austin by the state police
[49:46.640 --> 49:53.120]  of all folks that is coming up that that video is up on info wars dot com and sheldon andelson
[49:53.120 --> 50:00.000]  the big casino owner says in a video and the jewsland post covered it new guy ran start the war
[50:00.000 --> 50:06.320]  we're going to talk about that with jim mars coming up uh in studio and more i've got some other news
[50:06.320 --> 50:13.360]  that i want to hit first before we go there but the issue is if we don't speak up against tyranny
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.480]  it then becomes normalized so the system demonizes promoting american ideas
[50:18.480 --> 50:26.720]  political correctness is about control of ideas that's why the university of denver in colorada and
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.880]  also the boulder university as well to colorado universities came out and said don't dress as
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.960]  cowboys as indians as geisha girls that's racist we're going to kick you out of school if you do
[50:36.960 --> 50:42.640]  there's no law there's no regulation dressing up like a geisha girl doesn't put up put down japanese
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.360]  folks it's just a fun costume to put on dress it up like a cowboy didn't put down cowboys
[50:47.360 --> 50:52.640]  this is the mind control because they want us all fighting with each other while they're busy
[50:52.640 --> 50:57.600]  setting up their police state they want to teach us that the threat is each other not the foreign
[50:57.600 --> 51:03.440]  corporate interests that are above the law tax exempt who have diplomatic immunity fraudulently
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.720]  they want us at each other's throat so they can roll in and take over the society now briefly

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:47.040]  the capital yesterday i'll be narrating this is the cutting edge of civil rights where your guns
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:59.840]  are legal and lawful the cops will arrest you if it's in your uh rifle you know carrier gun rack in
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:07.280]  your car now long rifles are legal handguns aren't openly displayed well these are black powder 1898
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:13.200]  pre they're totally legal they show them the law what kind of world do we live in when police officers
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:21.600]  refuse to obey the law read the law read the law read the law they're chanting at state police
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:27.120]  read the law as they twist a guy's arm viciously who's not resisting and then they try to and they
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:48.160]  grab his arm and the torture move later their number one enemy is a second amendment i'm telling
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.360]  you have to give him you got an issue in order in order for it to be handgun it's got to be it's
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.400]  got to meet the requirements chapter 46 it doesn't do it you try to go on to which you're resting
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.640]  and these cops are so aggressive you know they got these jobs just like the police people are
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:17.040]  so cowardly don't join the gist of you gentlemen sometimes don't do mma mr tough guy don't fight
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:23.760]  other men watch him grab his arm not resisting who the cop man he's just banned read the law
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.320]  any chance the gun owner is a number one enemy any real americans number one enemy
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.160]  she's aggression i like to grab on him
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.320]  by the way what do you do with these wars and aggression has been in 19 years in the army
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:55.040]  10 years of combat the guy they're grabbing on sir you're interfering with the rest i mean
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.440]  10 years of combat compared to these idiots that spend all day acting tough on citizens
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.080]  reason i know as i saw his jacket was out the gun rally had 10 years of combat operations on one
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:21.440]  arm the point is it just so these police are trained as warriors but we're the enemy you guys
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.280]  for freaking assault that's why you don't have militarized police because they're trying to kill
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:32.320]  people break things it's for an enemy pushing me back they're peacekeepers sir yeah jukari has the
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.280]  state police guy shoving to him pushing the press because they think you're a citizen you're dog
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.160]  me you're there to provide tax money and that's it tough guy you're there for there you go that's
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:48.960]  it there'll be robots in place and he could win that that cost an ejection probably over 100 cancer
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:54.240]  viruses but when he dies he'll worship the government as he dies from the chemical weapon
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:04.320]  a bio weapon he will beg them he will worship them ladies and gentlemen what you just witnessed is
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:13.520]  the police state two citizens were lawfully carrying free 1899 revolvers under texas petal
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:20.960]  code 46 that's all about the cops and they're free they they feel threatened or i feel threatened
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.240]  by a government that doesn't think i should have guns i feel threatened by the foreign banks around
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:34.640]  this country texas dps just arrested two people for not carrying a firearm for lawfully carrying
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:40.320]  a firearm so when they say they're not this is the real tip of the spear for liberty we salute

[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:34.880]  but here is my review from last friday night's info wars nightly news of the new captain america
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:44.880]  winner soldier film that's coming out to build a better world sometimes means tearing the old one
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:54.080]  down and that makes enemies the much anticipated captain america to winner soldier is coming out
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:00.000]  in april of next year and i've got to admit i'm a fan of captain america and some of the ideas
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  that are in the original comic but more and more it's been turned into a politically correct
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.920]  uh system to sell propaganda and that may be why the franchise has been in deep trouble that's
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:16.720]  admitted but this new trailer is simply amazing and before i went out and found the spoilers online
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.880]  that break down the plot i knew instantly when i saw the first trailer that just came out what
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:28.160]  this is all about and if you read the new york daily news and others they say they don't know
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:34.320]  what it means it's confusing there's nothing confusing about it and before i even looked up
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:40.960]  the spoilers so this is a spoiler alert i knew exactly what was going on because it's so clear
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.320]  hollywood knows what we're hungry for we know that corrupt elements have taken over the government
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:52.320]  we're aware of this and that's what the film is about at first captain america says this is
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.960]  tyranny this is corruption and he's told by his boss and also robert redford who's his
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:05.200]  government handler that to build a better world sometimes it means tearing the old one down
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.800]  and that makes enemies and he says that doesn't sound like liberty that sounds like fear and tyranny
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:17.760]  and then his old boss begins to wake up so he is wounded almost mortally and captain america
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.200]  begins to wake up and he's on board the big shield command ship and has to take out a whole group
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:29.360]  of traders when that happens suddenly the bad guys that have been staging terror attacks
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.880]  come after captain america and he doesn't know where the assassin and others are coming from
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:40.880]  and who they work for of course they really work for the director of shield shield is the shadow
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.640]  government led by robert redford who just so happens to be the villain we're gonna neutralize
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.800]  a lot of threats before they happen thought the punishment usually came after the crime
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:58.880]  shield takes the world as it is not as we'd like it to be this isn't freedom this is weird and
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:05.440]  they're staging these events to get the western world to give up their liberties so that they can
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:11.920]  offer them security aka our government running and creating and fostering and funding al-qaeda
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.600]  and allowing them to attack us as a pretext to take over our lives in our world and this is what
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.240]  hollywood's doing more and more as their anti-liberty franchises fail now when you watch mainline
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:30.160]  television shows it's anti-liberty anti-gun anti-family anti-militia but more and more in big
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.520]  films like the last superman they've got to give wholesome messages because they know that they've
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:42.480]  lost the body politic the group collective and the people are waking up before we get started
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.720]  does anyone want to get out
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:57.440]  well you heard it here first captain america winner soldier is all about doing the right thing and
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:03.600]  being a patriot even when it's unpopular and risking your life to do it this movie's fantasy
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.920]  but right now good men and women in our military are standing up to the public gun confiscation plans
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:17.360]  that are being promoted by obama obama is preparing our military for a civil war with the american
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:24.240]  people it's important we openly discuss this so they're unable to launch this conflagration
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.800]  americans need to come together around the bill of rights and constitution not give the offshore
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:36.960]  tyrants a civil war as a political distraction all right folks that is just a few minutes from
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.720]  info or saintly news friday night and i was talking to jim mars the best-selling author researcher
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.600]  his book crossfire got turned into the movie jfk the fifth anniversary is coming up we're
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.640]  going to talk about that later first we're going to talk about some of the current events
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.600]  but uh jim you were saying oh yeah i mean the real captain america from the comic book character
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:02.080]  he would be a hundred percent against what dhs is doing today well yeah because the original
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:08.160]  captain america you know started off during uh back in the 40s fighting the nazis nazi you
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:14.240]  know that's the german acronym for national socialist okay they get everybody together and
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:19.920]  take up the weapons and and make everybody toe the mark and if you speak out then you get a rest oh
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.600]  wait a minute kind of sounds like what's happening today what's happening to our press right now
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.760]  we're gonna go to break and come back into the banking the nsa all of it but as a guy that wrote
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.880]  for the fortward star telegram for decades jim as somebody who's been a professor teaching you know
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:39.280]  jfk research as somebody who's been around i mean you were a journalist back when kennedy got killed
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.920]  you even knew jack ruby understanding all that what does it like to see members of the press being
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.760]  arrested swat teams rating the press for their files uh on government corruption i mean nixon
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:56.400]  never even imagined stuff like this jim that's true uh captain america if he was a real person
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.080]  he was here today he'd be throwing up in his soup at what's going on today uh it's incredible and
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.360]  well he'd be a terrorist oh yeah yeah because he wears a funny suit and uh you know fights for
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.360]  well i mean he's for he's for due process freedom and i mean that's terrorism yeah well they they
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.280]  pretty well outline that is uh that's uh they openly say any veteran is a terrorist exactly
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.640]  exactly and uh what's it what's really bad now and people need to understand this if you're a veteran
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.560]  and you go in you're trying to get some va benefits one of the questions they ask you is do you have
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:32.240]  any guns and if you answer yes you better be prepared for a whole battery of stuff and they're
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.280]  going to put you on the list and then any reason to take your guns outside log they'll do it now
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.240]  well why was it i mean we've had veterans going all the way back to aren't you a veteran oh yeah i
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:47.040]  mean a terrorist oops wait a minute maybe i should not admit having served in the u.s you were a
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:54.720]  terrorist too yeah yeah they trained me to use a rifle and during the vietnam war of course uh and
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.080]  we've had all these veterans uh all the way up here never had any problem why all of a sudden now
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:05.280]  do they feel like a veteran is a problem you know why because they're trained with firearms and they
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.320]  know how to use they could stop a takeover they could stop what do you make a ford hood on record
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:15.760]  now saying if you're evangelical or given the tea party you will be arrested they had to back off
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.240]  but i mean that even freaks me out that they would violate the first amendment and threaten people
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.280]  well they they backed off by saying well that's not official policy that's just somebody happened
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.720]  to say that but i'm here to tell you in the military and in the army you don't say squat unless it's
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:35.360]  approved by the higher echelons so they're lying through their teeth when they say that this is not
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.520]  oh we know no they said that that we're going to remove those training materials that are southern
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.320]  property law center right and of course that the southern public look at how they're persecuting
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.160]  the tea party and and pro-life groups i mean look at how they're going after people that's illegal
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:57.200]  southern paul uh poverty law center is a branch of the adl that's right okay so they actually
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:03.120]  should be registered as foreign uh representatives of the foreign government the tea party good
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.480]  battering different at least they're homegrown people they're just the merrier that's why they're

[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.120]  been on record they've been trying this forever people say well it hadn't all happened yet because
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.400]  we've been trying to hold it back but unfortunately most of it now has happened i mean we're failing
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:36.800]  so the more we fail the more we're right we don't like being right well uh up until recently up until
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.680]  about 10 years ago or so uh every time they were trying to put the screws to us they'd say well

[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:48.800]  free society still are we going into tyranny and there's no doubt we're very very deep into tyranny
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:54.400]  the denial is over now they're telling us the tyranny is for our own good but we know it's not
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:00.000]  but you were shaken up watching earlier if folks missed it the video in the audio we air
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.000]  of the state police attacking people legally carrying firearms downtown
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:10.320]  even when they were presented with the law and texas only one of six states that that bans the open
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:15.120]  carrying of handguns but these were black powders they were legal but yeah you i've forgotten about
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:22.240]  this in 78 you caused congressional hearings and the dps it turned out secretly under the feds
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:27.680]  had files on texas even the mainline liberals conservatives didn't matter you broke that for
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:33.280]  the fort war star telegram tell folks about that well that's true uh i was i remember having a face
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.720]  face meeting with homer garrison at that time was there to the dps and i learned later that uh in
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:45.680]  the following the release of this story they they destroyed and shredded tons of documents down there
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:51.520]  took them weeks to do it they were they were putting out reports on people who were simply
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:57.200]  going to city council meetings and raising questions about nuclear power and they were putting reports
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:02.800]  on them and marking them subversives okay so see this has been going on a long it's a chilling effect
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:08.960]  demonization campaign yes now it's evangelical christians yes yes but the difference is back
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:13.840]  then when this story when my story hit and other other media started following it there was a huge
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:19.280]  public outcry he almost went to jail nowadays it's like well of course we spy on you shut up
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:24.960]  exactly exactly and now you know i look around and everybody's party in and let you know let's go and
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:30.560]  and uh have a big well i mean that's the issue a free people will be aggressive and jealous of
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.920]  their freedom as thomas everson said yeah slaves won't be so folks got to decide well how they want
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.160]  that's right the time for decision is rapidly approaching get back into that story though
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:46.240]  what they were doing oh well they uh people would go to and they had undercover dps guys that would
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.200]  go to city council meetings and county commissioner courts meetings and would take notes and then
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.320]  anybody gets up and raise questions about what's going on and at this case the the key thing was
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:01.760]  about nuclear power because they were debating whether to build that comanche peak nuclear plant
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.280]  and all all they did was like the one student one of the fellows was an airline pilot he simply
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.040]  went there and raised questions wouldn't know how much is going to cost how long it's going to be
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:18.000]  and they wrote up a report and then sent a copy to his boss and it was marked subversive i was about
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.160]  to say that's his job that's what the secret service does now if he criticized obama they
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.600]  try to get you fired it is political warfare like the irs going after the tea party this is
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:33.600]  criminal they should lose their jobs not the guy that went and asked questions exactly and and again
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:39.040]  the man they're evil how do they hire such scum i'm i just well people some people do anything for
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:44.480]  money you know but what gets me is the reaction of the so-called honest people again back then there
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:50.000]  was a groundswell to public outrage saying you can't be doing this and they backed off today i don't
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.640]  see any public outrage you know well it's there but the horror media covers it up but i mean get back
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.480]  so so you broke this how did you first discover it and then and then and then what did the head of
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.040]  the dps try to do to get you to back off well the way i discovered it was the pilot this pilot a
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:08.800]  friend of mine it was friends with a friend of mine and uh through this friend i finally convinced
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.560]  him he didn't want to go public because he didn't want to lose this job and i finally convinced him
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.200]  you got to go public and you got to use your not and your name so that people know what's happening
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.640]  and he finally toughed it up and he did his boss was a good guy he said you're not a subversive
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.680]  and he didn't lose his job and then other people started coming forward saying that's the key to
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:33.920]  me is americans standing behind free speech exactly all it hey listen all everybody i hear
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.600]  i'm sure you've heard this the same refrain but i'm only one person what can i do well hey all
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.880]  throughout history it's been one person that changes history history has never been changed
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:51.920]  by a committee look at gondi exactly martin luther king christ exactly exactly it's always been one
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.280]  person they weren't even going to have the revolutionary war but george washington showed up
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.440]  and said i will command the forces that's right now on the other side it also works on the other
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.160]  side when hitler showed up at the german workers party which became the nancy party he said i will
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:10.480]  lead you they're they're like nine people there nine people and from there it goes round on up to
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.440]  war and get world war and evil knows how powerful the individual is that's why they try to shut them
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.440]  down how dare an airline pilot not want to pay for a dangerous power plant in his neighborhood
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.480]  how dare you in america we're gonna get you fired and when you go through a border checkpoint they
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.720]  say are you a citizen you just say i'm a texan and laugh it off and why should you have to declare
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.360]  who you are why you know in a free country we've already legalized all the illegals anyways it's
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.800]  exactly doesn't matter you know ron paul's right they now admit the border the the fence is to keep
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:46.960]  us from leaving and that that's what it's getting to be and that time will come no i talked to the
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.800]  coyotes down there when i was at big ben last year i started earlier this year they said oh no we
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.640]  have dozens a day now that leave and go across on the canoe yeah so now it's the other way that's
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:02.400]  all right that's right and if it gets to be a surreal stream they're gonna start closing it off
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.160]  they're gonna say you can't leave oh that's what they already tried to stop they let the
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.160]  illegals pour across shit thousands at night even in big ben that's the middle of nowhere cops all
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.320]  just stand down they're all paid off well i think right now and i could be wrong but i think right
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.120]  now you can still physically get out of the us but you can't take your money with you you can't
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.720]  transfer it the irs couldn't get it passed last year so now it's just a rag where if they open
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.120]  investigation you can't leave the us that's right that's capital controls that's right what do you
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:33.360]  make of and that's holding an investigation that doesn't mean you're being convicted of anything
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.240]  so in other words if if alex jones there's not even an indictment no if you want to leave the
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.720]  country all they gotta do is say well we've got him under investigation bam you're you're shut down
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.400]  you can't go and people like well that sounds good oh really that's only in north korea nazi
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.880]  germany for folks that don't know history when that happens to a country everyone flees in fear i
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.320]  mean i mean folks don't know the stuff that's already happened here is like a death sentence for a
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.520]  country i mean it's like red level we're in critical condition yep it's all over but the
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.240]  shouting and but like you said earlier you get it's time you're gonna have to pick side you know
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.920]  you you're gonna be the side of freedom or you're not uh and the thing is people of good conscious
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:18.080]  can disagree and still be free i mean i'll grant you your freedom to believe worship whatever you
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.960]  want to do as long as you're not in my face with it you know and i think you would grant me the same
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:27.280]  right exactly but the so-called liberals running the pentagon say you can't be a christian we'll
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.000]  have you arrested i can't believe they're even i mean it just shows these people are nuts well
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.280]  and it's the same thing they had they observed ramadan in washington but they wouldn't let them
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.160]  put up a christmas tree you know wait a minute i mean why do you think they're so after christians
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.200]  because i i mean what's going on there well because christians have a history of freedom and of
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:53.840]  supporting even though they do go for you know render in their Caesar they nevertheless have
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.280]  always been for freedom that's that this country was founded mostly by people fleeing europe who
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:05.200]  wanted to practice their version of christianity exactly but that's the modern hitler christianity
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.080]  of romans 13 do what the government says they're afraid of the real christianity that led the
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:16.240]  rebellion against king george the third right in 1776 well in the new testament they asked jesus his
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:22.080]  disciples do they say should we pay taxes and what did he say he said go down the river catch a fish
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:27.760]  if you find a coin in the fishes mouth then pay it as taxes well that's what are the odds of finding
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.960]  a coin in fishes mouth not very well that's why that's why paul said render under Caesar because
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.800]  that's his face is on it yeah that's his system he issued that money it is his that's right but

[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:18.160]  well jer
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:33.040]  well jerseil and post is reporting that sheldon adelson noted billionaire businessman casino
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:39.280]  owner and who also owns newspapers in israel suggested the u.s should use nuclear weapons
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:45.040]  on iran to impose its demands from position of strength folks imagine saying preemptively nuke
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:53.200]  iran blow up a city killing million people that's an international war crime and that just shows the
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:59.520]  madness that's going on as iran actually tries to make deals like qaddafi did so they double
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:05.040]  crossing put al qaeda in charge our own allies got double crossed in egypt al qaeda put in charge
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.520]  now the same thing in syria i'm going to get jim marz's take on this and talk about some attacks
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.800]  on free speech in america that are currently going on but here's a clip of him american jewish
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:21.840]  billionaire blast obama over negotiations with tay ron here's a clip of the audio you pick up your cell
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:28.240]  phone and you call somewhere in nebraska and you say okay let it go so there's an atomic weapon
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:34.800]  goes over ballistic missiles in the middle of the desert that doesn't hurt a soul maybe a couple
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.880]  of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever and then you and then you say see the next one is in the
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:48.560]  middle of the desert so we mean business you want to be wiped out go ahead take a tough position
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:55.040]  and continue with you don't believe in development you want to be peaceful and everybody hears
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:02.720]  so so so nuke nuke some rural area and then and then several i mean it's just madness and again
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.960]  i'm not on the side of israel iran i'm on the side of just common law i'm not iranian i'm not israeli
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:16.880]  i'm just an american who is just so sick of i mean the west has radicalized islam destabilized the
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.400]  middle east going back to british intelligence that hitler took it over we owe the muslims an
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:28.000]  apology if you really study history for how we've meddled in their affairs and put radicals in
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.400]  every time i try to put some mainline guy in our government takes some out and puts radicals in
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.560]  that's that's why this is so evil because you could argue there's radicalism there a threat
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.760]  but when you help radicalize them just so you can take american liberty jim marz you're an expert
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:46.320]  on this what do you have to say well it's just amazing i mean what you're talking about is
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:50.480]  absolutely true but then that's ancient history let's talk about like right now just the last
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:56.400]  12 years al-qaeda is supposed to be we're supposed to be in a death battle with al-qaeda right and on
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:03.440]  september the 17th uh of this year obama waived the portion of the law that prohibits american
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:09.520]  companies from providing weaponry to terrorist groups so that he could arm the syrian rebels
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.880]  half of whom are al-qaeda and it actually said arm terrorist yes it actually said arm terrorist
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.600]  yes because he wants to arm the terrorist now you know what kind of game are we playing and of
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.520]  course the whole war on terrorism things a joke to begin with because let me tell you something
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.400]  think about this and i say documents came out last week that they they were trying to gag us over it
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.440]  where they admitted in court it's all fake it's all fake and and anybody with any if you use your
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.720]  brain you can tell that because here's the deal we're supposed to be so afraid of an international
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:45.520]  terrorist group trying to slip weapons of mass destruction in our country to destroy our freedoms
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:51.200]  and yet what have they done to secure the border nothing okay and and yet you go to the airport
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:55.440]  and the tsa is all over you take off your belt take off your shoes take off your jacket empty
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.280]  your pockets no now they're spying on everything you do outside your house without warrants nsa but
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.720]  wait you go rent a private airplane and you go fly to anyone the little thousands of airports
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.880]  all around the united states and there's no x-ray machines there's no nothing i'm no jet
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.960]  setter but i know a lot of hollywood folks that'll literally say hey we want you for a party tomorrow
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:20.720]  night in l.a the jets landing and a wide body jet lands for folks that don't know how these people
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.120]  live and there's a butler on there and you that's right or if you're really in trouble a couple
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:31.440]  of girls in swimsuits you gotta say no i'm married but the point is is that is that it is no i d no
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:38.240]  nothing nothing you fly from texas to la and land at the private airport over near their private
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:43.440]  hangar and you can unload your baggage and your anthrax and your nuclear oh yeah it's totally
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.040]  hell just like god just like the bin laden family when all their traffic was grounded they were
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:55.600]  allowed to fly out 15 flights right and uh and richard uh the uh clark the head of the anti-terrorist
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:02.160]  team said well okay you can do that but they needed to be debrief first by the fbi but they
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:07.360]  were not nobody even questioned them they all the ears the bin laden family gets to fly out of the
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.680]  united states uh you know in a free ticket uh and and won't stop one question the general public
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:19.200]  has no idea how fake this is it's total fake and then and but look at the look at the billions of
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:25.840]  dollars trillions probably that have been poured into the war on terrorism and then you look around
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:31.680]  you see the school systems falling you see the bridges the roads the infrastructures fall apart
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:36.160]  think of all the good we could do with this money that we've been squandering and over there 12 years
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.560]  of warfare in iraq and they're right back where they started from fighting between the suna and
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:47.040]  the shiites and who knows okay the general public has no idea you know that's why i got so mad and
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.840]  it won't wake up that's what i don't understand that's why i got so mad at ben aflac he admitted
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:57.360]  he only flies on private jets good for him he earned the money but he goes oh let the tsa do
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.880]  whatever they want shut up and do it he doesn't fly commercial neither do those congressmen they
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:10.080]  don't get searched except except for ted kennedy he he got on the no fly list and got stopped three
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.920]  of four which shows no judge no jury listen let's shift gears because i want to get into a bunch of
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.400]  news with you now for those that don't know it's been the dallas morning news it's been in the dallas
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.400]  observer and i'm going to be there this 22nd hard to believe i was talking about this a year ago now
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.760]  it's here yeah they've said no one is allowed in nealy plaza for the fifth anniversary who doesn't
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.480]  agree with the official story you've got to be invited well it's a public park and then no demonstrations
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:38.240]  around it they're announcing a violation of the first amendment so the international press and
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:42.880]  others this is going to be the strizand effect and you know what that is where she didn't want media
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.040]  covering her so it made it bigger right i'm going to be there everybody needs to be there with her
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.840]  bullhorns and their fliers the press will all cover us and it'll all be about how they're trying
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.960]  to censor us plus every poll shows 90% know they killed kennedy i mean it doesn't matter but it just
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.520]  shows what thugs they are tell folks you live up by dallas what's happening jim mars well what's
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:07.520]  happening is for 50 years uh the various groups and various researchers and various uh kennedy
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:13.760]  files have uh tried to get a permit to go into the daily plaza and officially hold some ceremony
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:17.840]  and the city never would issue a permit they said it's a public park you can go in and do what you
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:24.640]  want to do okay well this year 50th anniversary the city fathers of and mothers of dallas decided
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.600]  that oops you know foreign press may be there and we don't want anybody telling anything other than
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:36.480]  the official oswald did it alone theory and so they for a couple hundred bucks got a permit
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.600]  and seal it's gonna seal off the park for four or five days and i'm not letting anybody in there
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.480]  unless you buy a ticket and then when you buy a ticket you can't pick up the ticket until the morning
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:51.440]  of the event and then you have to go funnel through the police checkpoints and then you
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:58.800]  have to be vetted by the dallas police so in other words i know people who are conspiracy researchers
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:04.640]  who cannot even get onto their website or get registered and get one of these tickets there
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:10.320]  that this no no it's gonna be selected lap dogs this is gonna blow up in their face royal well i
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.880]  would i mean i would hope everybody i don't even get it they let us in it be less of a story
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.040]  than the fact that they didn't know what they're idiots i know they are they're shooting themselves
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.160]  squirreling the foot it's like the nsa had put out a 30 minute pro nsa thing saying shut down the
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:31.680]  press it has a record 8 000 down votes 100 pro votes it has the record negative votes on youtube
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:38.000]  right well i would hope everybody that's listening to your voice today in mind would simply decide
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.360]  they're going to go to the park on that uh friday afternoon 50 years after uh this whole country
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:48.640]  took a turn for the worse the foreign banks had a coup and took a big dump on us you mean yep
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.760]  absolutely in fact what's uh now becoming quite clear to everybody is that uh uh obviously you
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:02.000]  don't kill the chief executive of the country uh unless you have taken pains to see that the person
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.960]  that takes his place doesn't come after you so obviously johnson's name is being now thrown around
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:15.840]  more widely than ever although i can recall on the day of the kennedy assassination there were
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:22.720]  many people who quietly and under their breath were saying linden has a hand in this they knew
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.920]  well his lawyer has said that yeah now we're now a lawyer now a secret service guy and there's
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.400]  it's all coming out now but again we're not supposed to talk about it and you can't go to
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:36.720]  db plus and try to raise question i've been on airplanes flying from dallas to austin but like
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:41.920]  high powered people i mean my family was in dallas it's a big joke they know where that everybody

[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:27.760]  dalas you were saying you would crystallize as you did for my son rex before you came live with us
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:34.400]  the essence of questioning the official story of the jfk assassination 50 years ago yeah well
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.040]  we're hitting into the 50th anniversary and there's already been a spate of books come out and
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:44.560]  and you're going to see tv specials and retrospectives and all this who and i and and people just
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:50.240]  can't accept that a loner can change history and i guess we'll never know and it's it's just too
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:54.800]  controversial let me cut through all of this okay let's just use our common sense here here's the
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.840]  deal it here's the candy assassination and nutshell if you trust the government then you trust the
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:05.200]  evidence they presented and it's pretty damn and you believe monkeys might fly out of my petudia
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.080]  yeah and it's a well it pretty well proves oswald did it okay but if you don't trust the government
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.160]  then you begin to look at that evidence and when the closer you look at it it all starts falling
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:18.960]  apart okay the fingerprints on the rifle the funeral home director said the fb i came in
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:25.920]  put his dead hand on the gun okay uh the x-rays and medical the hundreds of dead witnesses dead
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:32.640]  witnesses the the autopsy x-rays and photographs the men who took them not not conspiracy theorists
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:37.520]  i'm talking about floyd revie took the photographs and jerald custer who took the x-rays now say the
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.800]  ones they're showing us in the national archives are fakes phonies and not the ones they took the
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:49.440]  documents were altered congress found it was a conspiracy exactly the last official word of the
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:54.560]  u.s government said it was probably conspiracy because they had two sets of acoustical scientists
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:59.280]  who said at least one shot came from the grassy and now they've got this flotilla of whitewash
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.600]  is going on that's right and they're going to try to keep anyone who's got a descending voice
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:11.120]  from the oswald did it alone theory out of dealie plaza on the day of the 50th good luck with that
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:15.840]  dumbasses i think they're shooting themselves in a foot i would hope everyone would just
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.720]  trek over to dealie plaza and just show up just to be in a public park that's publicly taken
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.040]  oh yeah it's going to blow up in their face for oil are you going to be there i'm going to be there
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.080]  all right i already said a year ago i wasn't when they said no free speech there which they've never
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:35.680]  done they won't give us a permit but now these other jolly rogers they get one oh yeah the sixth
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:41.440]  floor museum which is uh it claims to make no particular statement of opinion and yet they've
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:47.280]  plexiglassed off the the wind of the sixth floor the old book depository so that no one can get up
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:51.920]  there and look out and see that there's a tree intervening in the line of sight to the road
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:56.160]  but i mean you have all the witnesses seeing them shooting uh let's put up the strizand effect for
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:00.960]  those that don't know want to read it the strizand effect is a phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.400]  remove or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:11.840]  more widely usually facilitated by the internet it is named after america entertainer barbers
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:17.760]  strizand who attempted in 2003 to suppress photographs of her residents in malibu california
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:24.240]  and inadvertently gathering further publicity uh i mean the that's the good news is none of this is
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:32.080]  working no no well truth will out you know and this is the truth and uh i've taught a course on
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:37.840]  the kennedy assassination for 30 years at the university of texas in arlington and uh and that
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:43.840]  goes back 30 years and i haven't seen anything to change the conclusions that i've discovered and
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:48.160]  that were found by the house last nation's committee look off record i know people that
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:51.520]  are related to lbj that talked about what he said for you had a heart attack and died
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:56.960]  i mean it's none of this is a secret no i mean i've interviewed his mistress all of it and
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:01.120]  hey people say well it went higher than him sure he was just their puppet right but the military
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:06.160]  from your research jim you're probably no doubt the leading world expert on jfk in fact there's no
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:12.080]  probably about it who was behind it what were the reasons okay i'll tell you what well number one
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:17.200]  yes linden johnson was the most powerful senator on capitol hill he was head of the arm services
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.680]  committee he was the guy that had his hand on the purse strings of the military so anything the
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:27.920]  military did he they were like you know two sides of the same coin all right they wanted vietnam
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:33.440]  that's number one kennedy was going to disengage and that's number uh that's number one reason
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:39.520]  number two reason uh is that his brother bobby was prosecuting organized crime and it's been
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:43.760]  said by a member of the kennedy family if they'd been left alone if kennedy had lived they would have
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:48.960]  broken the back of organized crime in the united states think what kind of country we have today
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:54.400]  with no organized crime no instead we're run by organized crime right and the other thing is is
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:00.880]  that uh in october kennedy issued a memorandum to the head of the cia demanding that they turn over
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:07.120]  all their files on ufo's biggest secret we got going said a deadline and he was going to abolish
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:13.760]  the federal reserve and that's the key the next key thing is in a summer of 63 issued 4.2 billion
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:19.360]  dollars through the treasury department rather than the federal reserve system the money wasn't
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:25.520]  worth any more or less but we didn't have to pay interest on it and by the way foreign bankers
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.080]  exactly by the way i'm sure you've already mentioned to your audience that this december the hundred
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:36.560]  year uh uh december 23rd is the hundred year anniversary of the three senators voting through
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:42.000]  the private federal reserve that is as private as my big toe so we don't have i mean i mean the
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.880]  federal reserve is as federal as my big toe we don't have to put on a huge big effort like
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:52.800]  ron paul was asking for uh to audit or anything else all we have to do is not renew their charter
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:56.480]  but notice there's no discussion of that happening no you're not going to hear that in the mainstream
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:02.800]  media jim mars we've got about five minutes left in this live sunday transmission i see positive
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.520]  things happening folks are waking up to the nsa the police take the military saying no to the
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:12.000]  marshal law plans they're testing folks say well they're not doing it we have to discredit it so
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.800]  they don't try to do it they're trying to sell it to the military that shows they're trying to go
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:22.640]  operational i see a lot of positive stuff happening i see a big awakening but also see the tyranny
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:27.760]  pouring in like a flood where are we historically how big is the awakening happening what is your
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:33.520]  uh as a wise owl what is your perspective the guy's been around you know since the 60s before
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.680]  we start telegram what is your gut tell you about the future for my children your grandchildren
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:45.840]  well my gut tells me we're in a precarious situation in the united states today it may
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.880]  be a little too late to save the republic and it's a little too soon to start shooting those bastards
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:59.120]  so we're in pretty bad shape pretty bad shape but as you said there is a consciousness raising
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:04.400]  going on and there's more and more people waking up but i would say as an admonition to those folks
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:11.680]  when you wake up go try to wake up your neighbors but actually though here's the problem alex you
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:17.680]  can always wake up somebody who's asleep but you can never wake up someone who's pretending to be
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.160]  asleep and we have too many people in this country today pretending to be asleep because they don't
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.800]  want to deal with it that's profound because i run into people that go actually i know you're
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:31.360]  right but what do i do they feel powerless right and it's like if you just start resisting and
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:37.280]  saying no it's over but they've just given in i can't imagine the feeling of just giving into the
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.680]  worst common denominator because when you give into tyranny you let the worst people in the world
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:48.240]  run things and the last time i was flying out of a dfw international there must have been 500
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.240]  people gathered up there in those you know back and forth lines waiting to go through tsa and they
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:56:01.760]  had maybe maybe 10 tsa guys there you know people if they had any backbone and should simply say
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.800]  look this is wrong i'm gonna go to my plane and walk on through there you know 10 people can't
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.640]  stop 500 sure and the terrorists would shut down the airport and say they were keeping it safe the
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.680]  truth is the people they represent run the terrorist right staged it all right to seize control of
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:20.960]  society isn't that clear isn't it clear now they did all this to take over so they could rob our
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:26.240]  bank accounts and put out obama care i mean it's clear they did it and they've been caught doing it
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:32.560]  they are the terrorists and obama care obviously is nothing very little to do with medical and it
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:37.360]  has everything to do with data mining they're trying to get everybody's bank account number and
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:40.960]  and that's right and and then grab your bank account because you didn't buy obama care you
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:47.360]  can't buy exactly and now the proof of that is is that when they try to launch their big
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:52.000]  website for everybody's sign up it doesn't even work well jim mars i want to thank you for joining
