[00:00:04.898 --> 00:00:09.740]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.321]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:12.861]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:17.043]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.043 --> 00:00:25.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.027 --> 00:00:29.989]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:35.002]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours until 3 p.m.
[00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:41.143]  Central Standard Time today, and of course many stations re-air us at different times, but we're live right now at 11 a.m.
[00:00:41.143 --> 00:00:45.884]  and 45 seconds Central Standard Time.
[00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:48.024]  I think Drudge Report says it all.
[00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:55.386]  We just keep going back to Drudge because Drudge knows how to just simply encapsulate the populist sentiment.
[00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:11.180]  Whether it be a photo of Facebook owner and founder Zuckerberg not wearing a artificial reality headset and marching in front of a crowd of a thousand of his minions wearing the goggles.
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.845]  They're obviously being dehumanized, put into a mass trance, losing their humanity.
[00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:24.789]  He is walking amongst the vegetables that he's growing in his garden.
[00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:29.343]  Then there's this image at DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:31.044]  The nominee!
[00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:44.994]  You've got his blonde hair in the back as he leans over a crowd of fawning men and women like it was a 1956 Elvis concert.
[00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:49.898]  And a lot of mainstream media said Drudge is trolling the MSM.
[00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:52.559]  Drudge saying he's the nominee.
[00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:54.301]  Well, he's got more delegates
[00:01:56.664 --> 00:02:00.608]  Then Mitt Romney did at this stage in 2012 and 2008.
[00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:13.262]  He has way more than, of course, John McCain, who they were saying was the presumptive nominees both times, with less.
[00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:18.448]  But they still just keep saying he can't win, he can't have it, we won't allow it, the pub says so, Obama says so.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.502]  And many others say so.
[00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:24.985]  The social justice warriors control reality.
[00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.067]  They just tell us this is off limits.
[00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:30.770]  And people are revolting against that.
[00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.052]  And so he is the nominee.
[00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:38.594]  Barring super dirty tricks, election fraud, or assassination.
[00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:41.476]  And I want to be clear, I'm not saying they're going to kill Trump.
[00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:43.056]  The media has misrepresented that.
[00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:47.679]  I'm saying that is definitely in the cards.
[00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:55.843]  And I think everybody knows that's a very reasonable statement that Trump, for all intents and purposes, as I said yesterday, is on the equivalent of a suicide mission.
[00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:07.510]  Doesn't mean that you're going to die, it means it's one of the most dangerous missions you can carry out, and that the death card is in the tarot deck.
[00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.991]  And I think we all need to realize the danger Donald Trump's in.
[00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:24.114]  I've been very skeptical of Trump, as everybody knows, over the last few years, and even up until about five, six months ago, but when you call for auditing the Fed, when you talk about 9-11 truth, and scare the daylights out of the establishment, the Clintons and the Bushes,
[00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:37.301]  When you destroy political correctness, when you call for cutting taxes on poor people, when you call for not letting China and India make bad deals, that's not protectionism.
[00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:41.324]  That's them making one-sided deals that screw us over.
[00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:45.288]  He's hitting the populist zeitgeist and he's saying everything that needs to be said.
[00:03:45.288 --> 00:03:51.453]  And he says a few things that I think are wrong and misconstrued, like the whole Apple passcode thing on the FBI.
[00:03:54.162 --> 00:04:03.568]  Separate from that, there's a reason the Democrat and Republican and even foreign Davos-type power structures are scared of Donald Trump.
[00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:09.151]  And it's because he threatens their existing system, and we know their existing system is very bad.
[00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:11.292]  Is it a gamble going for Trump?
[00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.674]  Absolutely.
[00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:21.839]  But it is a gamble where the odds are a lot better than going with any of the other establishment candidates.
[00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:24.942]  And they know he can win.
[00:04:24.942 --> 00:04:27.723]  They know in major polls he beats Hillary right now.
[00:04:27.723 --> 00:04:33.645]  The British oddsmakers now have him a easy winner.
[00:04:33.645 --> 00:04:41.327]  Just a year ago, he was several hundred to one that he couldn't.
[00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:43.267]  So you see the big change there.
[00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:48.249]  We'll have the caucus numbers and more straight ahead as we look towards Super Tuesday.
[00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.880]  Now, only six and a half days away.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.301]  Big broadcast lined up.
[00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:58.862]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:09.965]  In addition to threatening to invade Syria and Al-Bashar al-Assad, Saudi Arabia says it wants to arm jihadists in the country with anti-aircraft missiles to take out Russian jets.
[00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:13.566]  We believe that introducing surface-to-air missiles in Syria is
[00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:14.046]  We're good to go!
[00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:43.859]  Even the New York Times admits there are few, if any, moderate rebels fighting in Syria.
[00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:52.404]  Despite this reality, Secretary of State John Kerry and British Prime Minister David Cameron continue to insist there are moderates fighting against Assad.
[00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:56.247]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[00:05:58.496 --> 00:06:01.998]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:01.998 --> 00:06:10.263]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:15.666]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:06:58.343 --> 00:07:04.090]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:18.526]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver, and fused it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:26.790]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:32.212]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:07:32.212 --> 00:07:35.934]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.

[00:07:40.056 --> 00:07:43.938]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:48.501]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:07.615]  I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just, you know, sit back because here they come again.
[00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.080]  Wake up, America!
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.700]  Wake up, world!
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:27.923]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.923 --> 00:08:29.324]  I'm running for president.
[00:08:29.324 --> 00:08:33.005]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:36.926]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:38.467]  I've come too far!
[00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:40.608]  I ain't no ways tired!
[00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:42.548]  What was that?
[00:08:42.548 --> 00:08:43.689]  Is that a dog?
[00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:49.875]  Uh-uh.
[00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:53.499]  It has been reported you've made five million making speeches.
[00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:56.923]  The president's made more than a hundred million dollars.
[00:08:56.923 --> 00:08:59.447]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:08:59.447 --> 00:09:02.571]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:03.352]  My sister-in-law.
[00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:14.734]  Another conspiracy theory.
[00:09:14.734 --> 00:09:16.616]  Have you always told the truth?
[00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:18.177]  I've always tried to.
[00:09:18.177 --> 00:09:19.098]  Always.
[00:09:19.098 --> 00:09:19.879]  Always.
[00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:23.262]  I will fight to rein in Wall Street, and you know what?
[00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.984]  I know how to do it!
[00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:29.187]  We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.
[00:09:29.187 --> 00:09:31.749]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[00:09:31.749 --> 00:09:38.475]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[00:09:44.103 --> 00:09:45.249]  It's a little sick.
[00:09:45.249 --> 00:09:45.893]  Open up.
[00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:47.240]  Come on, take it.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.602]  Take it!
[00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:09.490]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.632]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:10:11.632 --> 00:10:13.573]  Because there is a war on.
[00:10:13.573 --> 00:10:16.115]  For your mind.
[00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.636]  We are going to be very busy patriots.
[00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:21.939]  Very busy truth tellers today.
[00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:26.882]  Very busy revolutionaries against the globalist tyranny.
[00:10:26.882 --> 00:10:28.983]  Wow, there's a lot of stuff to cover here.
[00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:31.625]  It is overwhelming.
[00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:34.287]  Obviously Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee for
[00:10:37.486 --> 00:10:40.949]  The Republican nomination.
[00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:46.213]  He's got as many delegates as Reagan had at this time back in 1980.
[00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:52.038]  He's got way more than Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates of the past like John McCain have had.
[00:10:52.038 --> 00:10:54.200]  We've got an article breaking down those numbers.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.842]  We'll get to them.
[00:10:55.842 --> 00:11:00.466]  The entire establishment is in a complete conniption fit against Donald Trump.
[00:11:00.466 --> 00:11:04.009]  And I admit that he is an unknown quantity, an unknown country.
[00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.936]  When it comes to a political track record.
[00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:28.854]  But what he's done the last year, destroying political correctness, lifting up a standard to promote Americana and free market, exposing 9-11 and criminal involvement of the Saudis and elements of our government, calling for the audit of the private run for private Federal Reserve, the list goes on and on.
[00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:32.237]  What he's done, and the fact that he's so receptive
[00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:45.990]  When people corrected him about the refugee crisis, he went from saying, bring them in, to saying, oh my gosh, we didn't know there were terrorists amongst them, and they weren't being vetted, don't bring them in.
[00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:51.654]  And when we said, hey, audit the private Federal Reserve, he's like, you bet.
[00:11:51.654 --> 00:11:55.077]  Hey, come out and expose Bush for 9-11.
[00:11:55.077 --> 00:11:57.059]  Did it.
[00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:01.282]  And I'm not bragging, a lot of folks in the grassroots are bringing this to Trump, but we brought it directly to him.
[00:12:04.312 --> 00:12:05.773]  So he's very, very responsive.
[00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:06.934]  He's aware of what's going on.
[00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:12.358]  And according to people that have known him for 40 years, he does not like the New World Order.
[00:12:12.358 --> 00:12:13.699]  And here's the deal.
[00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:16.320]  Roger Stone is going to be in studio for an hour and a half on Friday.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.822]  He's coming to Austin to be on the show.
[00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:22.345]  We're bringing him down here from New York.
[00:12:22.345 --> 00:12:31.071]  And he's been banned from CNN as of yesterday for saying some of their commentators are dumber than dog manure, which is true.
[00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:39.444]  But really it's because he's such an effective Trump supporter.
[00:12:39.444 --> 00:12:41.685]  But if they can ban Stone for that, they can ban anything.
[00:12:41.685 --> 00:12:45.265]  And the fact is that they say they're banning someone.
[00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:49.646]  We all know that I've basically been banned from Fox and CNN and I don't even really care.
[00:12:49.646 --> 00:12:57.628]  Most of the time I wouldn't even return their phone calls back when they wanted me on all the time.
[00:12:57.628 --> 00:13:00.109]  Stone has compared it to, you know, Soviet-style America.
[00:13:00.109 --> 00:13:00.749]  This is happening.
[00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:01.729]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:10.864]  Ron Paul, who I really respect, has come out and said that he would not support Trump as a GOP nominee.
[00:13:10.864 --> 00:13:13.406]  Paul doesn't support the other mainline Republicans.
[00:13:17.054 --> 00:13:20.515]  If he doesn't win the nomination, the last two times he ran because he's a purist.
[00:13:20.515 --> 00:13:22.095]  And I respect that from a purist.
[00:13:22.095 --> 00:13:29.817]  If you want to know where I'm coming from, I'm a purist, but I'm also a military political strategist.
[00:13:29.817 --> 00:13:30.317]  I've studied it.
[00:13:30.317 --> 00:13:32.258]  I know truth's the ultimate weapon.
[00:13:32.258 --> 00:13:33.118]  That's what I stand with.
[00:13:33.118 --> 00:13:35.099]  There are a lot of dirty tricks we can play.
[00:13:35.099 --> 00:13:36.039]  We can join the dark side.
[00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:37.179]  We don't use that.
[00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:38.160]  We use the truth.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.380]  So I'll be completely truthful with you.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.601]  Trump's an unknown country.
[00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:45.322]  He is light years better than Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and some of the others.
[00:13:45.322 --> 00:13:48.303]  And the system's scared of him.
[00:13:48.303 --> 00:13:50.684]  And he's responsive to the people.
[00:13:50.684 --> 00:13:51.845]  He's aggressive.
[00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:53.646]  He's got courage.
[00:13:53.646 --> 00:13:58.928]  And he definitely could have come in and suckered people for the globalists.
[00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:00.068]  He's not doing that.
[00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:06.771]  The things he's done are so devastating to them that it's irreversible, much of it.
[00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:22.126]  And he's riding a wave, surfing a wave, a very dangerous wave, for all of us, of massive populist anger against the system, the government, the corporations, where 90 plus percent of Americans believe the U.S.
[00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:24.627]  government's the number one threat to them and their families.
[00:14:24.627 --> 00:14:35.454]  And no amount of armored vehicles, no amount of propaganda, no amount of fluoride in the water, no amount of brainwashing of the children in public schools is going to reverse this sentiment that's only going to intensify.
[00:14:36.812 --> 00:14:46.277]  I mean, you know the country's in a revolution against tyranny when one of the top TV producers in the country says, my new X-Files series isn't really going to be aliens.
[00:14:46.277 --> 00:14:50.819]  It's going to be government conspiracies, eugenics, and the material Alex Jones covers.
[00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:56.182]  We get our material and research from Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:14:56.182 --> 00:15:04.666]  That shows that by the time mainstream has picked up on what we've done and where we are going, we're already light years past it.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:21.704]  And InfoWars is only one small part of a larger constellation, or fleet, of resistance, and it's exponentially growing.
[00:15:21.704 --> 00:15:33.588]  If people think the singularity of awakening is already hot, and already explosive, and already seismic, and already electric, and already colossal, and magical, and growing explosively,
[00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:41.072]  Understand, this is only the detonation you're seeing, not the explosion.
[00:15:41.072 --> 00:15:49.177]  Just like you got a howitzer round, you're putting in a big field piece artillery.
[00:15:49.177 --> 00:15:55.280]  And you've got that little cap on the back that maybe uses the amount of gunpowder that you could put in a nickel.
[00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:07.578]  But the pin hits it, it explodes, detonating all the powder in front of it and firing the munition out the tube.
[00:16:07.578 --> 00:16:25.306]  And what you've seen so far is the detonation of the cap, but now in slow motion, the charge is exploding and driving the munition down the barrel.
[00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:27.487]  So that's what everybody sees, it's what you feel.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.643]  It's the globalists running around like chickens with their heads cut off, panicking.
[00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:38.849]  Like it's a ship on fire.
[00:16:38.849 --> 00:16:42.131]  They're all trying to pass buckets of water along to each other, but they're infighting.
[00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:43.493]  Some are jumping overboard and escaping.
[00:16:44.656 --> 00:16:47.518]  All the disarray you see is failure by the system.
[00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:52.002]  And all their bravado attempts are nothing but attempts.
[00:16:52.002 --> 00:16:53.043]  They have to survive.
[00:16:53.043 --> 00:17:09.776]  Just like Hillary Clinton needs to fail forward and become president to give herself a pardon, or hope Obama gives her one, and to keep everybody blackmailed and in line, the whole New World Order has to get more power and get in full control because they're a cornered creature.
[00:17:09.776 --> 00:17:10.677]  They were too greedy.
[00:17:10.677 --> 00:17:11.938]  They pushed too hard.
[00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:13.039]  They dug too deeply.
[00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:23.746]  And awaken things older than them, like human survival and human destiny.
[00:17:23.746 --> 00:17:32.811]  And all of our ancestors will, genetically transmitted through us, like electricity.
[00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:33.251]  You understand?
[00:17:35.026 --> 00:17:44.010]  Touch your oldest ancestor through the genetic line of each parent before you who physically came out of the womb and out of the genetics of the last person.
[00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:48.291]  You are physically connected to your most ancient ancestors.
[00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:49.932]  You live on through them.
[00:17:49.932 --> 00:17:50.952]  They live on through you.
[00:17:50.952 --> 00:17:53.393]  And that's not spiritual.
[00:17:53.393 --> 00:17:54.614]  That is genetic.
[00:17:54.614 --> 00:18:01.637]  But once you study the genetics, you then notice the spiritual because that's only the cherry on top.
[00:18:01.637 --> 00:18:03.117]  And the system knows this.
[00:18:03.117 --> 00:18:04.518]  They are scared to death of it.
[00:18:06.257 --> 00:18:08.701]  And they want to suppress it.
[00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:18.679]  And so Trump is a manifestation of the human will to suck air into its lungs and to be strong and healthy.
[00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:19.621]  To be strong and free.
[00:18:22.532 --> 00:18:26.673]  I have a political correct stack here today that is the worst I've ever seen.
[00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:29.394]  The level of brainwashing is unprecedented.
[00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:31.554]  But first we're going to get into Trump, what happened in the caucus.
[00:18:31.554 --> 00:18:33.195]  We're going to get into the latest with Hillary.
[00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:37.176]  Judge orders Discovery to go forward over Clinton private email server.
[00:18:37.176 --> 00:18:45.718]  We've got Black Lives Matter just engaged in their normal, horrible activities because their sorrows run.
[00:18:48.248 --> 00:18:53.670]  And we've got GOP judiciary, no hearing on Obama, court nominee.
[00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.791]  That will force Obama to try some emergency appointment, which he can't even do either.
[00:18:58.791 --> 00:19:01.692]  Not for the Supreme Court, unless there's, quote, a civil emergency.
[00:19:01.692 --> 00:19:02.532]  So look for that.
[00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:05.473]  We're going to find out real quick if they killed Scalia or not.
[00:19:05.473 --> 00:19:12.075]  If they go around the Constitution like they've been doing at unprecedented levels, then we know.
[00:19:12.075 --> 00:19:14.716]  Russia takes concrete steps towards Syria ceasefire.
[00:19:16.052 --> 00:19:20.879]  Turkey continues shelling, speaking of artillery rounds, Ministry of Defense reports.
[00:19:20.879 --> 00:19:23.883]  You may not care about Rick Perry, but this is important.
[00:19:23.883 --> 00:19:30.232]  Texas court dismissed his second felony charge against former Governor Rick Perry, who did nothing.
[00:19:31.564 --> 00:19:34.226]  He should have gotten an award for what he did.
[00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:35.427]  He has the veto power.
[00:19:35.427 --> 00:19:42.011]  It's a state-funded bill to give money to the, quote, ethics boards over counties.
[00:19:42.011 --> 00:19:49.617]  They have an ethics officer and the county attorney that got caught drunk falling down all over the street and everything and spitting on police.
[00:19:49.617 --> 00:19:52.899]  He said, no, I'm vetoing Travis County getting that money until you remove her.
[00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:56.342]  They indicted him, just like they've indicted the Attorney General.
[00:19:56.342 --> 00:19:57.743]  They're going after Republicans, folks.
[00:19:59.702 --> 00:20:03.404]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[00:20:03.404 --> 00:20:08.867]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[00:20:08.867 --> 00:20:15.571]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:19.813]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[00:20:19.813 --> 00:20:22.575]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:23.995]  Well now, so do I!

[00:22:27.884 --> 00:22:30.945]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:22:30.945 --> 00:22:33.567]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:33.567 --> 00:22:34.327]  Croix River.
[00:22:34.327 --> 00:22:35.367]  I loved my dad.
[00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:36.548]  But boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:36.548 --> 00:22:39.509]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:40.389]  His excuse?
[00:22:40.389 --> 00:22:41.730]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.331]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:49.093]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:24:24.074 --> 00:24:27.517]  And Donald Trump is the cult of personality.
[00:24:27.517 --> 00:24:28.838]  Is he a dictator in the making?
[00:24:28.838 --> 00:24:36.284]  Well, we already have a dictatorship of the executive and the private federal reserve run by an oligarchy of offshore banks.
[00:24:36.284 --> 00:24:38.806]  So, I'm not hoping for a dictator to block him.
[00:24:38.806 --> 00:24:52.297]  I'm hoping for an Americana man of strength to rally the people to kick the offshore globalists out of here and at least not let them bankrupt the country so they can consolidate and buy it all up.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:14.265]  And if we have a debate about that, if we have a discussion about that, if we have a discussion about the TPP taking over our sovereignty with the EU in these secret treaties, which are being negotiated right now, you won't be able to have it because it's so flagrantly illegal, it's so flagrantly conquest.
[00:25:14.265 --> 00:25:16.665]  We really are an occupied nation.
[00:25:16.665 --> 00:25:18.946]  We really are under Soviet-style brainwashing.
[00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:21.696]  That our government's using.
[00:25:21.696 --> 00:25:23.357]  Nothing to do with the Russians.
[00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:25.037]  We really are in deep trouble.
[00:25:25.037 --> 00:25:28.899]  They really are coming after us.
[00:25:28.899 --> 00:25:33.881]  And I'm not going to digress on this too long because I don't want to bash Lindbeck.
[00:25:33.881 --> 00:25:38.003]  But he's going after Donald Trump.
[00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:40.384]  And he admits he's lost a lot of his audience over doing it.
[00:25:40.384 --> 00:25:45.567]  I think Lindbeck does a lot of good stuff.
[00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:46.447]  He's done a lot of good work.
[00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:54.237]  But I saw the headlines last night and this morning, Glenn Beck saying, Donald Trump supporters are like brown shirts.
[00:25:54.237 --> 00:25:55.738]  They came and bullied us.
[00:25:55.738 --> 00:26:00.163]  And then I went and watched raw footage this morning, spent about 30 minutes researching it.
[00:26:00.163 --> 00:26:04.928]  And Donald Trump said yesterday morning, I'm going to go to every caucus site because there they let you speak.
[00:26:04.928 --> 00:26:06.790]  They have speakers.
[00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.892]  It's very open.
[00:26:07.892 --> 00:26:09.754]  So he went and visited every caucus site.
[00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:22.801]  And then he went and spent like 15 minutes there, like he did everywhere else, went to the door, came in, everybody ran from Beck to see Donald Trump, and then Beck got up on stage and like threw a fit.
[00:26:22.801 --> 00:26:24.882]  The video's just incredible.
[00:26:24.882 --> 00:26:25.862]  I mean, what do you expect?
[00:26:25.862 --> 00:26:31.524]  I'd have said, hey Donald, come on up here!
[00:26:31.524 --> 00:26:38.786]  There's Salon, Donald Trump spectacularly trolls Glenn Beck, crashes his pro Ted Cruz, Nevada caucus speech live on air.
[00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:44.042]  That's what everyone keeps saying.
[00:26:44.042 --> 00:26:50.303]  Just like they say in the news, Drudge trolled the media saying the nominee.
[00:26:50.303 --> 00:26:52.344]  No he didn't!
[00:26:52.344 --> 00:27:00.626]  They were saying that Mitt Romney and John McCain were the presumptive nominees by this point in the election in 2012 and 2008.
[00:27:00.626 --> 00:27:09.268]  Drudge has an article, Trump has won more voters than Romney at this point, 2012, and many more than McCain in 08, and is basically in a dead heat with Ronald Reagan.
[00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:13.672]  He is the guy that can win in all the polls.
[00:27:13.672 --> 00:27:15.573]  He's the guy that can defeat Hillary.
[00:27:15.573 --> 00:27:17.956]  He's got Democrats in record numbers crossing over.
[00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:22.219]  We told you this.
[00:27:22.219 --> 00:27:26.443]  Get ready for this.
[00:27:26.443 --> 00:27:35.551]  He got basically as many Hispanic voters, percentage-wise, as Hillary did in Nevada.
[00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:36.472]  And that's in the stack.
[00:27:39.175 --> 00:27:42.137]  45% of Hispanics voted for him.
[00:27:42.137 --> 00:27:45.499]  That are voting in the caucus.
[00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:47.120]  That is just incredible.
[00:27:48.695 --> 00:28:02.247]  Well I've always found, I mean they had a Gallup poll a year ago where it was something like 78%, they had another one 67%, and another scientific poll, I think it was Mason Dixon, of Hispanic Americans, people that are American citizens, said, yeah, we don't want totally open borders.
[00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:03.188]  Yeah!
[00:28:03.188 --> 00:28:03.989]  Yeah!
[00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:05.410]  Have you been down to Mexico?
[00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.612]  You been to Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala?
[00:28:07.612 --> 00:28:08.874]  They got borders too!
[00:28:08.874 --> 00:28:10.395]  It's dangerous!
[00:28:10.395 --> 00:28:11.035]  It's scary!
[00:28:12.133 --> 00:28:13.214]  It's third world.
[00:28:13.214 --> 00:28:18.498]  Yeah, we can't just have unlimited people here who have no background or criminals.
[00:28:18.498 --> 00:28:22.381]  If somebody wants to come here and has got a good record and can get a job, bring them.
[00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:23.802]  I'm all for bringing in people to work.
[00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:26.064]  I don't care where you're from.
[00:28:26.064 --> 00:28:30.908]  But don't bring in, you know, 300,000 jihadis last year or over in Europe.
[00:28:30.908 --> 00:28:34.531]  It's, you know, four or five million.
[00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:35.692]  It's crazy.
[00:28:35.692 --> 00:28:38.314]  You just can't do it as taxpayers.
[00:28:38.314 --> 00:28:39.455]  Everybody comes here and gets free stuff.
[00:28:40.592 --> 00:28:42.673]  So they're really trying to demonize Trump.
[00:28:42.673 --> 00:28:44.374]  Drudge report on Nevada landslide.
[00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:47.936]  Donald Trump, the nominee.
[00:28:47.936 --> 00:28:50.537]  Nevada presidential caucus results.
[00:28:50.537 --> 00:28:53.098]  Donald Trump, 45.9%.
[00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:56.840]  And he got 45% of the Hispanic vote.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.841]  Boom, see?
[00:28:57.841 --> 00:28:58.921]  Just like the general public.
[00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:00.722]  Just like black people or white people.
[00:29:00.722 --> 00:29:05.925]  And we're seeing 20% shifts in blacks towards Trump, which you never see for Republican candidates.
[00:29:07.227 --> 00:29:12.530]  Because he'll actually go to those communities and say, I'm going to try to develop jobs and I'm going to try to cut taxes for you.
[00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.412]  Obama didn't even go to black neighborhoods.
[00:29:15.412 --> 00:29:22.736]  In fact, they've had articles that he is the president with the least number of visits to black communities since the 30s.
[00:29:22.736 --> 00:29:27.679]  I mean, it is, he just totally ignores the black community because he thinks he's got you.
[00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:29.220]  He thinks he doesn't owe you anything.
[00:29:31.573 --> 00:29:35.756]  Ben Carson claims Obama was raised white, doesn't understand black Americans.
[00:29:35.756 --> 00:29:37.097]  And that's the word from insiders.
[00:29:37.097 --> 00:29:41.160]  Obama is uncomfortable around black people.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.081]  I'm telling you.
[00:29:42.081 --> 00:29:45.083]  The guy has got a silver spoon in his mouth his whole life.
[00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:48.226]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the huge Trump surge.
[00:29:48.226 --> 00:29:49.567]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.567 --> 00:29:51.128]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.128 --> 00:29:52.109]  The Trump tsunami.
[00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:54.771]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.022 --> 00:30:02.883]  Hey, what's going on?
[00:30:02.883 --> 00:30:04.564]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.

[00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:07.747]  Probably nothing.

[00:30:43.306 --> 00:30:43.566]  Ha ha!

[00:32:03.155 --> 00:32:07.917]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:32:07.917 --> 00:32:09.257]  Talk about the effects.
[00:32:09.257 --> 00:32:10.757]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:32:10.757 --> 00:32:12.678]  I have drive to go to the gym.

[00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:15.559]  I feel sexier.
[00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:16.539]  I love it.
[00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:19.520]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.201]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:23.522]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:32:23.522 --> 00:32:24.703]  Consult your physician.

[00:33:13.423 --> 00:33:15.766]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.614 --> 00:33:38.814]  The world is waking up!
[00:33:38.814 --> 00:33:40.415]  Get his childhoods in!
[00:33:40.415 --> 00:33:52.758]  There are conspiracies, there are mafias, there are organized crime syndicates who've tried to organize the world to where they can never be overthrown.
[00:33:52.758 --> 00:33:55.619]  And to teach us that we don't have any power.
[00:33:57.705 --> 00:34:16.478]  The truth is, the minute we realize that we can study how the world really works, that we can organize together and build a system based on free will, based on free association, based on innovation, trailblazing, and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[00:34:16.478 --> 00:34:21.542]  The day you make that choice is the day you really start living.
[00:34:21.542 --> 00:34:27.086]  Television and this mass media culture is gonna suck you dry and make you feel empty.
[00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:38.493]  But facing reality and the great challenging contest of liberty will empower you.
[00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:41.055]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:34:41.055 --> 00:34:49.562]  And Texas, out of the gates, is marching forward to rally the world against this tyranny.
[00:34:49.562 --> 00:34:52.724]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:34:58.909 --> 00:35:02.091]  All right, let's start plowing into the news.
[00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:03.052]  I want to run through a lot of it.
[00:35:03.052 --> 00:35:08.736]  We've got a big special report that took us months to basically put together.
[00:35:08.736 --> 00:35:11.538]  We even went to Rome to document this last year.
[00:35:11.538 --> 00:35:13.960]  It's part of the reason I went there.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.801]  And it ties into a whole bunch of different issues.
[00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:18.183]  And it again proves Donald Trump right yet again.
[00:35:18.183 --> 00:35:22.105]  So we're going to have that special report premiere here in just a moment.
[00:35:22.105 --> 00:35:25.468]  Donald Trump proven right about Vatican having the biggest walls in the world.
[00:35:26.578 --> 00:35:42.371]  They have the New York Times and about a thousand other publications, you can type in the term and look, come out the day after Donald Trump started tweeting photos last week, last Friday, saying that the Pope has his own big walls.
[00:35:42.371 --> 00:35:45.093]  The New York Times came out and said there are not walls.
[00:35:45.093 --> 00:35:49.517]  There's some decorative walls by part of it, but it doesn't have any security and it's wide open.
[00:35:50.373 --> 00:35:53.816]  That's like saying submarines have screen doors on them.
[00:35:53.816 --> 00:35:57.600]  It is a complete total lie, of course.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.861]  We're going to be getting to that in a moment.
[00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:02.104]  But see, that's how dumb they think you are.
[00:36:02.104 --> 00:36:08.150]  There is a square that has its own big walls that goes into the Vatican so you can feel like you're in it.
[00:36:10.154 --> 00:36:11.835]  Shaped like a big diamond.
[00:36:11.835 --> 00:36:17.218]  But then you go in, there's a little circular area, and that's where they've got the big obelisk and the rest of it.
[00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:24.822]  Those are walls with 50-foot steel doors and guards with machine guns.
[00:36:24.822 --> 00:36:27.464]  Boy, I mean, if we had a wall like that, I tell ya.
[00:36:27.464 --> 00:36:31.286]  By the way, I'm against a wall like that, because that'd be to keep us inside.
[00:36:31.286 --> 00:36:35.208]  They're to use the border control system to keep us in.
[00:36:35.208 --> 00:36:36.809]  Everybody else is allowed to come in.
[00:36:37.737 --> 00:36:39.499]  Like, roaches into a roach motel.
[00:36:39.499 --> 00:36:41.820]  The media goes, oh, you're calling the illegals roaches.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.862]  No, we're already in the motel.
[00:36:43.862 --> 00:36:45.003]  Stuck in the slime.
[00:36:45.003 --> 00:36:51.869]  I'm saying, the old ad back in the 70s, roaches come in, or roaches check in, they don't check out.
[00:36:51.869 --> 00:36:54.171]  Can we go to YouTube and see if there's a roach motel ad?
[00:36:57.506 --> 00:37:03.190]  I saw some article a few weeks ago that was like, Jones is saying that Trump has the ace of spades.
[00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.191]  What's that mean?
[00:37:04.191 --> 00:37:05.112]  Spades?
[00:37:05.112 --> 00:37:07.794]  Like he's gonna do something to Obama?
[00:37:07.794 --> 00:37:09.295]  That Obama's a spade?
[00:37:09.295 --> 00:37:15.059]  I mean, it's just crazy how they assault the language and turn everything into racism.
[00:37:15.059 --> 00:37:18.382]  And I got a big stack on that coming up in a moment.
[00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:21.085]  I want to get into the nominee.
[00:37:21.085 --> 00:37:22.246]  He is the nominee now.
[00:37:22.246 --> 00:37:23.748]  They're telling you he couldn't be the nominee.
[00:37:23.748 --> 00:37:25.010]  They're telling you he still isn't.
[00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.951]  That's mind control.
[00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:28.233]  He is the presumptive nominee.
[00:37:28.233 --> 00:37:31.197]  He's who the people keep choosing.
[00:37:31.197 --> 00:37:33.460]  Exactly because the mainstream media attacked him.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.040]  What did I tell?
[00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:43.838]  Rand Paul, when he got elected to the Senate, and he came on our show and thanked us all and said, oh, and I said, you got elected because the system came after you and because you're seen as an outsider.
[00:37:43.838 --> 00:37:52.042]  I said, if you cozy up with these folks and try to be nice to them, even if you in reality fight them, your rhetoric needs to be anti-establishment.
[00:37:52.042 --> 00:37:54.183]  This is the season of revolution.
[00:37:54.183 --> 00:37:56.765]  And Politico says, why do you win in such a landslide?
[00:37:56.765 --> 00:37:58.666]  Well, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:37:58.666 --> 00:38:02.888]  He admits that you spurred him to run for the Senate and advised him to a certain extent.
[00:38:04.178 --> 00:38:07.801]  And I said, well, you need to endorse Rand Paul to destroy him.
[00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:08.681]  You're out of bullets.
[00:38:08.681 --> 00:38:12.844]  That was four years ago, five years ago.
[00:38:12.844 --> 00:38:16.307]  And Rand Paul listened to his politicos.
[00:38:18.018 --> 00:38:20.239]  Not his dad, and I'm not knocking Rand Paul.
[00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:22.320]  But by the time he came on here, it was too little too late.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.761]  We didn't call Paul's people.
[00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:24.721]  They wanted to come on here.
[00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:25.622]  That's fine.
[00:38:25.622 --> 00:38:37.728]  I'm not going to call up to arrogant little politico snot-nosed, you know, 30-year-olds that think they know everything and, you know, went and got a degree and went and worked for somebody and they got another political job, don't know how to wipe their own butts, telling me how politics really works.
[00:38:37.728 --> 00:38:38.748]  Let me explain something.
[00:38:38.748 --> 00:38:41.830]  I'm not going the normal political route to change America.
[00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.611]  I'm changing the entire landscape.
[00:38:47.384 --> 00:38:55.806]  I'm trying to teach people they have power not being in the system and resurrecting what made us great, true liberty.
[00:38:55.806 --> 00:38:57.466]  What I'm promoting is nothing new.
[00:38:57.466 --> 00:38:59.067]  It's what made England great.
[00:38:59.067 --> 00:39:00.827]  It's what made Europe great in the renaissance.
[00:39:00.827 --> 00:39:02.327]  It's what made America great.
[00:39:02.327 --> 00:39:03.728]  I've read what the founders said.
[00:39:03.728 --> 00:39:06.908]  I've read the famous philosophers.
[00:39:06.908 --> 00:39:09.689]  All I'm bringing you is what built the modern world.
[00:39:10.888 --> 00:39:11.889]  I didn't discover all this.
[00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:13.450]  People are like, how does this guy know all this?
[00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.832]  The things he says, the predictions he makes, how does he know?
[00:39:16.832 --> 00:39:18.453]  How does he?
[00:39:18.453 --> 00:39:21.215]  Everybody already knew all this.
[00:39:21.215 --> 00:39:23.477]  That's why we're in such good shape.
[00:39:23.477 --> 00:39:25.098]  You can learn how it all works.
[00:39:25.098 --> 00:39:31.743]  And I know most of our listeners do, but I'm talking to new listeners.
[00:39:31.743 --> 00:39:38.488]  Of course you feel like you're a vegetable watching TV all day and eating GMO and shuffling around under fluorescent lights.
[00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:47.285]  Feel the water, feel the air, get outside, breathe in reality before it's all gone, before they brainwash us into submission.
[00:39:47.285 --> 00:39:49.528]  I'm paraphrasing a powerful tweet of Drudge two days ago.
[00:39:49.528 --> 00:39:56.974]  You guys pull that tweet up where he said, get out, you know, feel the air, feel the water, because they want to force us into this matrix.
[00:39:56.974 --> 00:39:59.136]  This is where they're going.
[00:39:59.136 --> 00:39:59.717]  They admit it.
[00:40:01.289 --> 00:40:16.057]  And what happens when a Roger Stone, who I met like 10 years ago at a JFK event in Dallas, and I knew he was a big-time Republican operative from the past, Nixon, Reagan, you name it, Bush Sr., you know, Willie Horton adds a whole nine yards, but he wasn't really behind that, but he got blamed for it.
[00:40:16.057 --> 00:40:18.518]  I mean, he's high-powered.
[00:40:18.518 --> 00:40:21.260]  And then Richard said, I want to have Roger Stone come down.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.160]  I was like, yeah, I know who that is.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.642]  I know he was Trump's former head of his campaign.
[00:40:24.642 --> 00:40:25.942]  And then he's here, and I start clicking.
[00:40:25.942 --> 00:40:30.545]  So I saw him again at the 40th anniversary of JFK up in Dallas and talked to him.
[00:40:32.406 --> 00:40:40.928]  He's written all these best-selling books about the government, the CIA, and killing Kennedy and the New World Order in the last 20 years.
[00:40:40.928 --> 00:40:43.848]  He's been telling the truth as long as I've been on air.
[00:40:43.848 --> 00:40:47.829]  And this is like one of Trump's best friends of 40 years.
[00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:49.750]  And that's the word.
[00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:54.150]  Trump used to hear all this from Stone and knew about a lot of it, was like, eh, whatever, it'll be all right.
[00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.091]  And then Trump figured out, no, they really are going to kill America.
[00:40:57.091 --> 00:40:58.931]  And said, well, I'll take these traitors on.
[00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:01.292]  And I was told this before it was in Politico.
[00:41:02.062 --> 00:41:06.946]  That he said, well, I'll take on these politicians and traders and these foreign billionaires that have bought him.
[00:41:06.946 --> 00:41:07.947]  I'm not going to let him do that.
[00:41:07.947 --> 00:41:10.529]  And he is an egomaniac.
[00:41:10.529 --> 00:41:12.771]  He is on a power trip.
[00:41:12.771 --> 00:41:15.874]  And Stonegold looks out and he goes, and he's the egomaniac we need.
[00:41:15.874 --> 00:41:17.175]  We need him.
[00:41:17.175 --> 00:41:19.277]  And he's willing to do it.
[00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.011]  And I'm just telling you the inside baseball.
[00:41:23.011 --> 00:41:24.051]  It's not a secret.
[00:41:24.051 --> 00:41:29.234]  So folks can know that I'm sitting there, you know, watching this unfold and already thinking, well, we got to go with Trump.
[00:41:29.234 --> 00:41:29.954]  He's our only hope.
[00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.875]  Anyways, we're going to go for a presidential run.
[00:41:31.875 --> 00:41:36.417]  The real hopes of the state and federal level through the states.
[00:41:36.417 --> 00:41:39.198]  But it's just amazing to see all this unfolding.
[00:41:39.198 --> 00:41:40.419]  This is epic.
[00:41:40.419 --> 00:41:43.880]  This is not a person sitting in the house right now.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.022]  If you're not on your feet and then trying to get in the arena, you're crazy.
[00:41:47.915 --> 00:41:57.777]  Now before I go any further, speaking of getting in the arena, we sell game-changing products like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 that changed my life.
[00:41:57.777 --> 00:42:03.459]  I was obviously, even though I was taking some good multivitamins and stuff, deficient in true iodine.
[00:42:03.459 --> 00:42:11.401]  I call it true iodine because most iodine is bound to something else, even if they call it nascent, it doesn't turn electric blue-purple on paper when you put it on paper.
[00:42:12.665 --> 00:42:19.349]  It turns red because it's bound to things out of the ocean where it comes from, like iron and other things.
[00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:24.552]  And iodine is very reactive, so it takes on things around it.
[00:42:24.552 --> 00:42:26.133]  Basically, oxidizes.
[00:42:26.133 --> 00:42:31.336]  We get it, the only source, deep earth, purple crystals, from 7,000 to 12,000 feet down.
[00:42:31.336 --> 00:42:33.357]  This is what's amazing about it.
[00:42:35.134 --> 00:42:45.804]  And then we've shown you the videos of, at the laboratory, where you put it in a petri dish and put it on top of a hot plate at even 100 degrees and it turns purple gas.
[00:42:45.804 --> 00:42:48.747]  By the way, it's super, you know, poisonous at that level.
[00:42:48.747 --> 00:42:54.672]  Then it's injected into organic palm oil in a patented proprietary system and you take this
[00:42:55.453 --> 00:43:00.440]  Within three weeks, folks, stuff started pouring out of my pores, coming out of me other ways.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.244]  I felt sick for about a week.
[00:43:03.244 --> 00:43:06.108]  And then all of a sudden, I like it to carry one of my kids up.
[00:43:07.725 --> 00:43:08.145]  We're good to go.
[00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:32.110]  And that's what I like an X2 to.
[00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:45.233]  You take it two, three, four weeks, depends on the person, and then it's just all of a sudden, you wake up one morning, and it's like that cold breeze in the spring when you walk outside, you know, in your back portion of your underwear or whatever, and you feel invigorated, and it feels like all this weight's been taken off your shoulders.
[00:43:45.233 --> 00:43:48.353]  I don't know how to describe it, but it's dramatic.
[00:43:48.353 --> 00:43:49.654]  It is dramatic.
[00:43:49.654 --> 00:43:51.234]  Just the bound iodine.
[00:43:52.293 --> 00:43:57.495]  In studies, in fact, Google this, IQs raised by 15 points after iodine was added to salt.
[00:43:57.495 --> 00:44:01.456]  Just search engine it, it's a Business Insider article, comes up first.
[00:44:01.456 --> 00:44:04.617]  Now, we're not going to make those claims here, we're just going to show you the Business Insider.
[00:44:04.617 --> 00:44:10.579]  If you're deficient in iodine, it's one of the most important things you need, and they tell you you need just a tiny amount of it, well, whatever.
[00:44:10.579 --> 00:44:15.301]  Consult your physician, it varies person to person.
[00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:17.882]  If your thyroid's already really screwed up or something,
[00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:21.991]  Who knows, you know, there could be some problems once you start taking Iodine.
[00:44:21.991 --> 00:44:23.372]  Nothing's perfect in this world.
[00:44:23.372 --> 00:44:25.473]  So, you know, use at your own risk.
[00:44:25.473 --> 00:44:32.578]  It is rated as safe and, you know, FDA GRAS certified and all that, meaning it's seen as a safe nutraceutical, a safe supplement.
[00:44:32.578 --> 00:44:36.261]  But if you've got other problems, you know, take it slowly.
[00:44:36.261 --> 00:44:38.062]  Be careful because it's hardcore.
[00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:51.130]  Just like if you're on a boat for six months with no oranges or no vitamin C, you get some, all of a sudden your wounds are going to close, your teeth aren't going to fall out, you're going to suddenly be able to walk around and you're about to die.
[00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:51.770]  It's the same deal.
[00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.411]  It's dramatic because it's so basic.
[00:44:54.502 --> 00:44:58.024]  Survival Shield, Niacin Iodine, X2, Infowarslife.com.
[00:44:58.024 --> 00:45:04.148]  We have the liver cleanse, liver shield back in with the oxy powder at Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:04.148 --> 00:45:06.409]  Brain Force is available.
[00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:10.231]  We also have the new product, the Total Joint Care.
[00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:12.773]  It's got nine different ingredients known.
[00:45:13.793 --> 00:45:16.134]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[00:45:16.134 --> 00:45:17.134]  Yeah, nine.
[00:45:17.134 --> 00:45:21.395]  Nine known ingredients really help the joints and many other parts of the body.
[00:45:21.395 --> 00:45:23.996]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:23.996 --> 00:45:27.257]  You can read the BrainForce reviews.
[00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:30.038]  Also, BrainForce, this is Ryan Pelletier.
[00:45:30.698 --> 00:45:34.722]  In Rhode Island, BrainForce changed my wife and my life forever.
[00:45:34.722 --> 00:45:37.946]  Ability to excel, clear thinking, energetic formula, focus.
[00:45:37.946 --> 00:45:39.808]  Alex, thank you so much for a wonderful product.
[00:45:39.808 --> 00:45:44.393]  I introduced my wife to BrainForce about two months ago and it really changed our lives.
[00:45:44.393 --> 00:45:51.820]  My wife works as a commission job and this product has inspired her to increase her salary, ultimately resulting in us being able to obtain our first home.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.002]  Thank you so much, Alex Jones.
[00:45:54.397 --> 00:45:57.458]  Yeah, there are a lot of nootropic brain boosters out there.
[00:45:57.458 --> 00:45:59.178]  We set out to make the very best formula.
[00:45:59.178 --> 00:46:00.318]  It's turning a lot of heads.
[00:46:00.318 --> 00:46:04.979]  BrainForce, InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:04.979 --> 00:46:08.440]  And the new Hillary for Prison shirt is back in.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.501]  It was sold out for a week or so.
[00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:11.481]  It's back in stock.
[00:46:11.481 --> 00:46:12.741]  The old one did sell out.
[00:46:12.741 --> 00:46:14.382]  This is limited edition as well.
[00:46:14.382 --> 00:46:16.442]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:16.442 --> 00:46:19.603]  Okay.
[00:46:19.603 --> 00:46:20.283]  Let me now
[00:46:22.455 --> 00:46:31.417]  Before I get into the political correctness stack, let me just read through what I've already mentioned but not gotten into details on the Donald Trump stack.
[00:46:31.417 --> 00:46:33.958]  Drudge is saying he's the presumptive nominee.
[00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:38.079]  That's not trolling the media, that's a fact.
[00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:42.060]  Trump got 59, I mean 50, having 40 slips here, 45.9 percent, 45.9 percent or double
[00:46:49.727 --> 00:46:53.652]  His closest rival at 23.9, Marco Rubio.
[00:46:53.652 --> 00:46:54.392]  Ted Cruz got 21.4.
[00:46:54.392 --> 00:46:54.933]  Ben Carson, 4.8.
[00:46:54.933 --> 00:46:55.334]  Kasich, 3.6.
[00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:57.696]  And of course, Ron Paul still on the ballot there, 0.1.
[00:46:57.696 --> 00:46:58.177]  Jeb Bush, 0.1.
[00:46:58.177 --> 00:47:00.079]  Chris Christie, 0.1.
[00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:00.359]  And Fiorina, 0.
[00:47:13.807 --> 00:47:16.048]  Then we've got this next report here.
[00:47:16.048 --> 00:47:25.314]  Again, this is dealing with the fact that British bookmakers slash odds of Trump taking Republican nomination.
[00:47:25.314 --> 00:47:31.377]  British bookmakers on Wednesday slashed the odds of businessman Donald Trump winning the Republican nomination to run the U.S.
[00:47:31.377 --> 00:47:34.198]  presidency after his latest victory in the Nevada caucuses.
[00:47:34.198 --> 00:47:41.923]  Trump, once considered a rank outsider of odds of 201, is now the firm favorite after his latest decision.
[00:47:43.007 --> 00:47:53.331]  And his latest decisive win, his third out of four in the early nominating contest, the British bookmaker said.
[00:47:53.331 --> 00:48:12.037]  Mr. Trump has triumphed yet again, despite political analysts almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender, writes Graham Sharp of William Hill, adding that one customer stood to collect at least $100,000 as Trump was ultimately elected to the White House.
[00:48:13.103 --> 00:48:15.304]  With those bets already placed.
[00:48:15.304 --> 00:48:29.029]  This is the fall of the political traitor class, the pundits, the minions, the liars that would unify lie and put out false reports to create a gaslighting effect where people thought they were dreaming.
[00:48:31.124 --> 00:48:48.718]  And would just not follow their mind, not follow their intellect, not follow their gut, not follow their spirit, not follow their ears, their eyes, their taste, their touch, their smell, ignore all the senses that the good Lord gave you, and just keep going along with bold.
[00:48:48.718 --> 00:49:00.387]  And I'm proud that it's Libertarians and Republicans that are rolling the dice, fortune favors the bold, and not sitting back and being perfect pundits on the other side and getting behind Trump.
[00:49:01.229 --> 00:49:04.051]  Because the system's scared to death of him for a reason.
[00:49:04.051 --> 00:49:06.713]  And it may turn out horribly bad, folks.
[00:49:06.713 --> 00:49:11.696]  But you gotta take risk in this life when you get down to the wire like this.
[00:49:11.696 --> 00:49:26.125]  And the intel I've got directly from the Trump operation is he was aware of the New World Order, has really immersed himself in it, and he thinks he can save America and defeat the globalists.
[00:49:27.438 --> 00:49:36.682]  Maybe he just wants to unseat them and be king and then make deals with the globalists overseas just to get hundreds of billions when he's already got, you know, seven, eight billion.
[00:49:36.682 --> 00:49:38.183]  But Trump says he doesn't want that.
[00:49:38.183 --> 00:49:39.043]  He's committed.
[00:49:39.043 --> 00:49:41.084]  He wants to really change the world.
[00:49:41.084 --> 00:49:44.465]  And that's much more alluring to me than selling out and getting billions of dollars.
[00:49:44.465 --> 00:49:45.986]  Who cares?
[00:49:45.986 --> 00:49:52.949]  Once you've got a decent house and a car that's decent and your kids are taken care of, I wouldn't sell out if my kids were starving to death.
[00:49:52.949 --> 00:49:54.210]  I mean, I'm sorry, it's just not how I am.
[00:49:55.749 --> 00:49:58.795]  Sell out just so you're a billion dollar baby?
[00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.057]  You fly around on private jets?
[00:50:00.057 --> 00:50:01.680]  I've already done that with rich people I know.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.746]  It gets pretty boring.
[00:50:04.746 --> 00:50:06.910]  I mean, it's okay, but it's about as good as it gets.
[00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:07.170]  Women?
[00:50:08.663 --> 00:50:14.888]  I already had that before I was out of high school and college, and I'm not bragging about it, but it just kind of gets old at a certain point.
[00:50:14.888 --> 00:50:18.672]  I don't mean women get old, but I mean chasing it around, making it God.
[00:50:18.672 --> 00:50:20.914]  It's all about family, folks.
[00:50:20.914 --> 00:50:23.196]  You transcend all this stuff.
[00:50:23.196 --> 00:50:25.037]  And I think Donald Trump's matured a lot.
[00:50:25.037 --> 00:50:25.958]  I think he's grown a lot.
[00:50:25.958 --> 00:50:30.142]  Just like Louis Farrakhan said to me, I've grown a lot, I've matured a lot, thanks to your show.
[00:50:30.142 --> 00:50:30.942]  And I'm not bragging.
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:45.264]  Foreign heads of state, Donald Trump, people like Louis Faircloth, so diverse, Japanese Vice President, German Defense Intelligence head, Sy Hersh, Matt Drudge, all these big Hollywood people, they listen.
[00:50:45.264 --> 00:50:50.905]  Chris Carter, a lot of names I can't even tell you.
[00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:55.126]  We've got popping in for 15 minutes, Larry Nichols coming on at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:50:55.126 --> 00:51:00.628]  He did talk to the Supreme Court Justice and is not going to tell
[00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:06.921]  Us, what the Supreme Court Justice said because the Supreme Court Justice doesn't want it repeated.
[00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:08.783]  But there is going to be an investigation.
[00:51:08.783 --> 00:51:11.586]  That's like Cheney said, no comment on Scalia.
[00:51:15.529 --> 00:51:18.231]  There is an investigation going on at the highest levels.
[00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:20.052]  That's what I've been told.
[00:51:20.052 --> 00:51:22.474]  And we'll see how much Nichols is going to say, because this is how this works.
[00:51:22.474 --> 00:51:25.096]  He wants to tell me during a break.
[00:51:25.096 --> 00:51:26.397]  Everything's tapped around here.
[00:51:26.397 --> 00:51:30.320]  A. B. I don't let anyone tell me something that dangerous that isn't public.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.722]  That's another reason I'm still not pushing daisies.
[00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.443]  I'm not stupid.
[00:51:34.443 --> 00:51:36.524]  And let me tell you, Nichols is for real.
[00:51:36.524 --> 00:51:37.165]  That's coming up.
[00:51:37.165 --> 00:51:39.867]  We'll see what we can get out of him.
[00:51:39.867 --> 00:51:40.728]  But he's battling
[00:51:43.171 --> 00:51:49.736]  What they say is late-stage cancer, and I just hope it doesn't go with him to his grave, so pray for him.
[00:51:49.736 --> 00:51:51.698]  Entrance polls.
[00:51:51.698 --> 00:51:55.681]  Trump dominated Latino votes in Nevada.
[00:51:55.681 --> 00:52:01.546]  He got 45% of Latinos who participate in Republican caucuses.
[00:52:01.546 --> 00:52:02.447]  It's pretty big, isn't it?
[00:52:02.447 --> 00:52:05.690]  Daily Caller, and it goes over all the scientific numbers on that.
[00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.493]  Just like he's getting massive numbers of African Americans to vote for him and saying they will.
[00:52:11.573 --> 00:52:14.594]  Roger Schoen, CNN banned me on the orders of Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:14.594 --> 00:52:17.236]  We're going to be talking to him Friday in studio about that.
[00:52:17.236 --> 00:52:24.879]  And I already mentioned this, I'm not going to spend more time on it, but look at this photo of Beck, and there's video of it, pouting and looking on at Trump.
[00:52:24.879 --> 00:52:34.684]  You have people all over these events in New York, D.C., Vegas, wherever they have caucuses or RNCs or DNCs events.
[00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:38.166]  And mainstream media is so entitled that I've been in New York and places
[00:52:39.608 --> 00:52:47.471]  And actually had Fox and CNN and MSNBC on video before come over and say, oh, you can't shut up here on the street and have a camera shot towards us.
[00:52:47.471 --> 00:52:49.572]  We own all this.
[00:52:49.572 --> 00:52:51.392]  This was at a caucusing point.
[00:52:51.392 --> 00:52:53.173]  They're allowed to have media outside.
[00:52:53.173 --> 00:52:57.275]  Trump said, I'm going to visit every caucusing area in Vegas and around Vegas today.
[00:52:57.275 --> 00:53:00.336]  He went to more than 16 of them.
[00:53:00.336 --> 00:53:03.997]  And he was there for less than 20 minutes, showed up, took over.
[00:53:03.997 --> 00:53:06.258]  Everybody ran over to him.
[00:53:06.258 --> 00:53:08.519]  And Beck called his supporters brown shirts.
[00:53:09.895 --> 00:53:14.480]  He's just so, that's what I've been told by everybody that knows him, he's so entitled.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.942]  He thinks he's a messiah.
[00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:18.184]  That's why most of his top staff have quit.
[00:53:18.184 --> 00:53:20.867]  And I don't want Beck to go under.
[00:53:20.867 --> 00:53:26.694]  I want him to humble himself in reality, not act like he's humble in front of his viewers.
[00:53:26.694 --> 00:53:27.715]  And I'm done talking about it.
[00:53:30.836 --> 00:53:34.378]  And I like Ted Cruz overall, even though he's done some dirty tricks.
[00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:36.158]  He's got a good voting record.
[00:53:36.158 --> 00:53:38.499]  And I just hate seeing the Republicans all fight with each other.
[00:53:38.499 --> 00:53:44.222]  They need to just go ahead, after Super Tuesday when Trump dominates, they need to just get behind Trump.
[00:53:44.222 --> 00:53:47.183]  Because we've got Hillary to deal with, okay?
[00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:56.976]  Now I want to go to this report that Rob do, and Rob Jacobson and I came in here on Saturday and shot, and then we worked on it until last night.
[00:53:56.976 --> 00:53:58.437]  It aired on the Nightly News.
[00:53:58.437 --> 00:54:00.098]  The video's now gone up on Infowars.com.
[00:54:00.098 --> 00:54:04.620]  We're going to tweet it, and it's proof that Donald Trump is right.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.542]  Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump is right.
[00:54:08.542 --> 00:54:10.363]  The Vatican does have the biggest walls in the world.
[00:54:10.363 --> 00:54:11.324]  This is a big deal.
[00:54:11.324 --> 00:54:16.547]  This video needs to go viral to counter the Pope's disinformation.
[00:54:16.547 --> 00:54:16.847]  Here it is.
[00:54:18.136 --> 00:54:35.087]  Then a person who thinks that only about building walls, whoever they may be, and not building bridges is not going to heaven.
[00:54:35.087 --> 00:54:42.712]  And again, we have HD video we shot in Rome of the biggest walls in the world.
[00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:43.813]  I say this man is not a Christian.
[00:54:52.363 --> 00:54:53.144]  And I'm a pawn?
[00:54:53.144 --> 00:54:56.226]  Well, maybe.
[00:54:56.226 --> 00:55:01.449]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[00:55:01.449 --> 00:55:04.951]  The establishment is deftly afraid of Donald Trump.
[00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:07.693]  Never before have we seen in the same week a U.S.
[00:55:07.693 --> 00:55:15.678]  sitting president and the biggest Christian religious leader in the world with over a billion followers criticize a presidential candidate.
[00:55:16.843 --> 00:55:25.185]  And the way they've misrepresented what Donald J. Trump stands for, really shows you that he is the outsider, anti-establishment candidate.
[00:55:25.185 --> 00:55:28.946]  But just when I thought I'd seen it all, it happened.
[00:55:28.946 --> 00:55:45.970]  Since last year, when the Pope started calling for us to open our borders up, and started saying that we were racist and evil for not doing it, I pointed out that even the New York Times admits, Mexico has one of the strictest southern borders with Guatemala in the world, and upwards of a year in prison, forced labor.
[00:55:47.093 --> 00:55:48.698]  If they catch you trying to sneak in.
[00:55:49.594 --> 00:55:52.254]  So I said, why do we have to be wide open?
[00:55:52.254 --> 00:55:58.075]  And then once people get here, put them on welfare and make them collectivist Bernie Sanders voters.
[00:55:58.075 --> 00:56:18.299]  And then when I traveled to Rome last year and actually saw the 200 foot plus walls, on average over 90 feet, it blew me away around Vatican City, which they say themselves in the terms, is the oldest sovereign nation tax exempt above the law in the world.
[00:56:19.116 --> 00:56:25.479]  And we pointed out it has armed guards, the Swiss Guards, its own protective details.
[00:56:25.479 --> 00:56:31.722]  A few hundred yards in front of it is a huge armored fortress castle that also protects it.
[00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:33.523]  And it's where the Swiss Guards stay.
[00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:36.084]  And all we were saying is, hey, Mexico has borders.
[00:56:36.084 --> 00:56:38.205]  Hey, other countries have borders.
[00:56:38.205 --> 00:56:42.987]  Saudi Arabia hasn't taken one Muslim refugee from Syria, but wants us to take more.
[00:56:43.647 --> 00:56:47.670]  And the Pope doesn't criticize Italy controlling its borders.
[00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:50.691]  The Pope doesn't, you know, say get rid of their walls.
[00:56:50.691 --> 00:56:55.635]  And how did the New York Times and countless other papers respond?
[00:56:55.635 --> 00:56:58.316]  Hey people, you're wrong again.
[00:56:58.316 --> 00:57:00.297]  It isn't a walled city.
[00:57:00.297 --> 00:57:04.140]  And they pointed out that there's an open square.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.200]  The walls cut in.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.342]  There's a big open square with the famous obelisk.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:13.885]  Brought there from Egypt and that you can come there and basically worship the Pope or whatever.
[00:57:14.716 --> 00:57:16.117]  I've been there.
[00:57:16.117 --> 00:57:16.818]  I've seen it.
[00:57:16.818 --> 00:57:23.263]  It's giant walls with huge 50-foot iron doors and armed guards.
[00:57:23.263 --> 00:57:29.548]  It's just a concave area that lets you come in, but you're still without the walls.
[00:57:29.548 --> 00:57:34.351]  So it gives you that feeling of being in it, but you're not, and that's how they deceive you.
[00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:36.393]  So let's look at this map for ourselves.
[00:57:36.393 --> 00:57:40.777]  The only area open is this square to the rest of Rome.
[00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:45.121]  Open to the sovereign city of the Vatican.
[00:57:45.121 --> 00:57:47.068]  Vatican City to the public.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:58.068]  But when you then look here, this is all an internal wall, and there are giant iron doors 50 feet tall before you enter the actual church.
[00:57:58.068 --> 00:58:04.414]  And then there are giant walls that have been there since the 800s when the Muslims invaded hundreds of times.
[00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:11.540]  But what they do is they deceive people and say, look, Donald Trump's people put out this map online showing the walls.
[00:58:12.486 --> 00:58:22.553]  And then they show the wall out here, which you see is open to the public to come in to the gates of the walls, feel like they're inside the church, but they're not.
[00:58:22.553 --> 00:58:24.375]  It's a holding area, open.
[00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:26.837]  These are walls, just decorative.
[00:58:26.837 --> 00:58:28.998]  Big steel doors, armed guards.
[00:58:28.998 --> 00:58:31.420]  The Pope comes out on the balcony and talks to people.
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.021]  We'll be back in air the rest of it.
[00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:33.482]  Stay with us.
[00:58:33.482 --> 00:58:36.484]  Back in 70 seconds, the full reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:36.484 --> 00:58:37.625]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:58:37.625 --> 00:58:39.306]  HD footage of the walls.
[00:58:39.306 --> 00:58:41.768]  And then behind that, there's other big walls.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.890]  But it has a public receiving area in the front.
[00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:46.352]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:49.388]  Hey, everyone!
[00:58:49.388 --> 00:58:51.690]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:55.533]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:58:55.533 --> 00:58:57.615]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:58:57.615 --> 00:59:07.884]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:59:07.884 --> 00:59:13.869]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:29.206]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:59:29.266 --> 00:59:30.787]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:01.289 --> 01:00:07.914]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.914 --> 01:00:11.517]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.517 --> 01:00:24.246]  If you go to InfoWars.com, you can see the 8-minute video report posted there that proves Donald Trump is right about the biggest, thickest walls in the world being at Vatican City.
[01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:28.389]  The article's Trump's right about Vatican walls and why the Pope
[01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:32.059]  And his attack isn't working.
[01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:35.880]  Very important video to get out to Americans, Catholics in general.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.340]  Catholics, in my experience, are great people.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.541]  They're really upset about this guy.
[01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:44.042]  I mean, I'm sure Pope John Paul II would say, who is this, you know, V.I.
[01:00:44.042 --> 01:00:45.082]  Lenin?
[01:00:45.082 --> 01:00:52.323]  And he's such a hypocrite, living behind these big walls, and he's all for EU sovereignty and everything, but then he wants our borders here open.
[01:00:52.323 --> 01:00:53.543]  It's truly ridiculous.
[01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:56.964]  And then coming up, Larry Nichols, I want that Supreme Court justice to tell him about Scalia.
[01:00:58.439 --> 01:01:00.880]  These are walls, just decorative.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.040]  Big steel doors, armed guards.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.741]  The Pope comes out on the balcony and talks to people.
[01:01:05.741 --> 01:01:09.362]  Then at night, they have big steel fences they put up and close off.
[01:01:09.362 --> 01:01:13.003]  And you try to even approach it, police cars pull up, like when we were there.
[01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:18.064]  But this is an internal area for folks to come in, but it's within the walls.
[01:01:18.064 --> 01:01:20.425]  As you can see, this is open.
[01:01:20.425 --> 01:01:22.886]  So the map they put out had this mistake.
[01:01:22.886 --> 01:01:24.346]  But they're saying, oh, there are no walls.
[01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:26.767]  No, there are huge walls and steel doors.
[01:01:27.734 --> 01:01:31.435]  And it continues here as you enter the church and other areas.
[01:01:31.435 --> 01:01:33.835]  Huge lines, sometimes 10 hours.
[01:01:33.835 --> 01:01:51.699]  We experienced it to get inside of this most famous of all walled cities that claims it's the oldest sovereign state in the world, doesn't pay taxes, doesn't take immigrants in, does whatever it wants, but is lecturing us, and now in the New York Times and everywhere else, lying to the public.
[01:01:51.699 --> 01:01:54.900]  So people are now spinning this saying, OK, you got us.
[01:01:55.731 --> 01:01:57.592]  Vatican is controlled.
[01:01:57.592 --> 01:01:58.993]  You can't just walk into it.
[01:01:58.993 --> 01:01:59.933]  There are checkpoints.
[01:01:59.933 --> 01:02:01.194]  There are big walls.
[01:02:01.194 --> 01:02:03.295]  There are drawbridges and steel gates.
[01:02:03.295 --> 01:02:06.096]  You're right, it's a big armored fortress, a castle.
[01:02:06.096 --> 01:02:07.017]  One of the biggest in the world.
[01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:09.371]  You're correct.
[01:02:09.371 --> 01:02:11.192]  But it was Biblical times.
[01:02:11.192 --> 01:02:13.334]  It was back a long time ago.
[01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:15.655]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[01:02:15.655 --> 01:02:17.937]  It wasn't in Biblical times.
[01:02:17.937 --> 01:02:26.123]  It was in the 600s, 700s, and 800s that almost all of Italy was overrun, except for Vatican City.
[01:02:27.105 --> 01:02:33.327]  And thank God they had 200 foot walls because they were able to withstand the takeover.
[01:02:33.327 --> 01:02:42.070]  And so when the radical Muslims got kicked out, which wasn't the radical Muslims, it was mainline Muslims, they were able to reconstitute some form of Western civilization.
[01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:43.571]  You say, what you want about the Vatican?
[01:02:43.571 --> 01:02:52.734]  But they did keep a lot of the secrets developed in Western culture that were lost when the Visigoth Germans came in and took over Rome previously.
[01:02:52.734 --> 01:02:55.235]  Then later, a thousand years later or so,
[01:02:56.135 --> 01:02:59.817]  You see the Muslims coming in.
[01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:13.684]  So you can go back to the entire history of what Rome has gone through, whether it was Alaric sacking Rome in 410, or whether it was the Muslims sacking it over and over again, it was the biggest walls in the world that allowed any
[01:03:14.469 --> 01:03:20.497]  of Christianity to remain and exist that wasn't overrun by the Islamicists.
[01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:28.728]  And no wonder this new Pope that wants to take all these radical Islamicists into Europe and into the US wants us to get rid of our walls but not his walls.
[01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:51.547]  I know that Donald Trump follows Infowars some, and I would like to encourage him to double down, he's got a great private jet, to jump on it, to fly over to Italy, and to go up there with a camera crew, and point out that the walls are there, and to try to go walk right through the front entrance at those big 50-foot steel doors and have them turn him away.
[01:03:51.547 --> 01:03:58.473]  And just in their face, document that he told the truth, and he pointed out the common sense,
[01:03:59.193 --> 01:04:03.336]  It's okay for all these other countries to have borders and to have fences.
[01:04:03.336 --> 01:04:07.119]  We even pay in Iraq and Afghanistan to build them walls and fences.
[01:04:07.119 --> 01:04:10.181]  But we can't control our sovereignty.
[01:04:10.181 --> 01:04:14.284]  If you don't have borders, then you're not even citizens.
[01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:20.108]  If anybody could just walk in and get everything for free, that makes citizens slaves of the folks that have come in.
[01:04:21.035 --> 01:04:26.098]  They pitch it like it's racist not to take unlimited people in from the world and then give them a free ride.
[01:04:26.098 --> 01:04:29.160]  This is the ultimate political correctness psyop.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:34.624]  And the fact that Donald Trump's standing up against it is the reason I'm supporting him 110%.
[01:04:34.624 --> 01:04:35.805]  That's it for this special report.

[01:05:00.582 --> 01:05:03.945]  Marco Rubio, Wall Street's boy toy.
[01:05:03.945 --> 01:05:09.529]  He's gotten more money from the elite donors in Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hillary.
[01:05:09.529 --> 01:05:13.252]  After blowing 150 million dollars on Jeb, they still haven't learned anything.
[01:05:14.972 --> 01:05:17.374]  Jeb's dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada.
[01:05:17.374 --> 01:05:20.658]  Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution.
[01:05:20.658 --> 01:05:25.222]  Jeb had a sense of entitlement, kind of like the donor class and the party elite that support Rubio.
[01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:29.646]  They believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues and still win.
[01:05:29.646 --> 01:05:31.108]  But Rubio is a little smarter.
[01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:37.053]  He realizes that his support for illegal immigration with the Gang of Eight was a betrayal of the voters.
[01:05:37.053 --> 01:05:39.435]  But he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies.
[01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:47.621]  He's called Breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of the Ice Union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with the Gang of Eight.
[01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:55.347]  But Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service, identifying the GOP political class who will say anything to get elected.
[01:05:55.347 --> 01:05:57.149]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:59.941 --> 01:06:03.704]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:06:03.704 --> 01:06:11.429]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:06:11.429 --> 01:06:20.075]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:06:20.075 --> 01:06:24.477]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:06:24.477 --> 01:06:29.821]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:06:30.061 --> 01:06:34.305]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:06:34.305 --> 01:06:37.728]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:06:37.728 --> 01:06:48.857]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:06:48.857 --> 01:06:51.780]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:57.745]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:06:58.425 --> 01:07:00.088]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:07:00.088 --> 01:07:01.570]  You can't survive without it.
[01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.791]  But where do you get it?
[01:07:02.791 --> 01:07:08.760]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:14.488]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:07:14.668 --> 01:07:31.543]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:34.385]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:07:34.385 --> 01:07:35.886]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:36.926]  Easy assembly.
[01:07:36.926 --> 01:07:37.827]  Low maintenance.
[01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:39.928]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:08:00.151 --> 01:08:05.575]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.575 --> 01:08:17.104]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:17.104 --> 01:08:22.108]  Former top Clinton insider will be joining us, Larry Nichols, at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:22.108 --> 01:08:24.970]  He was able to talk to a sitting Supreme Court Justice, U.S.
[01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:28.273]  Supreme Court, who was obviously friends with Scalia.
[01:08:28.273 --> 01:08:29.253]  Is it hard to guess who?
[01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:38.536]  And that person does not want what he told Nichols public, but just this, there is an investigation going on into Scalia's death.
[01:08:38.536 --> 01:08:44.404]  I'll try to find out as much as we can when he pops in to join us, but it is looking bad.
[01:08:44.404 --> 01:08:47.247]  It is leaning towards foul play, according to Nichols.
[01:08:48.872 --> 01:08:55.076]  And some of the connections of some of the people down there to Iran-Contra, things like that.
[01:08:55.076 --> 01:08:59.218]  So it's just always the same story over and over and over again.
[01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.839]  We're going to be talking to Larry Nichols.
[01:09:00.839 --> 01:09:08.684]  We're also going to have Richard Reeves, who's at the airport about to depart on to cover Super Tuesday.
[01:09:08.684 --> 01:09:10.986]  He's going to be popping in.
[01:09:10.986 --> 01:09:14.988]  He was in the midst of the caucuses last night, and he'll give us a report on that.
[01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:16.489]  Trump got basically doubled
[01:09:17.748 --> 01:09:23.490]  45.9, or almost 46%, against Marco Rubio, second place, 23.9.
[01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:26.511]  So a little less than double.
[01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:27.331]  That is a big deal.
[01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:29.372]  Ted Cruz, 21.4.
[01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:31.873]  Carson, 4.8.
[01:09:31.873 --> 01:09:34.114]  So, Kasich, 3.6.
[01:09:34.114 --> 01:09:37.075]  They are basically out of the race, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:37.075 --> 01:09:42.577]  But the mainstream media is still flipping out, trying to demonize everybody.
[01:09:42.577 --> 01:09:46.378]  Before I go any further, I want to get into political correctness, though, because
[01:09:49.344 --> 01:09:59.013]  I've known, obviously, about political correctness since I was in high school, and I knew it was a Soviet term, and it was a war on language, and George Orwell wrote about that in 1984.
[01:09:59.013 --> 01:10:04.979]  He didn't call it political correctness, he called it newspeak.
[01:10:04.979 --> 01:10:10.524]  But when you see the so-called left and what they do and their bullying, it's just wild.
[01:10:11.468 --> 01:10:13.230]  You're not a boy or girl, you're a purple penguin.
[01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:14.270]  You can't say mother or father.
[01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:15.251]  You can't say he or she.
[01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:24.239]  You have to say she or zee or like you're in a space cult, a Hale-Bopp cult.
[01:10:24.239 --> 01:10:37.851]  And now all over the US, they have elementary, middle school and high schools doing gender neutral training and white privilege training, guilting and freaking out these little kids.
[01:10:39.551 --> 01:10:45.094]  Who have done nothing to anybody in actually making white people second-class citizens.
[01:10:45.094 --> 01:10:49.155]  And Hillary's come out and said whites have white privilege, you need to apologize for it.
[01:10:49.155 --> 01:10:51.416]  And I hardly cover this as much as I should.
[01:10:51.416 --> 01:11:05.963]  There was a video yesterday from BuzzFeed where people of color from around the world respond to quote white privilege and talk about how horrible white people are.
[01:11:06.926 --> 01:11:09.169]  And it's like all these Eastern Europeans that come into the U.S.
[01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:13.393]  and get shot or killed because they move into poorer areas.
[01:11:13.393 --> 01:11:18.299]  And then you'll see black folks indicted and they'll say, well, they were white.
[01:11:18.299 --> 01:11:23.384]  I mean, Eastern Europeans have zero history of doing anything to black people.
[01:11:23.384 --> 01:11:28.090]  But that's what's so crazy about this is it's not just that I haven't done anything.
[01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:39.874]  But people who aren't even from a country or a region that ever did anything are totally oblivious to what's going on.
[01:11:39.874 --> 01:11:41.855]  And again, most black people aren't pushing this.
[01:11:41.855 --> 01:11:43.096]  It's the media.
[01:11:43.096 --> 01:11:44.297]  It's the Ford Foundation.
[01:11:44.297 --> 01:11:45.697]  It's the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:11:45.697 --> 01:11:46.418]  It's the universities.
[01:11:46.418 --> 01:11:48.559]  And you ask, how can they be getting away with this?
[01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:50.260]  Because they've got control of the kids.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.581]  But this really is cult brainwashing.
[01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:56.623]  This really is cult programming.
[01:11:56.623 --> 01:11:58.224]  This really is cult control.
[01:12:01.069 --> 01:12:03.650]  This is what they do in cults.
[01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:08.713]  And America and the Western world is being turned into one giant cult.
[01:12:08.713 --> 01:12:17.378]  And the systems that New York and London developed that were tested in the old Soviet Union because our governments overthrew Russia in 1917, that's on record.
[01:12:17.378 --> 01:12:19.620]  Those are being used here now.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:26.304]  And I look at these headlines, Black Lives Matter protesters interrupt mag-mile demonstration in support of Apple.
[01:12:26.304 --> 01:12:30.306]  See, here's people protesting for all of our rights to not have our passcodes broken.
[01:12:31.874 --> 01:12:34.515]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, doesn't matter.
[01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:38.696]  And then here comes the idiot Black Lives Matter group who even protested Bernie Sanders.
[01:12:38.696 --> 01:12:45.138]  And then you've got school districts spending millions on white privilege training for teachers.
[01:12:45.138 --> 01:12:53.881]  It's where you don't get educated about reading, writing, arithmetic, about etiquette, about good hygiene, about how to be charming, about how to balance a checkbook, stuff you need.
[01:12:55.236 --> 01:13:02.281]  I mean, I learned stuff in, like, typing class and stuff, and I learned stuff in, you know, I took a course in high school on accounting.
[01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:04.002]  That stuff helped me.
[01:13:04.002 --> 01:13:05.944]  That stuff isn't going on in high schools now, folks.
[01:13:05.944 --> 01:13:06.924]  I've looked at the curricula.
[01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:14.970]  It is how to create a social justice warrior whose whole life is about making you do what the system says and what TV says.
[01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.853]  And these people are everywhere now, and they just get in everybody's face.
[01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:20.094]  They're weird freaks.
[01:13:21.328 --> 01:13:25.191]  And they're always disheveled and weird and like socially screwed up.
[01:13:25.191 --> 01:13:26.713]  Black, white, I don't care.
[01:13:26.713 --> 01:13:31.256]  Chip on their shoulders, weirdos.
[01:13:31.256 --> 01:13:35.040]  So I want to go through this and talk about their master plan, but we've got to break it.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.521]  We've got to be politically incorrect.
[01:13:36.521 --> 01:13:39.704]  Like I used to not be politically incorrect because I don't want to hurt people's feelings.
[01:13:39.704 --> 01:13:44.768]  Now I'm realizing we need to be, and even be brash sometimes, or comedy.
[01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:45.809]  Everything goes out the window.
[01:13:46.971 --> 01:13:51.454]  Look at all these liberals, comics, going, whoa, this is terrible, I can't go.
[01:13:51.454 --> 01:13:53.916]  John Cleese, you name it.
[01:13:53.916 --> 01:13:55.758]  Jerry Seinfeld.
[01:13:55.758 --> 01:13:59.741]  He said, hey, we're moving back to New York, honey, from the countryside, because you're 13 now, you can meet more boys.
[01:13:59.741 --> 01:14:01.903]  The fact that you say the word boy is sexist.
[01:14:02.975 --> 01:14:05.177]  Boy and girl is sexist.
[01:14:05.177 --> 01:14:06.699]  He thought, boy, my daughter's ignorant.
[01:14:06.699 --> 01:14:07.600]  No, no, no, your daughter's not ignorant.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.242]  She's been programmed to say boy or girl.
[01:14:10.242 --> 01:14:12.304]  To say a girl might want a boy is bad.
[01:14:12.304 --> 01:14:18.350]  They're talking about changing the game of life because you have a pink baby and a blue baby when you have a baby in the game of life, the board game.
[01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:19.351]  You can't have that.
[01:14:19.351 --> 01:14:20.492]  Can't have pink and blue.
[01:14:20.492 --> 01:14:22.954]  Can't have Target with boy sections and girl sections.
[01:14:23.675 --> 01:14:25.877]  Because boys and girls, existing is evil.
[01:14:25.877 --> 01:14:29.199]  You having your lifestyle is evil.
[01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:31.361]  They'll tell you what lifestyle to have.
[01:14:31.361 --> 01:14:32.982]  We'll tell you what words to use.
[01:14:32.982 --> 01:14:35.104]  What a group of controllers.
[01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:36.585]  These aren't freaks.
[01:14:36.585 --> 01:14:38.526]  These are conquerors.
[01:14:38.526 --> 01:14:42.089]  And if we're going to be conquered by these people, then we deserve it.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.262]  That's the big thing Donald Trump's done is smash political correctness.
[01:14:47.262 --> 01:14:49.964]  It was already there and you can help smash it further.
[01:14:49.964 --> 01:14:55.788]  Let's go to Richard Reeves at the airport in Vegas, Nevada, about to jump on an airplane to cover Super Tuesday coming up.
[01:14:55.788 --> 01:14:59.531]  Great job Richard and of course Matt there, your camera person.
[01:15:00.231 --> 01:15:02.012]  I'm going to break that rule.
[01:15:02.012 --> 01:15:03.573]  I did that on purpose.
[01:15:03.573 --> 01:15:04.494]  Richard, I know you only have five minutes.
[01:15:04.494 --> 01:15:05.635]  You're going to jump on the plane.
[01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:07.316]  Recap what you saw.
[01:15:07.316 --> 01:15:10.558]  You caught unions engaged in what looked like preparation for Dirty Tricks.
[01:15:10.558 --> 01:15:12.339]  That still wasn't successful.
[01:15:12.339 --> 01:15:15.041]  Trump almost 46%, close to double.
[01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:18.263]  Marco Rubio in second place.
[01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:20.504]  The Glenn Beck situation so much more.
[01:15:20.504 --> 01:15:23.086]  Richard Reeves, what was the spirit?
[01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:26.608]  What was the flavor on the ground there?
[01:15:26.608 --> 01:15:27.669]  What did you witness?
[01:15:29.156 --> 01:15:33.664]  It was absolutely electric, absolutely unbelievable.
[01:15:33.664 --> 01:15:38.833]  Donald J., the T-Rex of presidential candidates, Trump.
[01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.145]  Congratulations.
[01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:42.547]  That was huge last night.
[01:15:42.547 --> 01:15:44.649]  He overachieved what I thought he would get.
[01:15:44.649 --> 01:15:46.751]  He overachieved by two or three percent.
[01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.634]  Dr. Carson overachieved a couple of percent.
[01:15:49.634 --> 01:15:53.738]  That's the five percent that I thought Ted Cruz was going to get to put him into second place.
[01:15:53.738 --> 01:15:57.041]  So bad news for Ted Cruz, that third place finish.
[01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:58.382]  Mark it down, folks.
[01:15:58.382 --> 01:15:58.983]  Mark it down.
[01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:11.268]  This is the beginning of the end of Ted Cruz, and it's also the beginning of the end of Marco Rubio, because Donald, the T-Rex presidential candidate, Trump, has got the ball.
[01:16:11.268 --> 01:16:13.569]  He has got the eye of the tiger.
[01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.510]  What we saw last night was awesome.
[01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:16.451]  It was electric.
[01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:18.591]  Thank you, Alex Jones, for getting us here.
[01:16:18.591 --> 01:16:23.894]  Thank you, InfoWarriors, for supporting InfoWars.com, InfoWars team, and all the related websites.
[01:16:24.474 --> 01:16:28.498]  Totally electric there at the audience here in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:16:28.498 --> 01:16:34.764]  And I'm telling you, Alex, upcoming on Tuesday, what we've got to watch for is the splitter strategy.
[01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:42.191]  The splitter strategy, we talked about it in a previous video, is where they hope that Kasich might be able to steal Michigan, Ohio.
[01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:45.114]  They hope that Marco Rubio might be able to grab Florida.
[01:16:45.114 --> 01:16:47.336]  And they hope that Ted Cruz might be able to grab Texas.
[01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:58.824]  So that splitter strategy is where they could potentially split up, divide it up, and then try to make it look reasonable even though he's still winning to contest the nomination and to continue it on till later.
[01:16:58.824 --> 01:17:11.273]  We need to be pushing that when he wins Super Tuesday, everybody needs to get on these candidates and tell them it's time for them to get out of the race and stop the attacks, or they're basically, they're the ones working for Hillary, they're the ones that are Democrats at that point, and we have to expand on all of that.
[01:17:12.185 --> 01:17:18.947]  We have to let folks know in Florida and Texas, and I really love Governor Abbott, but you know, he has to endorse his good buddy Ted Cruz.
[01:17:18.947 --> 01:17:19.807]  I understand that.
[01:17:19.807 --> 01:17:23.287]  But separate from that, we absolutely have to have Texas go for Trump.
[01:17:23.287 --> 01:17:27.368]  And I don't want to hear this thing, well, you know, Cruz kind of talks in a Texas accent.
[01:17:27.368 --> 01:17:30.809]  Look, I don't get into the whole cult of Texas thing, but I'm an eighth generation Texan.
[01:17:30.809 --> 01:17:34.090]  Okay, family at the whole nine yards helped start, I mean, literally started.
[01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.551]  The state, on my mother's side, and my dad's side was in it.
[01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:45.073]  So let me just tell you, as an original Texan, as original as it gets, I'm going for Trump, and I don't want to hear all this stuff about, Ted Cruz from Texas!
[01:17:45.073 --> 01:17:47.034]  I'm not against the guy that he's from Canada.
[01:17:47.034 --> 01:17:49.294]  I'm glad he got to Texas as soon as he could.
[01:17:49.294 --> 01:17:54.336]  But I'm a real Texan, as Texan as it gets, you know, I'm no hat and all cattle, okay?
[01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.617]  I don't wear a cowboy hat, but I got the cattle, literally.
[01:17:56.617 --> 01:17:57.717]  I got cattle.
[01:17:57.717 --> 01:17:58.517]  Black Angus.
[01:17:58.517 --> 01:17:59.458]  Now, let's go back to you.
[01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:00.778]  What do you think about that statement, Richard?
[01:18:01.826 --> 01:18:05.748]  Well, you and I are 100% on the same page right there.
[01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:07.689]  I think that, like I say, Ted Cruz is in trouble.
[01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:09.009]  He really needed a second place.
[01:18:09.009 --> 01:18:16.132]  So I think that potentially what we're going to see in these upcoming Super Tuesday states is more of Ted Cruz support going to Donald Trump.
[01:18:16.132 --> 01:18:21.955]  I wouldn't be surprised if in many states we see over 50% performance for Donald Trump, which would be excellent.
[01:18:22.555 --> 01:18:25.878]  Dr. Carson, another 2 or 3 percent will go to Donald Trump, I think.
[01:18:25.878 --> 01:18:28.379]  So in many states, over 50 percent.
[01:18:28.379 --> 01:18:31.542]  Ted Cruz, without that second place, he's injured.
[01:18:31.542 --> 01:18:32.042]  That's right.
[01:18:32.042 --> 01:18:36.485]  They kept saying that as other candidates dropped out, the other leads would get bigger, but that's not true.
[01:18:36.485 --> 01:18:37.686]  He's getting the leads.
[01:18:37.686 --> 01:18:39.868]  And there's polls out that Jeb Bush people are going to him.
[01:18:41.189 --> 01:19:00.700]  That's right, and on the delegate countdown, the great thing about Nevada, here's the thing Alex, congratulations to you and all the InfoWarriors because those dress rehearsals in 2008, the dress rehearsal in 2012, is what kept and made sure that these caucuses here in Nevada were run in an honest fashion.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.262]  The fact that all the Ron Paulers were in there and the Libertarians were watching now,
[01:19:04.702 --> 01:19:12.527]  Now we've got our people in a lot of delegate positions, not enough to overall steal it like Hillary would do, or the Republicans would do, but enough to keep it honest.
[01:19:12.527 --> 01:19:14.148]  That's right, they're going to keep it honest.
[01:19:14.148 --> 01:19:20.213]  I think the full delegate slate of 30 delegates are going to be Trump loyalists when they go to Cleveland.
[01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:21.253]  That's great news.
[01:19:21.253 --> 01:19:25.096]  So what I'm seeing so far is Iowa, I think they're going to be Trump loyalists.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.201]  You have New Hampshire.
[01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:28.582]  They're going to be Trump loyalists.
[01:19:28.582 --> 01:19:34.466]  South Carolina is the one state where we've got all the GOP-ers from 2015 that are going to be in that delegation.
[01:19:34.466 --> 01:19:35.407]  So we've got to worry about that.
[01:19:35.407 --> 01:19:43.673]  But the way to solve that is by Donald Trump just running the upcoming table here on all these states, getting masses, huge 60% levels of delegation.
[01:19:43.673 --> 01:19:44.113]  That's right.
[01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:46.155]  He needs to be as strong as possible.
[01:19:46.155 --> 01:19:48.577]  He's the winner to go up against Hillary, absolutely.
[01:19:48.577 --> 01:19:49.898]  When you're on tomorrow,
[01:19:51.232 --> 01:19:55.737]  I want to go over how we think they may, at the convention, try to steal it from him.
[01:19:55.737 --> 01:19:58.601]  I don't want to put the cart before the horse, but that's the next real fight.
[01:19:58.601 --> 01:20:00.103]  I mean, he's going to run the table.
[01:20:00.103 --> 01:20:06.250]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.253]  His name is Harry Dent.

[01:21:59.884 --> 01:22:01.505]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[01:22:01.505 --> 01:22:04.746]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[01:22:04.746 --> 01:22:06.366]  I take it three times a day.
[01:22:06.366 --> 01:22:11.868]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[01:22:11.868 --> 01:22:15.370]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:20.512]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy, let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[01:22:20.512 --> 01:22:23.973]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have zero percent body fat.
[01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:28.635]  I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[01:22:28.635 --> 01:22:35.058]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life and arthritis that runs through my family.
[01:22:35.058 --> 01:22:39.339]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[01:22:39.339 --> 01:22:42.181]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[01:22:42.181 --> 01:22:45.262]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.
[01:22:45.262 --> 01:22:47.803]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for One World Way.

[01:23:52.453 --> 01:23:55.754]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:23:55.754 --> 01:23:56.694]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:23:56.694 --> 01:24:02.417]  The people are rising up!
[01:24:22.148 --> 01:24:23.769]  Our champion is Donald Trump.
[01:24:23.769 --> 01:24:24.669]  Is he pure of heart?
[01:24:24.669 --> 01:24:26.130]  He better be.
[01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:28.731]  But he's only a manifestation of populism.
[01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:31.392]  And the establishment is battling him for real.
[01:24:31.392 --> 01:24:33.593]  He's firing 9-11 Truth.
[01:24:33.593 --> 01:24:35.614]  Attacks on the private Federal Reserve.
[01:24:35.614 --> 01:24:38.035]  Political correctness.
[01:24:38.035 --> 01:24:41.597]  Offshore deals meant to shut down our industry.
[01:24:41.597 --> 01:24:44.839]  Political correctness.
[01:24:44.839 --> 01:24:47.760]  Donald Trump definitely has the eye of the tiger.
[01:24:50.359 --> 01:24:51.920]  We need to stop going along with the system.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:56.643]  Stop always doing what they tell us is a smart move.
[01:24:56.643 --> 01:25:00.085]  It's all about justice being done.
[01:25:00.085 --> 01:25:02.966]  Though the heavens fall.
[01:25:02.966 --> 01:25:12.812]  And if the establishment thinks they're going to simply play games with Trump or the public, or if Trump thinks he's going to deceive us and play games, they have to know we're not in the climate we were before.
[01:25:12.812 --> 01:25:17.055]  This is just the beginning of the explosive, animating contest of liberty.
[01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:23.034]  The reawakening of humankind, led by men.
[01:25:23.034 --> 01:25:25.276]  Get ready, because it's here.
[01:25:25.276 --> 01:25:26.857]  This is just the beginning.
[01:25:26.857 --> 01:25:29.178]  But the detonation has begun.
[01:25:29.178 --> 01:25:33.661]  The explosion is now here.
[01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:39.765]  Alright, let me give the political correctness I was mentioning earlier than our guest is joining us.
[01:25:39.765 --> 01:25:44.468]  Every day I see videos shown in US, European, Australian colleges.
[01:25:44.468 --> 01:25:46.970]  Every day I see... I mean, I never showed the Marine getting beat up.
[01:25:49.093 --> 01:25:56.655]  Because he's a Marine, they see he's a Marine, he's a white guy, they beat him up, they've now arrested those guys.
[01:25:56.655 --> 01:25:57.435]  Racial attacks.
[01:25:57.435 --> 01:26:02.596]  I don't even play the footage anymore of like where they walk up and just shoot a cop for no reason.
[01:26:02.596 --> 01:26:04.156]  It's just crazy.
[01:26:04.156 --> 01:26:10.638]  And I know there are bad police out there too, but randomly just attacking some white guy because he's white, it's just so stupid.
[01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:13.231]  But why is it getting so bad?
[01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:32.059]  Because the media, the controlled media, is pushing the narrative that you don't have a job, or the society's falling apart, not because your mom was on welfare, not because she was a crackhead, not because the CIA shipped drugs in, but because there's a white marine at McDonald's.
[01:26:32.059 --> 01:26:37.801]  Kind of deserves to be beat up at a McDonald's.
[01:26:37.801 --> 01:26:38.221]  I'm joking.
[01:26:38.221 --> 01:26:39.322]  Some place is the only place to eat.
[01:26:41.633 --> 01:26:43.995]  But that article's out today.
[01:26:43.995 --> 01:26:50.081]  That footage, in fact, maybe we should just show the footage of the background of the Marine being attacked.
[01:26:50.081 --> 01:26:56.727]  But then this, Black Lives Matter protesters interrupt Mag Mile demonstration in support of Apple, CBS.
[01:26:56.727 --> 01:27:05.536]  What was billed as a demonstration on the Mag Mile in support of Apple's fight with the FBI turned into a latest protest over the city's handling, and then it goes on.
[01:27:07.628 --> 01:27:15.714]  And it's the entitlement of even Bernie Sanders and others and Democrats that say all lives matter and Black Lives Matter shows up so angry.
[01:27:15.714 --> 01:27:32.026]  It's like, that's what social justice warriorism is with feminists or anybody is they're so entitled, they're so hateful at you and they just look like they're on a power trip like they're mighty because they're a protected group and you've hurt them and they're going to show you with some
[01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:35.232]  Assertiveness training.
[01:27:35.232 --> 01:27:41.237]  They're gonna henpeck you into submission, and I just see it everywhere now.
[01:27:41.237 --> 01:27:50.205]  And women, particularly, just watch TV all day, and these sitcoms, and these dramas, and read these magazines telling them how to treat their boyfriends and husbands.
[01:27:50.205 --> 01:27:55.369]  It's all designed to wreck your family, break down society, and screw your kids up.
[01:27:55.369 --> 01:28:01.975]  On record, Dr. Spock saying, don't spank your kids, don't discipline them, and now we have a nation of just spoiled, rotten trash.
[01:28:04.335 --> 01:28:06.876]  They go, what are you, for beating your kids with a tire iron?
[01:28:06.876 --> 01:28:08.356]  No!
[01:28:08.356 --> 01:28:10.116]  They always show an extreme or the other.
[01:28:10.116 --> 01:28:14.597]  But in my day, you got paddled at school for getting in trouble.
[01:28:14.597 --> 01:28:16.197]  And believe me, you didn't want to get in trouble.
[01:28:16.197 --> 01:28:18.378]  Now, you just call the cops and they taser you.
[01:28:18.378 --> 01:28:19.978]  See, it just means more force.
[01:28:19.978 --> 01:28:25.039]  But only the government can have force, because it's the parent.
[01:28:25.039 --> 01:28:28.300]  School district spending millions on white privilege training for teachers.
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:28.880]  San Francisco.
[01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:31.126]  This is all over the country.
[01:28:31.126 --> 01:28:38.525]  There's no question that the Pacific Education Group, a San Francisco-based education installment company, is a successful for non-profit, for-profit business.
[01:28:40.902 --> 01:28:46.868]  It's a standing tribute to American capitalism and the success that entrepreneurs of all races can experience in the free market today.
[01:28:46.868 --> 01:28:51.973]  Of course, PEG's overt mission is to improve educational opportunities for black and other minority children.
[01:28:51.973 --> 01:28:59.219]  The company sells the notion of the American education system is unfairly based on traditional white cultural norms.
[01:28:59.219 --> 01:29:04.825]  So if you bring in Kwanzaa or something, that's supposedly reading, writing, arithmetic,
[01:29:06.434 --> 01:29:09.718]  Hygiene, being charming, etiquette is what you need.
[01:29:09.718 --> 01:29:13.484]  But oh no, we're going to learn about Indian and African culture all day.
[01:29:13.484 --> 01:29:14.705]  What does that even do?
[01:29:14.705 --> 01:29:15.867]  It just confuses everything.
[01:29:17.551 --> 01:29:21.335]  Because here's the deal, this culture in the United States is Renaissance culture.
[01:29:21.335 --> 01:29:24.938]  And it borrows from everything, but it's about success.
[01:29:24.938 --> 01:29:30.023]  And then it goes on, the main teaching is just how bad white people are.
[01:29:30.023 --> 01:29:31.864]  Again, don't miss it.
[01:29:31.864 --> 01:29:40.693]  The real mission here is just to screw everybody up, and make sure they burn all the time, teach them about purple penguins, and how white people are bad, instead of actually learning
[01:29:41.013 --> 01:29:49.481]  How to go get a job and be successful, and so you're a screwed up person with a chip on your shoulder, who can only get a government job being another henpecker, commissar!
[01:29:49.481 --> 01:29:52.003]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.003 --> 01:29:54.706]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.016 --> 01:30:02.897]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:04.579]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[01:30:04.579 --> 01:30:06.341]  What are you guys doing this Thursday?
[01:30:06.341 --> 01:30:07.743]  Probably nothing.
[01:30:07.743 --> 01:30:15.352]  You're gonna get off work, sit down, go through your TV channels, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, definitely a no.
[01:30:15.352 --> 01:30:18.296]  Watching Dung Beetles on Discovery Channel, negative.
[01:30:18.536 --> 01:30:27.340]  Get your laptop, hook it up to your TV, and go to infowars.com forward slash show and watch this Thursday's live GOP debate coverage.
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.741]  Watch as we smash through the lies and disinformation in real time.
[01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:38.504]  You'll see people like Lee Ann McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, and David Knight break everything down for you.
[01:30:38.504 --> 01:30:40.965]  The GOP debate shouldn't be something that's boring.
[01:30:40.965 --> 01:30:43.306]  It should be fun for you and all your friends and family.
[01:30:43.306 --> 01:30:43.586]  Ha ha!
[01:30:43.806 --> 01:30:45.948]  So get some popcorn, sit down and enjoy.
[01:30:45.948 --> 01:30:55.096]  Make sure you join us this Thursday, February 25th, 2016 at 7pm Central Standard Time as we break down everything that's happening with the GOP debate.
[01:30:58.644 --> 01:31:04.407]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:31:04.407 --> 01:31:18.833]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:31:19.093 --> 01:31:27.097]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:31:27.097 --> 01:31:32.539]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:31:32.539 --> 01:31:36.241]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:40.363]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:31:40.363 --> 01:31:44.245]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:31:44.725 --> 01:31:44.965]  I think so.
[01:32:03.502 --> 01:32:12.350]  Yongevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.
[01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:16.294]  Yongevity also offers you an ingenious way to augment your income.

[01:32:55.461 --> 01:32:56.762]  Check it out for yourself today.
[01:33:04.191 --> 01:33:22.085]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:22.085 --> 01:33:23.646]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:23.646 --> 01:33:28.269]  It's the Alex Jones Show when I call in full work live with yours truly Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:39.143]  Coming up in the fourth hour today, we have David Knight hosting the transmission, always doing an excellent job.
[01:33:39.143 --> 01:33:43.284]  We'll cover all the latest news that's breaking as we're here talking today.
[01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:47.385]  We have some breaking news I want to get to as well.
[01:33:47.385 --> 01:33:53.427]  I also want to get into persecution of Republicans and Conservatives and Libertarians by Democrats across the country.
[01:33:54.501 --> 01:33:58.503]  Russia takes concrete steps towards Syrian ceasefire.
[01:33:58.503 --> 01:34:00.084]  Turkey continues shelling.
[01:34:00.084 --> 01:34:03.386]  GOP judiciary says no hearing on Obama court nominee.
[01:34:03.386 --> 01:34:09.109]  That's good news, but Obama's talking about an emergency appointment for what they call the nuclear option.
[01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:12.331]  We're going to be talking to Larry Nichols about that in just a moment.
[01:34:12.331 --> 01:34:12.831]  North Korea?
[01:34:14.531 --> 01:34:14.791]  We're good.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:39.228]  He was wanting to talk to me off-air about it, and I'm just not even going to do that because he knows about how this works better than I. If it isn't on-air, then I don't need to know about it.
[01:34:39.228 --> 01:34:42.031]  But we're going to see how much he can say on-air.
[01:34:42.031 --> 01:34:46.076]  Also the big Trump victory, what he thinks about that and a lot more.
[01:34:46.076 --> 01:34:53.423]  But before we go any further, we upgraded our shopping cart last year at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:34:56.564 --> 01:34:58.585]  And that means also Infolwerslife.com.
[01:34:58.585 --> 01:34:59.786]  It's both the same shopping cart.
[01:34:59.786 --> 01:35:01.187]  It's two different URLs.
[01:35:01.187 --> 01:35:03.949]  Infolwerslife.com takes you directly to the nutraceuticals.
[01:35:03.949 --> 01:35:08.112]  Infolwersstore.com is the big general site that has everything.
[01:35:08.112 --> 01:35:19.300]  To where we could have AutoShip where you can sign up for every 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days for specific items you want.
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:22.022]  That way you don't have to always be basically reordering it.
[01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:29.924]  And you get 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip® in perpetuity.
[01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:36.610]  You can stock up on BrainForce®, our amazing NutraTropic® and InfoWarsLife.com and get 10% off when you select AutoShip® before checkout.
[01:35:36.610 --> 01:35:42.036]  The InfoWars crew loves BrainForce® and many of the crew have started taking it instead of drinking coffee.
[01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:48.162]  Rob Duke took BrainForce® and was able to pull an all-nighter and finish the entire Louis Farrakhan interview that was two hours long.
[01:35:48.582 --> 01:35:57.028]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate extract and Alpha-GPC.
[01:35:57.028 --> 01:36:04.074]  BrainForce, VinForceLife.com, already has hundreds of five-star reviews that you can read for yourself at VinForceLife.com.
[01:36:04.074 --> 01:36:09.538]  Secure your BrainForce today while supplies last at VinForceLife.com and get 10% off with AutoShip.
[01:36:10.711 --> 01:36:16.514]  And I didn't think about this as a promo, but really, we're always holding back enough to cover those that are signing up for AutoShip.
[01:36:16.514 --> 01:36:29.522]  So basically, signing up for AutoShip means, for all intents and purposes, we will never be sold out of something, which happens all the time, because our herbs are the highest cold-pressed quality.
[01:36:29.522 --> 01:36:32.444]  Also, we have the all-new InfoWars Live Joint Formula.
[01:36:32.444 --> 01:36:38.948]  It's nine different known high-quality organic herbs and compounds known to boost joint health and so much more.
[01:36:40.885 --> 01:36:50.610]  And it would normally cost over $60 to get all of these separately at the same dose, but we have it all in together, concentrated, 60 capsules.
[01:36:50.610 --> 01:36:53.112]  Check out Joint Formula for yourself today.
[01:36:53.112 --> 01:36:58.214]  And finally, our liver cleanse is back in stock after being sold out for two months.
[01:36:58.214 --> 01:37:04.238]  You can watch the informational videos, read the reviews there as well about LiverShield.
[01:37:05.464 --> 01:37:08.245]  And you can see Leanne doing it, and what happened to her.
[01:37:08.245 --> 01:37:13.048]  You can see Rob Dew doing it, losing 12 pounds in one week of just a tritis that was in his intestines.
[01:37:13.048 --> 01:37:16.590]  I mean, you take it with the Oxy-Powder, it's traumatic.
[01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:24.214]  Do yourself a favor, take the time to go to InfoWarsLife.com, click on the liver shield section, and see it for yourself now, back in stock.
[01:37:24.634 --> 01:37:28.638]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:28.638 --> 01:37:31.120]  And finally, support our local affiliates.
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.261]  Become a sponsor.
[01:37:32.261 --> 01:37:33.282]  Support the sponsors.
[01:37:33.282 --> 01:37:35.223]  Let them know why you're supporting the sponsors.
[01:37:35.223 --> 01:37:36.885]  Send the station a hundred bucks.
[01:37:36.885 --> 01:37:46.453]  If the middle class and working class and wealthy people especially don't start spending your money, your time, and your energy in the fight for liberty, we're going to lose everything.
[01:37:46.453 --> 01:37:49.275]  About 37% of the wealth of China left in just the last six months.
[01:37:49.275 --> 01:37:50.797]  Something like 20% of the wealth of the U.S.
[01:37:52.622 --> 01:37:54.843]  This globalism is going to put a hurdle on everybody, folks.
[01:37:54.843 --> 01:37:56.804]  It's now time to really take action.
[01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.385]  And people now get that.
[01:37:58.385 --> 01:37:59.606]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:37:59.606 --> 01:38:03.348]  But regardless, you can't lose with this because these are such high-quality products.
[01:38:03.348 --> 01:38:08.090]  And I want to thank you all for shopping with the good guys at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:10.851]  Now, going to our guest.
[01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:13.092]  Going to our guest, Larry Nichols, Clinton insider.
[01:38:13.092 --> 01:38:14.553]  Doesn't need any introduction.
[01:38:14.553 --> 01:38:15.814]  I've been interviewing him for 20 years.
[01:38:15.814 --> 01:38:16.994]  Been on air 21 years.
[01:38:19.045 --> 01:38:23.728]  And he's the constant Clinton insider, the Clinton Chronicles, all of it couldn't have been done without him.
[01:38:23.728 --> 01:38:25.990]  MENA, the CIA drug dealing, all of it.
[01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:27.451]  He exposed it.
[01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:28.551]  He used to run their campaigns.
[01:38:28.551 --> 01:38:30.533]  He wouldn't be part of the murders.
[01:38:30.533 --> 01:38:33.435]  And the Clintons have talked about how he's their big enemy.
[01:38:33.435 --> 01:38:40.879]  Now I know early on in the Clinton administration, they tried to destroy certain people that were being nominated to the Supreme Court.
[01:38:40.879 --> 01:38:42.941]  That's when Nichols got to know them.
[01:38:42.941 --> 01:38:46.083]  And Nichols became an early source on the internet for a lot of folks out there.
[01:38:48.294 --> 01:38:50.497]  And he's battling cancer right now, and obviously needs your prayers.
[01:38:50.497 --> 01:38:53.220]  That's another issue, but one reason he hasn't been on us the last few days.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.924]  Also, it took him a few days to get back in touch with this person.
[01:38:56.924 --> 01:39:01.228]  He talked to him on the Monday after Scalia died on the Saturday.
[01:39:01.228 --> 01:39:02.470]  And Nichols set the time.
[01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:03.971]  I don't know what happened, but it looks weird.
[01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:08.076]  No autopsy, and we're going to investigate all these people, and we're going to check into it.
[01:39:08.076 --> 01:39:09.117]  But it is perfect timing.
[01:39:10.196 --> 01:39:10.476]  I feel better.
[01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:33.870]  Good.
[01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:35.031]  Hope you're taking care of yourself.
[01:39:35.031 --> 01:39:36.051]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:39:36.051 --> 01:39:39.052]  Obviously people have been calling, emailing, tweeting.
[01:39:39.052 --> 01:39:40.692]  Alex, where's Larry Nichols?
[01:39:40.692 --> 01:39:42.933]  When are you going to tell us what the Supreme Court Justice said?
[01:39:42.933 --> 01:39:44.753]  When are you going to tell us what happened?
[01:39:44.753 --> 01:39:47.034]  Well, you've been busy and weren't ready to comment.
[01:39:47.034 --> 01:39:52.816]  You still say this person now that you talked to doesn't want to have what they told you discussed.
[01:39:53.576 --> 01:40:03.704]  Let's start with the black sedan last, what was it, last Wednesday that was out in your driveway that would drive away every time you went out there, but you got photos of it driving away.
[01:40:03.704 --> 01:40:05.346]  You say you called the police, they came out.
[01:40:05.346 --> 01:40:06.126]  Let's start there.
[01:40:06.126 --> 01:40:07.848]  Let's start where we finished.
[01:40:07.848 --> 01:40:11.811]  Well, technically what that was was Homeland Security.
[01:40:11.811 --> 01:40:21.919]  And they told the police here that they had no jurisdiction over them and they could do any damn thing they wanted to do and pretty much let them believe that I had a one-way ticket to Gitmo.
[01:40:23.157 --> 01:40:25.338]  Now, what that meant, I have no idea.
[01:40:25.338 --> 01:40:29.219]  And Alex, if they want me, I live at 58 Kensington Drive, Conway, Arkansas.
[01:40:29.219 --> 01:40:31.499]  I've never hidden it.
[01:40:31.499 --> 01:40:32.380]  Come on.
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:33.620]  Let's do what's got to be done.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.440]  Just don't bore me to death.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:42.582]  I think a lot of it has to do, Alex, with how I end up in the middle of this junk, Alex, I never can figure out.
[01:40:42.582 --> 01:40:47.924]  But it has to do, I think, with some of the things that I was working on with this Galea death.
[01:40:47.924 --> 01:40:50.685]  Now, here's what's coming.
[01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:51.985]  There's going to be an investigation.
[01:40:53.012 --> 01:41:01.558]  So many of the things that were given as evidence and witness statements have turned out to be wrong.
[01:41:01.558 --> 01:41:03.800]  Wrong is, lies, whatever.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:12.046]  There's fixing to be a serious investigation and we're going to find out the truth about Scalia.
[01:41:12.046 --> 01:41:19.752]  Now, we may not find out about it through the mainstream media, but I assure you, I will know and if I know, you'll know and your audience will know.
[01:41:20.726 --> 01:41:21.727]  So, that's coming.
[01:41:21.727 --> 01:41:27.270]  Now, what kind of got me in the middle of it is the guy that owns the ranch.
[01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:28.490]  His name is Poindexter.
[01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:30.691]  Alex, that's right, isn't it?
[01:41:30.691 --> 01:41:31.212]  Poindexter.
[01:41:31.212 --> 01:41:32.973]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:32.973 --> 01:41:41.197]  When I was with the Contras in Nicaragua, when we would fight in the southern part of Nicaragua, there you would team up with the Muscogee Indians.
[01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:52.379]  When we'd start being chased by the Sandinistas, we'd run across the border into Costa Rica into a safe farm, 5,000 acre farm, owned by John Hall.
[01:41:52.379 --> 01:41:56.102]  But he had a silent partner.
[01:41:56.102 --> 01:42:00.125]  Now, this is pretty dubious stuff, Alex, back in those days.
[01:42:00.125 --> 01:42:02.567]  This is pretty slippery stuff.
[01:42:02.567 --> 01:42:04.769]  Well, guess who his silent partner was?
[01:42:06.927 --> 01:42:08.868]  Point Dexter.
[01:42:08.868 --> 01:42:10.769]  Another Point Dexter.
[01:42:10.769 --> 01:42:16.011]  Matter of fact, it's the Point Dexter that's got to do with the ranch.
[01:42:16.011 --> 01:42:16.732]  I've confirmed that.
[01:42:28.055 --> 01:42:34.296]  We've got the fact that he gets this special award created for him, given to him in person by Obama.
[01:42:34.296 --> 01:42:37.717]  He's part of these big brokerage firms that are connected to clandestine groups.
[01:42:37.717 --> 01:42:39.177]  I mean, that right there stinks.
[01:42:39.177 --> 01:42:41.438]  The story changing, no autopsy.
[01:42:41.438 --> 01:42:42.778]  Wow.
[01:42:42.778 --> 01:42:44.978]  Yeah, I mean, it's gonna get ugly.
[01:42:44.978 --> 01:42:57.201]  And what they're hoping, and I'm talking about Obama and the people involved in this, they're hoping that this will get totally buried by the election and it'll just go away.
[01:42:57.677 --> 01:42:59.918]  Well, it's not going to go away.
[01:42:59.918 --> 01:43:01.319]  It's not.
[01:43:01.319 --> 01:43:05.121]  And we're going to find out exactly what happened.
[01:43:05.121 --> 01:43:13.905]  And as you know, and folks, just so that you know, I have not shared anything with Alex in private.
[01:43:13.905 --> 01:43:14.326]  I wouldn't.
[01:43:14.326 --> 01:43:16.006]  It's not fair to Alex.
[01:43:16.006 --> 01:43:22.750]  And to the bad guys, if you're listening, I don't talk to Alex privately, so don't worry with him.
[01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:24.291]  But that's coming.
[01:43:24.291 --> 01:43:26.512]  Now, Alex, I got another bit of news for you.
[01:43:27.458 --> 01:43:35.224]  The Republican hierarchy, the establishment, they have decided to forego fighting Donald Trump.
[01:43:35.224 --> 01:43:36.405]  They're not going to fight him.
[01:43:36.405 --> 01:43:38.466]  Wow.
[01:43:38.466 --> 01:43:42.669]  Were you told this by insiders or were you able to see it in tea leaves?
[01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:45.211]  No, I don't do tea leaves.
[01:43:45.211 --> 01:43:48.734]  What they're doing is they're setting him up for the convention.
[01:43:50.649 --> 01:43:54.971]  Now, I don't know how many conventions any of you have ever worked or been around, but I've been around a lot of them.
[01:43:54.971 --> 01:43:58.432]  The Republican convention, Alex, is kind of weird.
[01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:00.814]  You know, the Democrats have what they call superdelegates.
[01:44:00.814 --> 01:44:03.915]  Superdelegates, folks, when people go vote,
[01:44:04.699 --> 01:44:07.701]  And they pick who they want to be their presidential nominee.
[01:44:07.701 --> 01:44:08.762]  Well, that's the people.
[01:44:08.762 --> 01:44:10.483]  Well, the Democrats didn't like that.
[01:44:10.483 --> 01:44:12.385]  So they wanted to put control on it.
[01:44:12.385 --> 01:44:23.233]  So they created this group called superdelegates, which are basically sitting congressmen, senators, governors, people that are in politics that are in good standing with the party.
[01:44:23.233 --> 01:44:24.814]  So it overrules the people.
[01:44:25.313 --> 01:44:30.298]  So if you're a Democrat and you think you're voting for this person or that, you ought to just go to superdelegates.
[01:44:30.298 --> 01:44:32.580]  And Democrats are just now learning about this.
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.001]  It's been in place since 72.
[01:44:34.001 --> 01:44:35.262]  They can't believe it.
[01:44:35.262 --> 01:44:36.123]  They can't believe it.
[01:44:36.123 --> 01:44:38.665]  Nah, the Republicans have their nasty trick.
[01:44:38.665 --> 01:44:40.247]  It's called a broker convention.
[01:44:41.235 --> 01:44:47.880]  When delegates are awarded because of the primary, they go to the convention.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:45:00.969]  When they get to the convention, you'll notice it goes around the floor and everybody says, from the great state of Arkansas, we give 28, cast our 28 votes to whatever.
[01:45:00.969 --> 01:45:05.912]  The second, if it's not 51%, when it goes around the floor for the first time,
[01:45:07.657 --> 01:45:15.265]  The second time it goes around the floor, the delegates are released, Alex, from their commitment to their people.
[01:45:15.265 --> 01:45:20.530]  That's right, because they're claiming that there's a stalemate, now it goes to the party insiders.
[01:45:20.530 --> 01:45:22.012]  That's exactly right.
[01:45:22.012 --> 01:45:27.638]  So, what they intend to do is meet Trump there.
[01:45:27.638 --> 01:45:28.599]  And folks, there's gonna...
[01:45:29.275 --> 01:45:32.276]  That's a tough one to beat, Alex, but we will beat it.
[01:45:32.276 --> 01:45:32.957]  We will beat it.
[01:45:32.957 --> 01:45:37.419]  Well, I mean, they tried to steal it from Reagan, and they said, at least put George Herbert Walker on, and we're going to steal it.
[01:45:37.419 --> 01:45:41.841]  But he had such a landslide, but they were able to force Bush in there.
[01:45:41.841 --> 01:45:46.083]  Boy, that's why it's important for Trump to go in with a landslide of delegates, isn't it?
[01:45:46.083 --> 01:45:46.623]  It is.
[01:45:46.623 --> 01:45:53.386]  Now, they also, because of that problem, they put in another little rule that exists today.
[01:45:53.386 --> 01:45:57.468]  There are some number of states, I don't know, I'm finding out who they are,
[01:45:58.044 --> 01:46:05.890]  But there are some number of states that the delegates don't even have to vote with the will of the people the first round.
[01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:07.972]  That's their protection device.
[01:46:07.972 --> 01:46:17.899]  You know, if you, conceivably, with the way Donald Trump's going, he could get enough delegate votes where he wins the first round.
[01:46:17.899 --> 01:46:19.420]  Well, they're fixing to jam that up.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:22.243]  They're going to jam it up on him.
[01:46:22.243 --> 01:46:25.825]  And they have foregone, they've given up trying to fight him.
[01:46:25.825 --> 01:46:26.646]  Now,
[01:46:27.659 --> 01:46:30.941]  That's coming.
[01:46:30.941 --> 01:46:38.444]  You know, Alex, they're doing everything, every dirty trick they can to enslave us.
[01:46:38.444 --> 01:46:42.286]  And this is all coming to a head very, very fast.
[01:46:42.286 --> 01:46:46.948]  Down to and including the replacement for Scalia.
[01:46:46.948 --> 01:46:54.092]  As you know, the Republicans, whatever you want to call them, the Republicans have said they're not going to entertain
[01:46:56.204 --> 01:46:59.307]  Looking into another replacement for Scalia.
[01:46:59.307 --> 01:47:15.820]  But most people don't realize, Alex, there is a law that was signed in 1970, I believe, and it says that a president in his last term, the last year of his last term, cannot appoint someone to the Supreme Court.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.901]  Unless there's an emergency.
[01:47:17.699 --> 01:47:22.041]  Unless there's an emergency within the court and Obama's fixing to use it.
[01:47:22.041 --> 01:47:31.665]  And when you hear Obama and the media talking about the nuclear option, Alex, you heard it first here when you and I talked about it last week.
[01:47:31.665 --> 01:47:34.486]  That's what the nuclear option is.
[01:47:34.486 --> 01:47:35.707]  And he's going to pull it.
[01:47:35.707 --> 01:47:36.427]  He's going to pull it.
[01:47:36.427 --> 01:47:38.768]  And when he does that,
[01:47:40.194 --> 01:47:43.859]  The whole dynamic of the country is going to change, Alex.
[01:47:43.859 --> 01:47:48.444]  He's been doing it on open borders, he's been doing it on guns, he's been doing it on military.
[01:47:48.444 --> 01:47:55.913]  Will the Republicans sit there and let him do an emergency appointment?
[01:47:55.913 --> 01:47:56.995]  You put me in spot, didn't you?
[01:47:56.995 --> 01:47:58.376]  Did you do it on purpose?
[01:47:59.031 --> 01:48:03.776]  No, I mean, I'm just trying to figure, I mean, I know we don't know, but at least they're blocking a hearing.
[01:48:03.776 --> 01:48:05.939]  I mean, they just can't let Obama do this.
[01:48:05.939 --> 01:48:14.488]  The only reason the Republicans are blocking the hearing, or give the sense that they're blocking the hearing, is to get them through this election cycle.
[01:48:15.643 --> 01:48:27.208]  Once the election cycle is over in November, they fully intend to address the situation with Obama and put in a Supreme Court justice before the next legislature or the next Congress takes off.
[01:48:27.208 --> 01:48:31.390]  And that's why Obama keeps saying in due time, if people want it now, he's going to wait until after the election.
[01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:32.030]  He's going to wait.
[01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:34.871]  Which shows there's a deal going on behind the scenes.
[01:48:34.871 --> 01:48:35.591]  Exactly.
[01:48:35.591 --> 01:48:36.972]  That's what I try to tell people.
[01:48:36.972 --> 01:48:38.512]  There are not two teams, Alex.
[01:48:38.512 --> 01:48:39.133]  There's not.
[01:48:39.133 --> 01:48:39.593]  It's one.
[01:48:40.427 --> 01:48:41.608]  They get together.
[01:48:41.608 --> 01:48:42.628]  I've been there.
[01:48:42.628 --> 01:48:44.109]  I've been in the cloakroom.
[01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:45.170]  I've been in the meetings.
[01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:48.151]  And they come off the floor of Congress.
[01:48:48.151 --> 01:48:53.874]  They say, boy, you, Teddy Kennedy, you sure knocked me in the butt on that speech you gave.
[01:48:53.874 --> 01:48:56.976]  And then Orrin Hatch will say, yeah.
[01:48:56.976 --> 01:48:58.977]  And then they're just buddies.
[01:48:58.977 --> 01:49:00.278]  It's all an act.
[01:49:00.618 --> 01:49:01.739]  And that's the old guard.
[01:49:01.739 --> 01:49:05.803]  They're threatened by the Libertarians, the Ron Paul types, and the Trumpians.
[01:49:05.803 --> 01:49:07.024]  And that's why there's a war.
[01:49:07.024 --> 01:49:12.368]  The old establishment thinks it can keep suppressing this giant populist explosion.
[01:49:12.368 --> 01:49:15.651]  If they steal it from Trump, there's going to be civil unrest.
[01:49:15.651 --> 01:49:17.573]  And maybe that's what Obama wants.
[01:49:17.573 --> 01:49:22.337]  Then he's got his Black Lives Matter group thawed out, ready to activate.
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:27.122]  You know, that's the thing, Alex, that people need to know.
[01:49:27.122 --> 01:49:28.423]  We're getting boxed in.
[01:49:28.423 --> 01:49:30.204]  People can think Obama's messing up.
[01:49:30.204 --> 01:49:33.125]  Hey, that old boy's pulling every trick he wants to pull.
[01:49:33.125 --> 01:49:34.086]  He's pulling it.
[01:49:34.086 --> 01:49:35.746]  And you're exactly right.
[01:49:35.746 --> 01:49:42.710]  He would love nothing better than for Trump to get cheated out of the election, for there to be an uprising, and then boom, he's now king.
[01:49:42.710 --> 01:49:44.351]  You don't have to worry about a president.
[01:49:44.351 --> 01:49:45.491]  He'll be it.
[01:49:45.491 --> 01:49:49.373]  He'll be king forever, at least until he doesn't want to be king.
[01:49:49.373 --> 01:49:52.855]  Now, another thing happened in Nevada.
[01:49:54.201 --> 01:50:18.553]  And by the way, I got word, a friend of mine went down there, Chad King, the guy that produced the States Right video for me, he went down and he met with Richard and Matthew, your guys, and thanks to the effort that they did, working with a lady named Miriam Witcher, 46% of the Latino vote went with Trump.
[01:50:18.553 --> 01:50:22.015]  That has brought Washington to its knees.
[01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:33.722]  That has Hillary's team scared pink because, remember, the rules with the Clinton campaign is a broken coalition.
[01:50:33.722 --> 01:50:44.654]  Stay there, explain it to us on the other side and I'm going to play the question of Obama making the joke about having to appoint a new judge at the Governor's Conference and all the cackling and weirdness that went on.
[01:50:46.075 --> 01:50:48.359]  That looks like a serious celebration.
[01:50:48.359 --> 01:50:50.103]  To me, very, very sick.
[01:50:50.103 --> 01:50:51.986]  I mean, is it another message?
[01:50:51.986 --> 01:50:53.629]  Like the pillow on the face?
[01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:56.415]  Luca Broxi sleeps with the fishies?

[01:53:04.804 --> 01:53:11.089]  We set out to make going to live events better by creating a way for you to get closer to the action at a price you want to pay.
[01:53:11.089 --> 01:53:11.709]  How?
[01:53:11.709 --> 01:53:19.175]  At ScoreBig.com, we work directly with your favorite teams and performers to get their unsold seats at unpublished prices and pass the huge savings on to you.
[01:53:19.175 --> 01:53:21.137]  At ScoreBig.com, you can name a ticket price.
[01:53:21.237 --> 01:53:23.078]  Still haven't made it to an NBA or NHL game?
[01:53:23.078 --> 01:53:26.339]  The seasons are winding down, so don't miss your chance to save on tickets!
[01:53:48.228 --> 01:53:49.948]  Here's what Obama had to say about old Scalia.
[01:53:49.948 --> 01:53:51.509]  We slowed it down so you can really hear it and see it good.
[01:53:51.509 --> 01:53:52.249]  Helping people retrain.
[01:53:52.249 --> 01:53:52.869]  Appointing judges.
[01:54:17.130 --> 01:54:18.071]  The usual stuff.
[01:54:35.993 --> 01:54:39.155]  You know, I've known a lot of people like you, Larry, that was, you know, well-known.
[01:54:39.155 --> 01:54:39.795]  People can look it up.
[01:54:39.795 --> 01:54:42.177]  Green Beret, Special Forces, operations all over the world.
[01:54:42.177 --> 01:54:51.162]  I know a lot of people that are Navy Shields, Delta Force, you know, guys that can do 300 pull-ups, you know, stuff, guys that can literally tear your head off your body.
[01:54:51.162 --> 01:54:56.385]  You know, the guys they got now are like, they're probably the guys with the, you know, double Y chromosomes and all the rest of it.
[01:54:56.385 --> 01:54:56.826]  Superman.
[01:54:57.566 --> 01:55:02.528]  And then I love people like Hillary and Obama, the folks that never do any of the killing, but they order the killing.
[01:55:02.528 --> 01:55:09.950]  I've noticed only killers that actually never did the killing love to brag about it and shmirk and say, I'm a good killer, I'm good at killing people.
[01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:13.591]  All the real killers I know are kind of sad about the killing and don't brag about it.
[01:55:13.591 --> 01:55:14.792]  They don't see it as good luck.
[01:55:14.792 --> 01:55:16.652]  What is it with the bragging about all this?
[01:55:16.652 --> 01:55:25.295]  And then let's get into, because I've got to go soon, into once he gets through the Broker Convention and then what do you expect the Clintons to pull then?
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:28.701]  Well, Hillary's on her way.
[01:55:28.701 --> 01:55:30.102]  She is on her way.
[01:55:30.102 --> 01:55:36.925]  Everything she needed to accomplish, you and I talked about when she first announced she was running, she has about accomplished it.
[01:55:36.925 --> 01:55:42.448]  Look, when was the last time you heard anything major about the email scandal?
[01:55:42.448 --> 01:55:46.390]  I mean, they mention it periodically, but not like it was.
[01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:48.891]  All of this is going away.
[01:55:48.891 --> 01:55:54.914]  By the time the election starts, the general election, you're going to hear Hillary say a million times,
[01:55:55.822 --> 01:55:57.583]  It's already been thoroughly investigated.
[01:55:57.583 --> 01:55:58.884]  Nobody found anything.
[01:55:58.884 --> 01:56:04.008]  It's those mean old right-wing conservative Republicans that have stirred all this up.
[01:56:04.008 --> 01:56:07.651]  And she couldn't be an astronaut and everybody was mean to her.
[01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:10.233]  And then they're mean to her.
[01:56:10.233 --> 01:56:11.614]  She's going to run a tough campaign.
[01:56:11.614 --> 01:56:14.676]  Now, I would offer this caution to Donald Trump.
[01:56:14.676 --> 01:56:22.082]  I hope he wins this primary and it looks good for him right now in the primary season, but
[01:56:23.371 --> 01:56:31.793]  Alex, if you can talk to Mr. Trump, you need to tell him, this is going to be just like playing TiddlyWinks compared to running against Hillary.
[01:56:31.793 --> 01:56:33.073]  It'll be brutal.
[01:56:33.073 --> 01:56:35.614]  That will be a brutal campaign.
[01:56:35.614 --> 01:56:37.514]  And he's going to have to get ready.
[01:56:37.514 --> 01:56:40.595]  Do you think Hillary, I mean, we know Hillary's ordered a lot of deaths.
[01:56:40.595 --> 01:56:49.297]  Do you think she'd have enough huevos to actually order, in the middle of a campaign, for him to be poisoned, have a heart attack, blow his plane up?
[01:56:50.373 --> 01:56:51.393]  Alright, let me say it this way.
[01:56:51.393 --> 01:56:57.096]  As you know, Alex, I have never said the Clintons ever actually killed anybody or ordered them to be killed.
[01:56:57.096 --> 01:57:01.658]  However, people have died by the dozens around them.
[01:57:01.658 --> 01:57:09.422]  Now, talking about Hillary, would she be the kind of person that would have no trouble saying off the guy?
[01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:11.302]  Hillary would do it in a second.
[01:57:11.302 --> 01:57:12.603]  In a second.
[01:57:12.603 --> 01:57:19.266]  Now, I hope Trump is using alternate security than just the Secret Service because he's going to need it.
[01:57:20.154 --> 01:57:27.819]  You know, Donald Trump is standing up for America right now on illegal immigration and many other subjects.
[01:57:27.819 --> 01:57:29.339]  He's at risk.
[01:57:29.339 --> 01:57:31.541]  And Hillary and them have a perfect co-opening.
[01:57:31.541 --> 01:57:38.005]  You know, a bunch of Mexicans could come in and shoot at Trump and she'd just go, what difference does it make?
[01:57:38.005 --> 01:57:39.285]  It wasn't me.
[01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:41.407]  He was saying he was going to close the border.
[01:57:41.407 --> 01:57:42.827]  So you got to watch out.
[01:57:42.827 --> 01:57:44.248]  It's going to get serious.
[01:57:44.248 --> 01:57:45.949]  We're talking Alex Jones.
[01:57:45.949 --> 01:57:47.810]  We got the Pope coming out against him.
[01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:48.531]  I mean, everybody.
[01:57:48.971 --> 01:57:50.071]  Trump's good, folks.
[01:57:50.071 --> 01:57:51.512]  He is our champion now.
[01:57:51.512 --> 01:57:54.813]  Regardless, this is epic, and people are still sitting on the sidelines.
[01:57:54.813 --> 01:57:56.374]  Just wait until they get him.
[01:57:56.374 --> 01:57:57.914]  Then people are going to feel really bad.
[01:57:57.914 --> 01:58:03.936]  In closing, talking to the Supreme Court Justice, and I know you said there were a few other tidbits, but what can we know?
[01:58:03.936 --> 01:58:06.017]  That there is an investigation going on.
[01:58:06.017 --> 01:58:07.157]  Will we be hearing about it?
[01:58:07.157 --> 01:58:10.198]  Is it governmental or private?
[01:58:10.198 --> 01:58:13.559]  How do I say this and not get somebody in trouble?
[01:58:13.559 --> 01:58:15.300]  There will be a government investigation.
[01:58:16.090 --> 01:58:24.216]  But in the interest of keeping it honest, there has been a vote to make a parallel private investigation.
[01:58:24.216 --> 01:58:28.499]  So there will be an investigation, both government and private.
[01:58:28.499 --> 01:58:30.881]  And we're going to know the outcome.
[01:58:30.881 --> 01:58:31.181]  Wow.
[01:58:31.181 --> 01:58:32.342]  Thank you, Larry Nichols.
[01:58:32.342 --> 01:58:33.582]  Thank you very much, my friend.
[01:58:33.582 --> 01:58:34.063]  We'll talk to you.
[01:58:34.063 --> 01:58:36.545]  You're saying that's from a Supreme Court justice?
[01:58:36.545 --> 01:58:37.405]  That's from a Supreme Court justice.
[01:58:37.405 --> 01:58:38.186]  Do one more minute with us.
[01:58:38.186 --> 01:58:39.687]  I know you got to go, but I want to come back and finish that.

[02:00:13.564 --> 02:00:15.367]  We are on the march.
[02:00:15.367 --> 02:00:18.531]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:00:18.531 --> 02:00:22.696]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:22.696 --> 02:00:28.183]  All right, Larry Nichols has got to go, but I want him in his own words as we're up against a break.
[02:00:28.183 --> 02:00:30.346]  Some of it was getting cut off.
[02:00:30.346 --> 02:00:30.847]  Recap.
[02:00:32.813 --> 02:00:35.795]  The Supreme Court Justice he talked to without giving the name.
[02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:36.755]  We have that info.
[02:00:36.755 --> 02:00:38.676]  We saw last week when he was on.
[02:00:38.676 --> 02:00:42.698]  He's out in the countryside, black SUV pulling in, pulling out when he'd go outside.
[02:00:42.698 --> 02:00:43.859]  He got a photo of it.
[02:00:43.859 --> 02:00:44.639]  The police came.
[02:00:44.639 --> 02:00:46.340]  He's called the local police.
[02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:48.241]  They talked to him and said, hey, we're Homeland Security.
[02:00:48.241 --> 02:00:49.842]  There's nothing you can do.
[02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:55.305]  And did they really add the smart mouth comment, Larry, you know, that Mr. Nichols is going to be going to Gitmo?
[02:00:56.658 --> 02:00:58.539]  He got a one-way ticket to Gitmo.
[02:00:58.539 --> 02:00:59.600]  Now, I don't know.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.922]  I mean, I didn't talk to him, but I can't imagine where the PD would have gotten a comment like that.
[02:01:03.922 --> 02:01:05.383]  That's not something they would have said.
[02:01:05.383 --> 02:01:06.484]  So you know the local PD?
[02:01:06.484 --> 02:01:07.404]  Well, you've been there forever.
[02:01:07.404 --> 02:01:22.694]  I mean, describe what happened there, and then in a minute or two, recap that you're saying, and you're a credible guy over the years for me, that you talked to Supreme Court Justice, and the word is there's going to be an incredible, there's going to be a federal investigation, and there's also a parallel private one.
[02:01:22.694 --> 02:01:22.974]  Go ahead.
[02:01:23.507 --> 02:01:24.148]  Right.
[02:01:24.148 --> 02:01:32.320]  Well, first off, what happened last week is, right on the air, while we were talking, the van, I go to let the dog out and do his little wee-wee break.
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.501]  What did I find in the driveway?
[02:01:33.501 --> 02:01:36.045]  A black SUV.
[02:01:36.045 --> 02:01:37.888]  I walk outside to see what it is.
[02:01:38.692 --> 02:01:40.153]  They back up to the end of the driveway.
[02:01:40.153 --> 02:01:42.355]  Well, I turned around thinking they were just turning around.
[02:01:42.355 --> 02:01:43.495]  I walked back to the door.
[02:01:43.495 --> 02:01:46.838]  They pull back up, turn back around, walk back out.
[02:01:46.838 --> 02:01:48.259]  And I knew something was up then.
[02:01:48.259 --> 02:01:49.920]  Two bruisers sitting in the front seat.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:53.482]  The windows were blackened on the side, but I could see through the front window.
[02:01:53.482 --> 02:01:54.983]  That's how close they were.
[02:01:54.983 --> 02:01:58.565]  And then I finally got a picture through the phone.
[02:01:58.565 --> 02:01:59.146]  That happened.
[02:01:59.682 --> 02:02:00.402]  That's just coming.
[02:02:00.402 --> 02:02:02.504]  We're not in America anymore, folks.
[02:02:02.504 --> 02:02:04.625]  This isn't America like we thought it was.
[02:02:04.625 --> 02:02:09.668]  Now, Scalia, there's going to be a joint investigation.
[02:02:09.668 --> 02:02:13.230]  One, by the government, through a special prosecutor.
[02:02:13.230 --> 02:02:21.735]  The other, through an independent... ...parallel, so that there can be no doubt as to the credibility of the investigation.
[02:02:21.735 --> 02:02:22.535]  Larry, start over.
[02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:23.956]  Your Skype cut out magically.
[02:02:23.956 --> 02:02:25.437]  Start over again on the investigation.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:29.523]  There's going to be a parallel, dual investigation.
[02:02:29.523 --> 02:02:46.338]  One by a special prosecutor for the government and the other by a special private investigation unit so that there can be no doubt as to the findings of what happened to Justice Scalia.
[02:02:46.338 --> 02:02:47.159]  That's coming.
[02:02:47.159 --> 02:02:51.423]  And as soon as it does, step by step, I'm told I will know
[02:02:52.870 --> 02:03:00.096]  And if I know, you will know, Alex, and all I can say to everybody in closing, believe in Donald Trump, please.
[02:03:00.096 --> 02:03:01.077]  Let's work.
[02:03:01.077 --> 02:03:05.981]  And Alex, we'll be dealing with these things coming up, what they're planning and the convention and all that.
[02:03:05.981 --> 02:03:08.624]  And we'll talk about what we can do to stop it.
[02:03:08.624 --> 02:03:10.005]  But folks, this is our time.
[02:03:10.005 --> 02:03:10.726]  This is our country.
[02:03:10.726 --> 02:03:13.048]  And I think, Alex, you'll join with me.
[02:03:13.048 --> 02:03:14.088]  We lose this election.
[02:03:14.088 --> 02:03:16.390]  There ain't gonna be another.
[02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.791]  It's over.
[02:03:17.844 --> 02:03:20.045]  Well, thank you so much, Mr. Nichols, for joining us.
[02:03:20.045 --> 02:03:24.729]  Clearly, the entire power structure is against him because they don't know who he is.
[02:03:24.729 --> 02:03:31.533]  Well, we see what he's doing, and we know it's a better move than Hillary, and so regardless, this is an epic time to be alive.
[02:03:31.533 --> 02:03:32.654]  Thank you so much, Mr. Nichols.
[02:03:33.274 --> 02:03:34.014]  You bet, Alex.
[02:03:34.014 --> 02:03:34.795]  Thank you, buddy.
[02:03:34.795 --> 02:03:35.695]  Thank you.
[02:03:35.695 --> 02:03:39.377]  And if you're watching right now, he's leaving us now.
[02:03:39.377 --> 02:03:40.637]  Larry is battling cancer.
[02:03:40.637 --> 02:03:42.178]  He's been coming on the show for 20 years.
[02:03:42.178 --> 02:03:43.538]  He never asked for support.
[02:03:43.538 --> 02:03:47.380]  He came on probably 50 times back in like 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000 during the Clintons.
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:48.220]  I had him on a few times since then.
[02:03:52.222 --> 02:03:54.203]  He never asked for anything, never wrote a book, never did any of that.
[02:03:54.203 --> 02:03:56.583]  But he was a successful guy in business, everything.
[02:03:56.583 --> 02:03:58.244]  Now he's out there battling cancer.
[02:03:58.244 --> 02:04:00.845]  I mean, he even has a tracheotomy in.
[02:04:00.845 --> 02:04:04.586]  And I'm going to put his address up on screen for folks who support him.
[02:04:04.586 --> 02:04:07.506]  The more medical care he gets, the longer they can keep him alive.
[02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:08.407]  He's been open about that.
[02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:10.727]  He just wants to stay alive through this election.
[02:04:10.727 --> 02:04:11.568]  And he's a tough guy.
[02:04:11.568 --> 02:04:15.009]  Larry Nichols, 58, Kingsington Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034.
[02:04:15.009 --> 02:04:19.370]  And his PayPal is NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:22.761]  And he has been getting some donations.
[02:04:22.761 --> 02:04:24.822]  He wanted to thank all of you for that.
[02:04:24.822 --> 02:04:27.323]  He's been able to get some of the medical care he needs.
[02:04:27.323 --> 02:04:30.244]  We were up there about four months ago and shot a documentary with him.
[02:04:30.244 --> 02:04:33.746]  And we're going to probably edit that in with all this new information.
[02:04:33.746 --> 02:04:36.947]  And he literally is living hand to mouth with the cancer.
[02:04:36.947 --> 02:04:39.248]  He's been battling for several years, lung cancer.
[02:04:39.248 --> 02:04:39.949]  And it's progressed.
[02:04:39.949 --> 02:04:41.509]  But he's a fighter.
[02:04:41.509 --> 02:04:45.151]  And he's literally, like he said, he's bored.
[02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:47.072]  They're going to just come kill him, you know, just come on.
[02:04:48.467 --> 02:04:49.989]  I'm kind of in that position.
[02:04:49.989 --> 02:04:52.632]  I'm not afraid of these people anymore.
[02:04:52.632 --> 02:04:55.736]  At least I'm not traitorous sacks of garbage like they are.
[02:04:55.736 --> 02:04:58.079]  At least I can look my children in the eyes and feel like a man.
[02:05:00.177 --> 02:05:05.940]  On this Wednesday, February 24th, 2016, here are some of the top stories on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:14.285]  More signs of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is in danger, as Russia and India reach an agreement to trade in their own currencies.
[02:05:14.285 --> 02:05:21.769]  And after failing to cover up the New Year's assaults in Cologne, German police began a witch hunt for whistleblowers who leaked what really happened.
[02:05:22.467 --> 02:05:33.054]  And as Donald Trump joins the calls to audit the Fed, we offer 100 reasons why we need to know what this powerful and private institution is doing to manipulate the economy.
[02:05:33.746 --> 02:05:41.091]  For laughs, watch video of Donald Trump shutting down and burying Glenn Beck at the Nevada caucuses last night.
[02:05:41.091 --> 02:05:50.157]  As Glenn Beck was speaking, endorsing Cruz at the caucus, Trump walks in and the crowd and media flock to Trump, leaving Beck by himself.
[02:05:50.157 --> 02:05:54.099]  You'll find all those articles and more at Infowars.com.
[02:05:54.099 --> 02:05:54.680]  I'm David Knight.
[02:05:58.297 --> 02:06:01.798]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:01.798 --> 02:06:10.042]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:10.042 --> 02:06:15.464]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:06:15.464 --> 02:06:17.985]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:06:34.973 --> 02:06:39.775]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.

[02:07:26.433 --> 02:07:31.995]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[02:07:31.995 --> 02:07:35.556]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:07:35.556 --> 02:07:39.698]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:07:39.698 --> 02:07:43.559]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:11.011]  Big Brother.
[02:08:11.011 --> 02:08:12.792]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:12.792 --> 02:08:14.714]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:14.714 --> 02:08:16.395]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:16.395 --> 02:08:18.057]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:18.057 --> 02:08:23.281]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.281 --> 02:08:24.722]  Black tie.
[02:08:36.664 --> 02:08:40.988]  Yeah, LaGrange, they got some real, really nice girls down there.
[02:08:40.988 --> 02:08:54.600]  And coming to you from just north of LaGrange, Austin, Texas, I'm your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide from the Lone Star State.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:58.983]  Diamond rings, I ain't missing.
[02:08:58.983 --> 02:09:00.525]  Alright, let's get serious here.
[02:09:02.259 --> 02:09:03.220]  I want to open the phones up.
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:09.303]  We've got some special reports coming up as well and a ton of news that I've mentioned some of but haven't drilled down into yet.
[02:09:09.303 --> 02:09:14.306]  What do you think about the caucus in Nevada?
[02:09:14.306 --> 02:09:17.648]  What do you think about Super Tuesday coming up next Tuesday?
[02:09:17.648 --> 02:09:19.208]  What do you really think about Donald Trump?
[02:09:19.208 --> 02:09:20.189]  What do you think about Hillary Clinton?
[02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:24.491]  What do you think about what you just heard with Larry Nichols and the state of the world?
[02:09:24.491 --> 02:09:28.634]  I've not known Larry Nichols a lot of me in the 20 years I've known him.
[02:09:28.634 --> 02:09:30.695]  And the fact that he talked to Supreme Court Justice
[02:09:32.205 --> 02:09:46.914]  That says the word is there's going to be a special investigator assigned to this and there's also a parallel private case and you add to that Dick Cheney's quote when he was asked about his friend Scalia being found dead, he said no comment.
[02:09:46.914 --> 02:09:48.015]  Unprecedented.
[02:09:48.015 --> 02:09:52.358]  What do you think about all of that and the subjects I'm about to go over right now?
[02:09:52.358 --> 02:09:53.118]  We're doing it again.
[02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:55.460]  First time callers, give you a chance to call in.
[02:09:56.613 --> 02:09:56.713]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:56.713 --> 02:09:56.973]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:56.973 --> 02:10:08.656]  Now, let's get back into the political corrects stack, because I didn't finish that.
[02:10:08.656 --> 02:10:11.497]  I want to recap it, talk about what a cult this is.
[02:10:11.497 --> 02:10:19.839]  CBS News, Black Lives Matter protesters interrupt mag-mile demonstration in support of Apple not giving over the nation's passcodes.
[02:10:19.839 --> 02:10:25.581]  And, by the way, Bill Gates, of course, is for Apple giving up their codes, because then they'll all be penetrated and wide open like PCs.
[02:10:26.892 --> 02:10:28.893]  And this is about breaking encryption.
[02:10:28.893 --> 02:10:30.435]  This is a referendum on that.
[02:10:30.435 --> 02:10:32.436]  Nothing to do with getting into these phones.
[02:10:32.436 --> 02:10:40.742]  They can go get the phone records and ISP records of everything they did from the phone company and from the internet service provider and they know it.
[02:10:40.742 --> 02:10:43.324]  You think you're erasing your history on your computer?
[02:10:43.324 --> 02:10:47.527]  It's not erased at the internet service provider.
[02:10:47.527 --> 02:10:48.968]  Or the phone company.
[02:10:48.968 --> 02:10:49.589]  And they know that.
[02:10:50.757 --> 02:10:54.940]  School districts spending millions on white privilege training for teachers.
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:11:00.303]  And that's to sabotage and brain damage the kids into self-loathing.
[02:11:00.303 --> 02:11:03.985]  Hillary, white people need to recognize our privilege.
[02:11:03.985 --> 02:11:06.887]  In fact, can we cue up that piece from BuzzFeed that's gone viral?
[02:11:06.887 --> 02:11:12.370]  I never played that yesterday where they asked the people of color about whites and they say how bad whites are.
[02:11:12.370 --> 02:11:16.813]  This is racism publicly being exercised to create racial division.
[02:11:18.507 --> 02:11:24.434]  Hillary, white people need to recognize our privilege and practice humility.
[02:11:24.434 --> 02:11:28.840]  And then she came out and said she didn't get to be an astronaut when she was a little girl.
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:29.441]  Not because...
[02:11:31.690 --> 02:11:36.512]  She never tried to be one, not because she had any of the skills, no, just she wanted to whine.
[02:11:36.512 --> 02:11:37.893]  She's been suppressed.
[02:11:37.893 --> 02:11:40.034]  She's only made $300 million.
[02:11:40.034 --> 02:11:45.336]  She's only gotten to murder, you know, entire leadership of countries and let Al-Qaeda kill hundreds of thousands.
[02:11:45.336 --> 02:11:47.637]  I mean, she's such a baby.
[02:11:47.637 --> 02:11:49.398]  Oh, she was abused.
[02:11:51.343 --> 02:11:59.630]  Meanwhile, we should probably roll this footage in the background, Black Lives Matter advocates arrested for robbing, beating Marine veteran.
[02:11:59.630 --> 02:12:01.952]  First, the media said it wasn't a racial attack.
[02:12:01.952 --> 02:12:04.574]  Now they admit it is, and now there's footage.
[02:12:04.574 --> 02:12:05.255]  It's pretty powerful.
[02:12:05.255 --> 02:12:18.786]  In fact, before we go to the Hillary footage, or before we even go to the, uh, whites are evil, um, video from Buzzfeed, can we pull up the Marine being attacked at McDonald's?
[02:12:18.786 --> 02:12:20.107]  Because it's just crazy.
[02:12:21.294 --> 02:12:26.119]  And then someone's approached, and because you're white, or because you're a veteran, you get attacked.
[02:12:26.119 --> 02:12:29.443]  And listen, I'm not a racist, I'm not an idiot, I'm not a fool.
[02:12:29.443 --> 02:12:32.246]  But there are thugs of all races and groups.
[02:12:32.246 --> 02:12:34.368]  And people that get in gangs.
[02:12:34.368 --> 02:12:36.410]  You can go to the wrong area and rednecks will attack you.
[02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:38.593]  The wrong area, black thugs will attack you.
[02:12:38.593 --> 02:12:40.915]  Or, you know, Hispanic thugs do this.
[02:12:42.395 --> 02:12:44.796]  You do this with black gang members and others.
[02:12:44.796 --> 02:12:46.356]  There is an attitude.
[02:12:46.356 --> 02:12:49.857]  There is just a, you deserve to be robbed, you deserve to be beaten.
[02:12:49.857 --> 02:12:52.358]  What does the new Black Panther Party say out of Houston all the time?
[02:12:52.358 --> 02:12:56.819]  They're like, don't rob in the hood, go to the white areas and mug them.
[02:12:56.819 --> 02:12:59.100]  I mean, it's just, don't mug anybody.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:03.501]  And this is all pushed by the Ford Foundation, by Soros, and by the White House.
[02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:08.762]  Black Lives Matter advocates arrested for robbing, beating Marine veteran, who just did nothing.
[02:13:08.762 --> 02:13:10.323]  They just beat him up and robbed him because he's white.
[02:13:11.817 --> 02:13:13.117]  He's a Marine Corps veteran.
[02:13:13.117 --> 02:13:19.699]  Police investigators said they took 17-year-old male and 17-year-old female into custody and charged them with aggravated assault and robbery.
[02:13:19.699 --> 02:13:20.739]  Man, I just don't get it.
[02:13:20.739 --> 02:13:23.920]  Even when it's veterans, people don't even fight back that much.
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.501]  I mean, uh... Somebody attacks me, I just go completely wild.
[02:13:28.501 --> 02:13:31.022]  I just don't get it.
[02:13:31.022 --> 02:13:34.823]  It would take... I don't know how I would just get in a fetal position and be beaten.
[02:13:34.823 --> 02:13:35.343]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:41.981]  I mean, I've been overwhelmed and been tackled before by, you know, four or five people, and I just start biting huge chunks out of people.
[02:13:41.981 --> 02:13:42.941]  People go, that's crazy.
[02:13:42.941 --> 02:13:43.942]  No, I'm primal.
[02:13:43.942 --> 02:13:46.162]  I got teeth for a reason.
[02:13:46.162 --> 02:13:47.723]  And believe me, most people just hold back.
[02:13:47.723 --> 02:13:49.563]  They, you know, I couldn't bite a chunk out of somebody.
[02:13:49.563 --> 02:13:53.064]  You can bite right through somebody's blue jeans and just go right through.
[02:13:53.064 --> 02:13:54.424]  And I'm sorry.
[02:13:54.424 --> 02:13:55.625]  You know, it's just what has to be done.
[02:13:55.625 --> 02:13:57.365]  I just don't get it.
[02:13:57.365 --> 02:13:59.465]  See, people think if you're primitive, you're dumb.
[02:13:59.465 --> 02:14:00.186]  No, no, no, no.
[02:14:00.186 --> 02:14:01.346]  If you're modern, you're dumb.
[02:14:02.148 --> 02:14:12.518]  See, if you're primitive, you're wired into everything you got, including your higher intelligence, but also you're bestial, primitive, caveman, bone-breaking, you know, you want to fight?
[02:14:12.518 --> 02:14:16.601]  You get in a real fight, somebody knocks you upside the head with a steel bar, it feels good.
[02:14:16.601 --> 02:14:21.746]  And I just don't get why people aren't ready to fight, politically or physically, it's pathetic.
[02:14:21.746 --> 02:14:25.390]  Excuse me, continuing here.
[02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:26.691]  Obama administration
[02:14:28.211 --> 02:14:32.674]  Changes rule to welcome immigrants with STDs.
[02:14:32.674 --> 02:14:33.834]  AIDS.
[02:14:33.834 --> 02:14:37.036]  Tuberculosis.
[02:14:37.036 --> 02:14:38.257]  Hepatitis.
[02:14:38.257 --> 02:14:40.158]  I mean, no country on earth does this.
[02:14:40.158 --> 02:14:42.539]  But see, it's about collapsing the country.
[02:14:42.539 --> 02:14:45.241]  It's about a hatred of America.
[02:14:45.241 --> 02:14:51.825]  Oh, and I'm afraid no matter what color your kids are, they're going to get the tuberculosis all around in the TB.
[02:14:51.825 --> 02:14:54.947]  But that's okay, because it's racist not to want diseases.
[02:14:56.403 --> 02:14:59.284]  Suspect indicted in Jessica Chambers' burning death.
[02:14:59.284 --> 02:15:09.688]  Folks that said it was racially motivated a year ago, plus what happened now, they're admitting it, and they have arrested two people for grabbing the cheerleader, reportedly raping her and then pouring gasoline on her and killing her.
[02:15:09.688 --> 02:15:14.170]  But, you know, it's okay because she's white and they're black, so there you go.
[02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:16.051]  There won't be any national marches about this.
[02:15:16.051 --> 02:15:20.212]  There won't be any big... Maybe Hillary will come out and say she deserved it, you know?
[02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:20.792]  Why not?
[02:15:20.792 --> 02:15:24.714]  Gloria Steinem won't talk about the jihadis running around murdering and raping and killing.
[02:15:27.134 --> 02:15:33.358]  Because Gloria Steinem and Hillary are conquerors of men and conquerors of America and conquerors of women in our families.
[02:15:33.358 --> 02:15:35.099]  They want to conquer humans.
[02:15:35.099 --> 02:15:37.180]  That means the family.
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:40.402]  By the way, they pretty much conquered black people and they're conquering everybody else.
[02:15:40.402 --> 02:15:46.426]  They break up the families, give you a thug culture, destroy everything.
[02:15:46.426 --> 02:15:53.411]  And then, when a lot of black people get up on their feet and become successful, they energize a new race war to create more division.
[02:15:53.411 --> 02:15:54.872]  That's the party of the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:15:56.255 --> 02:16:01.198]  Over 110,000 migrants have already crossed into Europe by sea in 2016 alone.
[02:16:01.198 --> 02:16:02.558]  AFP.
[02:16:02.558 --> 02:16:03.899]  Witch hunt for whistleblowers.
[02:16:03.899 --> 02:16:10.583]  German police probing cops who leaked Cologne sex assaults.
[02:16:10.583 --> 02:16:13.164]  Yeah, they're talking in Germany, France, Sweden and other places.
[02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:20.408]  They're saying we're going to arrest the police officers that leak the crime statistics and leak the assaults because they won't be involved in the cover-ups.
[02:16:22.486 --> 02:16:33.269]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those that cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:16:33.269 --> 02:16:38.390]  We tried to look up who said that, because I like to give people credit, but it's from the 1770s.
[02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:51.693]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those that cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:16:55.802 --> 02:16:57.623]  See, it's the cowards in government.
[02:16:57.623 --> 02:16:58.843]  They're not all cowards.
[02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:24.151]  But the cowards in the FBI, the cowards in the ATF, the cowards in the federal marshals, the cowards in the whole DHS system, that think because they've got a college degree and go shooting at the range and, you know, are on steroids and have big biceps and, you know, deadlift 600 pounds, and they're in a culture of hating the patriots and hating the American people, that that makes who you work for good or makes the crimes you commit okay because you have authority.
[02:17:27.947 --> 02:17:38.795]  But just know this, there are people sitting right next to you that know you're a little boy who's scared and is following along with the system because of peer pressure and you yourselves have Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:17:38.795 --> 02:17:43.398]  Only a crazy person would go along with this takeover.
[02:17:43.398 --> 02:17:47.180]  It's called the final takeover of the final revolution by the technocrats in their own writings.
[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:47.701]  You can look it up.
[02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:51.822]  Because it ends humanity as we know it.
[02:17:51.822 --> 02:17:55.363]  It makes us dependent on a machine that the globalists control.
[02:17:55.363 --> 02:17:57.663]  And that's if they decide to even keep us around.
[02:17:57.663 --> 02:18:05.786]  That's why Drudge... Did we ever find his tweet where he said, uh, don't give in to the brainwashing, go outside, feel the water, feel the air, feel the wind?
[02:18:05.786 --> 02:18:07.946]  Did we just go to his Twitter?
[02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.527]  I promise it's there.
[02:18:09.527 --> 02:18:11.627]  And I just want to put it on screen.
[02:18:11.627 --> 02:18:12.428]  I'm begging.
[02:18:12.428 --> 02:18:16.449]  Like, you guys do an excellent job, but I just really want that.
[02:18:17.372 --> 02:18:31.922]  Because it's that image of the Facebook ad with all his slaves going into his world, his false reality, wearing the virtual reality goggles, and notice he doesn't have them on, and it says everything.
[02:18:31.922 --> 02:18:36.865]  They're squatting low like four-legged animals as the Ascendant Man walks by them.
[02:18:36.865 --> 02:18:38.126]  He's not an Ascendant Man.
[02:18:38.126 --> 02:18:41.408]  He had to bring them low before he ascended.
[02:18:41.408 --> 02:18:41.769]  There it is.
[02:18:42.722 --> 02:18:47.924]  From his personal tweet, dear fellow humans, fight the coming brainwashing with all the energy you have left.
[02:18:47.924 --> 02:18:52.105]  Feel the water, the air, remember it.
[02:18:52.105 --> 02:18:53.886]  Ah, what an astute way to say it.
[02:18:53.886 --> 02:18:56.466]  I wish I could send out tweets like that.
[02:18:56.466 --> 02:18:58.067]  Sometimes I do.
[02:18:58.067 --> 02:19:04.169]  The dredge is good at staying quiet until he has that great little crystal moment, and me, I just blabber and there's a few little diamonds in there.
[02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:06.930]  Iraqi Kurds say Swedish teenage girl rescued from ISIS.
[02:19:08.582 --> 02:19:11.823]  Effort to open voting to illegal immigrants underway in New York City.
[02:19:11.823 --> 02:19:12.403]  Officially!
[02:19:12.403 --> 02:19:14.723]  Okay, Illinois tried to legalize it last year.
[02:19:14.723 --> 02:19:19.885]  And the Justice Department's there to make sure it can happen.
[02:19:19.885 --> 02:19:22.985]  As Sweden collapses, Norway promises to close border.
[02:19:22.985 --> 02:19:26.266]  Norwegian Prime Minister is prepared for the worst.
[02:19:26.266 --> 02:19:30.527]  France describes it as their highway system has collapsed.
[02:19:30.527 --> 02:19:32.748]  With the road ban, it's the robberies.
[02:19:32.748 --> 02:19:33.728]  Just type into YouTube.
[02:19:34.768 --> 02:19:36.970]  Immigrants, migrants rob on highway.
[02:19:36.970 --> 02:19:39.813]  It's just descended into road warrior.
[02:19:39.813 --> 02:19:43.176]  And the liberal socialists are all trained how to do what when they get attacked?
[02:19:43.176 --> 02:19:48.902]  They literally roll over, actually teach this at college campuses, and urinate on themselves.
[02:19:48.902 --> 02:19:53.046]  When you're attacked, you don't fight your family, you get on the ground and start urinating.
[02:19:53.046 --> 02:19:54.728]  I'm not kidding, look it up.
[02:19:54.728 --> 02:19:56.589]  This is what they've given us.
[02:19:56.589 --> 02:19:57.290]  A culture of death.
[02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:09.386]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[02:20:09.386 --> 02:20:12.989]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[02:20:12.989 --> 02:20:16.693]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[02:20:17.353 --> 02:20:19.174]  I said, let me see.
[02:20:19.174 --> 02:20:30.237]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[02:20:30.237 --> 02:20:41.360]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[02:20:42.301 --> 02:20:43.322]  How about you?

[02:20:44.642 --> 02:20:44.962]  That's 1-800-654-1632.

[02:20:46.083 --> 02:20:46.463]  We shop.
[02:20:46.463 --> 02:20:46.723]  You save.
[02:20:59.910 --> 02:21:03.611]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[02:21:03.611 --> 02:21:09.054]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[02:21:09.054 --> 02:21:15.776]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[02:21:15.776 --> 02:21:20.018]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[02:21:20.018 --> 02:21:22.779]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[02:21:22.779 --> 02:21:24.199]  Well now, so do I!
[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:30.523]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.

[02:21:36.366 --> 02:21:39.228]  Even when your wallet is open, imitators don't do that.
[02:21:39.228 --> 02:21:44.090]  ID Stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.

[02:23:28.394 --> 02:23:29.795]  You know about RVs.
[02:23:29.795 --> 02:23:31.256]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:23:31.256 --> 02:23:33.997]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:23:33.997 --> 02:23:36.759]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[02:23:36.759 --> 02:23:38.900]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.

[02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:56.831]  survivalistcamps.com
[02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:09.492]  I absolutely must get into all this news, but I also want to go to your phone calls.
[02:24:09.492 --> 02:24:25.658]  We have more on the election, more on Hillary, more on the Apple situation with the FBI, more on the Supreme Court, more on Russia and the future of the dollar, more on persecution of Republicans, Christians, and Libertarians, more on North Korea.
[02:24:25.658 --> 02:24:28.719]  Beijing overtakes New York City as billionaire capital of the world.
[02:24:30.984 --> 02:24:32.144]  That's just some of the news.
[02:24:32.144 --> 02:24:34.525]  I mean, I've got hundreds of stories here.
[02:24:34.525 --> 02:24:40.646]  I've been meaning to talk about Kanye West, but it's so epic, I don't want to just mention it and not do it.
[02:24:40.646 --> 02:24:47.107]  I've been following it since last week when Pizza Hut has been trolling him.
[02:24:47.107 --> 02:24:49.247]  The guy's made over $300 million.
[02:24:49.247 --> 02:24:51.428]  I looked it up.
[02:24:51.428 --> 02:24:56.108]  And he now is $50 million in the hole.
[02:24:56.108 --> 02:24:59.349]  But that's only on houses and properties that he just needs to sell.
[02:25:00.287 --> 02:25:04.348]  He's only in the hole on those properties and he's such a pig.
[02:25:04.348 --> 02:25:24.232]  He's such an arrogant crazy person that he wants his fans to give him money and they've already donated two million dollars to this fund and then he goes on TV shows and award shows and grabs mics away and says that other people are better than them and he gives money to Black Lives Matter.
[02:25:24.232 --> 02:25:27.712]  You talk about the ultimate narcissist crazy person.
[02:25:27.712 --> 02:25:28.573]  That's not true.
[02:25:28.573 --> 02:25:29.753]  How do you pronounce the guy's name?
[02:25:30.888 --> 02:25:32.970]  Raised the drug price 5,000 plus percent.
[02:25:32.970 --> 02:25:35.452]  He looks more narcissistic and crazy.
[02:25:35.452 --> 02:25:39.735]  But man, these two, imagine if you... Martin Shkreli.
[02:25:39.735 --> 02:25:43.078]  If you merge these two crazies together, what would you get?
[02:25:43.078 --> 02:25:50.084]  A self-entitled, just $200 cruddy t-shirt and champagne he sells?
[02:25:50.084 --> 02:25:52.646]  And I know people who think they're so cool.
[02:25:52.646 --> 02:25:54.808]  Man, that's uncool.
[02:25:54.808 --> 02:25:55.809]  Man, that's uncool.
[02:25:58.567 --> 02:26:06.130]  And I'm not really a fan of Pizza Hut, but I'm going to have to go eat one of their pizzas just because they trolled the daylights out of him saying, oh, we got a job for you, you know, come here.
[02:26:06.130 --> 02:26:11.572]  And they put out, you know, the fake resume that he supposedly returned to him.
[02:26:11.572 --> 02:26:19.295]  I want to troll Kyan as well.
[02:26:19.295 --> 02:26:20.836]  Kanye, whatever his stupid name is.
[02:26:20.836 --> 02:26:26.458]  I mean, the emptiness, because I've been in Hollywood, I've been at the big mansions, the emptiness of these people.
[02:26:27.924 --> 02:26:36.109]  You couldn't pay me any amount of money to live at one of those mansions with, say, Kim Kardashian, and most people think she's God.
[02:26:36.109 --> 02:26:43.493]  All these women watch her shows every day and literally think that's how you govern your future and that that's a woman.
[02:26:43.493 --> 02:26:54.760]  I was on an elliptical machine once, and there was this show on, and it was like 45 minutes, because they had ads, of her just showing another purse, another piece of jewelry, another car she had,
[02:26:55.902 --> 02:26:58.644]  And then just cutting to yachts and stuff.
[02:26:58.644 --> 02:27:04.709]  And imagine, you've got people brought up in front of television, entitled, dumb.
[02:27:04.709 --> 02:27:07.891]  Parents don't teach them hygiene.
[02:27:07.891 --> 02:27:08.912]  They've never been disciplined.
[02:27:08.912 --> 02:27:10.953]  I mean, black, white, doesn't matter.
[02:27:10.953 --> 02:27:19.660]  And then they're watching these shows with all this incredible wealth, thinking that's like another planet, and they haven't ever attained success.
[02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:20.801]  I mean, I've talked to people that go,
[02:27:22.435 --> 02:27:35.481]  Oh my gosh, you've been at a party with Brad Pitt and Josh Brolin and Sean Penn and Francis Ford Coppola?
[02:27:35.481 --> 02:27:36.501]  What is it like?
[02:27:36.501 --> 02:27:37.001]  What is it?
[02:27:37.001 --> 02:27:43.704]  Just a bunch of neurotic, unhappy people with their neurotic, unhappy girlfriends.
[02:27:43.704 --> 02:27:47.926]  The food's a little better, you can fly on planes quicker and not go through airport security.
[02:27:49.906 --> 02:28:01.437]  You know, when a butler is on a jet giving you hors d'oeuvres and there's women trying to pull your clothes off, people think, oh, that's the most wonderful thing on earth.
[02:28:01.437 --> 02:28:07.582]  You just get on these jets, and of course I'm a family guy, I've never done anything, and now I just don't even do it.
[02:28:07.582 --> 02:28:09.044]  Now I have opportunities all the time.
[02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:15.572]  And there's a butler serving you food and then there's just women in bikinis.
[02:28:15.572 --> 02:28:23.376]  And it's like they are just like the plate of strawberries and cheese and blueberries you're being offered.
[02:28:23.376 --> 02:28:24.837]  And champagne.
[02:28:24.837 --> 02:28:28.519]  And I don't just, oh there's a woman here, let's get that bikini off you right now.
[02:28:28.519 --> 02:28:32.701]  And it's not because I'm not a red-blooded man.
[02:28:32.701 --> 02:28:34.322]  It's because they've been dehumanized.
[02:28:36.277 --> 02:28:37.438]  And that's what it is out in L.A.
[02:28:37.438 --> 02:28:50.112]  All these rich guys, they've all got a mansion, and it's all full of a bunch of young women, and man, you talk about... I have been inside satanic ceremonies.
[02:28:50.112 --> 02:28:57.521]  When I snuck into Bohemian Grove, but before that, when I was a teenager in Dallas, they were always trying to get me to join it, so at least three times, I was taken to one, not knowing it was one.
[02:28:58.353 --> 02:28:59.114]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:28:59.114 --> 02:29:01.496]  I got out all three times, and man, they got pissed.
[02:29:01.496 --> 02:29:05.379]  But the point is, is that it was always women luring me into it.
[02:29:05.379 --> 02:29:06.360]  My life's been like a movie.
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:07.020]  Just look at it now.
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:08.642]  It just gets crazier by the second.
[02:29:08.642 --> 02:29:10.043]  This is Twilight Zone.
[02:29:10.043 --> 02:29:13.466]  And all that was training, though, for stuff later.
[02:29:13.466 --> 02:29:14.927]  And let me tell you something.
[02:29:14.927 --> 02:29:20.792]  Inside a satanic coven, I did not feel the soul-sucking death that I feel in Los Angeles.
[02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:26.052]  And that's why for me to even go out there, which I'm going to go out there very, very soon.
[02:29:26.052 --> 02:29:27.093]  Joe Rogan just got back with us.
[02:29:27.093 --> 02:29:28.174]  I'm going to go on his podcast.
[02:29:28.174 --> 02:29:30.296]  I'm going to visit with Chris Carter and others.
[02:29:30.296 --> 02:29:31.777]  I got a bunch of stuff to do out there.
[02:29:31.777 --> 02:29:32.598]  I'm not name dropping.
[02:29:32.598 --> 02:29:33.779]  I'm just saying, look, we're effective.
[02:29:33.779 --> 02:29:36.261]  We're having, you know, big change in the world.
[02:29:36.261 --> 02:29:38.142]  But for me, I have to literally
[02:29:38.923 --> 02:29:42.426]  Not just the stuff in the atmosphere and the dust and the people, but the spirit of it.
[02:29:42.426 --> 02:29:45.808]  Because I start getting sick as the plane comes in.
[02:29:45.808 --> 02:29:46.189]  Okay?
[02:29:46.189 --> 02:29:47.810]  It's satanic, folks.
[02:29:47.810 --> 02:29:49.211]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.211 --> 02:29:51.733]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.733 --> 02:29:54.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.851 --> 02:30:02.711]  Hey, what's going on?
[02:30:02.711 --> 02:30:04.412]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[02:30:04.412 --> 02:30:06.174]  What are you guys doing this Thursday?
[02:30:06.174 --> 02:30:07.495]  Probably nothing.
[02:30:07.495 --> 02:30:15.180]  You're going to get off work, sit down, go through your TV channels, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, definitely a no.
[02:30:15.180 --> 02:30:18.122]  Watching Dung Beetles on Discovery Channel, negative.
[02:30:18.362 --> 02:30:27.167]  Get your laptop, hook it up to your TV, and go to infowars.com forward slash show and watch this Thursday's live GOP debate coverage.
[02:30:27.167 --> 02:30:31.569]  Watch as we smash through the lies and disinformation in real time.
[02:30:31.569 --> 02:30:38.332]  You'll see people like Lee Ann McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, and David Knight break everything down for you.
[02:30:38.332 --> 02:30:40.794]  The GOP debate shouldn't be something that's boring.
[02:30:40.794 --> 02:30:43.135]  It should be fun for you and all your friends and family.
[02:30:43.135 --> 02:30:43.415]  Ha ha!
[02:30:43.635 --> 02:30:45.780]  So get some popcorn, sit down and enjoy.
[02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:54.939]  Make sure you join us this Thursday, February 25th, 2016 at 7pm Central Standard Time as we break down everything that's happening with the GOP debate.
[02:30:58.427 --> 02:30:59.027]  I love our candy!
[02:30:59.027 --> 02:31:00.168]  I will love it again!
[02:31:00.168 --> 02:31:01.749]  Mine, mine, mine!
[02:31:28.427 --> 02:31:29.207]  I think so.
[02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:02.802]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:32:02.802 --> 02:32:07.565]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:32:07.565 --> 02:32:08.905]  Talk about the effects.
[02:32:08.905 --> 02:32:10.406]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:32:10.406 --> 02:32:12.327]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:32:12.327 --> 02:32:13.448]  I feel like I look better.
[02:32:13.448 --> 02:32:14.168]  I feel better.
[02:32:14.168 --> 02:32:15.569]  I feel sexier.
[02:32:15.569 --> 02:32:15.929]  I love it.
[02:32:16.189 --> 02:32:19.150]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:32:19.150 --> 02:32:22.092]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[02:32:22.092 --> 02:32:23.172]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:32:23.172 --> 02:32:24.353]  Consult your physician.
[02:32:24.353 --> 02:32:26.734]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[02:32:26.734 --> 02:32:28.074]  This is life-changing.
[02:32:28.074 --> 02:32:28.995]  Shower filters.
[02:32:28.995 --> 02:32:30.595]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:32:30.595 --> 02:32:34.797]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[02:32:34.797 --> 02:32:39.599]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[02:32:39.599 --> 02:32:41.760]  This new four-stage filtration process
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:42.380]  I'm good to go.
[02:33:09.150 --> 02:33:13.754]  This is our land.
[02:33:13.754 --> 02:33:17.078]  These are our people.
[02:33:17.078 --> 02:33:17.798]  The workers.
[02:33:18.831 --> 02:33:24.013]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:48.865 --> 02:33:57.950]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:57.950 --> 02:34:03.753]  Our whole lives from the day we're conceived to the day we die is boot camp.
[02:34:03.753 --> 02:34:08.756]  I look back on my life and I think about all of it was training for what we now face.
[02:34:08.756 --> 02:34:10.636]  Same thing for you.
[02:34:10.636 --> 02:34:17.300]  Don't take the traumas of your life and fixate on them and use them to feel sorry for yourself and have this victim mentality.
[02:34:19.697 --> 02:34:21.318]  Use it to empower yourself.
[02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:27.259]  Use it and realize that maybe that happened to you so you can understand what's happened to other people so you can save them.
[02:34:27.259 --> 02:34:39.903]  The truth is we're on a planet in deep space, surrounded by dimensions we can't even see.
[02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:44.164]  Living in the most incredible, epic times our species has ever witnessed.
[02:34:46.491 --> 02:34:47.792]  It's like we're driving through the mountains.
[02:34:47.792 --> 02:34:50.934]  We see clouds above us, a veil.
[02:34:50.934 --> 02:34:55.657]  We're going to drive through that veil and above it will be the sun.
[02:34:55.657 --> 02:34:59.639]  And we'll be able to see for thousands of miles around us in all directions.
[02:34:59.639 --> 02:35:07.924]  Jakari Jackson shot an excellent in-depth report that will air in the next hour at the big Body Hack Conference, Body Modification Conference.
[02:35:07.924 --> 02:35:09.565]  They'll cover that when David Knight is hosting.
[02:35:09.565 --> 02:35:11.146]  It's excellent.
[02:35:11.146 --> 02:35:15.629]  I want to go to Eric and Rick and Jeremy and Frank and Daryl and others that are patiently holding.
[02:35:16.667 --> 02:35:24.574]  And then I'm going to get into the other news, military, political, you name it, there is a lot of it.
[02:35:24.574 --> 02:35:39.526]  I kind of went off on a rant about Kanye West, but that is true Satanism, in my view, is not some chick on an altar, you know, sex magic, all the rest of it, that's just the lure.
[02:35:39.526 --> 02:35:40.787]  Real Satanism
[02:35:42.171 --> 02:35:52.098]  Is about only caring about yourself and getting into your own personal power and becoming delusional about that power.
[02:35:52.098 --> 02:35:54.459]  And then hating everyone around you.
[02:35:54.459 --> 02:35:56.481]  And boy, there are reasons to dislike people.
[02:35:56.481 --> 02:36:00.864]  But instead of wanting to actually lift folks up, you revel in seeing them fall.
[02:36:03.581 --> 02:36:30.047]  And the devil, or the archetype, if you will, if you don't believe in these forces, those forces are real, but you don't believe it's spiritual in nature, because you can't see it, just like you can't see photons from deep space, is the devil convinces you that if you make a deal, if you just commit to that force, if you use that evil logic, that twisted math, that the devil will give you power.
[02:36:30.047 --> 02:36:32.708]  The truth is, you're a powerful being, you already have the power,
[02:36:34.093 --> 02:36:44.358]  The devil gives you the confidence to then use that power, but because you do it in service to the devil, you believe the power is coming from the devil.
[02:36:44.358 --> 02:36:50.001]  That's why the devil will try to get you to do bad things, or do extreme things, or do things that even make you stronger.
[02:36:50.001 --> 02:36:57.865]  Even though they're bad, that are stressful, because that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:36:57.865 --> 02:36:59.446]  Stronger for evil though, not for good.
[02:36:59.446 --> 02:37:03.368]  That's why Obi-Wan Kenobi, it's a great allegory, Darth Vader says,
[02:37:04.537 --> 02:37:06.378]  When I left you, I was but the learner.
[02:37:06.378 --> 02:37:07.739]  Now I am the master.
[02:37:07.739 --> 02:37:13.061]  And he says, only a master of evil, Darth.
[02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:15.623]  Only a master of evil!
[02:37:15.623 --> 02:37:17.364]  Not a master of good!
[02:37:17.364 --> 02:37:22.887]  You don't think masters of good don't know everything the evil people know and more?
[02:37:22.887 --> 02:37:25.448]  We know so much, we wouldn't dare be part of that!
[02:37:29.534 --> 02:37:39.818]  But the weak particularly are drawn to evil because of its worldly power.
[02:37:39.818 --> 02:37:41.738]  There's no spiritual world.
[02:37:41.738 --> 02:37:47.800]  That's why the Satanists did everything they could to recruit me and failed.
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:56.543]  When I was 14, 15, 16, so bad we had to move down here from Dallas to Austin, Texas.
[02:37:56.543 --> 02:37:58.284]  There isn't spiritual power in the world.
[02:37:59.497 --> 02:38:05.261]  But the devil could obviously foresee the potential of what I would end up doing.
[02:38:05.261 --> 02:38:07.643]  And the devil sees the potential of what you could do as well.
[02:38:07.643 --> 02:38:16.490]  Now I'm going to stop ranting and go to your phone calls, then to the news.
[02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:20.793]  I want to go to each person and move to the next, because if I start pontificating on what you say, I won't get to anybody.
[02:38:20.793 --> 02:38:23.755]  And then David Knight's coming up, he'll probably have open phones as well.
[02:38:23.755 --> 02:38:25.797]  I want to move to where we're trying to take more calls.
[02:38:25.797 --> 02:38:28.439]  Not because there's some program director in the sky, but because I need to.
[02:38:29.693 --> 02:38:30.976]  Rainforest is back in stock.
[02:38:30.976 --> 02:38:32.820]  It's the best NutraTropic we've come up with.
[02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:34.123]  It just gives me incredible energy.
[02:38:34.123 --> 02:38:37.410]  It's a lot better than drinking that afternoon coffee, though the afternoon coffee is more enjoyable.
[02:38:37.410 --> 02:38:38.733]  It just doesn't have an effect on me anymore.
[02:38:39.778 --> 02:38:40.419]  Never really did.
[02:38:40.419 --> 02:38:41.960]  I can make coffee and go to bed.
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.181]  You don't take this and go to bed.
[02:38:43.181 --> 02:38:46.243]  And it's not because it has stimulants in it.
[02:38:46.243 --> 02:38:51.167]  It's because it's got neutrotropics that are building blocks for normal metabolic behavior in the brain.
[02:38:51.167 --> 02:38:52.608]  It'll blow you away.
[02:38:52.608 --> 02:38:55.470]  We believe it's the ultimate brain pill, especially for the price.
[02:38:55.470 --> 02:38:56.531]  Can you buy some stuff?
[02:38:56.531 --> 02:38:58.232]  A lot of it's prescription is $300.
[02:38:58.232 --> 02:38:58.612]  That's better?
[02:38:58.612 --> 02:38:59.673]  Yeah.
[02:38:59.673 --> 02:39:02.215]  But you're not going to find anything for $29.95 or even $50 or $60 that's close to BrainForce.
[02:39:06.917 --> 02:39:14.061]  I know leading competitors that sell their stuff for $40 and they admit to us, yeah, your formula's a lot better.
[02:39:14.061 --> 02:39:15.242]  And that's leading competitors.
[02:39:15.242 --> 02:39:16.483]  And I don't really see it as competitors.
[02:39:16.483 --> 02:39:17.583]  They do.
[02:39:17.583 --> 02:39:20.165]  Infowarslife.com, it's back in stock.
[02:39:20.165 --> 02:39:22.486]  The liver cleanse is back in with a gallbladder cleanse.
[02:39:22.486 --> 02:39:23.367]  Take it with the Oxy-Powder.
[02:39:23.367 --> 02:39:23.787]  Incredible.
[02:39:23.787 --> 02:39:25.168]  See the informational videos.
[02:39:25.168 --> 02:39:26.749]  Very easy six-day cleanse.
[02:39:26.749 --> 02:39:29.070]  You owe it to yourself to try this and to support the transmission.
[02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:30.051]  It's a win-win.

[02:39:31.732 --> 02:39:33.573]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:39:33.573 --> 02:39:33.713]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:39:38.146 --> 02:39:41.067]  And we have an all-new product, the InfoWars Life Joint Formula.
[02:39:41.067 --> 02:39:45.909]  It's just nine known organic ingredients that boost joint health and so much more.
[02:39:45.909 --> 02:39:52.512]  And, again, if you tried to buy all these together, it'd be at least twice this to have all these formulas together in one, all these compounds.
[02:39:52.512 --> 02:39:55.553]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:40:21.376 --> 02:40:22.756]  A few items aren't.
[02:40:22.756 --> 02:40:27.458]  It's obvious we can't say it's auto-ship and immediate if we don't have control of the supply chain.
[02:40:27.458 --> 02:40:31.140]  We don't sell stuff when it's back-ordered unless we say back-ordered is my point.
[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:36.763]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:40:36.763 --> 02:40:39.344]  Now, let's go ahead and go to the phones.
[02:40:39.344 --> 02:40:42.225]  Let's talk to Eric in Colorado.
[02:40:42.225 --> 02:40:43.105]  You're on the air.
[02:40:43.105 --> 02:40:44.086]  Thanks for calling today, Eric.
[02:40:45.529 --> 02:40:47.310]  Hi sir, thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:40:47.310 --> 02:40:47.971]  Thank you for calling.
[02:40:47.971 --> 02:40:58.717]  I want to say thank you to you and the InfoWarrior crew for opening my eyes and giving me the answers of why to all of my questions.
[02:40:58.717 --> 02:41:03.880]  The first thing that I wanted to bring to your attention is kind of predictive programming, if you will.
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:07.502]  Season 5 episode of Family Guy.
[02:41:07.502 --> 02:41:12.265]  Death is talking to Peter and he says, oh man, it's been a crazy day today.
[02:41:14.669 --> 02:41:23.113]  Supreme Justice Scalia was killed by Dick Cheney in a hunting accident.
[02:41:23.113 --> 02:41:30.237]  So I'm not sure you know if that's something worthy of merit being looked into, but it caught my attention.
[02:41:31.178 --> 02:41:39.581]  That you could say, because Cheney's friends with him famously, and Cheney shot one of his other friends in South Texas, pretty close to that area, about 100 miles away.
[02:41:39.581 --> 02:41:43.102]  And then the man famously apologized for Dick Cheney shooting him.
[02:41:43.102 --> 02:41:44.963]  True bizarre behavior.
[02:41:44.963 --> 02:41:45.143]  But...
[02:41:47.719 --> 02:41:50.521]  I think all of us should pay attention to programming and TV.
[02:41:50.521 --> 02:41:59.007]  Everyone ought to have a hobby of taking clips out of TV, analyzing them, and putting them on the web, because that's where most of the propaganda is, is entertainment.
[02:41:59.007 --> 02:42:14.918]  But real predictive programming, where it's bonafide, is where the CIA approaches the X-Files and says, have an episode where a jet flies in the World Trade Center to blame the Pentagon, or to run by the... See, I try to speed up when I'm taking calls, and then I mess up.
[02:42:16.081 --> 02:42:29.589]  The CIA approaches and they say, we want an episode where a jet is flown into the World Trade Center by a secret group in the Pentagon, a rogue group, to blame it on Afghanistan and have martial law on America, but really the plane is remote control, there aren't hijackers.
[02:42:29.589 --> 02:42:35.693]  And that was an actual episode a year or less than a year, about nine months before 9-11.
[02:42:35.693 --> 02:42:40.476]  And I was told by one of the stars of the show that the CIA had approached them on that plot and others.
[02:42:41.536 --> 02:42:43.438]  Now, I'm finally going to get to talk to Chris Carter soon.
[02:42:43.438 --> 02:42:45.000]  I can't wait to ask him about that.
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.483]  That's one of the few things I actually get excited about that'll actually get me to go to L.A.
[02:42:48.483 --> 02:42:54.569]  and enter Mordor, where I think Satan must sit or something, because I don't get sick going anywhere but there.
[02:42:54.569 --> 02:42:56.471]  And every time I'm there, I just can't wait to get out.
[02:42:56.471 --> 02:42:57.452]  But I am going into Mordor.
[02:42:58.433 --> 02:42:59.834]  for a couple days.
[02:42:59.834 --> 02:43:01.354]  I love Santa Cruz.
[02:43:01.354 --> 02:43:03.715]  San Francisco's even nice, even though it's a corrupt city.
[02:43:03.715 --> 02:43:04.776]  San Diego's okay.
[02:43:04.776 --> 02:43:06.156]  It's L.A., folks.
[02:43:06.156 --> 02:43:07.397]  So I will be looking into that.
[02:43:07.397 --> 02:43:08.457]  God bless you, Eric.
[02:43:08.457 --> 02:43:10.038]  I appreciate the call.
[02:43:10.038 --> 02:43:12.559]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric.
[02:43:12.559 --> 02:43:13.459]  Rick in Minnesota.
[02:43:13.459 --> 02:43:16.200]  You're on the air.
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:17.101]  Hello?
[02:43:17.101 --> 02:43:17.601]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:17.601 --> 02:43:19.261]  Welcome, Rick.
[02:43:19.261 --> 02:43:19.542]  All right.
[02:43:19.542 --> 02:43:21.242]  Hey, thank you very much, sir.
[02:43:21.242 --> 02:43:22.143]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:43:23.359 --> 02:43:31.166]  The reason I called today was really I wanted to give a testimonial, and not to your product, but more to just the message that InfoWars stands for.
[02:43:31.166 --> 02:43:34.669]  I'm just going to a real short story, and I'm not going to take up any more time than necessary.
[02:43:34.669 --> 02:43:38.473]  Hopefully I can help kind of answer one of the questions you had a little bit ago.
[02:43:38.473 --> 02:43:39.674]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[02:43:39.674 --> 02:43:40.915]  I'm not screening your call.
[02:43:40.915 --> 02:43:42.176]  There's this syndrome, though.
[02:43:42.176 --> 02:43:43.878]  Everybody screens calls.
[02:43:43.878 --> 02:43:47.101]  So once I get a caller on air, people ask, hey, can I talk about this, can I talk about that?
[02:43:47.101 --> 02:43:48.262]  Just go ahead and get your point out, brother.
[02:43:49.082 --> 02:43:49.883]  Okay, alright.
[02:43:49.883 --> 02:44:03.834]  So, the other day I got in kind of a Facebook little fight with a buddy of mine, or a guy I know, and I had posted about Obama making a joke about Scalia's death, and he said it was a bunch of clickbait.
[02:44:03.834 --> 02:44:07.297]  And so I like to make sure I'm putting out good information and everything.
[02:44:08.101 --> 02:44:16.346]  And I went and I looked up for myself on YouTube to find the video, and it showed multiple days of that entire Governor's event, and I found him.
[02:44:16.346 --> 02:44:19.388]  I thought, in fact, that I had posted something that wasn't true or whatever.
[02:44:19.388 --> 02:44:23.150]  I had apologized to him, and he made me go and check again.
[02:44:23.150 --> 02:44:27.793]  So I double-checked, and sure enough, I pulled up the exact clip from the WhiteHouse.gov site.
[02:44:27.793 --> 02:44:30.234]  My message is this.
[02:44:30.234 --> 02:44:31.875]  I want to, first of all, apologize for doubting.
[02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:47.962]  But I'm skeptical by nature, and secondly, I wanted to thank you for putting out good information, and if anybody's on their journey of becoming a believer in what's said here and compassionate about this movement and going for it, don't doubt
[02:44:49.392 --> 02:44:56.339]  If someone can't watch a clip of Obama and see him making a joke about Scalia and then figures out some way to say that's fake, that's their issue.
[02:45:09.369 --> 02:45:15.854]  I mean, I have people saying there's no world government, or TPP doesn't exist, or the Pope didn't call for world government.
[02:45:15.854 --> 02:45:20.617]  And we make mistakes sometimes in things, but overall, we're very accurate.
[02:45:20.617 --> 02:45:26.882]  And so, people that aren't awake by now are going to have to wake up on their own.
[02:45:26.882 --> 02:45:28.503]  And I let the dead bury the dead.
[02:45:28.503 --> 02:45:30.564]  I knocked the dust off my feet.
[02:45:30.564 --> 02:45:33.807]  I appreciate your call, Rick.
[02:45:33.807 --> 02:45:35.528]  I don't think you should ever trust Infowars.
[02:45:37.904 --> 02:45:49.649]  You should trust your own research and your own facts, but you shouldn't just also trust people that go, I hear Alex Jones, CIA, address these claims.
[02:45:49.649 --> 02:45:50.749]  Let's just say I am.
[02:45:50.749 --> 02:45:51.169]  I'm not.
[02:45:51.169 --> 02:45:53.970]  But let's just say for the sake of argument, I am.
[02:45:53.970 --> 02:45:55.851]  Now, you're better than me.
[02:45:55.851 --> 02:45:57.772]  I wasn't successful on my own.
[02:45:57.772 --> 02:45:59.973]  You need to be successful and go out and fight tyranny.
[02:45:59.973 --> 02:46:00.833]  Let's just move along.
[02:46:00.833 --> 02:46:01.413]  I'm the bad man.
[02:46:03.646 --> 02:46:05.987]  The government, you know, makes all the decisions for the show.
[02:46:05.987 --> 02:46:07.288]  I don't do anything myself.
[02:46:07.288 --> 02:46:08.589]  I don't put my shoes on in the morning.
[02:46:08.589 --> 02:46:09.810]  In fact, I'm a robot.
[02:46:09.810 --> 02:46:11.431]  No, I mean, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:46:11.431 --> 02:46:14.232]  I don't want to make it about Alex Jones.
[02:46:14.232 --> 02:46:14.893]  Okay?
[02:46:14.893 --> 02:46:17.154]  I know the media does that.
[02:46:17.154 --> 02:46:23.037]  But, Scalia died, and I said, watch, I bet they don't have an autopsy, and of course they didn't.
[02:46:23.037 --> 02:46:24.458]  The next day.
[02:46:24.458 --> 02:46:25.599]  And then the whole story fell apart.
[02:46:26.894 --> 02:46:31.897]  And they say we're crazy to ask that question of known killers and known liars that run this government.
[02:46:31.897 --> 02:46:38.120]  They're bringing in record numbers of radical Muslims and lying about how many they're bringing in.
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:41.202]  So there's so much coming at us.
[02:46:41.202 --> 02:46:44.464]  It's not like it's my job to even tell everybody what's going on.
[02:46:44.464 --> 02:46:47.365]  It's your job to know what's going on.
[02:46:47.365 --> 02:46:50.587]  But of course people want to change the subject on to Alex Jones.
[02:46:52.096 --> 02:46:56.879]  Because then they don't have to go read the article at Infowars.com by Kit Daniels.
[02:46:56.879 --> 02:46:57.480]  Dominant.
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:04.265]  Trump wins 1% of... Trump within 1% of Cruz's home state of Texas.
[02:47:04.265 --> 02:47:07.167]  That is a big deal.
[02:47:07.167 --> 02:47:07.727]  Dominant.
[02:47:07.727 --> 02:47:10.369]  Trump within 1 point of Cruz's home state of Texas.
[02:47:10.369 --> 02:47:14.191]  He was 10 points behind a week ago.
[02:47:14.191 --> 02:47:18.995]  In comparison, in 2008, Iowa winner won his home state by 40%.
[02:47:21.701 --> 02:47:29.003]  So the fact that Trump is leading and gaining in Texas and is close to edging him out shows how strong he is.
[02:47:29.003 --> 02:47:30.343]  He needs to win Texas.
[02:47:30.343 --> 02:47:31.944]  He needs to win Florida.
[02:47:31.944 --> 02:47:36.665]  He needs to win these key battleground states or they're going to try to steal the nomination.
[02:47:36.665 --> 02:47:38.305]  We've seen so much fraud.
[02:47:38.305 --> 02:47:41.086]  He's in this electoral process.
[02:47:41.086 --> 02:47:47.488]  He's the winner so far and the whole system's against him and they're so arrogant they think they can continue to push this direction.
[02:47:50.848 --> 02:47:52.349]  But it's a big deal.
[02:47:52.349 --> 02:47:54.510]  It is a big, big, big deal.
[02:47:54.510 --> 02:48:09.018]  Coming up in the fourth hour before I go back to your calls, host David Knight is going to look at what's happening over in Moscow with the anti-smoking campaign using Obama's image.
[02:48:09.018 --> 02:48:12.760]  We'll also look at Bernie Sanders, a bum who didn't earn his first steady paycheck until 40.
[02:48:13.854 --> 02:48:17.738]  We'll look at Marine Assaulted, what we were already talking about earlier.
[02:48:17.738 --> 02:48:23.303]  Trump's supporting Eagles of Death metal singer says guns could have stopped attacks.
[02:48:23.303 --> 02:48:31.330]  In Paris, Syrian refugees admitted US-Paris attack.
[02:48:31.330 --> 02:48:35.554]  George, how do you say his name from Star Trek?
[02:48:35.554 --> 02:48:39.418]  Takai falls for Zika virus conspiracy theory.
[02:48:40.595 --> 02:48:43.836]  Brazil state bans pesticide after Zika claim.
[02:48:43.836 --> 02:48:49.218]  Justice Kalia died of a heart attack according to officials now.
[02:48:49.218 --> 02:48:50.738]  We'll also look at John Rutherford's report.
[02:48:50.738 --> 02:48:51.939]  Was Kalia murdered?
[02:48:51.939 --> 02:48:56.680]  Former intel officer suspects foul play.
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:58.020]  I figured this was a typo.
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:02.642]  You guys brought me the show rundown that he writes right before he does the fourth hour.
[02:49:02.642 --> 02:49:03.242]  I don't care.
[02:49:03.242 --> 02:49:07.743]  It's teleprompter free and then things kind of disintegrate here in the third hour because I disintegrate.
[02:49:07.743 --> 02:49:08.824]  This is from the 17th.
[02:49:10.399 --> 02:49:10.699]  I knew.
[02:49:10.699 --> 02:49:15.023]  I said, boy, David Knight's covering a lot of old news.
[02:49:15.023 --> 02:49:15.924]  Oh, it's an old template.
[02:49:15.924 --> 02:49:16.645]  It's current.
[02:49:16.645 --> 02:49:17.065]  Okay.
[02:49:17.065 --> 02:49:18.467]  Well, whatever.
[02:49:18.467 --> 02:49:19.748]  Interesting.
[02:49:19.748 --> 02:49:23.632]  Now, continuing here, folks, I will go back to your phone calls.
[02:49:23.632 --> 02:49:25.914]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in California.
[02:49:25.914 --> 02:49:26.294]  Go ahead.
[02:49:26.294 --> 02:49:28.837]  Hey, man.
[02:49:28.837 --> 02:49:32.340]  This is Jeremy from soul-sucking Los Angeles.
[02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:33.241]  You just brought up.
[02:49:33.241 --> 02:49:34.342]  I feel sorry for you, brother.
[02:49:35.718 --> 02:49:37.439]  Yeah, I've been here my whole life.
[02:49:37.439 --> 02:49:45.141]  There's times that it's good, there's times that it's bad, but unfortunately, you know, it hasn't necessarily gotten any better.
[02:49:45.141 --> 02:50:01.547]  But what I called about was that I wanted to tell you what I really love this show and the way that it has this wide swath of aggregation and really just is, you're definitely walking point for independent media.
[02:50:01.547 --> 02:50:02.988]  You have been for a while.
[02:50:03.832 --> 02:50:15.041]  What I am wondering though, is that like with Amy Goodman and people like that that covered Occupy Wall Street, you have independent media journalist Pete Santilli in jail.
[02:50:15.041 --> 02:50:23.868]  And whether or not you agree with his content, agree with the spirit of his reporting and everything else like that, I know that there's been times there's been back and forth.
[02:50:23.868 --> 02:50:25.429]  But Alex, I want to ask you right now.
[02:50:26.394 --> 02:50:35.419]  Where are you at in supporting an independent media journalist that is in jail for being an independent media journalist?
[02:50:35.419 --> 02:50:41.503]  There's all sorts of media people in jail, so I don't know specifically what you're talking about.
[02:50:41.503 --> 02:50:43.344]  Well, you know what David Knight does.
[02:50:44.631 --> 02:50:48.036]  And I think that you need to get with him because this is all about Oregon.
[02:50:48.036 --> 02:50:49.378]  It's tying in with the Bundys.
[02:50:49.378 --> 02:50:50.600]  It's tying in with the BLM.
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:51.161]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:50:51.161 --> 02:50:52.563]  You don't have to all be cryptic.
[02:50:52.563 --> 02:50:55.667]  Everybody, I guess there's like a flotilla of callers today to make it about me.
[02:50:57.330 --> 02:50:58.111]  Want me to go away?
[02:50:58.111 --> 02:50:59.071]  Would you be better off then?
[02:50:59.071 --> 02:51:09.938]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:09.938 --> 02:51:14.121]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:14.121 --> 02:51:16.282]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:16.282 --> 02:51:21.726]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:21.906 --> 02:51:31.930]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:31.930 --> 02:51:38.413]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:38.413 --> 02:51:41.755]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[02:51:41.755 --> 02:51:43.816]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:43.816 --> 02:51:46.937]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:46.937 --> 02:51:49.418]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[02:51:58.364 --> 02:52:01.786]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:02.586 --> 02:52:03.207]  It's true.
[02:52:03.207 --> 02:52:07.369]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:07.369 --> 02:52:09.751]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:09.751 --> 02:52:14.534]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:14.534 --> 02:52:23.040]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides,
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:27.402]  Bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[02:52:27.402 --> 02:52:31.203]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:52:31.203 --> 02:52:33.864]  The gold standard in water purification.
[02:52:33.864 --> 02:52:38.166]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[02:52:38.166 --> 02:52:38.987]  Big Berkey.
[02:52:38.987 --> 02:52:42.448]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:52:42.688 --> 02:52:44.449]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[02:52:46.831 --> 02:52:47.571]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:52:47.571 --> 02:52:48.972]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[02:52:48.972 --> 02:52:49.992]  For the love of clean water.
[02:52:59.227 --> 02:53:02.948]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[02:53:02.948 --> 02:53:08.389]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:15.091]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[02:53:15.091 --> 02:53:19.352]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[02:53:19.352 --> 02:53:22.092]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[02:53:22.092 --> 02:53:23.513]  Well now, so do I!
[02:53:24.993 --> 02:53:29.856]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.
[02:53:29.856 --> 02:53:35.680]  ID Stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago to prevent electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:38.542]  Even when your wallet is open, imitators don't do that.
[02:53:38.542 --> 02:53:43.425]  ID Stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[02:53:43.425 --> 02:53:47.788]  Visit IDStronghold.com and get the original RFID blocking wallet.
[02:53:47.788 --> 02:53:50.049]  I'm Walt Augustinowicz, founder and CEO.
[02:53:50.049 --> 02:53:52.891]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold.
[02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:56.571]  IDStronghold.com
[02:54:14.955 --> 02:54:20.380]  I'm going five minutes to the next hour to hit a few more of these news stories I haven't gotten, but in the day the night takes over.
[02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:23.042]  And the computer did print off an old show, I was right.
[02:54:23.042 --> 02:54:33.110]  On the 24th day, David Night, that's this Wednesday, we'll be covering just a bunch of incredible information.
[02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:39.195]  What shipping containers, Smoot, Hawley, and Ferris Bueller, tell us about trade policy?
[02:54:39.195 --> 02:54:43.018]  Largest container ship in history docks on the Pacific, another example of
[02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:46.732]  One-sided trade law would shine him.
[02:54:46.732 --> 02:54:47.894]  We're going to break that down.
[02:54:47.894 --> 02:54:50.197]  He's going to get into the Supreme Court Justice.
[02:54:50.197 --> 02:54:55.884]  Talks favorably about jury nullification as lower court strikes down Nevada fallout.
[02:54:55.884 --> 02:55:00.389]  We're going to have Jakari Jackson in the studio with a body hack report from the Body Hack Conference.
[02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:02.612]  Really amazing stuff that he covered there.
[02:55:03.453 --> 02:55:07.914]  We'll also go through the conspiracy theory about the Internet of Things.
[02:55:07.914 --> 02:55:17.636]  They admit that the light bulbs, through data over power line, will be like smart meters in your house, spying on everything you do, including watching you.
[02:55:17.636 --> 02:55:22.417]  Because the new light bulbs actually have little transmitters that send out light that bounces back.
[02:55:22.417 --> 02:55:24.318]  They can use it like sonar.
[02:55:24.318 --> 02:55:26.038]  And it controls your computers.
[02:55:26.038 --> 02:55:27.838]  That's even in the Associated Press.
[02:55:27.838 --> 02:55:30.399]  But other media is saying it's a conspiracy theory if you don't like it.
[02:55:31.803 --> 02:55:34.524]  This and so much more with David Knight in the fourth hour.
[02:55:34.524 --> 02:55:43.309]  I want to again go to some more of your phone calls right now.
[02:55:43.309 --> 02:55:49.392]  There's another story out of the Daily Beast saying Trump's remorseless delegate math means Rubio and Cruz are screwed.
[02:55:49.392 --> 02:55:57.817]  And that's why Drudge is right with the headline, the nominee today with an image of Donald Trump, because he's already got it won with the current numbers.
[02:56:00.236 --> 02:56:04.919]  The only reason they're keeping the other candidates in is to try to have the Republican establishment bring Trump down.
[02:56:04.919 --> 02:56:12.583]  Trump needs to win Texas and Florida so the Democrats are facing a major competitor when he wins the nomination.
[02:56:12.583 --> 02:56:16.945]  And so they can't steal the nomination with a broker convention coming up at the RNC.
[02:56:16.945 --> 02:56:22.988]  And believe me, I'm going to be there for the RNC and other crew members are going to be there, not just Richard Reeves.
[02:56:22.988 --> 02:56:27.391]  We're going to have a big presence there from the entire four days of the RNC.
[02:56:28.766 --> 02:56:32.169]  The Nightly News is coming up tonight, by the way, at 7 o'clock Central, Infowarsnews.com.
[02:56:32.169 --> 02:56:33.590]  Right now, let's go to Frank.
[02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:35.452]  Let's go to Frank in Maryland.
[02:56:35.452 --> 02:56:36.233]  Frank, you're on the air.
[02:56:36.233 --> 02:56:38.775]  Go ahead.
[02:56:38.775 --> 02:56:39.175]  Hello.
[02:56:39.175 --> 02:56:42.998]  I'd like to say first thanks to your supporters.
[02:56:42.998 --> 02:56:44.180]  They are the greatest.
[02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:44.620]  Thank you, sir.
[02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:46.582]  Most informed.
[02:56:46.582 --> 02:56:50.285]  They've helped me, compassion-wise and warmth-wise.
[02:56:50.285 --> 02:56:52.767]  They've taught me in many ways.
[02:56:52.767 --> 02:56:53.508]  Now, with you,
[02:56:54.605 --> 02:56:56.807]  You are the greatest speaker of this time right now.
[02:56:56.807 --> 02:56:57.347]  I am not.
[02:56:57.347 --> 02:56:59.369]  I'm babbling half the time, especially by the third hour.
[02:56:59.369 --> 02:57:00.469]  But go ahead, sir.
[02:57:00.469 --> 02:57:01.951]  Anyway, keep doing it.
[02:57:01.951 --> 02:57:03.252]  You're not going away anywhere.
[02:57:03.252 --> 02:57:05.293]  Your words live on.
[02:57:05.293 --> 02:57:06.154]  Your spiel live on.
[02:57:07.196 --> 02:57:08.416]  He'll keep going on, doesn't matter.
[02:57:29.332 --> 02:57:30.633]  That's a lie.
[02:57:30.633 --> 02:57:32.534]  I wouldn't say your supporters were the greatest anyway.
[02:57:32.534 --> 02:57:34.035]  They've helped me out.
[02:57:34.035 --> 02:57:34.996]  Well, they're awesome folks.
[02:57:34.996 --> 02:57:36.357]  There are a lot of patriots out there.
[02:57:36.357 --> 02:57:38.919]  Frank, what do you think about Trump?
[02:57:38.919 --> 02:57:40.240]  I'm talking about Trump right now.
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:43.802]  In regard to Jeb Bush people coming over, those are voters.
[02:57:43.802 --> 02:57:50.767]  You're going to have delegates who come over trying to influence the other delegates who have been supporting Donald Trump and other people.
[02:57:50.767 --> 02:57:58.273]  You've got to be aware of that, investigate that, because they were putting them into delegate positions through a process.
[02:57:59.315 --> 02:58:00.035]  I agree.
[02:58:00.035 --> 02:58:10.077]  Will Bush try to throw his votes, his delegates he put in, superdelegates basically, it's the same thing, to somebody like Marco Rubio?
[02:58:10.077 --> 02:58:11.658]  That's a great point.
[02:58:11.658 --> 02:58:12.418]  No, no, no.
[02:58:12.418 --> 02:58:13.298]  No, that's what I'm saying.
[02:58:13.298 --> 02:58:16.239]  They're going to put it towards Donald Trump.
[02:58:16.239 --> 02:58:23.821]  They'll try to influence him to take a vice president or whoever they want to put in or whatever they want to do.
[02:58:23.821 --> 02:58:25.061]  It's not just that, vice president.
[02:58:25.615 --> 02:58:26.096]  Great point.
[02:58:26.096 --> 02:58:27.778]  And that's why I didn't want you to thank me, Frank.
[02:58:27.778 --> 02:58:29.079]  I love you to death.
[02:58:29.079 --> 02:58:31.322]  You spent like a minute on that and 30 seconds on a key point.
[02:58:31.322 --> 02:58:32.623]  That's another great thought.
[02:58:32.623 --> 02:58:35.567]  Like you did with Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush in 1980.
[02:58:35.567 --> 02:58:36.868]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:36.868 --> 02:58:41.293]  Stay with us.
[02:58:41.293 --> 02:58:45.258]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.444 --> 02:58:49.405]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:58:49.405 --> 02:58:49.965]  Good, brother.
[02:58:49.965 --> 02:58:51.907]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:58:51.907 --> 02:58:53.628]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:58:53.628 --> 02:58:57.671]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:58:57.671 --> 02:59:00.273]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:59:00.273 --> 02:59:02.714]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:59:02.714 --> 02:59:10.560]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:59:10.760 --> 02:59:14.125]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[02:59:14.125 --> 02:59:15.647]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:59:15.647 --> 02:59:18.691]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:59:18.691 --> 02:59:20.353]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:59:20.353 --> 02:59:27.983]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:59:28.063 --> 02:59:30.144]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.205 --> 03:00:02.366]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:00:02.366 --> 03:00:03.106]  Yes, I am.
[03:00:03.106 --> 03:00:05.447]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:05.447 --> 03:00:07.748]  Okay, I'm going to William in Washington.
[03:00:07.748 --> 03:00:08.809]  William in Washington.
[03:00:08.809 --> 03:00:09.849]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:09.849 --> 03:00:11.550]  Go ahead.
[03:00:11.550 --> 03:00:12.150]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:13.011]  Good to hear your voice.
[03:00:13.011 --> 03:00:13.451]  Thank you, sir.
[03:00:13.451 --> 03:00:14.111]  How are you doing?
[03:00:14.111 --> 03:00:16.372]  Good, thank you.
[03:00:16.372 --> 03:00:21.014]  Yeah, I just, you know, I was shooting for Rand Paul in the beginning.
[03:00:21.014 --> 03:00:24.916]  You know, slowly, I've always liked what Trump has said in the beginning.
[03:00:25.976 --> 03:00:28.117]  Slowly, my support's moved over to him.
[03:00:28.117 --> 03:00:37.879]  A few weeks ago, uh, this is kind of an eyebrow raiser, so I apologize for the, uh, uh... No, we want to hear you criticize Trump, if that's what you think, brother.
[03:00:37.879 --> 03:00:38.299]  Go ahead.
[03:00:38.299 --> 03:00:40.780]  Well, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not criticizing Trump.
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:42.861]  I just, I'm... You don't have to qualify him.
[03:00:42.861 --> 03:00:44.801]  Just, just get into it.
[03:00:44.801 --> 03:00:51.083]  I'm a homosexual male, so it's kind of an eyebrow raiser to support Trump, or a Republican in general.
[03:00:52.347 --> 03:01:00.930]  In that sense, but a couple weeks ago when he was speaking to that evangelical crowd, he said he wanted to go after gay marriage, and despite that I...
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:06.322]  You know, I still would vote for him over, you know, Sanders or Clinton.
[03:01:06.322 --> 03:01:08.802]  Sure, well I appreciate your courage to call in and talk about this, William.
[03:01:08.802 --> 03:01:10.543]  Let me just get this clear here.
[03:01:10.543 --> 03:01:15.625]  I don't dislike anybody, as long as it's consensuing adults, and so let's get that clear.
[03:01:15.625 --> 03:01:21.427]  I don't like some of the liberal gay lobby going after people's kids, or them trying to teach heterosexual stuff and sexualizing kids.
[03:01:21.427 --> 03:01:28.369]  Let's be clear, I'm not a hypocrite that just sits up here and hates on people for who they are, or who they love, or whatever.
[03:01:28.369 --> 03:01:31.050]  But there's an attack on marriage, and that
[03:01:31.690 --> 03:01:35.811]  Is a very, you know, key to humanity that then juxtaposes.
[03:01:35.811 --> 03:01:37.351]  I'm not against civil unions.
[03:01:37.351 --> 03:01:39.091]  I'm not against contracts.
[03:01:39.091 --> 03:01:44.492]  And so I'm just saying that whole thing to me is a football issue that is used to divert everybody.
[03:01:44.492 --> 03:01:45.833]  But you stack it all up.
[03:01:45.833 --> 03:01:47.813]  Let's just take over the Republican Party.
[03:01:47.813 --> 03:01:50.373]  We know the Democrats are a bunch of cult leaders.
[03:01:50.373 --> 03:01:51.894]  And, you know, here's the deal.
[03:01:51.894 --> 03:01:58.055]  If people, you know, that are that are gay don't like what's happened in the Republican Party, but you agree with so much more, go take the thing over.
[03:01:58.635 --> 03:01:59.655]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:01:59.655 --> 03:02:03.036]  Let's kick the foreign bankers out of the Republican Party and the Democrats.
[03:02:03.036 --> 03:02:07.777]  Let's take the country back with a populist, and then we can fight over the little stuff.
[03:02:07.777 --> 03:02:16.380]  And maybe that's not little to you, but quite frankly, a bunch of divorce lawyers just wanted to get people married under the same sex so they can get all your money.
[03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:17.020]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:18.639 --> 03:02:22.907]  I agree with the sentiment you said before.
[03:02:22.907 --> 03:02:28.276]  As long as they're not teaching it to kids, it doesn't really bother you too much.
[03:02:28.276 --> 03:02:30.720]  It's not even bothering me too much!
[03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:32.083]  It's not even on my radar, brother!
[03:02:33.237 --> 03:02:33.837]  I don't know.
[03:02:51.681 --> 03:02:52.662]  Look, here's the deal.
[03:02:52.662 --> 03:02:53.842]  I'm not somebody that plays games.
[03:02:53.842 --> 03:02:55.724]  I'm very fiscally conservative.
[03:02:55.724 --> 03:02:56.384]  I'm a Christian.
[03:02:56.384 --> 03:02:58.345]  I have a relationship with Christ.
[03:02:58.345 --> 03:03:01.768]  But it's not the relationship the preachers sell, okay?
[03:03:01.768 --> 03:03:09.993]  And then I don't... Christ hung around with, you know, debt collectors and tax collectors and prostitutes, and not because that's what he liked.
[03:03:09.993 --> 03:03:14.176]  They were better than the Pharisees, who were a bunch of fakes and a bunch of oppressors.
[03:03:14.176 --> 03:03:20.620]  He wanted to be around real people, and actually wanted to try to be around folks that were real humans that he could lead to lead others.
[03:03:23.282 --> 03:03:28.744]  Absolutely, I think that shows courage on your part to support Trump even though you disagree with some of his policies.
[03:03:28.744 --> 03:03:29.645]  God bless you, you gotta jump.
[03:03:29.645 --> 03:03:31.286]  I want to get to all these calls.
[03:03:31.286 --> 03:03:33.247]  I want to talk to John, let's talk about the movie Hail Caesar.
[03:03:33.247 --> 03:03:36.208]  And we got Tucker in Nebraska.
[03:03:36.208 --> 03:03:38.649]  Tucker, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:03:38.649 --> 03:03:40.050]  Yeah, how's it going, Alex?
[03:03:40.050 --> 03:03:41.751]  It's a real privilege.
[03:03:41.751 --> 03:03:50.235]  Hey, you know, it's just really, really nice to hear and see that people are finally pulling their heads out of the proverbial wazoo.
[03:03:51.468 --> 03:04:05.262]  And starting to speak up and stand up to the establishment which has stolen so gracefully the opportunity to be American.
[03:04:05.262 --> 03:04:15.772]  They have twisted everything to their favor to where, you know, like Hillary Clinton, God get me started,
[03:04:16.557 --> 03:04:28.153]  Um, how can people stand up, show their faces, and vote for another human being that is probably in all time recorded?
[03:04:28.775 --> 03:04:31.577]  The greatest liar that has ever been in public life.
[03:04:31.577 --> 03:04:32.477]  Hold on, stay there.
[03:04:32.477 --> 03:04:36.919]  I'm going to come back and finish up with John, Tucker, John, and Hall.
[03:04:36.919 --> 03:04:39.061]  I'm going to take calls with David Knight for one segment.
[03:04:39.061 --> 03:04:41.062]  I'm going to be out of here because David's got a lot to cover.
[03:04:41.062 --> 03:04:44.984]  That's why I did the fourth hour so that I could cross over with these great reporters and anchors.
[03:04:44.984 --> 03:04:46.525]  He's got a big show lined up, but stay there.
[03:04:46.525 --> 03:04:49.066]  I want you to be able to finish up, Tucker, because now we're getting to some callers.
[03:04:49.066 --> 03:04:50.027]  The other callers weren't bad.
[03:04:50.027 --> 03:04:52.508]  They were just telling me how great I was, and I love you.
[03:04:52.508 --> 03:04:53.228]  You're great.
[03:04:53.228 --> 03:04:54.329]  Let's talk about you.
[03:04:54.329 --> 03:04:55.089]  You have the power.
[03:04:55.089 --> 03:04:56.150]  You're the listeners.
[03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:57.851]  You are the body politic.
[03:05:00.177 --> 03:05:05.921]  On this Wednesday, February 24th, 2016, here are some of the top stories on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:05.921 --> 03:05:14.267]  More signs of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is in danger, as Russia and India reach an agreement to trade in their own currencies.
[03:05:14.267 --> 03:05:21.752]  And after failing to cover up the New Year's assaults in Cologne, German police began a witch hunt for whistleblowers who leaked what really happened.
[03:05:22.447 --> 03:05:33.060]  And as Donald Trump joins the calls to audit the Fed, we offer 100 reasons why we need to know what this powerful and private institution is doing to manipulate the economy.
[03:05:33.726 --> 03:05:41.072]  For laughs, watch video of Donald Trump shutting down and burying Glenn Beck at the Nevada caucuses last night.
[03:05:41.072 --> 03:05:50.139]  As Glenn Beck was speaking, endorsing Cruz at the caucus, Trump walks in and the crowd and media flock to Trump, leaving Beck by himself.
[03:05:50.139 --> 03:05:54.082]  You'll find all those articles and more at Infowars.com.
[03:05:54.082 --> 03:05:54.663]  I'm David Knight.
[03:05:58.311 --> 03:05:59.131]  Hey, everyone!
[03:05:59.131 --> 03:06:01.412]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:06:01.412 --> 03:06:05.253]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:06:05.253 --> 03:06:07.334]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:06:07.334 --> 03:06:17.617]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:06:17.617 --> 03:06:23.599]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:06:24.059 --> 03:06:38.896]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:06:38.916 --> 03:06:39.416]  I think so.
[03:06:59.424 --> 03:07:03.207]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:07:03.207 --> 03:07:10.932]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:07:10.932 --> 03:07:19.558]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:07:19.558 --> 03:07:23.981]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:07:23.981 --> 03:07:29.144]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[03:07:29.544 --> 03:07:33.785]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:07:33.785 --> 03:07:37.206]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:07:37.206 --> 03:07:48.349]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:07:48.349 --> 03:07:51.249]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:07:51.249 --> 03:07:57.231]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:08:13.377 --> 03:08:15.979]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:15.979 --> 03:08:21.403]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:21.403 --> 03:08:30.430]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[03:08:30.430 --> 03:08:35.174]  Ain't no mystery.
[03:08:35.174 --> 03:08:39.017]  Why I'm in misery.
[03:08:44.230 --> 03:08:47.972]  They call us walking corpses.
[03:08:47.972 --> 03:08:57.177]  Put us in their pretty pens.
[03:08:57.177 --> 03:09:01.339]  That's some poetry right there.
[03:09:01.339 --> 03:09:02.980]  Yeah, they want pretty dead.
[03:09:06.099 --> 03:09:16.364]  All the little pretty elites, all properly dressed, all manicured, doing all their scientific evil, but pointing down at, you know, somebody that drinks a beer as evil.
[03:09:16.364 --> 03:09:21.767]  Bunch of Pharisees.
[03:09:21.767 --> 03:09:27.390]  Right there, turn it up!
[03:09:27.390 --> 03:09:29.031]  All the corpses here are clean, boy!
[03:09:32.010 --> 03:09:33.092]  Alright, let's go to David Knight.
[03:09:33.092 --> 03:09:35.157]  David, I am jumping over into some of the hour.
[03:09:35.157 --> 03:09:37.282]  I appreciate you doing such a great job hosting.
[03:09:38.337 --> 03:09:42.660]  In the fourth hour, I guess three times this week, you're lined up to do it, along with the rest of the great crew.
[03:09:42.660 --> 03:09:46.902]  Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, Darren McBreen, and Rob doing so many others.
[03:09:46.902 --> 03:09:48.984]  Paul Watson, Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:09:48.984 --> 03:09:51.025]  Always a great grab bag here in the fourth hour.
[03:09:51.025 --> 03:09:56.768]  Tell us some of what's coming up in this hour, and then let's take a few calls together, because I promise to at least get to these calls.
[03:09:56.768 --> 03:09:57.589]  I know, I've seen it.
[03:09:57.589 --> 03:09:59.810]  It's a great report by Jakari Jackson.
[03:09:59.810 --> 03:10:06.995]  Really informative, really thought-provoking with all the transhumanism that he got at the body hacking meeting this week in Austin, and more.
[03:10:07.449 --> 03:10:08.770]  Yeah, we're going to have that report, Alex.
[03:10:08.770 --> 03:10:12.394]  We're also going to talk about some court issues.
[03:10:12.394 --> 03:10:17.519]  We have a judge who, for the first time, has come back and said, we don't have a right to film the police.
[03:10:17.519 --> 03:10:20.102]  A very interesting wrong decision.
[03:10:20.102 --> 03:10:21.924]  We're also going to look at something that's very hopeful.
[03:10:21.924 --> 03:10:26.729]  We had a Supreme Court justice come out in favor of fully informed juries in principle.
[03:10:26.729 --> 03:10:27.530]  That's a good sign.
[03:10:27.890 --> 03:10:35.396]  I also want to take a look at something most people will kind of be scratching their heads about, maybe didn't think they wanted to hear about, shipping containers.
[03:10:35.396 --> 03:10:46.164]  It tells us a lot about our economy, it tells us a lot about trade policy, and we're going to take a look at that, as well as, I guess we could say the fallout from the Nevada tests yesterday.
[03:10:46.164 --> 03:10:49.106]  Because that's kind of what it was, it was kind of like a nuclear test.
[03:10:49.746 --> 03:10:51.408]  I don't pressure you for your political views.
[03:10:51.408 --> 03:11:00.714]  I hired you because you were a smart guy, business owner, engineer, part of a whistleblower think tank group that exposed secret human testing in the Carolinas.
[03:11:00.714 --> 03:11:02.135]  I mean, you were a great find for us.
[03:11:02.135 --> 03:11:02.876]  So honored.
[03:11:02.876 --> 03:11:05.078]  You and your wife almost four years ago moved here.
[03:11:05.078 --> 03:11:06.158]  Well, you moved here three years ago.
[03:11:06.158 --> 03:11:11.082]  She stayed behind for a year to sell the home and pull up stakes from the Carolinas.
[03:11:11.082 --> 03:11:11.823]  But to have you here,
[03:11:12.987 --> 03:11:13.267]  I don't know.
[03:11:29.699 --> 03:11:36.964]  On so many fronts, I mean, really, I am moving more and more towards feeling really proud of my decision on Trump.
[03:11:36.964 --> 03:11:41.668]  I mean, I knew it was the right thing to do in my gut, but now I'm saying, oh, I guess my gut came through again.
[03:11:41.668 --> 03:11:45.911]  Now, look, who knows how this is going to change or where it's going to go, but what does your gut now tell you about Trump?
[03:11:46.530 --> 03:11:54.858]  Well, it's great to be here, Alex, especially because you don't put pressure on us, you let us say what we feel, and I know that we were on opposite sides of Trump for quite a while.
[03:11:54.858 --> 03:12:05.368]  I find it very positive, the things that he's done in the last couple weeks, talking about the missing pages, the classified pages about 9-11, talking about auditing the Fed, many of these things, and when you look at
[03:12:05.908 --> 03:12:13.313]  An issue that I believe he has real credibility on, and that's where he stands on trade and on globalism.
[03:12:13.313 --> 03:12:24.200]  When you look at what he did 35 years ago, spending $100,000 of his own money 35 years ago when he wasn't running for office to complain about what was happening in this country with trade, that's one aspect of it.
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:34.951]  But of course, he's also shut down the idea that we should reorder our economy, that we should pay taxes to a global entity because of the climate treaty, as well as open borders.
[03:12:34.951 --> 03:12:42.838]  Those are the three things that the globalists are using, that the elites are using, that the establishment are using to shut down the entire West.
[03:12:42.838 --> 03:12:43.259]  That's right.
[03:12:43.259 --> 03:12:44.580]  He's not perfect, but he is...
[03:12:45.581 --> 03:12:53.306]  Opposing the triad of the globalist takeover because he's fundamentally a nationalist who doesn't want to be part of their collective.
[03:12:53.306 --> 03:12:54.787]  Now, is he really a good guy?
[03:12:54.787 --> 03:12:56.008]  We're going to find out.
[03:12:56.008 --> 03:12:58.190]  But they're certainly scared of him.
[03:12:58.190 --> 03:13:02.272]  He's done stuff like, you know, shoot his mouth off about torture, like you amply said.
[03:13:02.272 --> 03:13:04.894]  They're all showing off because that's what the people want.
[03:13:04.894 --> 03:13:06.115]  He made a comment about Apple.
[03:13:06.115 --> 03:13:08.176]  I did a video saying, Donald, you're wrong.
[03:13:08.176 --> 03:13:09.957]  They want the encryption.
[03:13:09.957 --> 03:13:10.958]  That's what it's about.
[03:13:10.958 --> 03:13:12.139]  It'll screw up Apple.
[03:13:12.139 --> 03:13:13.320]  No wonder Bill Gates wants it.
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:17.221]  This will turn Apple into PCs.
[03:13:17.221 --> 03:13:18.442]  And look, I hate Apple.
[03:13:18.442 --> 03:13:22.143]  They're probably the most evil corporation out there with some of the worst factories.
[03:13:22.143 --> 03:13:25.084]  They fund some of the worst anti-American garbage.
[03:13:25.084 --> 03:13:28.445]  But Apple's right on this, and I think Donald Trump's wrong.
[03:13:28.445 --> 03:13:32.986]  He's playing up to some of the worst authoritarian instincts of the Republican Party right now in the primaries.
[03:13:32.986 --> 03:13:36.007]  And we'll have to see what happens in the long term.
[03:13:36.007 --> 03:13:39.969]  But even when we look at issues where we disagree with him on like eminent domain, for example,
[03:13:40.669 --> 03:13:47.595]  He will at least come out and say, this is what I think, unlike Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, who have both supported the Keystone Pipeline.
[03:13:47.595 --> 03:13:48.455]  They weasel around.
[03:13:48.455 --> 03:13:49.116]  Exactly.
[03:13:49.116 --> 03:13:51.258]  They will lie to your face.
[03:13:51.258 --> 03:13:58.884]  And that's why people who say that they support Trump because he's a straight shooter, people say they support Cruz because they agree with him on the issues.
[03:13:58.884 --> 03:14:03.707]  But so many people have been lied to for so long by people who micro...
[03:14:05.769 --> 03:14:09.731]  Do micro data to analyze where everybody is on the issues.
[03:14:09.731 --> 03:14:11.472]  Cruz is a perfect example of that.
[03:14:11.472 --> 03:14:14.254]  And then tell you exactly what you want to believe.
[03:14:14.254 --> 03:14:15.635]  People don't trust that anymore.
[03:14:15.635 --> 03:14:17.316]  I don't trust it either.
[03:14:17.316 --> 03:14:26.321]  He has the advanced stuff that Obama used, where they know each of their potential voters down to what they eat, how old they are, what they do, what issues they want.
[03:14:26.321 --> 03:14:32.124]  And then they micro tailor with a computer, they admit this, where they go to your door and say, Ted Cruz supports this, this and that.
[03:14:32.124 --> 03:14:34.706]  And then don't tell you, by the way, we're surveilling you.
[03:14:34.986 --> 03:14:37.587]  Yeah, that is very, very creepy.
[03:14:37.587 --> 03:14:51.871]  So when you see people who come to you and say, well, I'm staying with you on individual property rights and so forth and so on, and then stick the dagger in your knife like Marco Rubio did with the Gang of Eight, that type of betrayal is why people are looking for outsiders.
[03:14:51.871 --> 03:14:56.273]  It's why they are going with Donald Trump regardless of whether they agree with him on the issue.
[03:14:56.273 --> 03:14:59.014]  I have massive issues I disagree with him on still.
[03:14:59.014 --> 03:15:03.375]  So I need to turn it over to you because you've got a whole show lined up and I want to go to a few calls, but bottom line though.
[03:15:03.675 --> 03:15:06.058]  I know you're on the lesser of two evils, but this is a critical time.
[03:15:06.058 --> 03:15:10.664]  Whole power structure against him, Marco Rubio, or now Ted Cruz, Donald Trump.
[03:15:10.664 --> 03:15:16.491]  I mean, we gotta support one of them, or do we just sit back and keep the moral high ground and say we supported none of them?
[03:15:16.491 --> 03:15:19.555]  Things are so critical, I'm saying Donald Trump, I'm all in.
[03:15:19.555 --> 03:15:22.178]  Now, if he gets bad and really goes sideways, I'm coming after him.
[03:15:22.318 --> 03:15:23.599]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:15:23.599 --> 03:15:25.781]  I think it's important that we look at things.
[03:15:25.781 --> 03:15:38.514]  If we can shut down the three legs of the globalist takeover right now, if we can expose the lies that the police state was built upon, those are huge positives and so I would support him for that, yeah.
[03:15:38.514 --> 03:15:40.576]  Okay, so now you are moving into supporting Trump?
[03:15:40.876 --> 03:15:43.137]  Yeah, oh yeah, I'll vote for him in the Texas primary for sure.
[03:15:43.137 --> 03:15:44.017]  We'll see what happens after that.
[03:15:44.017 --> 03:15:46.479]  Okay, that's a big deal because David Knight cannot stand Trump.
[03:15:46.479 --> 03:15:47.759]  I'll just tell you behind the scenes.
[03:15:47.759 --> 03:15:50.821]  So that's a big deal right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:50.821 --> 03:15:52.541]  This is what's happening all over.
[03:15:52.541 --> 03:15:54.062]  Trump's getting more powerful.
[03:15:54.062 --> 03:15:55.083]  People are waking up.
[03:15:55.083 --> 03:15:56.903]  He's doing the right thing.
[03:15:56.903 --> 03:16:03.566]  But if he goes sideways, we've got to really let him know we're coming after him politically.
[03:16:03.566 --> 03:16:05.727]  We don't give anybody a pass on the issues.
[03:16:05.727 --> 03:16:07.008]  We're not going to follow somebody.
[03:16:07.008 --> 03:16:08.929]  I'm not going to follow somebody because of who they are.
[03:16:09.249 --> 03:16:13.813]  That's one of the issues that I had with Donald Trump at the very beginning was people falling behind him.
[03:16:13.813 --> 03:16:14.894]  Cult of personality.
[03:16:14.894 --> 03:16:15.555]  Exactly.
[03:16:15.555 --> 03:16:16.516]  That's very dangerous.
[03:16:16.516 --> 03:16:21.160]  I saw that with Donald Trump and of course there is a lot of cult of personality involved in that.
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:31.690]  You've got people crossing over from the Democrats to vote for him and so we need to still look at people and hold their feet to the fire and we need to... Well he better know, he better deliver, but we're behind him.
[03:16:31.690 --> 03:16:33.912]  Tucker, real fast because I want to go to John in Nebraska.
[03:16:33.912 --> 03:16:34.893]  Tucker, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:16:36.061 --> 03:16:38.163]  Yeah, David Knight, you're the man.
[03:16:38.163 --> 03:16:40.545]  Thanks, brother, for all you do for all of us out here.
[03:16:40.545 --> 03:16:44.168]  Let me get to the real, what's really going on.
[03:16:44.168 --> 03:16:47.891]  You know, people are really starting to wake up all over.
[03:16:47.891 --> 03:16:55.218]  It's just so refreshing to see the young minds and the old minds starting to take heed to what's being said.
[03:16:55.902 --> 03:17:07.266]  Through this electrical indoctrination that we all get on this mainstream media, people are so zombified to believing the half-truth.
[03:17:07.266 --> 03:17:15.309]  My grandpa always taught me, when two people are telling you different stories, you have to assume that they are both lying.
[03:17:15.309 --> 03:17:22.812]  So, you know, being brought up by the elders, I have a different set of moral principles
[03:17:23.234 --> 03:17:23.434]  I think.
[03:17:29.304 --> 03:17:39.569]  They're getting false information and are being told to believe the lies, just completely, just constantly being bombarded into our young minds.
[03:17:39.569 --> 03:17:42.791]  That's why they're so arrogant is they've got our kids, that's why we have to start changing them.
[03:17:42.791 --> 03:17:43.872]  That's a good point.
[03:17:43.872 --> 03:17:49.595]  If you're talking to two people and the story's different, one may be telling the truth, the other may be lying, or they both may be lying.
[03:17:49.595 --> 03:17:50.475]  That's a really good point.
[03:17:50.475 --> 03:17:53.257]  Don't just take the left-right paradigm and believe it.
[03:17:54.098 --> 03:17:55.279]  And I'm not doing that with Trump.
[03:17:55.279 --> 03:17:57.382]  I'm simply saying the system's scared of him.
[03:17:57.382 --> 03:17:59.525]  He's better on most of the issues than others.
[03:17:59.525 --> 03:18:00.386]  I'm getting behind him.
[03:18:00.386 --> 03:18:01.347]  I appreciate your call, Tucker.
[03:18:01.347 --> 03:18:04.651]  I want to get one more call in before break, and I'm handing it over to Knight.
[03:18:04.651 --> 03:18:05.572]  He'll probably take your calls.
[03:18:05.572 --> 03:18:08.817]  But John in Nebraska says he wants to talk about movie Hail Caesar.
[03:18:08.817 --> 03:18:11.560]  We kind of gave it the headline that Hail Caesar is a
[03:18:12.569 --> 03:18:14.570]  Allegory of the Christ story.
[03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:17.411]  Really, it's beyond that.
[03:18:17.411 --> 03:18:25.454]  But I saw the Coen Brothers movie is actually anti-political correct, anti-communist, and very sophisticated, if you watched it closely.
[03:18:25.454 --> 03:18:28.415]  What did you think, John?
[03:18:28.415 --> 03:18:32.536]  First-time caller, Alex, 17-year listener.
[03:18:32.536 --> 03:18:40.739]  At the end of the Coen Brothers film, you know, George Clooney's at the foot of the cross, and he's sounding very Christian, and then he gets caught up at the end.
[03:18:41.368 --> 03:18:46.012]  And in the background, uh, somebody maybe hit his thumb with a hammer or something.
[03:18:46.012 --> 03:18:48.093]  He said, son of a blank.
[03:18:48.093 --> 03:18:49.494]  Remember that?
[03:18:49.494 --> 03:18:49.735]  Yes.
[03:18:49.735 --> 03:18:51.216]  That's supposedly what messes him up.
[03:18:51.216 --> 03:18:52.717]  Yeah.
[03:18:52.717 --> 03:18:53.478]  Well, no.
[03:18:53.478 --> 03:19:08.870]  Well, my thinking is, is that's the true feeling of the Coen brothers in that the Talmud, you know, doesn't think too highly of Mary and the term son of a blank, you know, uh, echoes their feeling that, uh, she had Jesus out of wedlock.
[03:19:09.867 --> 03:19:17.051]  And so my taking was that it was a very sly, anti-Christian dig.
[03:19:17.051 --> 03:19:21.534]  I want to segue real quick to my main focus, if I may.
[03:19:21.534 --> 03:19:23.755]  We'll skip this network break because we're in the fourth hour.
[03:19:23.755 --> 03:19:26.136]  Go ahead.
[03:19:26.136 --> 03:19:37.863]  I have found out from a guy, a Christian guy named James Lloyd, I found out about 20 years ago that for the last 50, 60 years, approximately a third of the Hollywood films
[03:19:39.008 --> 03:19:42.990]  In the film, they embed the number 666.
[03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:53.454]  And I'll give you two recent examples of movies that I bet you saw, and that you and your listeners need to look for in the future, if I may.
[03:19:53.454 --> 03:19:56.655]  We're not screening your calls, bro.
[03:19:56.655 --> 03:19:59.236]  Every caller, I go through this thing where people say, may I say this?
[03:19:59.236 --> 03:20:02.418]  And I'm like, sure, go ahead.
[03:20:02.418 --> 03:20:02.718]  Sorry.
[03:20:03.819 --> 03:20:11.141]  In the movie Creed, about a third of the way through, Sylvester Stallone is talking to this Michael B. Jordan about this upcoming fight.
[03:20:11.141 --> 03:20:13.841]  He says, yeah, we got it in six weeks.
[03:20:13.841 --> 03:20:15.462]  And Jordan says, six weeks?
[03:20:15.462 --> 03:20:18.903]  And Sly Stallone says, yeah, six weeks.
[03:20:18.903 --> 03:20:20.503]  So there's your 666.
[03:20:20.503 --> 03:20:32.026]  Then in the movie Spotlight, towards the end of the film, they're able to figure out the percentage of priests in Boston, these Boston Globe writers, that the percentage of pedophilia is 6%.
[03:20:33.396 --> 03:20:37.279]  And they're looking at a graph on their computer and they say, look at that, six percent.
[03:20:37.279 --> 03:20:39.601]  And the other guy says, yeah, six percent.
[03:20:39.601 --> 03:20:42.463]  And then a retort, yeah, six percent.
[03:20:42.463 --> 03:20:46.066]  So I'm telling you, this is in a third of Hollywood films, either audio or digital.
[03:20:46.066 --> 03:20:47.287]  We're going to look into both those movies.
[03:20:47.287 --> 03:20:48.368]  I thought Creed was excellent.
[03:20:48.368 --> 03:20:50.349]  I don't usually like those Rocky movies.
[03:20:50.349 --> 03:20:53.552]  And I'm going to look at that, because I know Disney's been caught with subliminals.
[03:20:53.552 --> 03:20:55.794]  They teach in college that there are subliminals.
[03:20:55.794 --> 03:20:59.677]  A lot of sex subliminals and stuff as well, because it makes your brain really pay attention to it.
[03:20:59.677 --> 03:21:00.477]  It's one reason to do it.
[03:21:01.418 --> 03:21:05.121]  I thought, compared to most Hollywood movies, the Coen Brothers film was pretty good.
[03:21:05.121 --> 03:21:19.451]  You get the rabbi, not really slapped down, but you've got, you know, what he's saying sounds mean, and the Christian sounds sophisticated, and then you've got the Christ figure, kind of the studio head, who does it because he wants to help everybody, and you've got, you know, the Texan, who they think is dumb, but is actually...
[03:21:20.271 --> 03:21:33.824]  Really smart and saves the day and you've got kind of the boss that's God back in New York who knows what decisions to make even though they don't make sense and you've got kind of this whole comedy of eras but it's not at serendipity and synchronicity.
[03:21:33.824 --> 03:21:36.247]  I mean I've got to write notes the next time I see the movie.
[03:21:36.247 --> 03:21:37.348]  I thought it was an excellent film.
[03:21:37.888 --> 03:21:41.029]  And I think the Coen Brothers do a really, really good job.
[03:21:41.029 --> 03:21:42.749]  They do do things multi-level.
[03:21:42.749 --> 03:21:47.170]  So I get your point about they may have done that, too, to show that perspective.
[03:21:47.170 --> 03:21:50.971]  What I think they do is try to show multiple perspectives.
[03:21:50.971 --> 03:21:55.832]  And I don't want to sit there and say, I don't think the Coen Brothers are satanic watching their films.
[03:21:55.832 --> 03:21:57.152]  They seem like really smart people.
[03:21:57.152 --> 03:21:58.913]  But who knows?
[03:21:58.913 --> 03:22:01.473]  What's your comeback to that?
[03:22:01.473 --> 03:22:04.354]  Here's my final point, and it ties in with that.
[03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:09.334]  Are you going to be seeing Chris Carter of the X-Files possibly soon?
[03:22:09.334 --> 03:22:12.216]  Yeah, I said that a couple times since you've been on hold that I'm going to go out to L.A.
[03:22:12.216 --> 03:22:13.937]  and meet with him soon.
[03:22:13.937 --> 03:22:14.918]  Oh, sorry Alex.
[03:22:14.918 --> 03:22:16.419]  Anyway... I'm not trying to be mean.
[03:22:16.419 --> 03:22:17.961]  It's just like, I'm one of the people who listen to the show.
[03:22:17.961 --> 03:22:20.623]  I'm like, please don't ask permission to talk.
[03:22:20.623 --> 03:22:22.084]  And then I did say that.
[03:22:22.084 --> 03:22:23.625]  I'm not trying to be an old lady or something.
[03:22:23.625 --> 03:22:27.668]  It's just that... Go ahead.
[03:22:27.668 --> 03:22:33.273]  Anyway, in this final episode of the X-Files, in the first quarter of it,
[03:22:34.256 --> 03:22:43.520]  Dana Scully said something about six weeks and then she repeated it and then Joel McHale, who plays your character, also said six weeks.
[03:22:43.520 --> 03:22:45.261]  So sometimes they break up this 666.
[03:22:45.261 --> 03:22:49.663]  Which episode was that?
[03:22:49.663 --> 03:22:54.405]  The one that aired on Monday night, the day I called your tip line to inform you of what
[03:22:55.552 --> 03:22:56.152]  Alright, thank you.
[03:22:56.152 --> 03:22:57.192]  Well, we try to track it all.
[03:22:57.192 --> 03:22:58.032]  It doesn't mean we get to it all.
[03:22:58.032 --> 03:22:58.913]  And again, I'm not complaining.
[03:22:58.913 --> 03:22:59.613]  Thank you so much.
[03:22:59.613 --> 03:23:01.933]  God bless you.
[03:23:01.933 --> 03:23:09.954]  I missed, like, the first five, six minutes of the new X-Files that has my character in it because I thought it was the next hour.
[03:23:09.954 --> 03:23:12.635]  I had the time zones mixed up.
[03:23:12.635 --> 03:23:15.135]  What I was told was mixed up, so I got home late.
[03:23:15.135 --> 03:23:16.216]  And so I missed the first part.
[03:23:16.216 --> 03:23:19.956]  I actually want to watch that again tonight and then take some close-up of the show.
[03:23:19.956 --> 03:23:20.936]  But I'll look into that.
[03:23:20.936 --> 03:23:24.657]  I don't think, in an hour-long show, the word six is said three times.
[03:23:26.852 --> 03:23:30.077]  That people are trying to do that.
[03:23:30.077 --> 03:23:32.822]  I think a lot of this is we're subliminally hit with this stuff.
[03:23:32.822 --> 03:23:34.064]  We put it back on ourselves.
[03:23:34.064 --> 03:23:39.633]  Like ever since I was a little kid, there were like jello commercials and stuff that would say, Oh, it's delicious.
[03:23:39.633 --> 03:23:40.675]  Everything's a okay.
[03:23:40.675 --> 03:23:41.255]  And I would do like.
[03:23:42.213 --> 03:23:48.138]  You know, put my index finger to my thumb, and then people get that when I do that, and they say, man, he's doing Illuminati.
[03:23:48.138 --> 03:23:54.102]  I mean, I do lots of hand signals, and I guess they all do mean something.
[03:23:54.102 --> 03:24:11.116]  But some of the folks that promote all that go so far as they say that when I talked about when George W. Bush does the Diablo sign, does he mean University of Texas, or does he mean warding off the devil like it means in Italy, or does he mean
[03:24:12.717 --> 03:24:15.259]  Like some of the modern people have picked it up as a sign of the devil.
[03:24:15.259 --> 03:24:18.622]  Because Rodney James Dio popularized it.
[03:24:18.622 --> 03:24:20.203]  His grandmother was an old Italian lady.
[03:24:20.203 --> 03:24:24.346]  When she saw something she thought was evil, the way you ward it off was with that symbol.
[03:24:24.346 --> 03:24:29.110]  Well, then I make that symbol, and then people grab it and say, here he is making the satanic symbol.
[03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:30.751]  Well, yes, I'm making it to show you the symbol.
[03:24:30.751 --> 03:24:36.376]  It doesn't mean... Again, it's all this weird Pharisee stuff I've noticed people do to them.
[03:24:36.376 --> 03:24:39.779]  Say you're bad, show they're good, but then they do nothing.
[03:24:40.629 --> 03:24:43.873]  And then I'm sitting here full well knowing I'm not a Satanist.
[03:24:43.873 --> 03:24:45.435]  I have incredible empathy.
[03:24:45.435 --> 03:24:46.477]  I care about people.
[03:24:46.477 --> 03:24:47.899]  I love Jesus Christ.
[03:24:47.899 --> 03:24:49.160]  I want to help people.
[03:24:49.160 --> 03:24:52.124]  I want to empower humanity.
[03:24:52.124 --> 03:24:54.567]  I want to reach out to others.
[03:24:56.096 --> 03:25:01.318]  And that's what I do, it's what I stand for, but I'm not on trial from the devil, the accuser.
[03:25:01.318 --> 03:25:06.060]  But it is true, there's all sorts of weird satanic stuff in movies, in subliminals, you name it.
[03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:09.702]  But some people say, look at Stanley Kubrick, a satanist, a movie about satanism.
[03:25:09.702 --> 03:25:13.803]  He was exposing the satanism.
[03:25:13.803 --> 03:25:17.785]  So I think people have to deal with the stuff they can prove.
[03:25:17.785 --> 03:25:20.266]  Like, you can prove they've built FEMA camps around the country.
[03:25:21.732 --> 03:25:22.652]  You can prove that.
[03:25:22.652 --> 03:25:26.575]  They call them Emergency Centers Establishment Act, civilian inmate labor camp programs, all this.
[03:25:26.575 --> 03:25:28.215]  But no one wants to investigate.
[03:25:28.215 --> 03:25:29.576]  No one wants to go cover them.
[03:25:29.576 --> 03:25:31.537]  They want to just say, I heard there's a FEMA camp.
[03:25:31.537 --> 03:25:32.998]  I heard there's a chemtrail.
[03:25:32.998 --> 03:25:36.360]  Well, they've got scientific names for the chemtrail, and it's called geoengineering.
[03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:37.360]  Here's a news article.
[03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:39.782]  No one cares about admissions of it.
[03:25:39.782 --> 03:25:42.103]  They love the speculation of it.
[03:25:42.103 --> 03:25:43.604]  And I don't even know how to describe all this.
[03:25:43.604 --> 03:25:47.706]  It's just weird psychology that I think has been implanted by the television and stuff.
[03:25:48.815 --> 03:25:51.216]  I don't know how to explain it.
[03:25:51.216 --> 03:25:54.918]  I don't know about our listeners so much as the general public.
[03:25:54.918 --> 03:25:59.001]  David, I'm going to throw the baton to you because you've got a big show lined up and Jokari's report coming up.
[03:25:59.001 --> 03:26:02.362]  You might want to comment on my rant right there to see if you can make any sense of it.
[03:26:02.362 --> 03:26:04.604]  But the Nightly News is coming up tonight.
[03:26:04.604 --> 03:26:11.567]  Tomorrow we're going to have extended coverage of the big Republican debate ahead of Super Tuesday and more InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock weeknights.
[03:26:11.567 --> 03:26:12.188]  Thank you, David Dyke.
[03:26:12.827 --> 03:26:13.827]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:26:13.827 --> 03:26:22.530]  You know, I wanted to talk about something I think maybe you didn't really think you'd be interested in hearing about shipping containers, but I saw this article.
[03:26:22.530 --> 03:26:24.150]  It was on Daily Mail the other day.
[03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:28.331]  They had pictures of the largest container ship ever.
[03:26:28.331 --> 03:26:30.052]  It's docked in Long Beach, California.
[03:26:30.052 --> 03:26:35.033]  It will take five days to unload it, then it's going to go to Seattle and it's going to unload even more stuff.
[03:26:35.033 --> 03:26:36.794]  They say it's a quarter mile long.
[03:26:36.794 --> 03:26:40.655]  I thought it was interesting because the name of this ship is the Benjamin Franklin.
[03:26:41.195 --> 03:26:46.540]  And yet it's all about bringing goods from China to America, not the other way around.
[03:26:46.540 --> 03:26:49.082]  We've seen this happening for quite some time.
[03:26:49.082 --> 03:26:52.225]  Now this particular ship is a quarter mile long.
[03:26:52.225 --> 03:26:54.187]  It is bigger than the Empire State Building.
[03:26:54.187 --> 03:26:59.952]  It can hold up to 18,000 units, 116,000 tons of produce.
[03:26:59.952 --> 03:27:02.174]  It's going to take them five days to unload this.
[03:27:03.194 --> 03:27:06.115]  They said that they don't need much in terms of crew.
[03:27:06.115 --> 03:27:11.497]  You know, move this around with a crew the same as a ship half of the size.
[03:27:11.497 --> 03:27:15.078]  They say that it had made a maiden voyage to the U.S.
[03:27:15.078 --> 03:27:16.298]  back in December.
[03:27:16.298 --> 03:27:19.879]  It took it two weeks to unload the cargo that it had at that time.
[03:27:20.439 --> 03:27:26.065]  And so now it's taking it five days, but it's still a massive amount of cargo that's being unloaded.
[03:27:26.065 --> 03:27:33.912]  And I remember hearing years ago about these cargo ships that are coming to the United States laden down with things from China, like this.
[03:27:33.912 --> 03:27:37.175]  This ship that is as large as the Empire State Building.
[03:27:37.816 --> 03:27:40.939]  Filled with goods from China, going back completely empty.
[03:27:40.939 --> 03:27:42.079]  So I started searching for that.
[03:27:42.079 --> 03:27:43.721]  I found this article going back 10 years.
[03:27:43.721 --> 03:27:44.121]  2006.
[03:27:44.121 --> 03:27:52.108]  They talked about ships that were arriving from Europe or the United States that were speckled with E markings arriving in China.
[03:27:52.108 --> 03:27:55.370]  They say sometimes you get a vessel coming in here where the whole thing is empty.
[03:27:55.370 --> 03:27:56.171]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:27:56.171 --> 03:27:57.632]  Typically it was about 60% empty.
[03:27:59.013 --> 03:28:02.875]  They say shippers that carry television sets, sneakers, other manufactured goods to the U.S.
[03:28:02.875 --> 03:28:04.975]  and Europe trade with China was booming.
[03:28:04.975 --> 03:28:06.336]  That's ten years ago.
[03:28:06.336 --> 03:28:08.837]  But increasingly, it's a one-way street.
[03:28:08.837 --> 03:28:11.858]  They said year after year, the gap gets wider and wider.
[03:28:11.858 --> 03:28:12.878]  Well, that was ten years ago.
[03:28:12.878 --> 03:28:14.739]  Then I found another story.
[03:28:14.739 --> 03:28:16.480]  That was five years ago.
[03:28:18.129 --> 03:28:23.710]  Now they're talking about how they're going to deal with the problem of all these empty shipping containers.
[03:28:23.710 --> 03:28:29.812]  They say it's one of the biggest hidden costs of the shipping industry, the fact that they have to haul back all these empty shipping containers.
[03:28:29.812 --> 03:28:38.314]  So there's a very large trade article about how they're going to deal with the problem of all of these empty crates going backwards.
[03:28:38.314 --> 03:28:39.374]  They're not buying anything from
[03:28:39.394 --> 03:28:39.574]  I think?
[03:29:01.900 --> 03:29:14.387]  That shows where all of these large giant shipping cargo ships are, and they show in the Atlantic Ocean, not the Pacific Ocean, but in the Atlantic Ocean, they're all at port.
[03:29:14.387 --> 03:29:23.872]  They say commerce, and this is January the 8th, 2016, commerce between Europe and North America has literally come to a halt for the first time in known history.
[03:29:24.472 --> 03:29:29.076]  Not one cargo ship was in transit in the North Atlantic between Europe and North America.
[03:29:29.076 --> 03:29:30.437]  That was on January the 8th.
[03:29:30.437 --> 03:29:31.899]  This has never happened before.
[03:29:31.899 --> 03:29:33.520]  A horrific economic sign.
[03:29:33.520 --> 03:29:35.602]  Proof that commerce has literally stopped.
[03:29:35.602 --> 03:29:36.423]  Stay with us.
[03:29:36.423 --> 03:29:40.506]  When we come back, I'm going to talk about what that means for our trade policy.
[03:29:40.506 --> 03:29:42.068]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:42.068 --> 03:29:43.469]  It's a cardiac arrest, folks.
[03:29:47.928 --> 03:29:51.851]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.851 --> 03:30:00.497]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.497 --> 03:30:03.860]  Marco Rubio, Wall Street's boy toy.
[03:30:03.860 --> 03:30:09.444]  He's gotten more money from the elite donors in Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hillary.
[03:30:09.444 --> 03:30:13.167]  After blowing 150 million dollars on Jeb, they still haven't learned anything.
[03:30:14.890 --> 03:30:17.273]  Jeb's dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada.
[03:30:17.273 --> 03:30:20.577]  Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution.
[03:30:20.577 --> 03:30:24.982]  Jeb had a sense of entitlement, kind of like the donor class and the party elite that support Rubio.
[03:30:24.982 --> 03:30:29.567]  They believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues and still win.
[03:30:29.567 --> 03:30:31.029]  But Rubio is a little smarter.
[03:30:31.449 --> 03:30:36.951]  He realizes that his support for illegal immigration with a gang of eight was a betrayal of the voters.
[03:30:36.951 --> 03:30:39.632]  But he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies.
[03:30:39.632 --> 03:30:47.534]  He's called Breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of the ICE union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with a gang of eight.
[03:30:47.534 --> 03:30:55.257]  The Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service, identifying the GOP political class who will say anything to get elected.
[03:30:55.257 --> 03:30:57.058]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:58.398 --> 03:31:01.920]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:01.920 --> 03:31:10.165]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:10.165 --> 03:31:15.588]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:15.588 --> 03:31:18.109]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:31:18.109 --> 03:31:20.210]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:31:28.323 --> 03:31:29.244]  Shower filters.
[03:31:29.244 --> 03:31:30.966]  We're introducing the best yet.
[03:31:30.966 --> 03:31:35.031]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[03:31:35.031 --> 03:31:39.856]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.
[03:31:39.856 --> 03:31:46.944]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[03:31:46.944 --> 03:31:49.787]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[03:31:49.967 --> 03:31:50.548]  We're good.
[03:32:04.904 --> 03:32:08.307]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[03:32:08.307 --> 03:32:11.969]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[03:32:11.969 --> 03:32:14.431]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[03:32:14.431 --> 03:32:18.074]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2.
[03:32:18.074 --> 03:32:21.597]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:32:21.937 --> 03:32:24.039]  I needed a detox basically.
[03:32:24.039 --> 03:32:28.682]  I started taking X2 first for about seven days and then I did the deep cleanse.
[03:32:28.682 --> 03:32:32.325]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:32:32.325 --> 03:32:33.646]  What do you have to lose?
[03:32:33.646 --> 03:32:42.212]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:32:42.672 --> 03:32:46.653]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[03:32:46.653 --> 03:32:48.294]  I was, like, really more natural.
[03:32:48.294 --> 03:32:53.516]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:32:53.516 --> 03:32:55.897]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:32:55.897 --> 03:33:00.778]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:33:00.778 --> 03:33:02.339]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:33:14.230 --> 03:33:19.034]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.034 --> 03:33:22.417]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.417 --> 03:33:25.280]  I'm David Knight, your host, and joining me in this segment is Jakari Jackson.
[03:33:25.280 --> 03:33:31.145]  We're going to play a very interesting report that he had of a body hacking conference in Austin, Texas.
[03:33:31.145 --> 03:33:31.845]  Covered that yesterday.
[03:33:31.845 --> 03:33:33.427]  You can see that report on Infowars.com.
[03:33:33.427 --> 03:33:36.810]  We're going to play it in just a moment and talk to Jakari about what he saw there.
[03:33:37.470 --> 03:33:47.496]  And before we do that, I want to get back to this story about the shipping containers, because there's a lot that is here, just besides the fact that we have a shipping container.
[03:33:47.496 --> 03:33:51.058]  These ships are getting larger all the time.
[03:33:51.058 --> 03:34:00.823]  This one is the size of the Empire State Building, but of course they come over here, it takes days or weeks to unload them at each of the individual ports, and then they go back completely empty.
[03:34:00.823 --> 03:34:01.623]  What does that tell us?
[03:34:01.623 --> 03:34:02.504]  And what does it tell us?
[03:34:03.393 --> 03:34:08.715]  That even though this is a major problem for the shipping companies, it's like, well, you know, we only got trade going in one direction.
[03:34:08.715 --> 03:34:09.095]  You know what?
[03:34:09.095 --> 03:34:13.696]  It's not just a problem for the shipping companies, it's a problem for the American economy.
[03:34:13.696 --> 03:34:14.736]  How would they solve it?
[03:34:14.736 --> 03:34:25.260]  Well, one of the things that's happening is that we found out at the beginning of January that at least on one particular day there wasn't a single one of these ships carrying anything.
[03:34:25.260 --> 03:34:25.860]  Every one of them.
[03:34:26.280 --> 03:34:27.321]  Was at port.
[03:34:27.321 --> 03:34:32.144]  Very unprecedented, and of course that's what's behind the collapse of the stock market.
[03:34:32.144 --> 03:34:34.765]  It's really a collapse in demand.
[03:34:34.765 --> 03:34:36.186]  The economy is headed down.
[03:34:36.186 --> 03:34:38.688]  But I want to talk about the trade aspects of this.
[03:34:38.688 --> 03:34:43.231]  Before I do, I just want to let you know about some of the products we have at Infowarslife.com.
[03:34:43.231 --> 03:34:44.732]  That's what pays the bills here.
[03:34:44.732 --> 03:34:46.733]  That's what keeps us on the air.
[03:34:46.733 --> 03:34:48.474]  We have BrainForce available now.
[03:34:48.474 --> 03:34:49.415]  It is back in stock.
[03:34:49.415 --> 03:34:51.136]  And of course, if you sign up for AutoShip,
[03:34:51.696 --> 03:35:00.302]  You can determine the frequency that you want to get Brain Force and any of these products and get 10% off every time you order that.
[03:35:00.302 --> 03:35:02.623]  Signing up for auto ship before checkout.
[03:35:02.623 --> 03:35:06.206]  And of course, many of us in the crew really love Brain Force.
[03:35:06.206 --> 03:35:11.870]  You've heard Rob Dew's testimonial about how he used it in a particular all-nighter.
[03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:13.631]  I use it all the time.
[03:35:13.631 --> 03:35:16.533]  It really does make a difference.
[03:35:16.533 --> 03:35:19.715]  And also, we have a brand new formulation, Joint Formula.
[03:35:19.715 --> 03:35:21.476]  That's something that was just introduced this week.
[03:35:22.016 --> 03:35:23.637]  It's a first run.
[03:35:23.637 --> 03:35:29.699]  Our supply is very limited on it, but it is specifically designed to support the body's natural joint health and function.
[03:35:29.699 --> 03:35:32.200]  It's designed by our leading team of chemists.
[03:35:32.200 --> 03:35:33.841]  It's something that I will be trying.
[03:35:33.841 --> 03:35:37.922]  I haven't tried that yet, but it's something I will try, and I hope it works as well as BrainForce.
[03:35:37.922 --> 03:35:41.604]  You can get both of those at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:35:41.604 --> 03:35:48.707]  Now, quickly, before I go to Jakari, I want to talk about this issue with the shipping containers.
[03:35:50.379 --> 03:36:00.605]  The idea that many people have criticized Donald Trump about saying that what he's talking about is establishing protectionism because he points out that we're not getting a very good deal.
[03:36:00.605 --> 03:36:03.527]  You can see it with these shipping containers.
[03:36:03.527 --> 03:36:09.110]  A ship the size of the Empire State Building brings loads of goods over but goes back completely empty.
[03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:10.691]  Is that a good deal for us?
[03:36:10.691 --> 03:36:13.293]  Can you see the effect now?
[03:36:13.293 --> 03:36:16.835]  This giant sucking sound that Ross Perot used to talk about?
[03:36:16.835 --> 03:36:18.196]  We know how that's working out but
[03:36:18.556 --> 03:36:23.019]  The people who are trying to control our economy tell us, no, no, no, we need to have free trade.
[03:36:23.019 --> 03:36:24.679]  And I agree with free markets.
[03:36:24.679 --> 03:36:26.460]  I agree with unrestricted trade.
[03:36:26.460 --> 03:36:31.583]  Understand, what they're selling us with a Trans-Pacific Partnership is not free trade.
[03:36:31.583 --> 03:36:32.964]  It is managed trade.
[03:36:32.964 --> 03:36:39.328]  It is trade that is going to be managed by an unaccountable, unelected international commission.
[03:36:39.328 --> 03:36:46.792]  That's what Senator Sessions, who has looked at both the TPP and the TTIP, the Transatlantic and the Trans-Pacific Partnerships, has told us.
[03:36:47.392 --> 03:36:48.573]  These are treaties.
[03:36:48.573 --> 03:36:59.637]  People who have voted for these treaties in Congress have voted to shut down and ignore the constitutional process for ratifying a treaty because they didn't have 67 votes in the Senate.
[03:36:59.637 --> 03:37:00.738]  They changed the process.
[03:37:00.738 --> 03:37:01.618]  They've shut down debate.
[03:37:01.618 --> 03:37:08.281]  It's something that they're going to try to ram down our throat, and it's important to have someone who is going to stand up against that.
[03:37:08.281 --> 03:37:09.741]  It's very important.
[03:37:09.741 --> 03:37:13.103]  But I also want to talk about the fear about protectionism.
[03:37:13.723 --> 03:37:20.190]  You know, we've heard, and we hear it over and over again, the idea that Smoot-Hawley created the Depression.
[03:37:20.190 --> 03:37:21.251]  I want to play this clip for you.
[03:37:21.251 --> 03:37:25.715]  You've probably heard this before from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
[03:37:25.715 --> 03:37:33.383]  In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the, anyone, anyone?
[03:37:33.383 --> 03:37:34.945]  The Great Depression.
[03:37:35.885 --> 03:37:36.686]  Ben Stein.
[03:37:36.686 --> 03:37:37.607]  He's so droll.
[03:37:37.607 --> 03:37:43.732]  And there's these blank expressions from the kids if you're listening to this on the radio.
[03:37:58.172 --> 03:38:02.636]  It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression.
[03:38:02.636 --> 03:38:05.158]  Today, we have a similar debate over this.
[03:38:05.158 --> 03:38:07.200]  Anyone know what this is, class?
[03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:09.222]  Anyone?
[03:38:09.222 --> 03:38:09.582]  Anyone?
[03:38:09.582 --> 03:38:11.464]  Anyone seen this before?
[03:38:11.464 --> 03:38:13.045]  It's the Laffer Curve.
[03:38:13.045 --> 03:38:15.047]  Anyone know what this says?
[03:38:15.047 --> 03:38:21.793]  It says that at this point on the revenue curve, you will get exactly the same amount of revenue
[03:38:23.470 --> 03:38:26.032]  As of this point, this is very controversial.
[03:38:26.032 --> 03:38:30.255]  Does anyone know what Vice President Bush called this in 1980?
[03:38:30.255 --> 03:38:32.217]  Anyone?
[03:38:32.217 --> 03:38:35.359]  Something D-O-O economics.
[03:38:35.359 --> 03:38:36.840]  Voodoo economics.
[03:38:36.840 --> 03:38:38.302]  Yeah, voodoo economics.
[03:38:38.302 --> 03:38:39.382]  The Laffer Curve.
[03:38:39.382 --> 03:38:40.183]  The Smooth Holly.
[03:38:40.183 --> 03:38:42.165]  All the dismal sciences of economics.
[03:38:42.165 --> 03:38:42.465]  But look.
[03:38:43.584 --> 03:38:49.967]  Smoot-Hawley or even having some kind of trade protection is not going to be the end of the world.
[03:38:49.967 --> 03:38:52.448]  It was not the cause of the Great Depression.
[03:38:52.448 --> 03:38:56.990]  Ben Bernanke said we, the Federal Reserve, we caused the Great Depression.
[03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:58.271]  Sorry, won't do it again.
[03:38:59.131 --> 03:39:02.492]  And that was a little bit before 2008, Shikari.
[03:39:02.492 --> 03:39:03.852]  So they did do it again.
[03:39:03.852 --> 03:39:11.314]  But understand that at one point in time, that was the entire revenue of the American government.
[03:39:11.314 --> 03:39:17.296]  Jefferson said with his second inaugural address, he said, by eliminating useless offices,
[03:39:17.856 --> 03:39:26.439]  We have been able to eliminate all internal taxation so that we can say what farmer, what laborer, what mechanic knows the taxman.
[03:39:26.439 --> 03:39:34.062]  They did not have any internal taxation to fund the federal government because the federal government was reduced to constitutional size.
[03:39:34.662 --> 03:39:36.163]  So it can be achieved.
[03:39:36.163 --> 03:39:42.808]  And it wasn't the end of the world for the United States to have the only taxes be custom and import taxes.
[03:39:42.808 --> 03:39:46.411]  We need to understand that it is not a fair deal.
[03:39:46.411 --> 03:39:49.593]  We need to understand that there's a lot more that's being done to manipulate this.
[03:39:49.593 --> 03:39:51.695]  It's not just the currency issues.
[03:39:51.695 --> 03:39:54.477]  It's the entire thing they call the China price.
[03:39:54.477 --> 03:39:57.600]  The copyright issues and many other things that are involved there.
[03:39:58.140 --> 03:40:10.805]  But we need to address this, and just from a pragmatic standpoint, but we also need to address this because it is going to bring down this country, it's going to be used to establish a global sovereignty.
[03:40:10.805 --> 03:40:12.786]  That's the real problem with this.
[03:40:12.786 --> 03:40:14.667]  Now moving on, Jakar, you were at a...
[03:40:17.932 --> 03:40:33.217]  Yes, this weekend they have the Austin Body Hacking Convention and body hacking is a term that encapsulates everything from piercings and hair colorings all the way up to more noticeable things such as body replacements.
[03:40:33.217 --> 03:40:34.797]  You know, people have artificial limbs.
[03:40:35.297 --> 03:40:35.777]  And I heard about it.
[03:40:35.777 --> 03:40:39.379]  So this is necessary because one of the guys that you talked to there was an amputee, so yeah.
[03:40:39.379 --> 03:40:41.319]  Yes, you know, fixing his body.
[03:40:41.319 --> 03:40:43.140]  Yeah, some people do it for cosmetic reasons.
[03:40:43.140 --> 03:40:44.800]  This guy did it for a very practical reason.
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:46.981]  He lost his arm in a train accident.
[03:40:46.981 --> 03:40:58.825]  So I had a chance to go out and speak with him, and he has a rather advanced prosthetic, because if you think about, you know, normally a soldier, whoever loses a limb, they give him, you know, the old kind of hook hand, you know, to move the shoulder and it moves.
[03:40:58.825 --> 03:41:02.607]  This one is a lot more, I don't want to say lifelike, but it has more
[03:41:03.823 --> 03:41:08.206]  Features that you'd see as a normal human arm it can grip and grasp and things such as that.
[03:41:08.206 --> 03:41:29.780]  Well it was really interesting looking and of course this guy and I think he kind of alluded to the the comic book effect of it the look of it you know because it really was a nice piece of hardware it didn't look like some kind of a fake plastic simulation I mean they went for something that was a unique look let's play a little bit of that and then we'll talk about the report afterwards go ahead
[03:41:31.141 --> 03:41:40.928]  Body hacking, a term that encapsulates everything from hair colorings and piercings to more notable examples such as body modifications, if not outright limb replacement.
[03:41:40.928 --> 03:41:51.275]  We're going to spend the weekend here at the Austin Body Hacking Convention and while I do anticipate meeting many interesting people, our first guest James is most definitely the star of the show.
[03:41:51.275 --> 03:41:53.317]  Do you just plug it into a wall or how do you charge it?
[03:41:54.277 --> 03:42:02.942]  It has a high voltage lithium polymer battery, and so it's kind of sensitive, and it needs to be charged in the correct way.
[03:42:02.942 --> 03:42:05.023]  Well, the big question is, how does it feel?
[03:42:06.541 --> 03:42:08.203]  It's really interesting, actually.
[03:42:08.203 --> 03:42:10.384]  It's got a unique feel.
[03:42:10.384 --> 03:42:19.791]  It's quite heavy because of all the technology we've put in, but also light because of the materials we've used with this high-tech carbon fiber, which is just like the lightest thing that we could have chosen.
[03:42:19.791 --> 03:42:21.973]  And we're trying to incorporate some cool stuff.
[03:42:21.973 --> 03:42:24.075]  It's got lighting in there that we can activate.
[03:42:24.075 --> 03:42:30.139]  It's going to have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, heart rate sensor and stuff like that to reflect my heart rate through the arm and stuff.
[03:42:30.139 --> 03:42:32.161]  So it's going to have a whole bunch of different features as well.
[03:42:32.381 --> 03:42:34.062]  There's a drone as well.
[03:42:34.062 --> 03:42:35.082]  I always forget about the drone.
[03:42:35.082 --> 03:42:37.624]  It's going to have a quadcopter mounted on the side.
[03:42:37.624 --> 03:42:54.793]  James' arm came out of the Phantom Limb Project, an initiative where video game developer Konami teamed with technology companies and sought to fit a gamer with a prosthetic similar to the one worn by Venom Snake, the flagship character in Konami's Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain.
[03:42:55.293 --> 03:42:58.394]  This is inspired by the Metal Gear series.
[03:42:58.394 --> 03:43:02.136]  Metal Gear has always kind of explored the relationship between humans and technology.
[03:43:02.136 --> 03:43:07.819]  You know, we've got lots of cyborgs in the series, we've got, you know, mechanical, big mechanical weapons.
[03:43:07.819 --> 03:43:15.102]  And so, using this idea, we thought of, like, maybe we could create this amazing arm for an amputee gamer.
[03:43:15.102 --> 03:43:20.965]  So, a friend of mine called Sophie de Oliveira Barata makes incredible alternative prosthetics.
[03:43:21.585 --> 03:43:26.731]  And so I kind of put two and two together and asked her if she'd be interested in working on this project and she was really up for it.
[03:43:26.731 --> 03:43:34.119]  So we sort of sent out this survey to find an amputee gamer who was really up for the idea of having an amazing alternative limb.
[03:43:34.119 --> 03:43:35.040]  We found James!
[03:43:35.040 --> 03:43:38.124]  We have a 3D modeler called Rudy.
[03:43:38.744 --> 03:43:42.707]  We've worked with Open Bionics, who have made the bionic hand.
[03:43:42.707 --> 03:43:53.834]  Now, it's not switched on at the moment, but there's some sensors in James' harness which work on his muscles, and he can send signals to his hand and perform all these different gestures, which he can program himself.
[03:43:53.834 --> 03:44:01.098]  The main part of the arm is made of carbon fibre by a company called GTR, Global Racing Technologies.
[03:44:01.098 --> 03:44:01.599]  To be honest,
[03:44:02.279 --> 03:44:04.642]  The best thing about it is just how it looks, to be honest.
[03:44:04.642 --> 03:44:12.230]  Because I've tried to get used to a health service prosthetic that I got in the UK, and it just has no personality.
[03:44:12.230 --> 03:44:16.595]  And for me, with my high level of amputation, it's not a great deal of use.
[03:44:16.595 --> 03:44:18.797]  Is there anything implanted in your body?
[03:44:18.797 --> 03:44:19.478]  Anything internal?
[03:44:20.223 --> 03:44:26.969]  No, this project is basically, we found each other before I'm going to the implanted stage.
[03:44:26.969 --> 03:44:31.833]  I'm basically fundraising at the moment to get titanium implants into my bone.
[03:44:31.833 --> 03:44:37.318]  So basically I don't need to have this big harness, which is holding this thing on, and it will just connect to my bone directly.
[03:44:37.318 --> 03:44:42.082]  But it costs so much money, and in the UK we can't get that on our health service.
[03:44:42.082 --> 03:44:44.564]  So I'm really fortunate to have tried this 3D printing hand.
[03:44:45.353 --> 03:44:52.519]  And the great thing about the 3D printed hand and Open Bionics is that they're making it accessible for people to have this kind of thing at a really low cost.
[03:44:52.519 --> 03:44:54.700]  Do you guys have any plans to make more of these?
[03:44:54.700 --> 03:44:56.642]  Is this an ongoing project?
[03:44:56.642 --> 03:44:59.624]  I mean, it's been such a labor of love for everyone, I think.
[03:44:59.624 --> 03:45:02.486]  You know, we just want to make this absolutely perfect for James.
[03:45:02.486 --> 03:45:05.509]  There aren't any plans in the moment to make another one.
[03:45:05.509 --> 03:45:10.573]  In case you were wondering, James was polite enough to share the story of how he lost his arm.
[03:45:11.013 --> 03:45:21.075]  I've seen the footage of the CCCB and basically I kind of step towards the train as it's arriving and then I'm just walking alongside it and then the next frame I'm like falling between two carriages.
[03:45:21.075 --> 03:45:25.557]  You can see the rest of that report at Infowars.com and also on the Alex Jones Channel.
[03:45:25.557 --> 03:45:38.580]  That's a good example because from there you go into some spots where they're putting chips in people's hands for free and that's the bad side I think of the technology and you know we look at
[03:45:40.320 --> 03:45:40.861]  That's right.
[03:45:59.454 --> 03:46:01.456]  You can use things for good or for evil.
[03:46:01.456 --> 03:46:22.255]  It's just that over and over again now, it seems like the military-industrial complex that has most of the money, just as Eisenhower warned us, it has now taken all of the leading-edge technology and using it for evil, just like we see this Google robot that was up... Well, as I asked James, you know, towards the end of the report, I say, you know, we see a lot of advances in technology, but do you think the day will come when people will just...
[03:46:23.476 --> 03:46:30.519]  Cosmetically augment themselves, and he says that day is probably coming, but he doesn't recommend it You know he doesn't recommend people who would cut off their arm.
[03:46:30.519 --> 03:46:45.224]  Yeah, he doesn't recommend that you chop off your arm or your leg He says he has his as a necessity not as a cosmetic feature well of course and then there's the the malicious stuff that's being done by DARPA that that video that surfaced yesterday that was on Drudge report you can see it link there.
[03:46:45.224 --> 03:46:45.864]  I think still and
[03:46:46.464 --> 03:46:51.766]  That was pretty amazing, to see how resilient that walking robot was.
[03:46:51.766 --> 03:46:58.588]  And actually, you know, very frightening, very creepy, because you know that it's not going to be used for benign purpose.
[03:46:58.588 --> 03:47:05.570]  They're using, this is DARPA, they use, they create weapons, and so they are weaponizing walking robots.
[03:47:05.570 --> 03:47:08.071]  That's the bottom line, folks, that's what's happening here.
[03:47:08.131 --> 03:47:09.292]  I think it was when I first started here.
[03:47:09.292 --> 03:47:11.715]  I guess the same time you started as well.
[03:47:11.715 --> 03:47:18.063]  They had the PETA man and that was the robot they had on the wires and on the stilts and they walked on the treadmill.
[03:47:18.063 --> 03:47:20.205]  Now they've gone past that.
[03:47:20.205 --> 03:47:25.812]  Yeah, and it's amazing how rapid their progress is with this because they have enormous
[03:47:26.212 --> 03:47:34.658]  Astronomical amounts of money that are being poured into this by DARPA, by Google, who basically have bought up all the promising robot technology.
[03:47:34.658 --> 03:47:52.190]  So you're talking about just a couple of years ago, you saw these first pictures of their robot project, and it had all this attached wires and everything, but in this latest one, he's walking through the snow, you know, he makes his way out the door, and then he walks through the snow, he stumbles in the snow, and then you have the guys
[03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:58.831]  Knock him over and he jumps up and the way that he jumps up is actually kind of frightening and how quick it is.
[03:47:58.831 --> 03:48:08.854]  Most of his movements are very slow and deliberate but when he got knocked over and he's in that crouching position, it almost looks like a stop-action animation.
[03:48:08.854 --> 03:48:10.534]  You can see it right there if you're watching this.
[03:48:10.534 --> 03:48:16.495]  Now it halts there for a second then all of a sudden it makes a couple of jerky movements and jumps up really quickly.
[03:48:16.495 --> 03:48:18.296]  That's the thing that's really concerning.
[03:48:19.574 --> 03:48:25.398]  It's definitely a strange time to be alive, David.
[03:48:25.398 --> 03:48:30.141]  And I'm not exactly sure what the rationale is for having these walking robots.
[03:48:30.141 --> 03:48:33.924]  What exactly they're going to be used for, or at least what they tell us what they're going to be used for.
[03:48:33.924 --> 03:48:35.265]  Well, you know, the other thing, too, though,
[03:48:35.265 --> 03:48:36.006]  I thought it was interesting.
[03:48:36.006 --> 03:48:38.648]  I asked you about that while we were watching this report.
[03:48:38.648 --> 03:48:42.090]  He was talking about how he's going to get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in his arm.
[03:48:42.090 --> 03:48:47.374]  And I'm thinking, why do you need Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in your prosthetic arm?
[03:48:47.374 --> 03:48:50.336]  It seems to me like, you know, you're talking about body hacking.
[03:48:50.336 --> 03:49:01.825]  That would be something that would possibly create a problem if you've got some malicious hackers that decide they're going to hack into your arm and all of a sudden it starts acting like the police lieutenant from Young Frankenstein with a mind of its own.
[03:49:02.986 --> 03:49:15.695]  Well, you know, as technology advances, I'm not exactly sure what all bells and whistles will be in this arm, but I guess that's a question I just never thought to ask is, do you think your arm could be hacked by somebody?
[03:49:16.314 --> 03:49:19.095]  Well, you know, that's a good point.
[03:49:19.095 --> 03:49:33.261]  So, let's talk to people about the real issues with this, because all you people, all you boys and girls who love to talk about conspiracy theories, I want you to grab your tinfoil hats and sit by the radio for a moment, and we're going to talk to you about real life.
[03:49:33.261 --> 03:49:39.464]  You know, you think you live in this safe little bubble, and you've got these uniformed people that are looking out for everything that you do.
[03:49:39.464 --> 03:49:45.026]  They're going to stomp to death anybody who threatens your little bubble, but you don't have to worry about them.
[03:49:45.566 --> 03:49:47.566]  They would never harm you.
[03:49:47.566 --> 03:49:49.567]  They would never lie to you.
[03:49:49.567 --> 03:49:53.508]  Well, the reality is something far beyond that.
[03:49:53.508 --> 03:49:56.528]  I want to read to you something from USA Today.
[03:49:56.528 --> 03:49:59.609]  You know that conspiracy website, USA Today?
[03:49:59.609 --> 03:50:03.410]  This is from Stephen Petrow, okay?
[03:50:03.410 --> 03:50:04.950]  And this came out today.
[03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:09.111]  I got hacked mid-air while writing an Apple FBI story.
[03:50:09.111 --> 03:50:09.391]  He says,
[03:50:10.131 --> 03:50:12.673]  I don't really need to worry about online privacy, I used to think.
[03:50:12.673 --> 03:50:13.534]  I've got nothing to hide.
[03:50:13.534 --> 03:50:15.515]  Who would want to know what I'm up to anyway?
[03:50:15.515 --> 03:50:18.578]  Sure, I'm a journalist, but I'm not an investigative reporter.
[03:50:18.578 --> 03:50:20.339]  I'm not a political radical.
[03:50:20.339 --> 03:50:22.120]  Not much interest in anyone, really.
[03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:28.425]  He says, that was last week, when the standoff between the FBI and Apple seemed much more about principle than practice to me.
[03:50:28.425 --> 03:50:32.869]  That's when I thought I'd write a column on whether this legal fight matters for regular folks.
[03:50:32.869 --> 03:50:37.872]  People like my mother, a retired social worker, my best friend who works in retail, whatever.
[03:50:37.872 --> 03:50:39.714]  Then he says, just before midnight,
[03:50:40.154 --> 03:50:43.116]  My plane touched down in Raleigh after a three-hour flight from Dallas.
[03:50:43.116 --> 03:50:50.220]  As usual, I spent much of the flight using American Airlines' GoGo In-Flight Internet Connection to answer emails.
[03:50:50.220 --> 03:50:58.926]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you what happened to him, and I'm going to try to burst your little illusion of bubble that you don't need to worry about the Internet of Things.
[03:50:59.326 --> 03:51:08.813]  My name is Don Whiskin from HeartDrop.com, the distributors of Xtendivite, the number one heart drop that people have been raving about for years.

[03:54:05.401 --> 03:54:06.642]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:06.642 --> 03:54:20.851]  On this final segment, I want to complete what I was telling you about this journalist who was on an airplane going from Dallas to Raleigh working, as he said, on a story about Apple and FBI.
[03:54:20.851 --> 03:54:26.675]  And as he was doing this, as he was getting off, he'd been using the in-flight Internet connection to answer emails.
[03:54:26.675 --> 03:54:35.221]  And as he was starting to get off the plane in Raleigh, he said a guy that was in a row behind him, somebody he had never seen before, came up to him and said, I need to talk to you.
[03:54:35.939 --> 03:54:37.400]  He says, I was kind of taken back.
[03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:38.360]  He says, well, it's late.
[03:54:38.360 --> 03:54:39.301]  I need to get home.
[03:54:39.301 --> 03:54:40.562]  And he goes, you're a reporter, right?
[03:54:40.562 --> 03:54:42.122]  And he goes, yeah.
[03:54:42.122 --> 03:54:43.603]  He says, wait for me at the gate.
[03:54:43.603 --> 03:54:45.504]  Sounds like the X-Files, doesn't it?
[03:54:45.504 --> 03:54:47.545]  This is from USA Today, by the way.
[03:54:47.545 --> 03:54:50.347]  He says, well, I didn't answer, but I did wait.
[03:54:50.347 --> 03:54:52.008]  He says, how did you know I was a reporter?
[03:54:52.008 --> 03:54:55.030]  He says, are you interested in the FBI Apple story?
[03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:57.051]  He said, ignoring my question.
[03:54:57.711 --> 03:54:58.452]  He said, kind of.
[03:54:58.452 --> 03:54:59.613]  Why are you asking me that?
[03:54:59.613 --> 03:55:01.034]  And then he dropped the bombshell.
[03:55:01.034 --> 03:55:03.236]  He said, I hacked your email on the plane.
[03:55:03.236 --> 03:55:05.778]  I read everything you sent, everything you received.
[03:55:05.778 --> 03:55:08.480]  I did it to most people on the flight.
[03:55:08.480 --> 03:55:12.804]  He had verbatim details of a long email that he repeated back to me essentially word for word.
[03:55:12.804 --> 03:55:13.204]  In fact...
[03:55:14.059 --> 03:55:17.382]  He was Steve Nolan, GoGo's Vice President of Communications.
[03:55:17.382 --> 03:55:34.920]  I'm sorry, that's not who listened to it, but the Vice President of Communications that provided the on-flight internet connection on the plane told him he said the service is public, it operates in the same way as most open Wi-Fi hotspots on the ground, and he cautioned him against accessing sensitive materials while in flight.
[03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:35.480]  Do you understand?
[03:55:36.041 --> 03:55:54.104]  Do you understand that as he's talking about this, he says, he was writing to Bruce Schneer, who works for the Washington Post, and he says, well, the current case is about a single iPhone 5C, but the precedent it sets will apply to all smartphones, all computers, all cars, everything in the Internet of Things.
[03:55:54.980 --> 03:55:56.521]  Now, of course it will.
[03:55:56.521 --> 03:56:00.804]  And you need to understand that the Internet of Things is not simply your phone.
[03:56:00.804 --> 03:56:02.666]  It's not simply your computer.
[03:56:02.666 --> 03:56:04.427]  It is going to be every device in your house.
[03:56:04.427 --> 03:56:06.648]  Remember when we talked about this?
[03:56:06.648 --> 03:56:14.394]  We talked about David Petraeus saying that the CIA was going to be able to listen to people's conversations using appliances in their kitchen.
[03:56:14.394 --> 03:56:17.957]  People said, you're a bunch of paranoid conspiracy theorists.
[03:56:17.957 --> 03:56:19.117]  Well, now
[03:56:19.918 --> 03:56:24.899]  This guy, who writes for USA Today, has had an awakening because he saw it happen to him.
[03:56:24.899 --> 03:56:28.381]  Remember when Michael Hastings' car crashed?
[03:56:28.381 --> 03:56:36.283]  And we said, well, you know, that's one of the easiest cars to take over control of, the Mercedes, because they have the most subsystems in their car.
[03:56:37.243 --> 03:56:39.064]  And it's been demonstrated that they could be hacked.
[03:56:39.064 --> 03:56:42.466]  And everybody said, you're a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists.
[03:56:42.466 --> 03:56:50.249]  And then we had, I think it was the guy's name was Clark, who had been the director of security for Clinton, said, no, we've done that to a number of people.
[03:56:50.249 --> 03:57:05.216]  I mean, we had a clue from the very beginning because of who he was and because of the position of the engine not being captured in a frontal collision, as would happen if he truly had died in a crash with a tree, but because the engine was at a right angle
[03:57:06.075 --> 03:57:11.522]  More than 100 feet down the road, it's like, ah, looks like it blew up and then crashed.
[03:57:11.522 --> 03:57:19.171]  And the whole idea that it was flying down the road at 100 miles an hour, that is something we all know can be done very easily.
[03:57:19.171 --> 03:57:24.257]  We all don't realize just how extensive this control grid is about to become.
[03:57:25.157 --> 03:57:32.843]  It's going to control and monitor every movement, everything we say, and it is going to constantly analyze everything we say.
[03:57:32.843 --> 03:57:46.695]  I began this hour talking with Alex about one of the things that really bothered me about Ted Cruz, and that was his incessant data mining of prospective voters so that he could feed them precisely what they wanted to hear.
[03:57:47.915 --> 03:58:00.141]  Breaking them down into a huge matrix and then putting it on a smartphone app for his volunteers to go door-to-door so he could make a contact with them just the way they wanted to be contacted.
[03:58:00.141 --> 03:58:04.043]  Understand the power of control that will be in their hands.
[03:58:04.563 --> 03:58:23.187]  When they can monitor our every movement, not only with the Internet of Things, but it's going to be vehicle to infrastructure communication, talking to all the traffic lights, talking to all the local government and police about how you're driving, charging you accordingly, and increasing your insurance rates.
[03:58:23.187 --> 03:58:26.368]  It's going to be bad in a lot of different ways.
[03:58:26.368 --> 03:58:27.028]  Join us tonight.
[03:58:27.028 --> 03:58:29.989]  Jagari Jackson will be doing the nightly news, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:29.989 --> 03:58:30.249]  Eastern.
