[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.000 --> 00:26.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank
[00:26.000 --> 00:31.760]  you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday worldwide broadcast we're gonna be here for the
[00:31.760 --> 00:38.080]  next four hours until 3 p.m. central standard time today and of course many stations rear us at
[00:38.080 --> 00:43.680]  different times but we're live right now in 11 a.m. and 45 seconds central standard time
[00:45.680 --> 00:51.280]  I think drudge report says it all we just keep going back to drudge because drudge knows how to
[00:51.280 --> 00:59.680]  just simply encapsulate the populace sentiment whether it be a photo of facebook owner and
[00:59.680 --> 01:06.880]  founder zuckerberg not wearing a artificial reality headset and marching in front of a
[01:06.880 --> 01:13.040]  crowd of a thousand of his minions wearing the goggles they're obviously being dehumanized put
[01:13.040 --> 01:23.120]  into a mass trance losing their humanity he is walking amongst the vegetables that he's growing
[01:23.120 --> 01:32.080]  in his garden then there's this image at drudgereport.com right now the nominee you've got his blonde
[01:32.080 --> 01:39.040]  hair in the back as he leans over a crowd of fawning men and women like it was a 1956
[01:39.040 --> 01:51.520]  Elvis concert and a lot of mainstream media said drudge is trolling the msm drudge saying he's the
[01:51.520 --> 02:01.520]  nominee well he's got more delegates than Mitt Romney did at this stage in 2012 in 2008 he has
[02:01.520 --> 02:12.000]  way more than of course john mccain who they were saying was the presumptive nominees both times
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.880]  with less but they still just keep saying he can't win he can't have it we want to allow it the pub
[02:16.880 --> 02:24.720]  says so obama says so and many others say so the social justice warriors control reality
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.440]  and they just tell us this is off limits and people are revolting against that
[02:29.440 --> 02:32.000]  and so he is the nominee
[02:34.400 --> 02:39.360]  barring super dirty tricks election fraud or assassination and i want to be clear i'm not
[02:39.360 --> 02:45.520]  saying they're going to kill trump the media has misrepresented that i'm saying that is definitely
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.600]  in the cards and i think everybody knows that's a very reasonable statement that trump
[02:51.600 --> 02:57.280]  for all intents and purposes as i said yesterday is on the equivalent of a suicide mission it doesn't
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.960]  mean that you're going to die it means it's one of the most dangerous missions you can carry out
[03:02.960 --> 03:09.280]  and that the death guard is in the tarot deck and i think we all need to realize the danger
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.160]  donald trump's in i've been very skeptical of trump as everybody knows over the last few years
[03:14.800 --> 03:20.000]  and even until about five six months ago but when you call for auditing the fed when you talk about
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.080]  911 truth and scare the daylights out of the establishment the clinton's and the bushes
[03:24.080 --> 03:30.320]  is when you destroy political correctness when you call for cutting taxes on poor people
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.360]  when you call for not letting china and india make bad deals that's not protectionism that's
[03:37.360 --> 03:43.440]  them making one side of deals that screw us over he's hitting the populist zeitgeist and he's
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.760]  saying everything that needs to be said and he says a few things that i think are wrong and and
[03:47.760 --> 03:56.560]  misconstrued like the whole apple passcode thing on the fbi but separate from that there's a reason
[03:56.560 --> 04:02.320]  the democrat and republican and even foreign devos type power structures scared of donald trump
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.160]  and it's because he threatens their existing system and we know their existing sims system is
[04:08.160 --> 04:17.360]  very bad is it a gamble going for trump absolutely but it is a gamble where the odds are a lot better
[04:17.360 --> 04:25.360]  than going with any of the other establishment candidates and they know he can win they know in
[04:25.360 --> 04:32.160]  major polls he beats illy right now the british odds makers uh now have him a easy winner
[04:33.520 --> 04:42.640]  just a year ago he was several hundred to one that he couldn't so you see the big change there
[04:42.640 --> 04:50.400]  we'll have the caucus numbers and more straight ahead as we look towards super tuesday now only
[04:50.400 --> 04:55.760]  six and a half days away i'm alex jones big broadcast lined up stay with us
[04:58.640 --> 05:04.640]  in addition to threatening to invade syria and al-bashar al-asad saudi arabia says it
[05:04.640 --> 05:10.000]  wants to arm jihadist in the country with anti aircraft missiles to take out russian jets we
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.280]  believe that introducing surface to air missiles in syria is going to change the balance of power
[05:15.280 --> 05:20.800]  on the ground said the saudi foreign minister he continued it will allow the moderate opposition
[05:20.800 --> 05:25.440]  to be able to neutralize the helicopters and aircraft that are dropping chemicals and have
[05:25.440 --> 05:30.400]  been carpet bombing them just like the surface to air missiles in afghanistan were able to change
[05:30.400 --> 05:35.600]  the balance of power there this has to be studied very carefully however because you don't want
[05:35.600 --> 05:41.600]  such weaponry to fall into the wrong hands even the new york times admits there are few if any
[05:41.600 --> 05:47.520]  moderate rebels fighting in syria despite this reality secretary of state john carrey and british
[05:47.520 --> 05:52.480]  prime minister david cameron continue to insist there are moderates fighting against sad you

[08:32.720 --> 08:41.760]  i don't feel no ways tired i come too far i ain't no way he's tired me oh man
[08:43.280 --> 08:53.600]  what was that is that a dog it has been reported you've made five million making speeches the
[08:53.600 --> 08:59.440]  president made more than a hundred million dollars what's difference at this point does it make what
[08:59.440 --> 09:06.800]  does that make hillary clinton to the bush family my sister in law i don't know why that's funny
[09:12.320 --> 09:18.400]  another conspiracy theory let me buddy have you always told the truth i've always tried to always
[09:18.960 --> 09:26.480]  always i will fight to reign in wall street and you know what i know how to do it we came out of the
[09:26.480 --> 09:32.240]  white house not only dead broke but in debt i remember landing under sniper fire it was supposed
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.800]  to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads
[09:36.800 --> 10:00.640]  down to get into the vehicles a little sit open up come on take it take it
[10:07.280 --> 10:13.440]  i'm hillary clinton and i approve this message the alex jones show because there is a war on
[10:13.440 --> 10:22.240]  for your mind we are going to be very busy patriots very busy truth tellers today very
[10:22.240 --> 10:28.800]  busy revolutionaries against the globalist tyranny wow there's a lot of stuff to cover here
[10:28.800 --> 10:39.360]  it is overwhelming obviously donald trump is the presumptive nominee for the republican nomination
[10:40.800 --> 10:47.920]  he's got as many delegates as reagan had at this time back in 1980 he's got way more than mit romney
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.360]  and other republican candidates of the past like john mccain have had we've got an article breaking
[10:53.360 --> 10:58.480]  down those numbers we'll get to the entire establishment is in a complete conniption fit
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.000]  against donald trump and i admit that he is an unknown quantity an unknown country
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.200]  when it comes to a political track record but what he's done the last year destroying political
[11:11.200 --> 11:19.280]  correctness lifting up a standard to promote americana and free market exposing 9 11 and criminal
[11:19.280 --> 11:25.200]  involvement of the soddies and elements of our government calling for the audit of the private
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.280]  run for private federal reserve the list goes on and on what he's done and the fact that he's so
[11:31.280 --> 11:40.400]  receptive when people corrected him about the refugee crisis he went from saying bring him in
[11:40.400 --> 11:43.520]  saying oh my gosh you didn't know there were terrorists amongst them and they weren't being
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.800]  vetted don't bring them in and when we said hey ought the private federal reserve he's like you bet
[11:51.520 --> 11:58.800]  hey come out and expose bush for 9 11 did it and i'm not bragging a lot of folks in the grass
[11:58.800 --> 12:05.680]  roots are bringing this to trump but we brought it directly to him so he's very very responsive
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.400]  he's aware of what's going on and according to people that have known him for 40 years he does
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.200]  not like the new world order and here's the deal roger stone is going to be in studio for an hour
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.720]  and a half on friday he's coming to austin to be on the show we're bringing him down here from new
[12:20.720 --> 12:28.160]  york and he's been banned from cnn as of yesterday uh for saying some of their commentators are
[12:28.160 --> 12:36.640]  dummard and dogman there which is true but really it's because he's such an effective trump supporter
[12:36.640 --> 12:43.040]  but if they can ban stone for that they can ban anything and the fact is that they say they're
[12:43.040 --> 12:48.400]  banning someone we all know that i've basically been banned from foxes cnn and i don't really care
[12:49.440 --> 12:52.400]  most of the time i wouldn't even return their phone calls back when they wanted me on all the time
[12:57.440 --> 13:01.360]  stone is compared it to you know soviet style america this is happening that's exactly what
[13:01.360 --> 13:08.400]  it is but ron paul i really respect has come out and said that he would not support trump as a gop
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.360]  nominee um paul doesn't support the other mainline republicans
[13:16.880 --> 13:21.120]  if he doesn't win the nomination the last two times he ran because he's a purist and i respect
[13:21.120 --> 13:28.080]  that from a purist if you want to know where i'm coming from i'm a purist but i'm also a military
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.520]  political strategist i've studied it i know truce the ultimate weapon that's what i stand with
[13:33.520 --> 13:36.960]  there are a lot of dirty tricks we can play we can join the dark side we don't use that
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.440]  we use the truth it's all be completely truthful with you trump's an unknown country
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.480]  he is light years better than hillary clinton bernie sanders and some of the others and the system
[13:46.480 --> 13:55.440]  scared of him and he's responsive to the people he's aggressive he's got courage and he definitely
[13:55.440 --> 14:01.040]  could have come in and suckered people for the globalist he's not doing that the things he's done
[14:01.840 --> 14:10.880]  are so devastating to them that it's irreversible much of it and he's riding a wave surfing a wave
[14:10.880 --> 14:18.320]  a very dangerous wave for all of us of massive populist anger against the system the government
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.120]  the corporations were 90 plus percent of americans believe the u.s government's the number one threat
[14:23.120 --> 14:27.280]  to them and their families and no amount of armored vehicles no amount of propaganda no
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.040]  amount of fluoride in the water no amount of brainwashing of the children in public schools
[14:32.080 --> 14:37.520]  he's going to reverse this sentiment that's only going to intensify i mean you know the
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.560]  country's in a revolution against tyranny when one of the top tv producers in the country says
[14:42.560 --> 14:47.840]  my new x file series isn't really going to be aliens it's going to be government conspiracies
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.280]  eugenics and the material alex jones covers we get our material and research from alex jones and
[14:53.280 --> 15:01.440]  info wars that shows that by the time mainstream has picked up on what we've done and where we
[15:02.400 --> 15:11.440]  are going we're already light years past it and info wars is only one small part of a larger
[15:11.440 --> 15:22.400]  constellation or fleet of resistance and it's exponentially growing if if people think the
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.480]  singularity of awakening is already hot and already explosive and already seismic and already
[15:28.480 --> 15:36.080]  electric and already colossal and magical and and and growing explosively understand this is only
[15:36.080 --> 15:43.200]  the detonation you're seeing not the explosion just like you got a howitzer round you're putting in a
[15:43.200 --> 15:53.360]  big field piece artillery and you've got that little cap on the back that maybe is the amount of
[15:53.360 --> 16:03.520]  gunpowder that you could put in a nickel but the pin hits it it explodes detonating all the powder
[16:03.520 --> 16:10.640]  in front of it and firing the munition out the tube and what you've seen so far is the detonation
[16:10.640 --> 16:22.080]  of the cap but now in slow motion the charge is exploding and driving the munition down the barrel
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.320]  so that's what everybody sees it's what you feel it's the globalist running around like chickens
[16:30.320 --> 16:39.920]  with their heads cut off panicking like it's a ship on fire they're all trying to pass buckets
[16:39.920 --> 16:43.440]  of water along to each other but they're in fighting some are jumping overboard and escaping
[16:44.480 --> 16:50.880]  all the disarray you see is failure by the system and all their bravada attempts are nothing but
[16:50.880 --> 16:56.320]  attempts they have to survive just like Hillary Clinton needs to fail forward and become president
[16:56.320 --> 17:00.960]  to give herself a pardon or hope obama gives her one and to keep everybody blackmailed in line
[17:00.960 --> 17:07.040]  the whole new world order has to get more power and get in full control because they're a cornered
[17:07.040 --> 17:16.640]  creature they were too greedy they pushed too hard they dug too deeply and awaken things older than
[17:16.640 --> 17:29.200]  them like human survival and human destiny and all of our ancestors will genetically transmitted
[17:29.200 --> 17:37.840]  through us like electricity you understand you touch your oldest ancestor through the genetic
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.200]  line of each parent before you who physically came out of the womb and out of the genetics of the
[17:43.200 --> 17:49.280]  last person you are physically connected to your most ancient ancestors you you live on
[17:49.280 --> 17:55.120]  through them they live on through you and that's not spiritual that is genetic but once you study
[17:55.120 --> 18:02.560]  the genetics you then notice the spiritual because that's only the cherry on top and the system knows
[18:02.560 --> 18:11.120]  this they are scared to death of it and they want to suppress it and so trump is a manifestation
[18:11.120 --> 18:19.600]  of the human will to suck air into its lungs and to be strong and healthy to be strong and free
[18:22.320 --> 18:25.680]  i have a political correct stack here today that is the worst i've ever seen
[18:26.480 --> 18:31.200]  the level of brainwashing is unprecedented but first we're going to trump what happened in the
[18:31.200 --> 18:35.200]  caucus we're going to the latest with hillary judge orders discovery to go forward over clinton
[18:35.200 --> 18:41.520]  private email server uh we've got black lives matter just engaged in their normal horrible
[18:41.520 --> 18:51.760]  activities because they're sorrows run and we've got g.o.p judiciary no hearing on obama
[18:51.760 --> 18:57.600]  court nominee that will force obama to try some emergency appointment which he can't even do either
[18:58.640 --> 19:02.720]  not for the supreme court unless there's quote a civil emergency so look for that we're going to
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.000]  find out real quick if they killed scalia or not if they go around the constitution like they've
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.720]  been doing at unprecedented levels then we know russia takes concrete steps towards syria ceasefire
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.120]  turkey continues shelling speaking of artillery rounds ministry of defense reports you may not
[19:21.120 --> 19:27.680]  care about rick perry but this is important texas court dismisses second felony charge against
[19:27.680 --> 19:33.200]  former governor rick perry who did nothing he should have gotten an award for what he did
[19:34.000 --> 19:41.520]  he has the veto power it's a state funded bill to give money to quote ethics boards over over
[19:41.520 --> 19:46.960]  counties and have an ethics officer and the county attorney that got caught drunk falling
[19:46.960 --> 19:50.880]  down all over the street and everything and spitting on police he said no i'm vetoing travis
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.520]  county getting that money until you remove her they indicted him just like they've indicted the
[19:55.520 --> 20:02.080]  attorney general they're going after republicans folks i'm just a sweet old lady who needs help

[24:23.840 --> 24:29.120]  and donald trump is the cult of personality is he a dictator in the making well we already
[24:29.120 --> 24:34.320]  have a dictatorship of the executive and the private federal reserve run by an oligarchy of
[24:34.320 --> 24:41.840]  offshore banks so i'm not hoping for a dictator to block him i'm hoping for an americana man of
[24:41.840 --> 24:49.360]  strength to rally the people to kick the offshore globalist out of here and at least not let them
[24:49.360 --> 24:56.400]  bankrupt the country so they can consolidate and buy it all up and if we have a debate about that if
[24:56.400 --> 25:01.120]  we have a discussion about that if we have a discussion about the tpp taking over our sovereignty
[25:01.120 --> 25:07.920]  with the eu in these secret treaties which are being negotiated right now you won't be able to have
[25:07.920 --> 25:15.520]  it because it's so flagrantly illegal it's so flagrantly conquest we really are an occupied
[25:15.520 --> 25:22.080]  nation we really are under soviet style brainwashing that our government's using nothing to do with
[25:22.080 --> 25:29.680]  the russians we really are in deep trouble they really are coming after us and i'm not going to
[25:29.680 --> 25:35.920]  digress on this too long because i don't want to bash glenn beck but he's going after donald trump
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.840]  and he admits he's lost a lot of his audience overdoing it i think glenn beck does a lot of good
[25:43.840 --> 25:51.840]  stuff he's done a lot of good work but i saw the headlines last night this morning glenn beck saying
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.880]  donald trump supporters are like brown shirts they came and bullied us and then i went and watched raw
[25:56.880 --> 26:01.360]  footage this morning spent about 30 minutes researching it and donald trump said yesterday
[26:01.360 --> 26:05.600]  morning i'm going to go to every caucus site because there they let you speak they have speakers
[26:06.560 --> 26:12.880]  it's very open so he went and visited every caucus site and then he went and spent like 15
[26:12.880 --> 26:18.320]  minutes there like he did everywhere else went to the door came in everybody ran from beck to see
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.920]  donald trump and then beck got up on stage and like threw a fit the video is just incredible
[26:23.920 --> 26:27.360]  i mean what do you expect i'd have said hey donald come on up here
[26:31.360 --> 26:37.040]  there's salon donald trump spectacularly trolls glenn beck crashes his proted cruise
[26:37.040 --> 26:41.680]  nevada caucus speech live on air that's what everyone keeps saying
[26:43.920 --> 26:50.800]  just like they say in the news drudge trolled the media saying the nominee no he didn't
[26:50.800 --> 26:57.600]  they were saying that mitt romney and john mccain with the presumptive nominees by this point in the
[26:57.600 --> 27:04.240]  election in 2012 and 2008 drudge has an article trump has won more voters than romney at this
[27:04.240 --> 27:09.280]  point 2012 and many more than mccainan 08 and is basically in a dead heat with ronald reagan
[27:10.400 --> 27:15.920]  he is the guy that can win in all the polls he's the guy that can defeat hillary he's got
[27:15.920 --> 27:22.880]  democrats and record numbers crossing over we told you this get ready for this
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.640]  he got basically as many hispanic voters percentage wise as hillary
[27:33.280 --> 27:40.800]  did in nevada and that's in the stack 45 percent of hispanics voted for him
[27:40.800 --> 27:49.600]  that are voting in the caucus that is just incredible well i've always found i mean they
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.800]  had a gallup poll a year ago where it was something like 78 percent they had another one 67 percent
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.760]  and another scientific polling was mason dixon of hispanic americans people that are american
[27:59.760 --> 28:05.200]  citizens said yeah we don't want totally open borders yeah yeah have you been down to mexico
[28:05.200 --> 28:10.960]  you've been to nicaragua el salvador glada mala they got borders too it's dangerous it's scary
[28:11.920 --> 28:17.440]  it's third world yeah we can't just have unlimited people here who have no background
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.160]  or criminals if somebody wants to come here and has got a good record and can get a job bring them
[28:22.160 --> 28:27.360]  i'm all for bringing in people to work i don't care where you're from but don't bring in you know
[28:27.360 --> 28:32.480]  300 000 jihadis last year or over in europe it's it's you know four five million
[28:32.480 --> 28:40.640]  it's crazy you just can't do it as taxpayers everybody comes here and gets free stuff so
[28:40.640 --> 28:45.680]  they're really trying to demonize trump drudge report on nevada landslide donald trump the nominee
[28:47.760 --> 28:55.760]  nevada presidential caucus results donald trump 45.9 percent and he got 45 percent
[28:55.760 --> 29:00.560]  of hispanic vote boom see just like the general public just like black people or white people
[29:00.560 --> 29:05.920]  and we're seeing 20 shifts in blacks towards trump which you never see for republican candidates
[29:07.040 --> 29:10.720]  because he'll actually go to those communities and say i'm gonna try to develop jobs and i'm
[29:10.720 --> 29:15.680]  gonna try to cut taxes for you obama doesn't even go to black neighborhoods in fact they've
[29:15.680 --> 29:21.600]  had articles that he is the president with the least number of visits to black communities
[29:21.600 --> 29:26.240]  since the 30s i mean it is he just totally ignores the black community because he thinks
[29:26.240 --> 29:34.480]  he's got you he thinks he doesn't owe you anything ben carson claims obama was raised white doesn't
[29:34.480 --> 29:40.160]  understand black americans and that's the word from insiders obama is uncomfortable around black people
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.520]  i'm telling you the guy has got a silver spoon in his mouth his whole life all right we'll be

[33:46.240 --> 33:50.240]  who've tried to organize the world to where they can never be overthrown
[33:52.560 --> 34:00.240]  and to teach us that we don't have any power the truth is the minute we realize that we can
[34:00.240 --> 34:06.080]  study how the world really works that we can organize together and build a system based on free will

[34:58.720 --> 35:03.440]  all right let's start plowing into the news i want to run through a lot of it we got a big
[35:03.440 --> 35:10.800]  special report that took us months to basically put together we even went to roam to document this
[35:10.800 --> 35:15.680]  last year it's part of the reason i went there and it ties into a whole bunch of different issues
[35:15.680 --> 35:20.400]  and it again proves donald trump right yet again so we're going to have that special report uh
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.720]  premiere here in just a moment donald trump proven right about vatican having the biggest
[35:24.720 --> 35:30.080]  walls in the world they have the new york times and about a thousand other publications you can
[35:30.080 --> 35:36.480]  type in the term and look come out the day after donald trump started tweeting photos last week
[35:37.520 --> 35:43.520]  last friday saying that uh the pope has his own big walls the new york times came out and said
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.720]  there are not walls there's some decorative walls by part of it but it doesn't have any security
[35:48.720 --> 35:54.480]  and it's wide open that's like saying submarines have screen doors on them it is a complete
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.760]  total lie of course we're going to be getting to that in a moment but see that's how dumb they
[35:59.760 --> 36:07.200]  think you are there is a square that has its own big walls that goes into the vatican so you can
[36:07.200 --> 36:13.600]  feel like you're in it shake like a big diamond but then you go in there's a little circular area
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.760]  and that's what they've got the big obelisk and the rest of it those are walls with 50 foot steel
[36:19.760 --> 36:27.840]  doors and guards with machine guns boy i mean we had a wall like that i tell you by the way i'm
[36:27.840 --> 36:34.000]  against a wall like that because that'd be to keep us inside they're to use the the border control
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.360]  system to keep us in everybody else is allowed to come in like roaches into a roach motel
[36:39.360 --> 36:44.160]  and me he goes oh you're calling the illegals roaches no we're already in the motel stuck in
[36:44.160 --> 36:50.480]  the slime i'm saying the old ad back in the 70s roaches come in or roaches check in they don't
[36:50.480 --> 36:58.640]  check out can we go to youtube and see if there's a roach motel ad i saw some article a few weeks ago
[36:58.640 --> 37:05.680]  was like jones is saying that trump has the ace of spades what's that mean spades like he's gonna
[37:06.320 --> 37:13.120]  do something to obama that obama is a spade i mean it's just crazy how they assault the language
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.480]  and turn everything into racism and i got a big stack on that coming up in a moment but
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.600]  i want to get into the nominee he is the nominee now they're telling you he couldn't be the nominee
[37:23.600 --> 37:28.400]  they're telling you he still isn't that's mind control he is the presumptive nominee he's who
[37:28.400 --> 37:34.000]  the people keep choosing exactly because the mainstream media attacked him what did i tell
[37:35.280 --> 37:39.440]  ran paul when he got elected to the senate and he came on our show and thanked us all and said oh
[37:39.440 --> 37:43.600]  and i said you got elected because the system came after you and because you're seen as an outsider
[37:43.600 --> 37:48.880]  i said if you cozy up with these folks and try to be nice to them even if you in reality fight them
[37:49.440 --> 37:55.280]  your rhetoric needs to be anti-establishment this is the season of revolution and politico says
[37:55.280 --> 37:59.200]  why do you win in such a landslide well you know blah blah blah you know he admits that
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.800]  you spurred him to run for the senate and advised him to a certain extent
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.040]  and i said well you need to endorse ran paul to destroy him you're out of bullets that was four
[38:09.040 --> 38:19.120]  years ago five years ago and ran paul listened to his politicos not his dad and i'm not knocking
[38:19.120 --> 38:23.600]  ran paul but by the time he came on here it was too little too late we didn't call paul's people
[38:23.600 --> 38:27.840]  they wanted to come on here that's fine i'm not going to call up to arrogant little politico snot
[38:27.840 --> 38:31.440]  knows you know 30 year olds that think they know everything and you know went and got a degree and
[38:31.440 --> 38:34.880]  went and worked for somebody and they got another political job don't know how to wipe their own
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.840]  butts telling me how politics really works let me explain something i'm not going the normal
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.520]  political route to change america i'm changing the entire landscape
[38:47.120 --> 38:50.560]  i'm trying to teach people they have power not being in the system and
[38:50.560 --> 38:58.080]  and resurrecting what made us great true liberty when i'm promoting is nothing new it's what made
[38:58.080 --> 39:02.160]  england great it's what made europe great in the renaissance is what made america great
[39:02.160 --> 39:08.000]  i've read what the founders said i've read the famous philosophers all i'm bringing you
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.120]  is what built the modern world i didn't discover all this people like how does this guy know all
[39:13.120 --> 39:17.120]  this the things he says the predictions he makes the how does he know how does he
[39:17.120 --> 39:24.160]  see everybody already knew all this that's why we're in such good shape you can learn
[39:24.160 --> 39:27.840]  how it all works and i know most are listeners do but i'm talking to new listeners
[39:31.600 --> 39:36.960]  of course you feel like you're a vegetable watching tv all day and eating gmo and shuffling
[39:36.960 --> 39:43.920]  around under fluorescent lights feel the water feel the air get outside breathe in reality
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.320]  before it's all gone before they brainwash us into submission i'm paraphrasing a powerful
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.800]  tweeted rudge two days ago you guys pull that tweet up where he said get out you know feel the air
[39:52.800 --> 39:58.000]  feel the water because they want to force us into this matrix this is where they're going
[39:59.040 --> 40:05.360]  they admit it and what happens when a roger stone who i met like 10 years ago at a jfk event in
[40:05.360 --> 40:11.360]  dalis i knew he was a big-time republican operative from the past nixon reagan you name it bush senior
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.760]  you know willy horton adds the whole nine yards and he wasn't only behind that but he got blamed
[40:15.760 --> 40:21.280]  for it i mean he's high-powered and then richard said i don't have roger stone come down i was
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.280]  like yeah that is i know he was trump's former head of his campaign and then he's here and i
[40:25.280 --> 40:30.320]  started clicking so i saw him again at the 40th anniversary of jfk up in up in dalis and talked to
[40:30.320 --> 40:36.080]  him he's written all these best-selling books about the government the cia and killing kennedy
[40:36.080 --> 40:42.960]  and the new world order in the last 20 years he's been telling the truth as long as i've been on air
[40:43.680 --> 40:50.480]  and this is like one of trump's best friends of 40 years and that's the word trump used to hear
[40:50.480 --> 40:54.320]  all this from stone and knew about a lot of it was like ah whatever it'll be all right and then
[40:54.320 --> 40:59.200]  trump figured out no they really are going to kill america and said well i'll take these traders on
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.840]  and i was told this before it was in politico that he said well i'll take on these politicians
[41:03.840 --> 41:07.920]  and traders and these foreign billionaires that have bought them i'm not going to let him do that
[41:08.720 --> 41:14.240]  and it he is an egomaniac he is on a power trip and stone go looks hide he goes and he's the
[41:14.240 --> 41:22.160]  egomaniac we need we need him he and you know he's he's willing to do it and i'm just telling you
[41:22.160 --> 41:26.240]  the inside baseball it's not a secret so folks can know that i'm sitting there you know watching
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.400]  this unfold and already thinking well we got to go with trump he's our only hope anyways we're
[41:30.400 --> 41:34.640]  going to go for a presidential run the real hopes of the state and federal level through the states
[41:36.240 --> 41:42.400]  but it's just amazing to see all this unfolding this is epic this is not a person sitting in the
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.040]  house right now if you're not on your feet and then trying to get in the arena you're crazy
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.280]  now before i go any further speaking of getting in the arena we sell game changing products like
[41:53.280 --> 41:59.440]  survival shield nasa and iodine x2 that changed my life i was obviously even though i was taking
[41:59.440 --> 42:05.120]  some good multi vitamins and stuff deficient in true iodine i call it true iodine because most
[42:05.120 --> 42:09.920]  iodine is bound to something else even if they call it nascent it doesn't turn electric blue purple
[42:09.920 --> 42:15.360]  on paper when you put it on paper it turns red because it's bound to things out of the ocean
[42:15.360 --> 42:23.040]  where it comes from like iron and other things and iodine is very reactive so it takes on things
[42:23.040 --> 42:30.400]  around it basically oxidizes we get it the only source deep earth purple crystals from 7 to 12
[42:30.400 --> 42:37.440]  thousand feet down this is what's amazing about it and then we've shown you the videos of at the
[42:37.440 --> 42:43.600]  laboratory where you put it in a petri dish and put it on top of a hot plate at even 100 degrees
[42:43.600 --> 42:49.840]  and it turns purple gas by the way it's super you know poisonous at that level then it's injected
[42:49.840 --> 42:56.640]  into organic palm oil in a patent of a proprietary system and you take this within three weeks folks
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.920]  stuff started pouring out of my pores coming out of me other ways i felt sick for about a week
[43:03.120 --> 43:08.800]  and then all of a sudden i like it to carry one of my kids up you know a big hill or a mountain
[43:08.800 --> 43:11.200]  i don't know that many times when we're climbing a mountain you know and i carry them for half
[43:11.200 --> 43:14.880]  mile and put them back down when they're three four years old even when they're that big you
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.160]  start carrying them on your shoulders and what's fun about it is when you take them off your
[43:18.160 --> 43:23.360]  shoulders suddenly climbing the next half mile the mountain feels like you're flying
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.040]  and then i'll put one of the kids back on my shoulders when they were little so i miss having
[43:27.040 --> 43:34.160]  little ones and that's what i like an x2 to you take it two three four weeks depends on the person
[43:34.160 --> 43:38.000]  and then it's just all of a sudden you wake up one morning and it's like that cold breeze
[43:38.960 --> 43:42.080]  in the spring when you walk outside you know in your back portion your underwear or whatever and
[43:42.080 --> 43:45.360]  you feel invigorated and it feels like all this weight's been taken off your shoulders i don't
[43:45.360 --> 43:51.200]  know how to describe it but it's dramatic it is dramatic just the bound iodine
[43:52.160 --> 43:57.360]  in studies in fact google this iq's raised by 15 points after iodine was added to salt
[43:57.360 --> 44:02.320]  just search engine it's a business insider article comes up first now we're not going to make those
[44:02.320 --> 44:05.840]  claims here we're just going to show you the business insider if you're deficient in iodine
[44:05.840 --> 44:09.600]  it's one of the most important things you need and they tell you you need just a tiny amount of it
[44:09.600 --> 44:16.000]  well whatever consult your physician it varies person to person if you're you know if your
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.320]  thyroid's already really screwed up or something who knows you know there could be some problems
[44:20.320 --> 44:24.720]  once you start taking iodine nothing's perfect in this world so you know use it your own risk
[44:25.280 --> 44:29.600]  it is rated as safe and you know FDA grass certified and all that meaning it's seen as a safe
[44:30.400 --> 44:36.240]  nutraceutical a safe supplement but if you've got other problems you know take it slowly be
[44:36.240 --> 44:42.640]  careful because it's hard core just like if you had on a boat for six months with no oranges
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.120]  or no vitamin c you get some all of a sudden your wounds are going to close your teeth aren't
[44:47.120 --> 44:51.680]  going to fall out you're going to be able to walk around and you're about to die it's the same deal

[46:13.200 --> 46:23.760]  edition as well m4store.com okay let me now before i get into the political correctness
[46:23.760 --> 46:30.080]  stack let me just read through what i've already mentioned but not gotten into details on the
[46:30.080 --> 46:35.120]  the donald trump stack dr just saying he's the presumptive nominee that's not trolling the media
[46:35.120 --> 46:48.480]  that's a fact um trump got 59 i mean 50 having 40 slips here 45.9 percent 45.9 percent uh or
[46:48.480 --> 46:58.880]  double his closest rival at 23.9 marco rubio ted cruz got 21.4 ben karson 4.8 kasek 3.6
[46:58.880 --> 47:08.400]  and of course ron paul still on the ballot there 0.1 jeb bush 0.1 uh chris christy 0.1 and furena 0
[47:13.680 --> 47:18.880]  then we've got uh this next report here again this is um dealing with the fact that british
[47:18.880 --> 47:27.280]  bookmakers slash odds of trump taking republican nomination british bookmakers on wednesday slash
[47:27.280 --> 47:31.840]  the odds of businessman donald trump winning republican nomination to run the us presidency
[47:31.840 --> 47:37.280]  after his latest victory in the nevada caucus his trump once considered a rank outsider of odds of
[47:37.280 --> 47:46.400]  201 is now the firm favorite after his latest decision and his latest decisive win his third
[47:46.400 --> 47:55.200]  out of four in the early nominating contest the british bookmaker said mr trump has triumphed yet
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.040]  again despite political analyst almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender
[48:01.040 --> 48:07.920]  writes graham sharp of william hill adding that one customer stood to collect at least
[48:07.920 --> 48:14.400]  $100,000 as trump was ultimately elected to the white house with those bets already placed
[48:15.200 --> 48:22.160]  this is the fall of the political trader class the pundits the minions the liars that would
[48:22.160 --> 48:28.560]  unify lie and put out false reports to create a gaslighting effect where people thought they were
[48:28.560 --> 48:36.080]  dreaming and would just not follow their mind not follow their intellect not follow their gut
[48:36.080 --> 48:41.200]  not follow their spirit not follow their ears their eyes their taste their touch their smell
[48:41.200 --> 48:45.920]  ignore all the senses the good lord gave you and just keep going along with bold
[48:45.920 --> 48:52.560]  and i'm proud that it's libertarians and republicans that are rolling the dice
[48:54.080 --> 48:59.280]  fortune favors the bold and not sitting back and being perfect pundits on the other side
[48:59.280 --> 49:04.400]  and getting behind trump because the system's scared to death of them for a reason and it may
[49:04.400 --> 49:09.840]  turn out horribly bad folks but you got to take risk in this life when you get down to the wire like
[49:09.840 --> 49:20.240]  this and the intel i've got directly from the trump operation is he was aware of the new world order
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.080]  has really immersed himself in it and he thinks he can save america and defeat the globalist
[49:27.280 --> 49:32.400]  maybe he just wants to unseat them and be king and then make deals with the globalist overseas
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.040]  just to get hundreds of billions when he's already got you know seven eight billion but but trump
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.680]  says he doesn't want that he's committed he wants to really change the world and that's much more
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.320]  alluring to me than selling out and getting billions of dollars who cares once you got a
[49:46.320 --> 49:52.000]  decent house and a car that's decent and your kids are taken care of i wouldn't sell out of my kids
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.120]  were starving to death i mean i'm sorry it's just not how i am but sell out just so you're a billion
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.080]  dollar baby you fly around on private jets i've already done that rich people i know it gets pretty
[50:02.080 --> 50:09.760]  boring i mean it's okay but it's about as good as it gets women i already had that before i was out
[50:09.760 --> 50:13.920]  of high school and college and you know i'm not bragging about it but i just it just kind of gets
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.480]  old at a certain point i don't mean women get old but i mean chasing it around making it god
[50:19.200 --> 50:24.640]  it's all about family folks you you you transcend all this stuff and i think donald trump's matured
[50:24.640 --> 50:28.800]  a lot i think he's grown a lot just like lucifer con said to me i've grown a lot i've matured a lot
[50:28.800 --> 50:34.560]  thanks to your show and i'm not bragging but foreign heads of state donald trump people like
[50:34.560 --> 50:41.840]  lucifer con so diverse japanese vice president german defense intelligence head cy hirsch matt
[50:41.840 --> 50:48.800]  drudge all these big hollywood people they listen chris carter a lot of names i can't even tell you
[50:50.720 --> 50:54.960]  we've got popping in for 15 minutes larry nickles coming on at the bottom of the next hour
[50:54.960 --> 51:02.720]  he did talk to the supreme court justice and he's not going to tell us what the supreme court
[51:02.720 --> 51:07.680]  justice said because the supreme court justice doesn't want it repeated but there is going to
[51:07.680 --> 51:16.640]  be an investigation that's like cheney said no comment on scalia there is an investigation
[51:16.640 --> 51:21.120]  going on at the highest levels that's what i've been told and we'll see how much nickles is
[51:21.120 --> 51:25.280]  going to say because this is how this works he wants to tell me during a break all the everything's
[51:25.280 --> 51:30.080]  tapped around here a b i don't let anyone tell me something that dangerous that isn't public
[51:30.080 --> 51:34.880]  that's another reason i'm still not pushing daisies i'm not stupid uh and let me tell you
[51:34.880 --> 51:40.640]  nickles is for real that's coming up we'll see what we can get out of him uh but he's battling
[51:42.960 --> 51:47.920]  what they say is late stage cancer and i just hope it doesn't go with into his grave so pray for him
[51:47.920 --> 51:58.800]  enter its polls trump dominated latino votes in novada he got 45 percent of latinos who participated
[51:58.800 --> 52:04.160]  republican caucuses it's pretty big isn't it daily caller and it goes over all the scientific
[52:04.160 --> 52:08.720]  numbers on that just like he's getting massive numbers of african americans to vote for him
[52:08.720 --> 52:14.800]  and saying they will roger stone seeing and ban me on the orders of hillary clinton we're going to
[52:14.800 --> 52:18.080]  be talking to him friday and studio about that and i already mentioned this i'm not going to
[52:18.080 --> 52:22.160]  spend more time on it but look at this photo of beck and there's video of it pouting and looking
[52:22.160 --> 52:29.360]  on at trump you you have people all over these events in new york dc vegas wherever they have
[52:29.360 --> 52:37.680]  caucuses or rncs or dncs events and mainstream media is so entitled that i've been in new york in
[52:37.680 --> 52:44.240]  places and actually had fox and cnn and msnbc on video before come over and say oh you can't
[52:44.240 --> 52:50.160]  set up here on the street and have a camera shot towards us we own all this this was at a
[52:50.160 --> 52:54.240]  caucusing point they're allowed to have media outside trump said i'm going to visit every
[52:54.240 --> 53:00.720]  caucusing area in vegas and around vegas today he went to more than 16 of them and he was there
[53:00.720 --> 53:07.120]  for less than 20 minutes showed up took over everybody ran over to him and beck called his
[53:07.120 --> 53:14.560]  supporters brownshirts he's just so that's what i've been told by everybody that knows him he's so entitled he
[53:14.560 --> 53:19.680]  thinks he's a messiah that's why most of his top staff have quit and i don't want beck to go under
[53:20.640 --> 53:25.040]  i want him to humble himself in reality not act like he's humble in front of his viewers
[53:26.480 --> 53:27.680]  and i'm done talking about it
[53:30.640 --> 53:35.120]  and i like ted cruise overall even though he's done some dirty tricks i he's got a good voting
[53:35.120 --> 53:39.680]  record and i just hate seeing the republicans all fight with each other then you just go ahead
[53:39.680 --> 53:45.200]  after super tuesday when trump dominates then you just get behind trump that that's what i mean
[53:45.200 --> 53:51.920]  because we got hillary to deal with okay now i want to go to this report that rob doom uh
[53:51.920 --> 53:56.800]  and rob jackson and i came in here on saturday in shot and then we worked on it until last night
[53:56.800 --> 54:00.800]  it aired on the nightly news the video's now gone up on info wars dot com we're going to tweet it
[54:00.800 --> 54:06.560]  it and it's proof that donald trump is right indeed ladies and gentlemen donald trump is right
[54:08.320 --> 54:12.640]  the vatican does have the biggest walls in the world this is a big deal this video needs to go viral
[54:12.640 --> 54:16.880]  to counter the uh the pope's uh disinformation here it is
[54:16.880 --> 54:33.760]  and then a person who thinks that only about building walls whoever they may be and not building bridges
[54:33.760 --> 54:39.360]  is not going to heaven and again we have hd video we shot in roam of the biggest walls in the world
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.760]  christian i say this man is not a christian
[54:52.240 --> 54:58.480]  and i'm upon well maybe uh i continue to believe mr trump will not be present
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.960]  the establishment is definitely afraid of donald trump never before have we seen the same week a
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.480]  us sitting president and the biggest christian religious leader in the world with over a billion
[55:12.480 --> 55:19.040]  followers criticize a presidential candidate and the way they've misrepresented what donald j
[55:19.040 --> 55:25.840]  trump stands for really shows you that he is the outsider anti-establishment candidate but just when
[55:25.840 --> 55:32.000]  i thought i'd seen it all it happened since last year when the pope started calling for us to open
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.720]  our borders up and started saying that we were racist and evil for not doing it i pointed out
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.320]  that even the new york times admits mexico has one of the strictest southern borders with guatemala
[55:42.320 --> 55:48.640]  in the world and upwards of a year in prison forced labor if they catch you trying to sneak in
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.640]  so i said why do we have to be wide open and then once people get here put them on welfare
[55:54.640 --> 56:00.400]  and make them collectivist bernie sanders voters and then when i traveled to roam last year and
[56:00.400 --> 56:08.960]  actually saw the 200 foot plus walls on average over 90 feet it blew me away around vatican city
[56:08.960 --> 56:16.640]  which they say themselves in the turds is the oldest sovereign nation tax exempt above the law
[56:16.640 --> 56:25.520]  in the world and we pointed out it has arm guards the swiss guards its own protective details a few
[56:25.520 --> 56:31.920]  hundred yards in front of it is a huge armored fortress castle that also protects it and is where
[56:31.920 --> 56:37.440]  the swiss guards stay and all we were saying is hey mexico has borders hey other countries have
[56:37.440 --> 56:42.960]  borders shawty arabia hasn't taken one muslim refugee from syria but wants us to take more
[56:43.520 --> 56:49.200]  and the pope doesn't criticize idly controlling its borders the pope doesn't you know say get rid
[56:49.200 --> 56:56.720]  of their walls and how did the new york times and countless other papers respond hey people
[56:56.720 --> 57:03.920]  you're wrong again it is in a walled city and they pointed out that there's an open square
[57:03.920 --> 57:09.760]  the walls cut in there's a big open square with the famous obelisk brought there from egypt
[57:09.760 --> 57:15.280]  and that you can come there and basically uh worship the pope or whatever i've been there
[57:15.280 --> 57:23.600]  there i've seen it it's giant walls with huge 50 foot iron doors and armed guards it's just
[57:23.600 --> 57:30.160]  a concave area that lets you come in but you're still without the walls so it gives you that
[57:30.160 --> 57:35.280]  feeling of being in it but you're not and that's how they deceive you so let's look at this map
[57:35.280 --> 57:43.200]  for ourselves the only area open is this square to the rest of rome open to the sovereign city
[57:43.200 --> 57:51.200]  of the vatican vatican city to the public but when you then look here this is all an
[57:51.200 --> 57:57.920]  internal wall and there are giant iron doors 50 feet tall before you enter the actual church
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.640]  and then there are giant walls that have been there since the 800s when the muslims invaded
[58:02.640 --> 58:08.560]  hundreds of times but what they do is they deceive people and say look donald trump's people put out
[58:08.560 --> 58:17.280]  this map online showing the walls and then they show the wall out here which you see is open to the
[58:17.280 --> 58:22.400]  public to come in to the gates of the walls feel like they're inside the church but they're not
[58:22.400 --> 58:28.960]  it's a holding area open these are walls just decorative big steel doors armed guards the
[58:28.960 --> 58:33.520]  pope comes out on the balcony and talks to people we'll be back in the rest of it stay with us back

[58:38.720 --> 58:45.680]  walls and then behind that there's other big walls but it has a public receiving area in the front

[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:07.680]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.640]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network if you go to info wars dot com you can see the
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:21.120]  eight minute video report posted there that proves donald trump is right about the biggest
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.800]  thickest walls in the world being at vatican city the article trumps right about vatican walls
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:34.400]  and why the pope and his attack isn't working very important video to get out to americans
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.240]  catholics in general catholics in my experience are great people they're really upset about this
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:45.200]  guy uh i mean i'm sure pope john paul the second would say who is this you know vi lennon and he's
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.840]  such a hypocrite live behind these big walls and he's all for you you sovereignty and everything
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:55.040]  but then he wants our borders here open it's truly ridiculous and then coming up larry nickles i want
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.840]  that supreme court justice told him about scalia these are walls just decorative big steel doors
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.880]  armed guards the pope comes out on the balcony and talks to people then at night they have big
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.760]  steel fences they put up and close off and you try to even approach it police cars pull up
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.960]  like when we were there but but this is an internal area for folks to come in but it's within the
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.440]  walls as you can see this is open so the map they put out had this mistake but they're saying oh
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.440]  there are no walls no there are huge walls and steel doors and it continues here as you enter
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:36.560]  the church and other areas huge line sometimes 10 hours we experience it to get inside of this most
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.480]  famous of all walled cities that claims it's the oldest sovereign state in the world doesn't pay taxes
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:48.400]  doesn't take immigrants in does whatever it wants but is lecturing us and now in the new york times
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:55.600]  and everywhere else lying to the public so people are now spinning this saying okay you got us vatican
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.040]  vatican is controlled you can't just walk into it there are checkpoints there are big walls
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.200]  there are draw bridges and steel gates you're right it's a big armored fortress a castle
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.400]  one of the biggest in the world you're correct but it was biblical times it was back a long time
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:18.640]  ago the more things change the more they stay the same it wasn't in biblical times it was in the
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:28.240]  600 700s and 800s that almost all of italy was overrun except for vatican city and thank god they
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:34.240]  had 200 foot walls because they were able to withstand the takeover and so when the radical
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.800]  muslims got kicked out which wasn't the radical muslims it was mainline muslims they were able
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.840]  to reconstitute some form of western civilization you say what you want about the vatican but they
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.760]  did keep a lot of the secrets developed in western culture that were lost when the vizagoth germans
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:58.400]  came in and took over rome previously then later a thousand years later or so you see the muslims
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.920]  coming in so you can go back to the entire history of what rome has gone through whether it was
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.920]  alaric sacking rome in 410 or whether it was the muslims sacking it over and over again it was
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:17.760]  the biggest walls in the world that allowed any of christianity to remain and exist that
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.200]  wasn't overrun by the islamicist and no wonder this new pope that wants us to take all these radical
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:29.360]  islamicists into europe and into the us wants us to get rid of our walls but not his walls i know
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.960]  that donald trump follows info or some and i would like to encourage him to double down he's got a
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.920]  great private jet to jump on it to fly over to italy and to go up there with a camera crew
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.600]  and point out that the walls are there and to try to go walk right through the front entrance
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:54.560]  at those big 50-foot steel doors and have them turn him away and just in their face document
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.400]  that he told the truth and he pointed out the common sense it's okay for all these other
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.600]  countries to have borders and to have fences we even pay in iraq and afghanistan to build them
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:12.560]  walls and fences but we can't control our sovereignty if you don't have borders then
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.520]  you're not even citizens if anybody can just walk in and get everything for free that makes
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:23.120]  citizens slaves of the folks that have come in they pitch it like it's racist not to take unlimited
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.160]  people in from the world and then give them a free ride this is the ultimate political correctness
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.680]  syop and the fact that donald trump standing up against it is the reason i'm supporting him 110

[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.640]  party elite that support rubio they believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.080]  and still win but rubio is a little smarter he realizes that his support for illegal immigration
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.640]  with a gang of eight was a betrayal of the voters but he still thinks they're too stupid to see
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:43.040]  through the lives he's called bright bar a conspiracy website and the president of the

[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.840]  former top plenton cider will be joining us larry nickles at the bottom of the hour
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.800]  he was able to talk to a sitting supreme court justice u.s supreme court who was obviously friends
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:33.520]  with khalia isn't hard to guess who and uh that person does not want what he told nickles public
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.880]  but that just this there is an investigation uh going on indus khalia's death and i'll try to find
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:45.360]  out as much as we can when he pops in uh to join us but it is looking bad it is it is leaning towards
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:51.520]  foul play according to nickles and some of the connections of some of the people down there
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.880]  to um iran contra things like that so it's it's just always the same story over and over and over
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.080]  again but we're gonna be talking larry nickles now we're also gonna have um ritchard reeves who's
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:11.120]  at the airport about to depart uh on to cover super tuesday he's gonna be popping in he was in
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.400]  the midst of the caucuses last night uh and he'll give us a report on that trump got basically doubled
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:26.320]  45.9 or almost 46 percent against marco rubio second place 23.9 so a little less than double
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:35.600]  that is a big deal ted cruise 21.4 carcin 4.8 so case at 3.6 they are basically out of the
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:41.920]  race ladies and gentlemen but the mainstream media is still flipping out trying to demonize
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.320]  everybody before i go any further i want to get into political correctness though because
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.080]  i've known obviously about political correctness since i was in high school and i knew it was a
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:59.440]  soviet term i knew it was a war on language and george arwell wrote about that in 1984
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.800]  he didn't call political correctness he called it newspeak
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.160]  but when you see the so-called left and what they do and they're bullying
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.840]  it's it's just wild you're not a boy or girl you're a purple penguin you can't say my their
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.520]  father you can't say he or she you have to say g or z or you know like you're in a space cult a
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:29.680]  hail bop cult and now all over the u.s they have elementary middle school and high schools doing
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:37.360]  gendered neutral training and white privilege training guilting and freaking out these little
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:45.040]  kids who have done nothing to anybody and actually making white people second-class citizens and
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.000]  hillary's come out and said whites have white privilege you need to apologize for it and i
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.760]  hardly cover this much as i should there was a video yesterday from buzzfeed
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.080]  where people of color from around the world respond to quote white privilege and talk about
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.120]  how horrible white people are and it's like all these eastern europeans that come into the u.s and
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.960]  get shot or killed because they move into poorer areas and then you'll see black folks
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.400]  indicted and they'll say well they were white i mean each europeans have zero history of doing
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:27.520]  anything to black people but that's what's so crazy about this is it's not just that i haven't done
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:36.640]  anything but people who aren't even from a country or a reason that ever did anything are totally
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:42.880]  oblivious to what's going on and again most black people aren't pushing this it's the media
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.040]  it's the ford foundation it's the rocker fella foundation it's the universities and you ask
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.520]  how can they be getting away with this because they've got control of the kids but this really is
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:58.160]  cult brainwashing this really is cult programming this really is cult control
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:06.320]  this is what they do in cults in america and the western world's being turned into one giant cult
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.080]  and the systems that new york and london developed that were tested the old soviet union
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:18.400]  because our government's overthrew russia in 1917 that's that's on record those are being used
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.840]  here now and i look at these headlines black lives matter protesters interrupt mag mile
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:29.040]  demonstration in support of apple see here's people protesting for all of our rights to not
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:35.120]  have our passcodes broken black white hispanic asian doesn't matter and then here comes the
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.440]  idiot black lives matter group who even protested bernie sanders and then you've got school
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.640]  districts spending millions on white privilege training for teachers
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.080]  it's where you don't get educated about reading writing arithmetic about etiquette about good hygiene
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:55.920]  about how to be charming about how to balance a checkbook stuff you need i mean i learned stuff
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.720]  in like typing class and stuff and i learned stuff and in in in uh you know i took a course in high
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.760]  school on um accounting that stuff helped me that stuff isn't going on in high schools now folks
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.840]  i've looked at the curricula it is how to create a social justice warrior whose whole life is about
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.120]  making you do what the system says and what tv says and these people are everywhere now and they
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:23.760]  just get in everybody's face they're weird freaks and they're always disheveled and weird and and
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.640]  like socially screwed up black white i don't care chip on their shoulders weirdos
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.880]  so i want to go through this and talk about their master plan but we've got to break it
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.320]  we've got to be politically incorrect like i used to not be politically incorrect because i don't
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:44.960]  hurt people's feelings now i'm realizing we need to be and even be brash sometimes or comedy everything
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.640]  goes out the window look at all these liberals the comics going whoa i you know this is terrible i
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.800]  can't go john clees uh you name it jerry seinfeld he said hey we're moving back to new york county
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.560]  from the countryside because you're 13 now you can meet more boys the fact that you say the
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:06.800]  word boy is sexist boy and girl is sexist and he's he he thought boy my daughter's ignorant no no
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.680]  your daughter's not ignorant she's been programmed to say boy or girl to say a girl might want a
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.680]  boy as bad they're talking about changing the game of life because you have a pink baby and a blue
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:19.920]  baby when you have a baby in the game of life the board game you can't have that can't have pink and
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.760]  blue can't have target with boy sections and girl sections because boys and girls existing is evil

[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:38.720]  words to use what a group of controllers these aren't freaks these are conquerors and if we're
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.720]  going to be conquered by these people then we deserve it and that's the big thing donald trump's
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:50.080]  done is smash political correctness it was already there and you can help smash it further let's go
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.280]  to richard reeves at the airport in vegas novata about to jump on an airplane to cover super tuesday

[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.760]  with dirty tricks that still wasn't successful uh trump almost 46 close to double marco rubio in
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.960]  second place uh the glenbeck situation so much more richard reeves what was the what was the spirit
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:31.440]  what was the flavor on the ground uh there uh what did you witness it was absolutely electric
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:41.040]  absolutely unbelievable donald j the t-rex of presidential candidates trump congratulations
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.600]  that was huge last night he overachieved what i thought he would get he overachieved by two or
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.960]  three percent dr carsten overachieved a couple percent that's the five percent that i thought
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.920]  ted cruz was going to get to put him into second place so bad news for ted cruz that third place
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:02.320]  finish mark it down folks mark it down this is the beginning of the end of ted cruz and it's
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:08.960]  also the beginning of the end of marco rubio because donald the t-rex presidential candidate trump
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:16.320]  is got the ball he is got the eye of the tiger what we saw last night was awesome it was electric
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.520]  thank you alex jones for getting us here thank you and for warriors for supporting info wars dot
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.720]  com info wars team and all the related websites totally electric there at the audience they're
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.080]  here in las vegas nevada and i'm telling you alex upcoming on tuesday what we got a watch for
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:38.480]  is the splitter strategy the splitter strategy we talked about it in a in a previous video
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:43.520]  is where they hope that case it might be able to steal michigan ohio they hope that marco rubio might
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.560]  be able to grab florida and they hope the ted cruz might be able to grab texas so that splitter
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.600]  strategy is where they could potentially split up divided up and then and then try to make it look
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.240]  reasonable even though he's still winning to contest the nomination and to continue and on
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.720]  till later we need to be pushing that when he wins super tuesday everybody needs to get on these
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.840]  candidates and tell them it's time for them to get out of the race and stop the attacks or they're
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.520]  basically they're the ones working for hillary they're the ones that are democrats at that point
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:15.040]  and we have to expand on all of that we have to let folks know in florida and texas and i really
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.600]  love governor abit but he you know uh he has to endorse his good buddy ted cruz i understand that
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.840]  but separate from that we absolutely have to have texas go for trump and i don't want to hear this
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.240]  thing well you know a cruise kind of talks in a texas accent look i don't get into the whole
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.800]  cult of texas thing but i'm an eighth generation texan okay family at the whole nine yards helped
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.360]  start that i mean literally started the state on my mother's side and my dad's side was in it
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.520]  so let me just say as as an original texan is as original as it gets i'm going for trump
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.840]  and i don't want to hear all this stuff about ted cruz from kids is muted i'm not against the guy
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:51.040]  that he's from canada i'm glad he got to texas as soon as he could but i'm a real texan as texan
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.920]  as it gets you know i'm i'm no hat in all cattle okay i don't wear a cowboy hat but i got the cattle
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.400]  literally i got cattle black angus now let's go back to you what do you think about that statement
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:07.200]  reddard well you and i are 100 on the same page right there i think that like say ted cruz in
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.120]  trouble he really needed a second place so i think that potentially what we're going to see
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.240]  in these upcoming super tuesday states is more of ted cruz support going to donald trump i wouldn't
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.440]  be surprised if many states we see a over 50 performance for donald trump which would be
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.960]  excellent dr carsten another two three percent will go to donald trump i think so in many states
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.320]  over 50 percent ted cruz without that second place he's injured very that's right they kept
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.400]  saying that as other candidates dropped out the other leads would get bigger but that's not true
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.600]  he's getting the leads and and there's pulls out the jeb bush people are going down that's right
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.960]  and on the delegate countdown the great thing about nevada here's the thing alex congratulations
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.720]  to you and all the info warriors because those dress rehearsals in 2008 the dress rehearsal
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:59.840]  in 2012 is what kept me and made sure that these caucuses here in nevada were run in an honest
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.560]  fashion the fact that all the ron paulers were in there and the libertarians were watching now
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.560]  now we've got our people in a lot of delegate positions not enough to overall steal it like
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.880]  hillary would do or the republicans would do but enough to keep it honest that's right they're
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:18.560]  going to keep it honest i think the full delegate slate of 30 delegates are going to be trump loyalist
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:24.000]  when they go to cleveland that's great news so what i'm seeing so far is iowa i think they're
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.280]  going to be trump loyalist you have new hampshire they're going to be trump loyalist south carolina
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.760]  is the one state where we've got all the gop years for 2015 that are going to be in that
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.560]  delegation so we've got to worry about that but the way to solve that is by don trump just running
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.720]  the upcoming table here on all these states getting masses huge 60 that's right he needs to be as
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:49.840]  strong as possible he's the winner to go up against hillary absolutely when you're on tomorrow
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.840]  i want to go over how we think they may at the convention try to steal it from him i don't want
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.160]  to put the cart before the horse but that's the next real fight i mean he's gonna run the table this

[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.520]  up our champion is donald trump is he pure heart he better be but he's only a manifestation of
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:34.000]  populism and the establishment is battling him for real he's firing 9 11 truth attacks on the
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.920]  private federal reserve political correctness offshore deals meant to shut down our industry
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.400]  political correctness
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:51.760]  Donald trump definitely has the eye of the tiger we need to stop going along with the system
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:59.040]  stop always doing what they tell us is a smart move it's all about justice being done
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:05.840]  though the heavens fall and if the establishment thinks they're going to simply play games with
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.400]  trump or the public or if trump thinks he's going to deceive us and play games they have to know
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:16.000]  we're not in the climate we were before this is just the beginning of the explosive animating
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:24.320]  contest of liberty the real awakening of humankind led by men get ready because it's here
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:31.840]  this is just the beginning but the detonation has begun the explosion is now here
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.160]  all right let me give the political correctness i was mentioning earlier than our guest is joining
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:45.440]  us every day i see videos shown in us european australian colleges every day i see i mean i
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.920]  never showed the marine getting beat up because he's a marine they see he's a marine he's a white guy
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:58.240]  they beat him up they've now arrested those guys racial attacks i don't even play the footage
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.080]  anymore of like where they walk up in and just shoot a cop for no reason it's just crazy and
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.960]  i know they're bad police out there too but randomly just attacking some white guy because
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:15.760]  he's white it's just so stupid but why is it getting so bad because the media the controlled media
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:23.600]  is pushing the narrative that you don't have a job or the society's falling apart not because your
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.960]  mom was on welfare not because she was a crackhead not because the cia ship drugs in but because
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  there's a white marine at mcdonald's
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.280]  kind of deserves to be beat up be at mcdonald's i'm i'm joking someplace is the only place to eat
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:46.160]  but that article is out today that footage maybe we should just show the footage of the
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:53.120]  background of the marine being attacked but then this black lives matter protesters interrupt
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:58.640]  mag mile demonstration in support of apples ebs always builds a demonstration on the mag mile
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:04.000]  in support of apples fight with the fbi turned into a latest protest over the city's handling
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.520]  and then it goes on and it's the entitlement of even bernie sanders and others and democrats that
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.040]  say all lives matter and black lives matter shows up it's so angry it's like that's what
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.320]  social justice warriorism is with feminist or anybody is they're so entitled they're so hateful
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:27.760]  at you and they just look like they're on a power trip like they're mighty because they're a protected
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:35.120]  group and you've hurt them and they're going to show you with some assertiveness training
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.640]  they're going to hin peck you into submission and i just see it everywhere now
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.920]  and women particularly just watch tv all day and these sitcoms and these dramas
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.440]  and read these magazines telling them how to treat their boyfriends and husbands
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.840]  it's all designed to wreck your family break down society and screw your kids up on record
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.080]  dr spock saying don't spank your kids don't discipline them and now we have a nation of
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:07.040]  just spoiled rotten trash they go what are you for beating your kids with a tire iron no
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.640]  they always show an extreme of the other but in my day you got paddled at school
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.360]  for getting in trouble and believe me you didn't want to get in trouble now they just call the cops
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.600]  and they taser you see that it just means more force but only the government can have force
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:28.160]  because it's the parent school district spending millions on white privilege training for teachers
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.960]  san francisco this is all over the country there's no question that the pacific education
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.640]  group of san francisco based education stolen company this is successful for non-profit
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:43.840]  for-profit business it's a standing tribute to america capitalism and the success that
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.640]  entrepreneurs of all races can experience in the free market today of course pegs overt mission
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.320]  is to improve educational opportunities for black and other minority children the company
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:57.760]  sells the notion of the american education system is unfairly based on traditional white
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:04.080]  cultural norms so if you bring in kwanzaa or something that's supposedly reading writing
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:10.880]  arithmetic hygiene being charming etiquette is what you need but oh no we're going to learn
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.840]  about indian and african culture all day what does that even do it just confuses everything
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:21.440]  because here's the deal this culture in the united states is renaissance culture and it
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:27.280]  borrows from everything but it's about success and then it goes on the main teaching is just how bad
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:34.480]  white people are again don't miss it the real mission here is just to screw everybody up
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:39.520]  and make sure they burn all the time teach them about purple penguins and how white people are bad
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:44.080]  instead of actually learning how to go get a job and be successful and so you're a screwed up person
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:48.800]  with a chip on your shoulder who can only get a government job being another henpecker commissar
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.640]  the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.160]  works better than i if it didn't on air then i don't need to know about it but we're going to see
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.080]  how much he can say on air also the big trump victory what's he what he thinks about that and

[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:20.480]  i've been interviewing him for 20 years but on air 21 years and he's the consulate clinton
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.200]  insider the clinton chronicles all of it couldn't have been done without him mena the ci drug dealing
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.520]  all of it he exposed it he's to run their campaigns he wouldn't be part of the murders
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:35.600]  and the clintons have talked about how he's their big enemy now i know early on uh in the clinton
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:40.880]  administration they try to destroy certain people that were being nominated to the supreme court that's
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.680]  what Nichols got to know them and Nichols became an early source on the internet for a lot of folks
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:51.040]  out there and he's battling cancer right now and obviously needs your prayers that's another issue
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.400]  but one reason he hadn't been almost the last few days also it took him a few days to get back
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:00.400]  in touch with this person now he talked to him on the monday after he had died on the saturday
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.040]  and Nichols at the time i don't know what happened but it looks weird no autopsy and
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.720]  we're going to investigate all these people and we're going to check into it but it is perfect
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.440]  timing now the republicans have said that they're not going to have a hearing on it obama says he
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.880]  may bypass that with something called the nuclear option so i want to cover the latest on scalia
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:23.200]  then the latest on the appointment and then the latest on what he thinks about trump the campaign
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.320]  hillary and so much more i want to go boom boom boom through all this with larry nichols larry

[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.600]  you're taking care of yourself thank you for coming on with us obviously people have been calling
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.920]  emailing tweeting alex where's larry nichols when are you going to tell us what the supreme
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.160]  court justice said when are you going to tell us what happened well you've been busy and weren't
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:50.960]  ready to comment you still say this person now that you talked to doesn't want to have what they
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:57.600]  told you discussed but let's start with the black sedan last what was it last wednesday
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.920]  that was out in your driveway that would drive away every time you went out there but you got
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.480]  photos of it driving away you say you called the police they came out let's start there let's start
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:13.440]  where we finished well technically what that was was homeland security and they told the police here
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.080]  that they had no jurisdiction over them and they could do any damn thing they wanted to do and pretty
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:25.360]  much let them believe that i had a one-way ticket to get mo and what that meant i have no idea and
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:30.000]  alex if they want me i live at 58 Kensington drive conway arkansas i've never hidden it
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.640]  come on let's do what's got to be done just don't bore me to death i think a lot of it has
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:42.640]  to do alex with and how i end up in the middle of this junk alex i never can figure out but it
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.240]  has to do i think with some of the things that i was working on with this clear death now here's
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:56.240]  what's coming there's going to be an investigation so many of the things that were given as evidence
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:04.640]  and witness statements have turned out to be wrong wrong is lies whatever there's fiction to be
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:13.280]  a serious investigation and we're going to find out the truth about split now we may not find out
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.880]  about it through the mainstream media but i assure you i will know and if i know you'll know and your
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:26.000]  audience will know so that's coming now what kind of got me in the middle of it is the guy that
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:33.760]  owns the ranch his name is poindexter alex that's right in it poindexter yes sir when i was with
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:39.600]  the contrast in nicaragua when we would fight in the southern part of nicaragua there you would
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.240]  team up with the mosquitos indians when we had started being chased by the sandinistas we'd run
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:53.040]  across the border into costa rica into a safe farm 5000 acre farm owned by john hall but he had
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:42:01.600]  a silent partner now this is pretty dubious stuff alex back in those days this is pretty slippery
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:09.840]  stuff well guess who his silent partner was poindexter not admiral poindexter but another poindexter
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.400]  another poindexter matter of fact it's the poindexter that's got to do with the wrench
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.560]  you've confirmed that i've confirmed that at his background he was in very secretive
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:25.680]  grips like you were from the vietnam era a similar army background you're a green beret he's connected
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:32.640]  to that then we've got the fact that he gets a special award created for him given to him in
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:37.680]  person by obama he's part of these big brokerage firms that are connected to clandestine grips i
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:44.160]  mean that right there stinks the story changing no autopsy wow yeah i mean it's gonna it's gonna get
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:51.280]  ugly and what they're hoping and i'm talking about obama and the people involved in this they're
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:58.080]  hoping that this will get totally buried by the election and uh it'll just go away well it's not
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:06.320]  gonna go away it's not and uh we're gonna find out exactly what happened and as you know and
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:14.240]  folks just so that you know i have not shared anything with alex in private uh i wouldn't
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:20.800]  it's not fair to alex and to the bad guys if you're listening i don't talk to alex privately so
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:28.320]  don't worry with him but that's common now alex i got another bit of news for you the republican
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.840]  hierarchy the establishment they have decided to forego fighting donald trump
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:40.480]  now they're not gonna fight him wow and uh were you told this by insiders or you're able to see
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:48.080]  the tea leaves no no i don't do tea leaves what they're doing is they're setting him up for the
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.760]  convention now i don't know how many conventions any of you've ever worked or been around but
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.360]  i've been around a lot of the republican convention alex is kind of weird you know the democrats
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:05.440]  have what to call super delegates super delegates folks when people go vote and they pick who they
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.320]  want to be their presidential nominee well that's the people well the democrats didn't like that
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.880]  so they wanted to put control on it so they created this group called super delegates
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:20.400]  which are basically sitting congressmen senators governors people that are in politics that are
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:26.560]  in good standing with the party so it overrules the people so if you're a democrat and you think
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.360]  you're voting for this person or that you ought to just go to super delegates and democrats are
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.000]  just now learning about this has been in place in 72 they can't believe it they can't believe it
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:43.360]  now the republicans have their nasty trick it's called a brokered convention when delegates are
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:49.120]  awarded because of the primary they go to the convention when they get to the convention
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.560]  you'll know alex notice it goes around the floor and everybody says from the great state of arkansas
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:45:04.560]  we give 28 tests to our 28 votes to whatever the second if it's not 51 percent when it goes around
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:12.400]  the floor the first time the second time it goes around the floor the delegates are released alex
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.120]  from their commitment to their people that's right because they're claiming that there's a
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:25.680]  stalemate now it goes to the party insiders that's exactly right so what they intend to do is meet
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:32.720]  trump there and folks there's gonna that's a tough one to beat alex but we will beat it we will beat
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:36.080]  it well that i mean they tried to steal it from reagan and they said at least put george herbert
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.240]  walker on and we're gonna steal it but he had such a landslide but they were able to force
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:45.040]  bush in there uh boy that's why it's important for trump to go in with a landslide of delegates
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:52.160]  isn't it it is now they also because of that problem they put in another little rule that exists
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:58.720]  today there are some number of states i don't know i'm finding out who they are but there are some
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:04.800]  number of states that the delegates don't even have to vote with the will of the people the first
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:12.400]  round that's their protection device you know if you conceivably the way donald trump's going he
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:19.280]  could get enough delegate votes where he wins the first round with their fiction to jam that up
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:26.640]  they're gonna jam it up on him and they have foregone they've given up trying to fight him now
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:37.680]  that's coming you know alex they're doing everything every dirty trick they can to enslave us
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:46.240]  and this is all coming to a head very very fast down to and including the replacement for scalia
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.800]  if you know the republicans whatever you want to call them the republicans have said they're not
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:47:01.360]  going to entertain looking into another replacement for scalia but most people don't realize alex
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:09.520]  there is a law that was signed in 1970 i believe and it says that a president in his last term
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:15.920]  the last year of his last term cannot appoint as you know someone to the supreme court unless
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:21.920]  there's an emergency unless there's an emergency within the court and obama's fiction to use it
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:28.080]  and when you hear obama and the media talking about the nuclear option alex you heard it first
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:33.520]  here when you and i talked about it last week that's what the nuclear option is
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:41.360]  and he's going to pull it he's going to pull it and when he does that the whole dynamic of the
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.440]  country is going to change alex the whole dynamic he's been doing on open borders he's been doing
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:51.120]  it on guns he's been doing it on military will the republicans sit there and let him do an emergency
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:48:00.160]  appointment you put me in spot didn't you do it on purpose no i mean i'm just trying to figure i
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.640]  mean i know we don't know but at least they're blocking a hearing i mean they just can't let
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:11.040]  obama do this the only reason the republicans are blocking the hearing or give the sense that
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:17.280]  they're blocking the hearing is to get them through this election cycle once the election cycle is
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:23.360]  over in november they fully intend to address the situation with obama and put in a supreme court
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:28.480]  justice before the next legislature or the next congress and that's what obama keeps saying in due
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.400]  time people want it now he's going to wait till after the election he's going to wait which shows
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.600]  there's a deal going on behind the scenes exactly that's what i try to tell people they're not two
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:44.160]  teams alex there's not it's one they get together i've been there i've been in the cloakroom i've
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.480]  been in the meetings and we they come off the floor of congress they say boy you teddy you teddy
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:55.760]  kennedy you sure not me in the butt on that speech you gave and then or or the foreign
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:01.840]  hatchers say yeah and then they're just buddies it's all an act and that's the old guard they're
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.040]  threatened by the libertarians the ron paul types and the trumpians and that's why there's a war the
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:13.200]  old establishment thinks it can keep suppressing this giant populist explosion if they steal it from
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.920]  trump man there's going to be civil unrest and maybe that's what obama wants then he'll trigger
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:25.520]  he's got his black lives matter group uh fall it out ready to activate you know that's the thing alex
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:30.400]  that people need to know we're getting boxed in people can think obama's messing up hey that
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.920]  old boy's pulling every trick he wants to pull he's pulling it and you're exactly right he would
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.960]  love nothing better than for trump to get cheated out of the election for there to be an uprising
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.560]  and then boom he's now king you don't have to worry about a president he'll be it he'll be king forever
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:54.800]  at least until he doesn't want to be king now another thing happened in the bottom and by the way
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:01.840]  i got word a friend of mine uh went down there had king the guy produced states right video for me
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:07.840]  he went down and he met with richard and matthew your guys and thanks to the effort that they did
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:16.800]  working with a lady named miriam witcher 46 percent of the latino vote went with trump
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:28.320]  that has brought washington to its knees that has hillary's team scared pink because remember
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:34.960]  the rules with the clinton campaign is a broken coalition stay there explain it to us on the
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:40.640]  other side and i'm going to play the close of obama making the joke about having to appoint a new
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:46.240]  judge at the governor's conference and all the cackling and weirdness that went on that looks
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:52.560]  like a serious celebration to me very very sick i mean there's another message like the pillow on

[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:39.040]  usual stuff you know i've known a lot of people like you larry that was you know well known
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:42.720]  people can look it up green beret special forces operations all the world i know a lot of people
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:48.160]  that are uh navy shields delta force you know guys that can do 300 pull-ups you know some
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:52.480]  guys that could literally tear your head off your body you know the guys they got now are like
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:56.240]  they're part of the guys with the you know double y chromosomes and all the rest of it
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.960]  supermen and then i love people like hillary and obama the folks that never do any of the
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.440]  killing but they order the killing i've noticed only killers that actually never did the killing
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:10.320]  love to brag about it and smirk and say i'm a good killer i'm good at killing people all the real
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.160]  killers i know are kind of sad about the killing and don't brag about it they don't see it as good
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:18.880]  luck what is it with the bragging about all this and then let's get into uh because we got to go
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:24.320]  soon uh into once he gets through the broker convention and then what do you expect the
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:31.120]  clinton is to pull them well heller is on her way she is on her way everything she needed to
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:36.800]  accomplish you and i talked about when she first announced she was running she is about accomplished
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:43.520]  look when was the last time you heard anything major about the email scandal i mean they mentioned it
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:50.400]  periodically but not like it was all of this is going away by the time the election starts
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:56.560]  the general election you're gonna hear hillary say a million times it's already been thoroughly
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:02.800]  investigated nobody found anything it's those mean oh right wing conservative republicans
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:07.600]  that have stirred all this and she couldn't be an astronaut and everybody was mean to her and
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:14.000]  and they're mean to her she's gonna run a tough campaign now i would offer this caution to donald
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:20.080]  trump i hope he wins this primary and it looks good for him right now in the primary season
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:28.720]  but alex if you can talk to mr trump you need to tell him this is going to be just like playing
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:35.440]  tiddlywings compared to running against hillary it'll be brutal that will be a brutal campaign
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:39.600]  and he's going to have to get ready do you think hillary i mean we know hillary's
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:45.280]  ordered a lot of deaths do you think she'd be have enough wavos to actually order in the middle
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:50.560]  of a campaign um for him to be poisoned to have a heart attack while was playing up all right let
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:55.520]  me say it this way as you know alex i have never said the clinton's ever actually killed anybody
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:03.120]  ordered them to be killed however forces died by the dozens around them now talking about hillary
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:10.080]  would she be the kind of person that would have no trouble saying off the guy hillary would do it
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:17.760]  in a second in a second now i hope trump she's using alternate security than just a secret
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:24.080]  service because he's gonna need it you know donald trump is standing up for america right now
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:30.880]  now on illegal immigration and many other subjects he's at risk and hillary and them have a perfect
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:37.120]  opening you know a bunch of mexicans could come in and shoot at trump and she'd just go what difference
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:42.640]  does it make it wasn't me he was saying he was going to close the border so you got to watch out
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.520]  it's going to get serious we're talking alex we got the we got the pope coming out against
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:53.200]  team i mean everybody trumps good folks he is our champion now regardless this is epic and people
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:57.200]  are still sitting on the sidelines just just wait till they get him then people are gonna feel really
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.800]  bad in closing talking to the supreme court justice and i know you said there were a few other tidbits
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.880]  but but what can we know that there is an investigation going on will we be hearing about
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:13.440]  it is it governmental or private there there how do i say this and not get somebody in trouble
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:19.520]  there will be a government investigation but they're in the interest of keeping it honest there
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:26.000]  has been a vote to make a parallel private investigation so there will be an investigation
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.240]  both government and private and uh we're going to know the outcome wow thank you larry nichols

[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:21.120]  in support of apple not giving over the nation's pass codes and by the way bill gates of course is
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.520]  for apple giving up their codes because then they'll all be penetrated and wide open like pc's
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:31.200]  and this is about breaking encryption this is a referendum on that nothing to do with getting
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:36.080]  into these phones they go get the phone records and isp records of everything they did from the
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:41.120]  phone company and from the internet service provider and they know it you think you're
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:46.240]  erasing your history on your computer it's not a race at the internet service provider
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:53.520]  or the phone company and they know that school district spending millions on white privilege
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:58.560]  training for teachers and that's the sabotage and brain damage the kids into self-loathing
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:05.440]  hillary white people need to recognize our privilege in fact can we queue up that piece
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:09.840]  from buzzfeed that's gone viral i never played that yesterday where they asked the quote people
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:15.600]  of color about whites and they say how bad whites are this is racism publicly being exercised to
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:23.360]  create racial division hillary white people need to recognize our privilege and practice humility
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:29.360]  and then she came out and said she didn't get to be an astronaut when she was a little girl not because
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:35.760]  she never tried to be one not because she had any of the skills not be no just she wanted to
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:41.360]  whine she's been suppressed she's only made 300 million dollars she's only gotten to murder you
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.320]  know entire leadership of countries and let al-qaeda kill hundreds of thousands i mean she's such a
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:55.200]  baby oh she was abused meanwhile we probably roll this footage in the background black lives matter
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:01.120]  advocates arrested for robbing beating marine veteran first the media said it wasn't a racial
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.840]  attack now they admit it is and now there's footage it's pretty powerful in fact before we go to the
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:16.640]  hillary footage or before even go to the whites are evil um video from buzzfeed can can we pull up
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:21.840]  the marine being attacked at mcdonald's because it's just it's just crazy and then someone's
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:26.640]  approached and because you're white or because you're a veteran you get attacked and listen i'm
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:32.400]  not a racist i'm not an idiot i'm not a fool but there are thugs of all races and groups and people
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:37.120]  that get in gangs you can go to the wrong area and rednecks will attack you the wrong area black
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:43.600]  thugs will attack you or or you know uh hispanic thugs do this but you do this with black gang
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:49.360]  members and others there is an attitude there is just a you deserve to be robbed you deserve to be
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.560]  beaten what does the new black panther party say out of houston all the time they're like
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.160]  don't rob in the hood go to the white areas and mug them i mean it's just don't mug anybody
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:04.320]  and this is all pushed by the ford foundation by soros and by the white house black lives matter
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.200]  advocates arrested for robbing beating marine veteran who just did nothing they just beat him
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:13.920]  up and robbed him because he's white or he's a marine corps veteran police investigators said
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.400]  they took 17 year old male and 17 year old female into custody and charged them with aggravated
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:23.200]  assault robbery man i just don't get even when it's veterans people don't even fight back that much
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:29.600]  i mean uh somebody attacks me i just go completely wild i just i just don't get it
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:35.280]  it would take i don't know how i would just get in a fetal position and be beaten i mean i'm sorry
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:40.000]  i mean i've been overwhelmed and been tackled before about you know four or five people and i
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.320]  just started biting huge chunks out of people people go that's crazy no i'm primal i got teeth
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.960]  for a reason and believe me most people just hold back they you know i couldn't bite a chunk out
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.120]  of somebody you can bite right through somebody's blue jeans and just go right through and i
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:58.160]  i'm sorry you know it's just what has to be done i i just don't get it i don't see people think of
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:03.040]  your primitive you're dumb no no no no if you're modern you're dumb see if you're primitive you're
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:07.360]  wired into everything you got including your higher intelligence but also your beastial
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:13.520]  primitive caveman bone breaking you know you want to fight you get in a real fight somebody
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:18.640]  knocks you upside the head with a steel bar it feels good and i just don't get why people
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:25.920]  aren't ready to fight politically or physically it's pathetic excuse me continuing here uh obama
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:34.720]  administration changes rule to welcome immigrants with std's aids tuberculosis
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:42.400]  hepatitis i mean no country on earth does this but but see it's about collapsing the country
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:47.440]  it's about a hatred of america oh and i'm afraid no matter what color your kids are they're going to
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:54.960]  get the tuberculosis all around the in the tb but that's okay because it's racist not to want diseases
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:00.560]  suspect indicted in jessica chamber's burning death folks that said it was racially motivated
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.920]  a year ago plus what happened now they're admitting it and they have arrested two people uh for grabbing
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.360]  the cheerleader uh reportedly raping her in the pouring gasoline on her and killing her
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:14.400]  and but you know it's okay because she's white and they're black so there you go there won't be
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:19.120]  any national marches about this there won't be any big maybe hillary will come out and say she
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:23.680]  deserved it you know why not gloria steinham won't talk about the jihadis running around murdering
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:30.720]  and raping and killing because gloria steinham and hillary are conquerors of men and conquerors of
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:35.520]  america and conquerors of women and our families they want to conquer humans and that means the
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:40.480]  family by the way they pretty much conquered black people and they're conquering everybody else they
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:47.680]  break up the families give you a thug culture destroy everything and then when a lot of black
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.160]  people get up on their feet and become successful they energize a new race war to create more division
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:59.520]  that's the party of the kukla's clan over 110 000 migrants have already crossed into europe

[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:34.320]  that cried appease appease are hung by those they tried to please we try to look up who said that
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:41.520]  because i like to give people credit but it's from the 1770s when freedom fails the best men

[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:49.120]  elliptical machine once and there was this show on it was in like 45 minutes because they had ads
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:56.480]  of her just showing another purse another piece of jewelry another car she had and then just cutting

[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:25.520]  i mean i've talked to people that go oh my gosh you've been at a party with me you know brad pit

[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:51.200]  you can fly on planes quicker and not go through airport security but you know when a butler is
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:58.560]  on a jet giving you hors d'oeuvres and there's women trying to pull your clothes off people
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:03.440]  think oh that's the most wonderful thing on earth you just get on these jets and of course i'm a
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:08.960]  family god never did anything and now i just don't even do it i have opportunities all the time
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:16.080]  and there's a butler serving you food and then there's just women and bikinis and you're just
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:22.320]  and it's like they are just like the plate of strawberries and cheese and blueberries you're
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:27.680]  being offered and champagne and i don't just oh there's a woman here let's get that bikini off
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:34.240]  right now and it's not because i'm not a red-blooded man it's because they've been dehumanized
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:40.240]  and that's what it is out in LA all these rich guys they've all got a mansion and it's all full
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:48.800]  of a bunch of young women and man you talk about i have been inside satanic ceremonies
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:53.040]  when i snuck into behemian grove but before that when i was a teenager in dallas
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:57.040]  they were always trying to get me to join it so at least three times i was taken to one not knowing
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:00.800]  it was one i'm just gonna leave it at that i got out all three times and man they got pissed
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:06.240]  but the point is is that it was always women learning me into it my life's been like a movie
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:11.360]  just look at it now it just gets crazier by the second and this is twilight zone and all that
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:17.040]  was training though for stuff later and let me tell you something inside a satanic coven
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:23.520]  i did not feel the soul sucking death that i feel in los angeles and that's why for me to even go

[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:01.600]  our whole lives from the day we're conceived the day we die is boot camp
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:08.960]  I look back on my life and I think about all of it was training for what we now face the same thing
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:15.520]  for you don't take the traumas of your life and fixate on them and use them to feel sorry for
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:22.160]  yourself and have this victim mentality use it to empower yourself use it and realize that
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:30.080]  that maybe that happened to you so you can understand what's happened to other people so you can save them
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:38.480]  the truth is we're on a planet in deep space surrounded by dimensions we can't even see
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:44.080]  living in the most incredible epic times our species has ever witnessed
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:50.800]  it's like we're driving through the mountains we see clouds above us a veil
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:54.400]  we're going to drive through that veil and above it will be the sun
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:59.440]  and we'll be able to see for thousands of miles around us in all directions
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:03.040]  jacari jackson shot an excellent in-depth report that'll air in the next hour
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:07.440]  with the big body hack conference body modification conference
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:12.720]  uh it will cover that when david night is hosting it's excellent I want to go to eric and rick and
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:18.320]  jeremy and frank and daryl and others that are patiently holding and then i'm going to get into
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:25.680]  the other news military political you name it there is a lot of it i kind of went off on a
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:34.000]  rant about kanye west but that is true satanism in my view is not some chick on an altar
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:43.360]  you know sex magic all the rest of it that's just the lure real satanism is about only caring
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:49.520]  about yourself and getting into your own personal power and becoming delusional about that power
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:56.320]  and then hating everyone around you and boy there are reasons to dislike people
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:00.800]  but instead of wanting to actually lift folks up you revel in seeing them fall
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:07.920]  and the devil or the archetype if you will if you don't believe in these forces those forces
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:12.720]  are real but you don't believe it's spiritual in nature because you can't see it just like you
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:15.520]  can't see photons from deep space
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:24.800]  is the devil convinces you that if you make a deal if you just commit to that force if you use that
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:31.440]  evil logic that twisted math that the devil will give you power the truth is you're a powerful being
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:39.520]  you already have the power the devil gives you the confidence to then use that power but because
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:44.480]  you do it in service to the devil you believe the power is coming from the devil that's what
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:49.440]  the devil will try to get you to do bad things or do extreme things or do things even make you
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:57.120]  stronger even though they're bad that are stressful because that which doesn't kill you only makes you
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:02.480]  stronger stronger for evil though not for good that's why we want Kenobi it's a great allegory
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:09.120]  Darth Vader says when I left you I was but the learner now I am the master and he says only
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:18.880]  a master of evil Darth only a master of evil not a master of good you don't think masters of good
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:25.440]  don't know everything the evil people know and more we know so much we wouldn't dare be part of that
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:34.720]  but the weak particularly are drawn to evil because of its worldly power
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:44.320]  there's no spiritual world that's why the satanists did everything they could to recruit me and felt
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:52.720]  when I was 14 15 16 so bad we had to move down here from Dallas to Austin Texas
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:01.120]  there isn't spiritual power in the world but the devil could obviously foresee the
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:07.600]  potential of what I would end up doing and the devil sees the potential of what you could do as well
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:17.040]  now I'm going to stop ranting and go to your phone calls into the news I want to go to each
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:20.720]  person and move the next as I start pontificating on what you say I won't get to anybody
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:24.480]  and then David Knight's coming up he'll probably have open phones as well I want to move towards
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:28.400]  trying to take more calls not because there's some program director in the sky but because I need to
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:33.280]  brain forces back in stock is the best in due to traffic we come up with it just gives me
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:36.560]  incredible energy it's a lot better than drinking that afternoon coffee though the afternoon coffee
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:41.120]  is more enjoyable she doesn't have an effect on me anymore never really did I'm gonna coffee go to
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:46.720]  bed you don't take this to go to bed and it's not because it has a stimulants in it it's because
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:51.280]  it's got neurotropics that are building blocks for normal metabolic behavior in the brain it'll
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:56.080]  blow you away we believe it's the ultimate brain pill especially for the price can you buy some
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:00.640]  stuff a lot of its prescription is $300 that's better yeah but you're not going to find anything
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:08.160]  for $29.95 or even $50 or $60 that's close to brain force I know leading competitors that sell
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:11.200]  their stuff for 40 bucks and they admit to us yeah your formula is a lot better
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:16.720]  and that's leading competitors and I don't really see it as competitors they do

[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:44.080]  phones let's talk to Eric in Colorado you're on the air thanks for calling today Eric
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:52.400]  hi sir thank you so much for taking my call thank you to you and the info info warrior crew for
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:59.200]  opening my eyes and giving me the answers of why to all of my questions the first thing that I
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:04.400]  wanted to bring to your attention is kind of a predictive programming if you will season five
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:13.280]  episode of family guy death is talking to Peter and he says oh man it's been a crazy day today
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:24.560]  supreme justice Scalia was killed by Dick Cheney in a hunting accident so I'm not sure you know
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:31.840]  if that's something worthy of merit being looked into but it caught my attention that that you
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.000]  could say because Cheney's friends with him famously and Cheney shot one of his other friends in
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.880]  south Texas pretty close to that area about a hundred miles away and then the man famously
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:48.400]  apologized for Dick Cheney shooting him true bizarre behavior but I I think all of us should
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:54.160]  pay attention to programming and TV everyone ought to have a hobby of taking clips out of TV
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:58.000]  analyzing them and putting them on the web because that's where most the propaganda is
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.200]  is entertainment but real predictive programming where it's bonafide is where the CIA approaches
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:08.640]  the X files and says have an episode where a jet flies in the world trade center to blame the
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:14.880]  Pentagon or to run by the say I try to speed up when I'm taking calls in and then I mess up
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:20.240]  the CIA approaches and they say we want an episode where a jet is flown into the world
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.960]  trade center by a secret group in the Pentagon a rogue group to blame it on afghanistan and
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:29.680]  have martial law in america but really the plane is remote control that aren't hijackers and that
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:36.400]  was an actual episode a year or less than a year about nine months before 9 11 and I was told by
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:41.840]  one of the stars of the show that the CIA had approached them on that plot and others now I'm
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:45.200]  finally going to get to talk to chris carter soon I can't wait to ask him about that that's one of
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:49.760]  the few things I actually get excited about that'll actually get me to go to LA and enter Mordor
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:54.560]  where I think satan must sit or something because I don't get sick going anywhere but there and
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:59.120]  every time I'm there I just can't wait to get out but I am going into Mordor for a couple days
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:03.600]  I love Santa Cruz San Francisco is even nice even though it's a corrupt city
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:08.880]  San Diego is okay it's LA folks so I will be looking into that god bless you Eric I appreciate the
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:13.920]  call let's go ahead and talk to Eric or don't we talk to Eric rick in Minnesota you're on the year
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:22.320]  hello yes sir welcome rick all right hey thank you very much sir uh pleasure to talk to you
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:26.800]  and uh the reason I called today was really I wanted to give a testimonial and not to your
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:32.240]  product but more to just the message that info large stands for um just going to a real short
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.160]  story and I'm not going to take up any more time than this story hopefully I can help kind of answer
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:40.720]  one of the questions you had a little bit of goes yeah here's the I'm not screening your call
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:44.880]  because there's this syndrome though everybody screens calls so once I get a caller on air
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:47.920]  people ask hey can I talk about this I don't know about that just go ahead and get your point out
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:53.120]  brother okay all right so uh the other day I got in kind of Facebook a little fight with
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:58.800]  with a buddy of mine or or dino and and I had posted about uh obama making a joke
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:05.200]  um about Scalia's death and and he said oh it was a bunch of clickbait and so I I like to make sure
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:10.640]  I'm putting out good information and everything and I went and I looked up for myself on YouTube
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:16.320]  to find the video and it showed us multiple days of that entire governor's event and I found and I
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:21.040]  thought in fact that I had posted something that wasn't true or whatever I had apologized and then
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:25.600]  suddenly made me go and check again so I double checked and sure enough to pull up the exact clip
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:31.760]  from the white house dot gov site my message this um that I want to first of all apologize for doubting
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:37.920]  but uh but I'm skeptical by nature and uh secondly I wanted to thank you for putting out good
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:43.600]  information and if anybody's on their journey of becoming a believer and uh in what's said here
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:50.320]  and compassionate about this movement and going forward don't doubt uh enforce cuts out good
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:54.160]  information and I don't know if this matters hopefully it can help another person maybe at
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:58.960]  that point they just they want to build sure well here's the deal here's the deal if someone can't
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:04.960]  watch a clip of Obama and see him making a joke about Scalia and then figures out some way to
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:12.160]  say that's fake that's their issue I mean I have people saying there's no world government or TPP
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:17.360]  doesn't exist or the pope didn't call for world government and we make mistakes sometimes in
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:25.200]  things but overall we're very accurate and and so I just people that aren't awake by now are going
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:30.160]  to have to wake up on their own and I and I let the dead bury the dead I knocked the dust off my
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:35.520]  feet I appreciate your call Rick um it I don't think you should ever trust him for worse
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:42.240]  you should trust your own research and your own facts but you shouldn't just also trust people
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:51.440]  that go I hear Alex Jones is CIA address these claims let's just say I am I'm not
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:56.640]  but let's just say for the sake of argument I am now you're better than me I wasn't successful
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:46:01.360]  on my own you need to be successful and go out and fight tearing let's just move along I'm the bad man
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:07.360]  uh the government you know makes all the decisions for the show I don't do anything myself I don't
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:12.080]  put my shoes on in the morning in fact I'm a robot no I mean I'm being sarcastic I don't want to make
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:19.920]  it about Alex Jones okay I know the media does that but Scalia died and I said watch I bet they
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:25.600]  don't have an autopsy and of course they didn't the next day and then the whole story fell apart
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.880]  and they say we're crazy to ask that question of known killers and known liars that run this
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.600]  government they're bringing in record numbers of radical Muslims and lying about how many they're
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:43.760]  bringing in so there's so much coming at us the it's not like it's my job to even tell everybody
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:49.280]  what's going on it's your job to know what's going on but of course people want to change the subject
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:55.920]  on to Alex Jones because then they don't have to go read the article at info wars.com by Kit Daniels
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:04.160]  is dominant Trump wins one percent of Trump within one percent of cruises home state of Texas
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:10.720]  that is a big deal dominant Trump within one point of cruises home state of Texas he was 10
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:20.320]  points behind a week ago in comparison in 2008 Iowa winner won his home state by 40 percent
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:27.760]  so the fact that Trump is leading and gaining in Texas and it's close to edging him out shows
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:33.760]  how strong he is he needs to win Texas he needs to win Florida he needs to win these key battleground

[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:02.640]  with the current numbers the only reason they're keeping the other candidates in is to try to have
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:08.720]  the republican establishment bring trump down trump needs to win texas and florida so the democrats
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:13.440]  are facing a major competitor when he wins the nomination and so they can't steal the

[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:14.480]  hey alex good to hear your voice thank you sir how you doing good thank you
[03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:21.040]  thank you yeah i just you know i i uh i was shooting for ram paul in the beginning i you
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:27.040]  know slowly i've i've always liked what trump had said in the beginning uh slowly my support's
[03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:32.960]  moved over to him a few weeks ago uh this is kind of an eyebrow razor so i apologize for the uh
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:39.040]  no we want to hear you criticize trump if that's what you think brother go ahead well i'm not i'm
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:45.680]  not i'm not criticizing trump i just i'm you don't have to qualify just just get into it i'm a homosexual
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:52.880]  male so it's kind of an eyebrow razor to support trump or republican in general uh in that sense
[03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:58.160]  but uh a couple weeks ago when he was speaking to uh that evangelical crowd he said he wanted to go
[03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:04.480]  after gay marriage and despite that i uh you know i i still would almost i would vote for him over
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:08.800]  you know strangers or clinton sure i appreciate your courage to call in and talk about this william let
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:13.760]  me just get this clear here i don't dislike anybody uh as long as it's consensuing adults
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:18.240]  and and so let's get that clear i don't like some of the liberal gay lobby going after people's kids
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:22.640]  or them trying to teach heterosexual stuff and sexualizing kids let's be clear i'm not a hypocrite
[03:01:22.640 --> 03:01:28.240]  that just sits up here and hates on people for who they are or you know who they love or whatever
[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:35.440]  but there's an attack on marriage and that is a very you know key to humanity that then juxtapose
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:40.560]  this i'm not against civil unions i'm not against contracts and so i'm just saying that whole thing
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:46.320]  to me is a football issue that is used to divert everybody but you stack it all up let's just take
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:50.960]  over the republican party we know the democrats are a bunch of cult leaders and you know here's the
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:55.520]  deal if if people you know that are that are gay don't like what's happened in the republican party
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:02:00.080]  but you agree with so much more go take the thing over you see what i'm saying let's let's kick the
[03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:04.480]  foreign bankers out of the republican party and the democrats let's take the country back with a
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:09.200]  populist and then we can fight over the little stuff and maybe that's not little to you but quite
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:14.240]  frankly a bunch of divorce lawyers just wanted to get people marrying into the same sex so they
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:22.400]  can get all your money i'm sorry go ahead i i i agree you know with the sentiment you've said
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:27.200]  before you know as long as they're not teaching it to kids you know it it doesn't really bother you
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:32.000]  too much i just uh it's not even bother me too much it's not even on my radar brother
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:37.280]  bet when trump said that you know it's like man i really support him but you know can't we just i
[03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:40.480]  don't know i guess i just kind of feel like aren't they're more important well here's the deal he
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:45.920]  used to if he's played politics anywhere it said he's more liberal socially and now he's being more
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:53.040]  conservative to get the votes so i mean let me tell you he's a look here's the deal i'm not somebody
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:57.520]  that plays games i'm very fiercely conservative i i'm a christian i have a relationship with christ
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:04.000]  but it's not the relationship the preachers sell okay and then i don't christ hung around with
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:09.840]  you know get collectors and tax collectors and prostitutes and not because that's what he liked

[03:10:10.960 --> 03:10:16.480]  court issues uh we have a judge who for the first time has come back and said we don't have a right
[03:10:16.480 --> 03:10:21.120]  to film the police a very interesting uh wrong decision we're also going to look at something
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:25.440]  that's very hopeful we had as the prime court justice come out in favor of fully informed
[03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:30.320]  juries and principle that's a good sign i also want to take a look at uh something most people
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:33.600]  will kind of be scratching their heads about maybe didn't think they wanted to hear about
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:39.840]  shipping containers uh it tells us a lot about our economy it tells us a lot about trade policy
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:43.920]  and we're going to take a look at that as well as kind i guess we could say the fallout from the
[03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:48.880]  nevada uh tests yesterday because that's kind of what it was it's kind of like to be honest with me
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:54.080]  i don't pressure you for your political views i hired you because you were a smart guy business
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:10:59.680]  owner engineer uh part of a whistleblower think tank group that exposed secret human testing
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:03.760]  in the carolinas i mean you were a great find for us so honored you and your wife almost four
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:07.840]  years ago moved here well you moved here three years ago she stayed behind for a year to sell the
[03:11:07.840 --> 03:11:13.120]  home and pull up stakes uh you know from the carolinas but to have you here i don't put
[03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:17.040]  pressure on you for political views i was almost ashamed starting to promote trump four or five
[03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:21.120]  months ago but i knew that the whole system was against him and i was just hoping he would you
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:25.520]  know do the right thing but now i'm coming out against the fed coming out for 911 truth scaring
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:32.720]  him coming out against political correctness coming out on so many fronts uh i mean really
[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:37.360]  i am moving more and more towards feeling really proud of my decision on trump and i knew it was
[03:11:37.360 --> 03:11:41.680]  the right thing to do in my gut but but now i'm saying oh i guess my gut came through again now
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:45.280]  look who knows how this is going to change your words going to go but what is your gut now tell
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:49.040]  you about trump well it's great to be here alex especially because you don't put pressure on
[03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:54.640]  us you let us say what we feel and i know that we were on opposite sides of trump for quite a while
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:58.800]  i find it very positive the things that he's done in the last couple weeks talking about
[03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:04.080]  the missing pages the classified pages about 911 talking about auditing the fed many of these things
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:10.400]  and when you look at an issue that i believe he has real credibility on and that's where he stands
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:16.720]  on trade and on globalism when you look at what he's did 35 years ago taking spending a hundred
[03:12:16.720 --> 03:12:20.960]  thousand dollars of his own money 35 years ago when he wasn't running for office to complain about
[03:12:20.960 --> 03:12:25.440]  what was happening in this country or trade that's one aspect of it but of course he's also
[03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:31.520]  shut down the idea that we should reorder our economy that we should pay taxes to a global
[03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:36.480]  entity because of the climate treaty as well as open borders those are the three things
[03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:40.720]  that the globalists are using that the elites are using that the establishment are using
[03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:48.720]  to shut down that's right he's not perfect but he is opposing the triad of the globalist takeover
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:53.600]  because he's fundamentally a nationalist who doesn't want to be part of their collective now is he
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:59.120]  really a good guy we're going to find out but they're certainly scared of him he's done stuff like
[03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:03.280]  you know shoot his mouth off about torture like you ampily said they're all showing off because
[03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:07.440]  that's what the people want yeah he made a comment about apple i did a video saying donald you're
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:12.880]  wrong they want the encryption that's what that's about it'll screw up apple no wonder bill gates
[03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:19.280]  wants it this will turn apple into into pcs and look i hate apple they're probably the most evil
[03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:24.000]  corporation out there with some of the worst factories they fund some of the worst anti-american
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:29.200]  garbage but apple's right on this and i think donald trump's wrong he's playing up to some of
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:33.680]  the worst authoritarian instincts that republican party right now in the primaries it will have to
[03:13:33.680 --> 03:13:38.320]  see what happens in the long term but even when we look at issues where we disagree with him on
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:43.360]  like imminent domain for example he will at least come out and say this is what i think
[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:47.840]  unlike jeb bush and ted crews who have both supported the keystone pipeline they weasel
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:54.080]  around taking exactly they will lie to your face and that's why people who say that they support
[03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:58.320]  trump because he's a straight shooter people say they support crews because they agree with him on
[03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:06.960]  the issues but so many people have been lied to for so long by people who micro do micro data to
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:12.080]  analyze where everybody is on the issues cruise is a perfect example of that and then tell you
[03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:16.560]  exactly what you want to believe people don't trust that anymore i don't trust it either well
[03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:22.320]  yeah i mean he has the advanced stuff that obama used oh yeah where they know each of their potential
[03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:26.560]  voters down to what they eat how old they are what they do what issues they want and then they
[03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:30.640]  micro tailor with a computer they admit this where they go to your door and say ten crews
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.920]  supports this this and that and then don't tell you by the way we're surveilling you yeah that that
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:41.760]  is very very creepy so when you see people who come to you and say well i'm stand with you on on
[03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:45.760]  individual property rights and so forth and so on and then stick the dagger in your knife like
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:51.680]  marco rubio did with the gang of eight that type of betrayal is why people are looking for outsiders
[03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:56.160]  it's why they are going with donald trump regardless of whether they agree with them on the issues
[03:14:56.160 --> 03:15:00.480]  i have my question i disagree with them on still so i need to turn it over to you and you got a
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:04.000]  whole show lined up and i want to go to a few calls but bottom line though i know you're under
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:08.800]  lesser two evils this is a critical time whole power structure against him marco rubio are now
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:14.000]  ten crews donald trump i mean we got to support one of them or do we just sit back and and keep
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:17.840]  the moral high ground and say we supported none of them the things are so critical i'm saying
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:22.880]  donald trump i'm all in now if he gets bad and really go sideways i'm coming after him yeah yeah
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:28.560]  but i think it's important that that we look at things if we can shut down the three legs of the
[03:15:28.560 --> 03:15:34.880]  globalist takeover right now if we can expose the lies that the police state was built upon
[03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:39.920]  those are huge positives and so i would support him for that yeah okay so now you are moving into
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:43.680]  supporting trump yeah oh yeah i'll vote for him in the texas primary for sure we'll see what happens
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:46.960]  after that that's a big deal because the day of night cannot stand trump i'll just tell you about
[03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:51.520]  the scenes so that that that's a big deal right there ladies and gentlemen that i mean this is
[03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:55.920]  what's happening all over trump's getting more powerful people are waking up they just he's doing
[03:15:55.920 --> 03:16:02.480]  the right thing but if he goes sideways we've we've got to really let him know we're coming
[03:16:02.480 --> 03:16:06.400]  after him politically we don't give anybody a pass on the issues we're not going to follow
[03:16:06.400 --> 03:16:10.480]  somebody i'm not going to follow somebody because of who they are that's one of the issues that i had
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:15.440]  with donald trump at the very beginning was people falling behind the personality exactly
[03:16:15.440 --> 03:16:19.840]  that's very dangerous i saw that uh with donald trump and of course there is a lot of cult of
[03:16:19.840 --> 03:16:24.000]  personality involved in that you got people crossing over from the democrats to vote for him
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:29.520]  and so we need to still look at people and hold their feet to the fire and we need to better know
[03:16:29.520 --> 03:16:33.120]  he better deliver but we're behind him let's talk her real fast as i want to go to john and
[03:16:33.120 --> 03:16:38.800]  nebraska talk her go ahead you're on the air yeah uh david night you're the man thanks brother for
[03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:44.720]  all you do for all of us out here let me get to the real uh what's really going on you know people
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:52.320]  are really starting to wake up all over it's just so refreshing to see the young minds and the old
[03:16:52.320 --> 03:16:58.960]  minds starting to take heed to what's being said through this uh electrical indoctrination
[03:16:58.960 --> 03:17:07.120]  that we all get on this mainstream media people are so zombified to believing the half truth
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:12.400]  my grandpa always taught me when two people are telling you different stories you have to assume
[03:17:12.400 --> 03:17:21.200]  that they are both lying so um you know being brought up by by the elders i have a different
[03:17:21.200 --> 03:17:26.960]  set of moral principles and spiritual principles than most of the people that are being raised
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:33.440]  by the television today that are getting false information and are being pulled to believe
[03:17:33.440 --> 03:17:40.080]  the lies just completely just constantly being bombarded into our young minds that's why they're
[03:17:40.080 --> 03:17:43.680]  so arrogant as they've got our kids that's where we have to start changing and that's a good point
[03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:46.960]  if you're talking to people in the stories different one may be telling the truth the other
[03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:52.000]  may be lying or they both may be lying that's a really good point don't just take the left right
[03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:56.400]  paradigm and believe it and and i'm not doing that with trump i'm simply saying the system's
[03:17:56.400 --> 03:18:00.640]  scared of him he's better on most of the issues than other i'm getting behind him i appreciate
[03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:04.480]  your call tucker i want to get one more calling before break and i'm handing it over to uh night
[03:18:04.480 --> 03:18:08.000]  you'll probably take your calls but john in nebraska says he wants to talk about moving hell
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:13.840]  caesar we kind of gave it the headline that hell caesar is a allegory of the christ story
[03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:21.200]  really it's beyond that but i saw the collin brothers movie is actually anti-political correct
[03:18:21.200 --> 03:18:26.320]  anti-communist and very sophisticated if you watched it closely what did you think john
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:34.720]  first time caller alex 17 year listener at the end of the collin brothers film you know
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:39.760]  george clonies at the foot of the cross and he's sounding very christian and then he gets
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:45.360]  caught up at the end and in the background uh somebody maybe hit his thumb with a hammer
[03:18:45.360 --> 03:18:51.360]  or something he said son of a blank remember that yes that's supposedly what messes him up yeah
[03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:57.920]  well now while my thinking is is that's the true feeling of the collin brothers in that the
[03:18:57.920 --> 03:19:03.440]  talmud you know doesn't think too highly of mary and the term son of a blank you know uh
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:12.000]  uh echoes their feeling that uh she had jesus out of wedlock and so my my thinking was uh
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:21.040]  that it was a very sly anti christian dig now i want to segue real quick so my main focus if i
[03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:27.200]  may we'll skip this network right because we're in the fourth hour go ahead i have found out from
[03:19:27.200 --> 03:19:33.600]  a guy a christian guy named james loyte i found out about 20 years ago that for the last 50 60
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:44.000]  years approximately a third of the hollywood films in the film they embed the number 666
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:50.560]  that i'll give you two recent examples of movies that i bet you saw and that you and your listeners
[03:19:50.560 --> 03:19:57.040]  need to look for in the future if i may we're not screening your calls bro i do every caller
[03:19:57.040 --> 03:20:03.920]  goes with this thing where people say may i say this and i'm like sure go ahead sorry uh in the
[03:20:03.920 --> 03:20:09.040]  movie creed uh about a third of the way through sylvester Stallone is talking to this michael
[03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:15.280]  b jordan about this upcoming fight he says yeah we got it in six weeks and jordan says six weeks
[03:20:15.280 --> 03:20:22.800]  and slice the loan said yeah six weeks so there's your 666 then in the movie spotlight towards the
[03:20:22.800 --> 03:20:28.960]  end of the film they're able to figure out the percentage of priests in boston these boston
[03:20:28.960 --> 03:20:34.720]  globe riders that the percentage of pedophilia is six percent and they're looking at a graph on
[03:20:34.720 --> 03:20:39.440]  their computer and they say look at that six percent the other guy says yeah six percent
[03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:45.520]  and then a retort yeah six percent so i'm telling you this is in a third of hollywood films either
[03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:48.800]  we're gonna look into both those movies and i thought creed was excellent i don't really like
[03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:53.280]  those rocky movies uh and i'm gonna look at that because i know disney's been caught with subliminals
[03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:57.680]  they teach in college that there are subliminals a lot of sex subliminals and stuff as well because
[03:20:57.680 --> 03:21:02.400]  it makes your brain really pay attention to it is one reason to do it i thought compared to most
[03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:06.720]  hollywood movies the killman brothers film was pretty good you get the rabbi i'm not really
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:11.360]  slapped down but you've got you know what he's saying sounds mean the christians sound sophisticated
[03:21:11.360 --> 03:21:15.040]  and then you've got the christ figure kind of the studio head who does it because he wants to help
[03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:18.880]  everybody and then you've got you know the you know the the texan who they think is dumb but
[03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:24.480]  it's actually really smart and saves the day and you've got kind of the boss that's god back in new
[03:21:24.480 --> 03:21:29.040]  york uh who knows what decisions to make even though they don't make sense and and you've got
[03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:33.920]  kind of this whole comedy of eras but it's not it's serendipity and synchronicity i mean i've
[03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:38.160]  got to write notes the next time i see the movie i thought it was an excellent film and i think the
[03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:43.680]  cohen brothers uh do a really really good job they do do things multi-level so i get your point
[03:21:43.680 --> 03:21:48.240]  about they may have done that too to show that perspective what i think they do is try to show
[03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:53.680]  multiple perspectives uh and i don't want to sit there and say i don't think the cohen brothers
[03:21:53.680 --> 03:21:59.120]  are satanic watching their films they seem like really smart people but uh uh who knows what's your
[03:21:59.760 --> 03:22:06.000]  come back to that here's my final point and ties in with that are you going to be seeing
[03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:11.200]  chris carter of the x-files possibly soon yeah i said that a couple times since you've been on hold
[03:22:11.200 --> 03:22:16.240]  that i'm going to go out to la and meet with him soon oh sorry alec anyway i'm not trying to be mean
[03:22:16.240 --> 03:22:20.560]  it's just like i'm only people listen to the show i'm like please don't ask permission to talk and
[03:22:20.560 --> 03:22:25.120]  then i and then i did say that i'm trying to be an old lady or something it's just that go ahead
[03:22:27.440 --> 03:22:35.360]  anyway in this final episode of the x-files in the first quarter of it uh dana scully said
[03:22:35.360 --> 03:22:41.920]  something about six weeks and then she repeated it and then joel mackayl who plays your character
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:47.840]  also said six weeks so sometimes they break up this six six six which episode was that which
[03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:54.000]  episode was that the one that aired on monday night the day i called your tip line to inform you
[03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:57.440]  of what i've just told you all right thank you well we try to track it all it doesn't mean we
[03:22:57.440 --> 03:23:02.560]  get to it all and again i'm not complaining thank you so much god bless you um i missed like the
[03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:09.360]  first five six minutes of the new x-files that has my character in it because i thought it was the
[03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:15.520]  next hour at the time zones mixed up what i was told was mixed up so i got home late and so i missed
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:18.880]  the first part i actually want to watch that again tonight and then take some close up for the show
[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:24.560]  but i'll look into that i don't think of an hour long show the word six is said three times
[03:23:24.560 --> 03:23:32.640]  that people are trying to do that i think a lot of this is we're subliminally hit with this stuff
[03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:37.120]  we put it back out ourselves like ever since i was a little kid they were like jello commercials
[03:23:37.120 --> 03:23:42.240]  and stuff that would say oh it's delicious everything's a okay and i would do like you know
[03:23:42.240 --> 03:23:47.440]  put my index finger to my thumb and then people get that when i do that and they say man he's doing
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:54.160]  a limonade well i mean i do lots of hand signals and i guess they all do mean something um but
[03:23:54.160 --> 03:24:01.120]  some of the folks that promote all that go so far as they say that when i talked about when george
[03:24:01.120 --> 03:24:08.080]  w bush does the the diablo sign does he mean university of texas or does he mean warding
[03:24:08.080 --> 03:24:14.160]  off the devil like it means in idly or does he mean like some of the modern people have picked
[03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:19.360]  it up as a sign of the devil because rodney james dio popularized it his grandmother was an old
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:24.160]  italian lady when she saw something she thought was evil the way you warded off was with that symbol
[03:24:24.160 --> 03:24:28.960]  well then i make that symbol and then people grab it and say here he is making the satanic symbol
[03:24:28.960 --> 03:24:34.000]  well yes i'm making it to show you the symbol doesn't mean again it's all this weird Pharisee
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:39.680]  stuff i've noticed people do to them say you're bad so they're good but then they do nothing
[03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:45.680]  and then i'm sitting here full well knowing i'm not a satanist i have incredible empathy i care
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:53.760]  about people i love jesus christ i want to help people i want to empower humanity i want to reach
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:25:00.000]  out to others and and that's what i do it's what i stand for but i'm not on trial from the devil
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:05.360]  the accuser but it is true there's all sorts of weird satanic stuff in movies in subliminals you
[03:25:05.360 --> 03:25:10.640]  name it but some people say look at stanley cubrick a satanist a movie about satanism he was exposing
[03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:18.560]  the satanism so i think it people have to deal with the stuff they can prove like you can prove
[03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:24.160]  they've built fema camps around the country you can prove that they call emergency centers establishment
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:28.800]  act civilian inmate labor camp programs all this but no one wants to investigate no one wants to go
[03:25:28.800 --> 03:25:33.040]  cover them they want to just say i heard there's a fema camp i heard there's a chem trail well
[03:25:33.040 --> 03:25:37.200]  they've got scientific names for the chem trailing it's called geoengineering here's a news article
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:42.480]  no one cares about admissions of it they love the speculation of it and i don't even know how
[03:25:42.480 --> 03:25:47.280]  to describe all this it's just weird psychology that i think has been implanted by the television
[03:25:47.280 --> 03:25:53.280]  and stuff uh and like people i don't know how to explain it and i'm gonna talk about our listeners
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:25:56.880]  as so much as the general public david i'm gonna throw the baton to you because you got a big show
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:26:00.880]  lined up in jacarys report coming up you might want to comment on my rant right there to see if
[03:26:00.880 --> 03:26:05.120]  you can make any sense of it but the nightly news is coming up tonight tomorrow we're gonna have
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:09.600]  extended coverage of the big republican debate ahead of super tuesday and more in forward
[03:26:09.600 --> 03:26:14.240]  nightly news seven o'clock weeknights thank you david night thank you alex uh you know i wanted
[03:26:14.240 --> 03:26:19.840]  to talk about something i think um maybe you didn't really think you'd be interested in hearing about
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:25.120]  shipping containers but i saw this article it was on a daily mail the other day they had pictures of
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:31.200]  the largest container ship ever it's docked in long beach california it will take five days to
[03:26:31.200 --> 03:26:35.200]  unload it then it's going to go to seattle and it's going to unload even more stuff they say
[03:26:35.200 --> 03:26:38.880]  it's a quarter mile long i thought it was interesting because the name of this ship
[03:26:38.880 --> 03:26:45.280]  is the benjamin franklin and yet it's all about bringing goods from china to america
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:49.680]  not the other way around we've seen this happening for quite some time now this
[03:26:49.680 --> 03:26:54.880]  particular ship is a quarter mile long it is bigger than the empire state building it can hold up to
[03:26:54.880 --> 03:27:03.680]  18 000 units 116 000 tons of produce it can take them five days to unload this now uh they said that
[03:27:04.240 --> 03:27:10.240]  they don't need much in terms of crew you know you move this around with a crew the same as a ship
[03:27:10.240 --> 03:27:16.480]  half of the size they say that it had made a maiden voyage to the us back in december it took
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:22.800]  it two weeks to unload the cargo that it had at that time and so now it's taking it five days but
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:28.000]  it's still a massive amount of cargo that's being unloaded and i remember hearing years ago
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:32.960]  about these cargo ships that are coming to the united states laden down with things from china
[03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:39.440]  like this this uh ship that is as large as the empire state building filled with goods from china
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:43.920]  going back completely empty so i started searching for that i found this article going back 10 years
[03:27:43.920 --> 03:27:49.680]  2006 they talked about ships that were arriving from europe or the united states that were speckled
[03:27:49.680 --> 03:27:54.400]  with e markings arriving in china they say sometimes we get a vessel coming in here where the whole
[03:27:54.400 --> 03:27:59.760]  thing is empty yeah that's right typically it was about 60 percent empty they say shippers they
[03:27:59.760 --> 03:28:04.480]  carry television sets sneakers other manufacturer goods the us and europe trade with china was
[03:28:04.480 --> 03:28:10.640]  booming that's 10 years ago but increasingly it's a one-way street they said year after year the gap
[03:28:10.640 --> 03:28:16.480]  gets wider and wider well that was 10 years ago then i found another story that was five years ago
[03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:22.400]  they're now they're talking about how they're going to deal with the problem of all these
[03:28:22.400 --> 03:28:26.240]  empty shipping containers they say it's one of the biggest hidden costs of the shipping industry
[03:28:26.240 --> 03:28:31.280]  the fact that they have to haul back all these empty shipping containers so there's a very large
[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:37.600]  trade article about how they're going to deal with the problem of all of these empty crates going
[03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:42.000]  back because they're they're not buying anything from the united states all the trade is unilateral
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:49.200]  they say 82 million port-to-port moves of empty containers worldwide in 2010 at that time now
[03:28:49.840 --> 03:28:55.600]  look at this article from the beginning of this year january the eighth 2016 reported by super
[03:28:55.600 --> 03:29:03.360]  station 95 in new york new york they have a snapshot data snapshot that shows where all of
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:10.560]  these large giant shipping cargo ships are and they show in the atlantic ocean not the pacific
[03:29:10.560 --> 03:29:16.480]  ocean but in the atlantic ocean they're all at port they say commerce and this is january the
[03:29:16.480 --> 03:29:22.080]  eighth 2016 commerce between europe and the north and north america has literally come to a halt
[03:29:22.080 --> 03:29:27.760]  for the first time in known history not one cargo ship was in transit in the north atlantic between
[03:29:27.760 --> 03:29:32.560]  europe and north america that was on january the eighth this has never happened before a horrific
[03:29:32.560 --> 03:29:37.600]  economic sign proof that commerce has literally stopped stay with us when we come back i'm going
[03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:43.360]  to talk about what that means for our trade policy we'll be right back to cardiac arrest folks
[03:29:47.760 --> 03:29:54.480]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.320 --> 03:30:06.480]  marco rubio wall streets boy toy he's gotten more money from the elite donors and wall street and
[03:30:06.480 --> 03:30:12.080]  number two jeb or even number three hillary after blowing 150 million dollars on jeb they still
[03:30:12.080 --> 03:30:18.800]  haven't learned anything jeb's dropping out didn't help rubio in nevada rubio is the establishment's
[03:30:18.800 --> 03:30:23.520]  20 solution jeb had a sense of entitlement kind of like the donor class and the party
[03:30:23.520 --> 03:30:28.560]  elite that support rubio they believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues
[03:30:28.560 --> 03:30:33.920]  and still win but rubio is a little smarter he realizes that his support for illegal immigration
[03:30:33.920 --> 03:30:38.480]  with a gang of eight was a betrayal of the voters but he still thinks they're too stupid to see
[03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:43.680]  through the lives he's called breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of the ice union a
[03:30:43.680 --> 03:30:49.280]  liar when they expose rubio's betrayal with the gang of eight the rubio's campaign will provide

[03:32:44.960 --> 03:32:51.280]  digestive flow i was like really more natural stock up on survival shield x2 today at info
[03:32:51.280 --> 03:33:08.640]  warslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139 they took my saddle in years broke my leg in the saturday lost
[03:33:08.640 --> 03:33:17.440]  my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way in defense of human liberty alex jones
[03:33:17.440 --> 03:33:24.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host and joining me in this segment
[03:33:24.400 --> 03:33:28.560]  is jacari jackson i'm going to play a very interesting report that he had of a body hacking
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:33.440]  conference in austin texas covered that yesterday you can see that report on info wars.com we're
[03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:38.160]  going to play it in just a moment and and talk to jacari about what he saw there and i before we
[03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:43.280]  do that i want to get back to uh this story about the shipping containers because there's a lot
[03:33:43.280 --> 03:33:49.120]  that is here just besides the fact that we have a shipping container these ships are getting
[03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:54.880]  larger all the time this one is the size of the empire state building but they of course they come
[03:33:54.880 --> 03:33:59.520]  over here that takes days or weeks to unload them at each of the individual ports and then they go
[03:33:59.520 --> 03:34:04.640]  back completely empty what does that tell us and what does it tell us that even though this is a
[03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:08.240]  major problem for the shipping companies it's like well you know we only got trade going in one
[03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:11.920]  direction you know what it's not just a problem for the shipping companies is a problem for the
[03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:18.160]  american economy how would they solve it well one of the things that's happening is that we found
[03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:23.120]  out at the beginning of january that at least on one particular day there wasn't a single one of
[03:34:23.120 --> 03:34:28.800]  these ships carrying anything every one of them was at port very unprecedented and of course
[03:34:28.800 --> 03:34:35.360]  that's what's behind the collapse of the stock market it's really a collapse in demand the economy
[03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:40.000]  is headed down but i want to talk about the the trade aspects of this before i do i just want
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:43.840]  to let you know about some of the products we have at info wars life dot com that's what pays
[03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:48.960]  the bills here that's what keeps us on the air we have a brain force available now it is back in
[03:34:48.960 --> 03:34:54.080]  stock and of course if you sign up for auto ship you can determine the frequency that you want to
[03:34:54.080 --> 03:35:00.160]  get brain force in any of these products and get 10 percent off every time you order that
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:05.520]  signing up for auto ship before check out and of course many of us and the crew really love
[03:35:05.520 --> 03:35:12.000]  brain force you've heard rob do's testimonial about how he used it in a particular all nighter i
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:18.720]  use it all the time it really does make a difference and also we have a brand new formulation
[03:35:18.720 --> 03:35:24.000]  joint formula that's something that was just introduced this week it's a first run our supply
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:28.240]  is very limited on it but it is specifically designed to support the body's natural joint
[03:35:28.240 --> 03:35:33.440]  health and function is designed by our leading team of chemists is something that i will be
[03:35:33.440 --> 03:35:37.600]  trying i haven't tried that yet but it's something i will try and i hope it works as well as brain
[03:35:37.600 --> 03:35:44.400]  force you can get both of those at info wars life dot com now quickly before i go to jacari i want to
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:52.480]  talk about this this issue with the shipping containers and the idea that many people have
[03:35:52.480 --> 03:35:58.320]  criticized donald trump about saying that what he's talking about is establishing protectionism
[03:35:58.320 --> 03:36:02.080]  because he points out that we're not getting a very good deal you can see it with these shipping
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:08.080]  containers a ship the size of the empire state building brings loads of goods over but goes back
[03:36:08.080 --> 03:36:14.800]  completely empty is that a good deal for us can you see the effect now this giant sucking sound
[03:36:14.800 --> 03:36:19.680]  that ross perot used to talk about we know how that's working out but the people who are trying to
[03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:24.640]  control our economy tell us no no no we need to have free trade and i agree with free markets i
[03:36:24.640 --> 03:36:29.760]  agree with unrestricted trade understand what they're selling us with a transit specific partnership
[03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:37.120]  is not free trade it is managed trade it is trade that is going to be managed by an unaccountable
[03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:42.560]  unelected international commission that's what senator sessions who has looked at both the tpp
[03:36:42.560 --> 03:36:48.400]  and the ttip the transatlantic and the trans specific partnerships has told us these are treaties
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:53.680]  people who have voted for these treaties and congress have voted to shut down and ignore
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:59.440]  the constitutional process for ratifying a treaty because they didn't have 67 votes in the senate
[03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:03.200]  they changed the process they've shut down debate it's something that they're going to try to ram
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:08.480]  down our throat and it's important to have someone who is going to stand up against that it's very
[03:37:08.480 --> 03:37:14.640]  important but i also want to talk about the fear about protectionism you know we've heard and we
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:20.720]  hear it over and over again the idea that smoot holly created the depression i want to play this
[03:37:20.720 --> 03:37:27.520]  clip for you probably heard this before from ferris bueller's day off 1930 the republican controlled
[03:37:27.520 --> 03:37:34.880]  house of representatives in an effort to alleviate the effects of the anyone anyone the great depression
[03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:47.360]  past the anyone anyone ben stein tariff bill the holly smoot tariff act which anyone raised or lowered
[03:37:48.320 --> 03:37:53.600]  raised tariffs he's so true there's this blank expressions from the kids if you're listening
[03:37:53.600 --> 03:37:59.520]  to this on the radio did it work anyone anyone know the effects it did not work on the united
[03:37:59.520 --> 03:38:05.520]  states sank deeper into the great depression today we have a similar debate over this anyone know
[03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:12.480]  what this is class anyone anyone anyone anyone seeing like expressions on everybody's laugher
[03:38:12.480 --> 03:38:19.920]  curve anyone know what this says it says that at this point on the revenue curve you will get
[03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:26.640]  exactly the same amount of revenue as at this point this is very controversial does anyone know
[03:38:26.640 --> 03:38:36.640]  what vice president bush called this in 1980 anyone something do economics voodoo economics
[03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:42.000]  they have voodoo economics the laugher curve the smoot holly all the dismal sciences of economics
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:49.440]  but look smoot holly or even having some kind of trade protection is not going to be the end of the
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:55.760]  world it was not the cause of the great depression ben Bernanke said we the federal reserve we caused
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:39:02.320]  the great depression sorry won't do it again and that was a little bit before 2008 chicare
[03:39:02.320 --> 03:39:09.360]  so they did do it again but understand that at one point in time that was the entire revenue
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:15.760]  of the american government jefferson said with his second inaugural address he said by eliminating
[03:39:15.760 --> 03:39:23.280]  useless offices we have been able to eliminate all internal taxation so the weekend say what farmer
[03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:29.280]  what labor what mechanic knows the tax man they did not have any internal taxation to fund the
[03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:35.120]  federal government because the federal government was reduced to constitutional size so it can't be
[03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:41.680]  achieved and it wasn't the end of the world for the united states to have the only taxes be custom
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:47.360]  and import taxes we need to understand that it is not a fair deal we need to understand that there's
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:52.480]  a lot more that's being done to manipulate it this is not just the currency issues it's the entire
[03:39:52.480 --> 03:39:57.920]  thing they call the china price the copyright issues and many other things that are involved there
[03:39:57.920 --> 03:40:03.920]  but we need to address this and just from a pragmatic standpoint but we also need to address
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:09.280]  this because it is going to bring down this country it's going to be used to establish
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:14.560]  a global sovereignty that's the real problem with this now moving on jacar you were at a
[03:40:15.920 --> 03:40:19.920]  body hacking conference in austin yesterday tell us a little bit about that before we take a look at
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:25.200]  the the report that you filed yes this weekend they have the austin body hacking convention and
[03:40:25.200 --> 03:40:30.160]  body hacking is a term that encapsulates everything from piercings and hair colorings all the way up
[03:40:30.160 --> 03:40:35.520]  to more noticeable things such as body replacements you know people have artificial limbs and i heard
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:39.680]  about it necessary because one of the guys that you talked to there was an amputee so yeah yes you
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:44.000]  know some fixing his body yeah some people do it for cosmetic reasons this guy did it for a very
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:48.720]  practical reason he lost his arm in a train accident so i had a chance to go out and speak with him
[03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:53.920]  and he has a rather advanced prosthetic because if you think about you know normally a soldier
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:57.840]  whoever loses a limb they give him you know the old kind of hook hand you know the move the shoulder
[03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:04.480]  and moves this one is a lot more i don't want to say lifelike but it has more features that you
[03:41:04.480 --> 03:41:08.960]  would see as a normal human army can grip and grasp and things such as that well it was really
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:15.120]  interesting looking and of course this guy and i think he kind of alluded to the the comic book
[03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:20.560]  effect of it the look of it you know because it really was a nice piece of hardware it didn't look
[03:41:20.560 --> 03:41:26.240]  like some kind of a fake plastic simulation i mean they went for something that was a unique
[03:41:26.240 --> 03:41:29.680]  look let's play a little bit of that and then we'll talk about the report afterwards go ahead
[03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:36.560]  body hacking a term that encapsulates everything from hair colorings and piercings to more notable
[03:41:36.560 --> 03:41:41.920]  examples such as body modifications if not outright limb replacement we're going to spend the weekend
[03:41:41.920 --> 03:41:46.480]  here at the awesome body hacking convention and while i do anticipate meeting many interesting
[03:41:46.480 --> 03:41:52.080]  people our first guest james is most definitely the star of the show do you just plug it into
[03:41:52.080 --> 03:41:59.280]  a wall or how do you charge it it has a high voltage lithium poly polymer battery and so
[03:41:59.280 --> 03:42:04.480]  it's kind of sensitive and it needs to be charged in the correct way well the big question is how
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:10.640]  does it feel um it's really interesting actually it's it's got a it's got a unique feel it's
[03:42:10.640 --> 03:42:15.600]  quite heavy because of all the technology we put in but also light because of the materials we use
[03:42:15.600 --> 03:42:19.600]  with this high-tech carbon fiber which is just like the lightest thing that we could have chosen
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:23.920]  and we're trying to incorporate some cool stuff it's got lighting in there that we can activate
[03:42:23.920 --> 03:42:28.480]  it's got it's going to have wi-fi bluetooth heart rate sensor and stuff like that to reflect
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:31.840]  my heart rate through the arm and stuff so it's going to have a whole bunch of different features
[03:42:31.840 --> 03:42:36.560]  as well as well i always forget about the drone it's going to have a quad cup to mount it on the
[03:42:36.560 --> 03:42:43.040]  side james's arm came out of the phantom limb project an initiative where video game developer
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:48.640]  kinami teamed with technology companies and sought to fit a gamer with a prosthetic similar to the
[03:42:48.640 --> 03:42:55.200]  one worn by venom snake the flagship character in kinami's metal gear solid five the phantom pain
[03:42:55.200 --> 03:43:00.480]  this is inspired by the metal gear series metal gear is always kind of explore the relationship
[03:43:00.480 --> 03:43:04.960]  between humans and technology you know we've got lots of cyborgs in the series we've got you know
[03:43:05.680 --> 03:43:11.840]  mechanical big mechanical weapons and so using this idea we thought of like maybe we could create
[03:43:11.840 --> 03:43:18.720]  this amazing arm for an amputee gamer so a friend of mine called sophie de olivera barata makes
[03:43:18.720 --> 03:43:23.840]  incredible alternative prosthetics and so i kind of put two and two together and asked her if she'd
[03:43:23.840 --> 03:43:28.560]  be interested in working in this project and she was really up for it so we sort of sent out this
[03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:33.040]  survey to find this an amputee gamer who was really up for the idea of having an amazing
[03:43:33.040 --> 03:43:40.800]  alternative limb we found james we have a 3d modeler called rudy we've worked with open bionics who
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:46.320]  have made the bionic hand now it's not switch on at the moment but there's some sensors in james's
[03:43:46.320 --> 03:43:51.520]  harness which work on on his muscles and he can send signals to his hand and perform all these
[03:43:51.520 --> 03:43:57.520]  different gestures which he can program himself the main part of the arm is made of carbon fiber
[03:43:57.520 --> 03:44:03.600]  by a company called gtr global racing technologies to be honest the the best thing about it is just
[03:44:03.600 --> 03:44:08.480]  how it looks to be honest because i've tried to get used to our health service prosthetic that i
[03:44:08.480 --> 03:44:14.720]  got in the uk and it's just has no personality and for me with with my high level of amputation
[03:44:14.720 --> 03:44:20.320]  it's no great deal of use is there anything implanted in your body anything internal no
[03:44:20.320 --> 03:44:25.920]  uh this this product project is basically we found each other before i'm i'm going to the
[03:44:25.920 --> 03:44:31.120]  implanted stage i'm basically fundraising at the moment to get titanium implants into my
[03:44:31.120 --> 03:44:35.760]  bone so basically i don't need to have this big harness which i'm it's just holding this thing on
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:40.640]  and it will just connect to my bone directly but it costs so much money and in the uk we can't get
[03:44:40.640 --> 03:44:45.840]  that on our health service so i'm really fortunate to have tried this 3d printing hand and the great
[03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:49.920]  thing about a 3d printed hand an open bionics is that they're making it accessible for people
[03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:54.560]  to have this kind of thing at a really low cost do you guys have any plans to make more of these
[03:44:54.560 --> 03:44:59.440]  is this an ongoing project i mean it's been such a labor of love for everyone i think
[03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:03.120]  you know we just want to make this absolutely perfect for james um there aren't any plans
[03:45:03.120 --> 03:45:08.320]  in the moment to to make another one in case you were wondering james was polite enough to
[03:45:08.320 --> 03:45:13.200]  share the story of how he lost his arm i've seen the footage of the cccv and basically
[03:45:13.200 --> 03:45:17.600]  i kind of stepped towards the train as it's arriving and then i'm just walking alongside it
[03:45:17.600 --> 03:45:21.680]  and then the next frame i'm like falling between two carriages all right you can see the rest of
[03:45:21.680 --> 03:45:27.360]  that report at info wars dot com and also on the alex jones channel that's a good example
[03:45:27.360 --> 03:45:32.800]  because from there you go into some spots where they're they're putting chips in people's hands
[03:45:32.800 --> 03:45:38.960]  for free and and that's the the bad side i think of the technology and you know we we look at
[03:45:38.960 --> 03:45:43.840]  uh this arm that he's got and that that that could be a very positive very good thing for him
[03:45:43.840 --> 03:45:50.000]  but then on the other hand no no pun intended you you've got this implant being put in the
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:56.400]  people's hands and and so that's the thing about technology it's always a a mixed bag
[03:45:56.400 --> 03:46:00.560]  and and you know i understand that technology has always been that way you can use things for
[03:46:00.560 --> 03:46:04.560]  good or for evil it's just that over and over again now it seems like the military industrial
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:09.600]  complex that has most of the money just as eisenhower warned us it has now taken all of the
[03:46:09.600 --> 03:46:14.240]  leading tech uh edge technology and using it for evil just like we see this google robot that was
[03:46:14.240 --> 03:46:18.720]  up well as i as i asked james you know towards the end of the report i say you know we see a lot
[03:46:18.720 --> 03:46:24.000]  advances in technology but do you think the day will come when people just uh cosmetically
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:28.560]  augment themselves and he says that day is probably coming but he doesn't recommend it you know he
[03:46:28.560 --> 03:46:32.160]  doesn't recommend people who would cut off their arm yeah he doesn't recommend that you chop off
[03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:37.600]  your arm your leg he says he has his as a necessity not as a cosmetic feature well of course and then
[03:46:37.600 --> 03:46:42.080]  there's the the malicious stuff that's being done by darpa that that video that surfaced yesterday
[03:46:42.080 --> 03:46:47.520]  that was on uh dredge report you can see it uh link there i think still that was pretty amazing
[03:46:47.520 --> 03:46:54.560]  to see how resilient that walking robot was and actually you know very frightening very creepy
[03:46:54.560 --> 03:47:00.560]  because you know that it's not going to be used for benign purpose they're using this is darpa
[03:47:00.560 --> 03:47:06.400]  they use they create weapons and so they are weaponizing walking robots that's the bottom line
[03:47:06.400 --> 03:47:10.480]  folks that's what's happening i think it was when i first started here i guess the same time you
[03:47:10.480 --> 03:47:16.000]  started as well they had the the pedaman and that was the robot they had on the wires and on the
[03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:22.720]  stilts and they walked on the treadmill now they've gone past that yeah and it's amazing how rapid
[03:47:22.720 --> 03:47:27.760]  their progress is with us because they have enormous astronomical amounts of money that are
[03:47:27.760 --> 03:47:34.000]  being poured into this by darpa by google who basically have bought up all the promising robot
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:40.400]  technology so you're talking about just a couple of years ago uh you saw these these first pictures
[03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:44.720]  of their robot project and it had all this attached wires and everything but in this latest one he's
[03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:49.600]  walking through the snow uh you know he makes his way out the door and then he walks through the snow
[03:47:49.600 --> 03:47:54.400]  he stumbles in the snow and the guy knocks him over knock him over and he jumps up and the way
[03:47:54.400 --> 03:47:59.200]  that he jumps up is is actually uh kind of frightening and how quick it is most of his
[03:47:59.200 --> 03:48:03.200]  movements are very slow and deliberate but when he got knocked over and he's in that
[03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:09.200]  crouching position it almost looks like a stop action animation uh from uh uh yeah you can see
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:13.040]  it right there if you're watching this now it halts there for a second then all of a sudden
[03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:17.520]  it makes a couple of tricky movements and jumps up really quickly yeah that's the thing that's
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:25.920]  really concerning it's uh it's definitely a strange strange time to be alive david and i'm not
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:30.800]  exactly sure what the rationale is for having these walking robots yeah what exactly they're
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:34.400]  going to be used for at least what they tell us what they're going to be used for well you know
[03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:37.040]  the other thing too that i thought was interesting and i asked you about that while we're watching
[03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:42.240]  this report uh he was talking about how he's going to get wi-fi and bluetooth in his arm and i'm
[03:48:42.240 --> 03:48:48.160]  thinking why do you need wi-fi and bluetooth in your prosthetic arm it seems to me like you know
[03:48:48.160 --> 03:48:53.600]  you're talking about body hacking uh that would be something that would possibly create a problem
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:48:57.040]  if you've got some malicious hackers they're decided they're going to hack into your arm and all
[03:48:57.040 --> 03:49:01.360]  of a sudden it starts acting like uh the police lieutenant from young frankenstein with a mind
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:05.920]  of its own doing its own thing or well you know that's technology advances like so i'm not exactly
[03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:11.120]  sure you know what all bells and whistles will go going to be in this uh this arm but you know
[03:49:11.120 --> 03:49:14.800]  like i guess that's the question i just never thought to ask is do you think your arm could be
[03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:20.400]  hacked by somebody well you know that that's a good point and you know so let's just let's talk
[03:49:20.400 --> 03:49:25.120]  to people about about the real issues with this because um you know all you people all you boys
[03:49:25.120 --> 03:49:29.840]  and girls who love to talk about conspiracy theories i want you to grab your tinfoil hats and set by
[03:49:29.840 --> 03:49:34.000]  the radio for a moment and we're going to talk to you about real life you know you think you live
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:38.960]  in this safe little bubble and you've got these uniform people that are looking out for everything
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:44.000]  that you do they're going to stomp to death anybody who threatens your little bubble but you
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:50.080]  don't have to worry about them they would never harm you they would never lie to you well the
[03:49:50.080 --> 03:49:56.400]  reality is something far beyond that i want to i want to read to you something from usa today
[03:49:56.400 --> 03:50:03.600]  you know that conspiracy website usa today uh this is from uh steven petrall okay and this
[03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:10.480]  was uh came out today i got hacked midair while writing an apple fbi story he says i don't really
[03:50:10.480 --> 03:50:14.400]  need to worry about online privacy i used to think i've got nothing to hide who would want to know
[03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:19.280]  what i'm up to anyway sure i'm a journalist but i'm not an investigative reporter i'm not a political
[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:25.200]  radical not much interest in anyone really he says that was last week when the standoff between the
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:29.360]  fbi and apple seemed much more about principle than practice to me that's when i thought i'd
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:34.800]  write a column on whether this legal fight matters for regular folks people like my mother or retired
[03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:40.480]  social worker my best friend who works in retail whatever then he says just before midnight my plane

[03:54:07.280 --> 03:54:13.280]  segment i want to complete what i was telling you about this journalist who is on an airplane
[03:54:13.280 --> 03:54:21.840]  going from Dallas to Raleigh working as he said on a story about apple and fbi and as he was doing
[03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:26.560]  this as he was getting off he'd been using the in-flight internet connection to answer emails
[03:54:26.560 --> 03:54:31.280]  and as he was starting to get off the plane in Raleigh he said a guy that was in a row behind
[03:54:31.280 --> 03:54:36.480]  him somebody he'd never seen before came up to him and said i need to talk to you he says i was
[03:54:36.480 --> 03:54:40.720]  kind of taken back he says well it's late i need to get home and he goes you're a reporter right
[03:54:40.720 --> 03:54:45.920]  and he goes yeah he says wait for me at the gate sounds like the x-files doesn't it this is from
[03:54:45.920 --> 03:54:51.280]  USA today by the way he says uh well i didn't answer but i did wait he says how did you know i was
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:54:57.920]  reporter he says are you interested in the fbi apple story he said ignoring my question he said
[03:54:57.920 --> 03:55:02.480]  kind of why are you asking me that and then he dropped the bombshell he said i hacked your email
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:08.320]  on the plane i read everything you sent everything you received i did it to most people on the flight
[03:55:08.320 --> 03:55:12.720]  he had verbatim details of a long email that he repeated back to me essentially word for word
[03:55:12.720 --> 03:55:19.120]  in fact he was steve nolyn gogo's vice president of communications or sorry that's not who uh who'd
[03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:23.280]  listen to it but uh the vice president of communications that provided the on-flight
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:27.680]  internet connection on the plane told him he said the services public it operates in the same way
[03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:33.600]  as most open wi-fi hotspots on the ground and he cautioned him against accessing sensitive
[03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:38.560]  materials while in flight do you understand do you understand that as he's talking about this he
[03:55:38.560 --> 03:55:44.080]  says he was writing to uh bruce schneer who works for the washington post and he says well the current
[03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:51.040]  case is about a single iphone 5c but the precedent it sets will apply to all smartphones all computers
[03:55:51.040 --> 03:55:57.440]  all cars everything in the internet of things now of course it will and you need to understand
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:56:02.880]  that the internet of things is not simply your phone it's not simply your computer it's going
[03:56:02.880 --> 03:56:07.520]  to be every device in your house remember when we talked about this when we talked about uh
[03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:12.720]  uh david portrayus saying that the cia was going to be able to listen to people's conversations
[03:56:12.720 --> 03:56:18.080]  using appliances in their kitchen people said you're a bunch of paranoid conspiracy theorists well
[03:56:18.800 --> 03:56:25.600]  now this guy who writes for us a today has had an awakening because he saw it happen to him remember
[03:56:25.600 --> 03:56:31.520]  when michael hastings car crashed and we said well you know that's one of the easiest cars
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:36.320]  to take over control of the Mercedes because they have the most subsystems in their car
[03:56:36.320 --> 03:56:40.800]  car and it's been demonstrated that they could be hacked and everybody said you're a bunch of crazy
[03:56:40.800 --> 03:56:46.800]  conspiracy theorists and then we had uh i think it was the guy's name was a clark who had been the
[03:56:46.800 --> 03:56:50.160]  director of security for clinton said no we've we've done that to a number of people
[03:56:50.800 --> 03:56:55.520]  i mean we had a clue from the very beginning because of who he was and because of the position
[03:56:55.520 --> 03:57:00.240]  of the engine not being captured in a frontal collision as would happen if he truly had
[03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:06.800]  uh died in a crash with a tree but because the engine was at a right angle more than 100 feet
[03:57:06.800 --> 03:57:12.880]  down the road it's like oh it looks like it blew up and then crashed and the whole idea that it
[03:57:12.880 --> 03:57:18.320]  was flying down the road at 100 miles an hour that is something we all know can be done very easily
[03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:24.160]  we all don't realize just how extensive this control grid is about to become
[03:57:24.160 --> 03:57:30.080]  it's going to control and monitor every movement everything we say and it is
[03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:36.080]  going to constantly analyze everything we say i began this hour talking with alex about one of
[03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:41.600]  the things that really bothered me about ted Cruz and that was his incessant data mining of
[03:57:41.600 --> 03:57:46.640]  prospective voters so that he could feed them precisely what they wanted to hear
[03:57:47.760 --> 03:57:52.880]  breaking them down into a huge matrix and then putting it on a smartphone app for his volunteers
[03:57:52.880 --> 03:57:59.280]  to go door to door so he could make a contact with them just the way they wanted to be contacted
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:06.240]  understand the power of control that will be in their hands when they can monitor our every
[03:58:06.240 --> 03:58:12.080]  movement not only with the internet of things but it's going to be vehicle to infrastructure
[03:58:12.080 --> 03:58:17.280]  communication talking to all the traffic lights talking to all the local government and police
[03:58:17.280 --> 03:58:23.760]  about how you're driving charging you accordingly and increasing your insurance rates it's going to
[03:58:23.760 --> 03:58:28.560]  be bad in a lot of different ways join us tonight jigari jackson will be doing the nightly news
