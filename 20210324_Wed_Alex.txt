[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  But where are the clowns?
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.000]  Send in the clowns
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.000]  Don't bother, they're here
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  Isn't it rich?
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  Isn't it queer?
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  Losing my timing this late in my career
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  Where are the clowns?
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  Where are the clowns?
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  There ought to be clowns
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.000]  Well, maybe next year
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  Why are there so many useless extra people?
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  When robots are so much more smart
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  People are human, all too human
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  People just break my heart
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  I've got a shot that will solve all my problems
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  If only you'll roll up your sleeves
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  Someday you'll get it, the vaccine connection
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  The clowns, little Fauci and me
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  Well, I'm just trying to get everybody to take my new gene therapy vaccine
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  We're going to introduce a little sterilization like we did in Kenya
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  We're going to introduce perhaps some nanobots, that'll be fun
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  Something to fix to the brainstem and engage in physical control of behavior
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  My goal here is most likely a much more smaller population
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  That's more controlled
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  Already people are so very compliant, which is great
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  Everyone wore their masks so quickly and easily
[02:17.000 --> 02:18.000]  I was very, very pleased with that
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  But there's another step we can take
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  Which is total atomic automation of the human soul
[02:27.000 --> 02:28.000]  That's what I'm really hoping for
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  I hope you'll join me
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  Step into my clinic
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  Your upgrade is ready
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  The transhuman age has begun
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  I've got a shot that will make you compliant
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  Sterile and stupid or two
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  Someday you'll get it, the vaccine connection
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  Your body, my nanobots and me
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  All the slowing to hell
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Thank you for making me
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  On the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  At least in government
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  And that's corporations
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  The left have wised up to this
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  Use companies to do it
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  The social media giants, and they are
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  If you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  Has been the radio show host Alex Jones
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  And multinational corporations in Big Deck
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  To silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  And saying, can you ban this person?
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  But this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.000]  For not defending the First Amendment
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  But instead attack dogging
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  Calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  Working with Big Tech
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  People know what's true, they can smell it
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  In a free country, everyone can be heard
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  And say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  But you want to fight, you better believe you got one
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  From the front lines of the information war
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000]  It's Alex Jones
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  Blisters ask me all the time
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  Why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  Why do you have multiple high quality items?
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.000]  Why do you do that?
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.000]  Because different strokes for different folks
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  And we're talking to researchers and scientists
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  And they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  But you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  And the two other types, because some people can't absorb pure iodine
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  Boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.000]  Is it better than X2?
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  Powdered pill sleep aid
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  And that is down and out
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  But they don't compete with each other
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  Different strokes for different folks
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  Different formulas, and it's 40% off
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  Out of the gates at mforestore.com and free shipping

[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  And while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the M4 at the same time

[05:50.000 --> 06:04.000]  At mforestore.com for 40% off and for shipping
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  At mforestore.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.000]  Big judge
[06:28.000 --> 06:29.000]  Up in Wisconsin
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  Former president of drag queen story hour
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  That's the pedophile story hour
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.000]  Foundation and children's court judge
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  A children's court judge
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  My, my, my
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Arrested on seven counts of child porn
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  Milwaukee County Judge Brett Blummy's Instagram page
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  Is filled with personal and professional
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  Highlights on his way to the judiciary
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  But after a search in cottage grove
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  Of one of his two homes and his arrest
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  Authorities say his computer activity on the app kick
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.000]  Links him to child porn
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  With uploaded images and videos
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Consistent with child pornography
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  Through the kick app
[07:09.000 --> 07:10.000]  On 27 occasions last fall
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  Judge Blummy, are you going to resign?
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.000]  What would you like to say to the voters
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  Who put you on the bench?
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  Judge Blummy has been on Milwaukee County
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.000]  Circuit court bench since August
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  His assignment, children's court
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  As a bond condition, he's now banned by a court
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  Of having unsupervised contact with minors
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  It's a club, it's a guild, it's an army
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  It's a force
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.000]  And just like
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  At Penn State, you had Jerry Sandusky
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  Supplying children through the Abused Children Foundation
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  To famous people that would come into town
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  And quote the 9 and 10 11 year old children
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.000]  Would stay with the celebrities
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  In their own little cottages, yes
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  Former Penn State assistant football coach
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.000]  Is charged with sexually abusing
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.000]  10 boys over 15 years here
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  It faces 52 counts
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  The report details accusations that
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  Sandusky would take his hands
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  And place them on their thighs
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  Because they were driving in the car
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  And he would tickle them
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.000]  And blow on their stomachs at bedtime
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  Would shower naked with them
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.000]  And would rape them
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.000]  The jurors finally listening to the interview
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.000]  Jerry Sandusky gave right after he was arrested
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  When he admitted to horsing around
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  And showering with boys, this from NBC
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  I have horsed around with kids
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  I have showered after workouts
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.000]  I have hugged them
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  And I have touched their leg
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  Without intent of sexual contact
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.000]  I have hundreds of articles
[08:44.000 --> 08:45.000]  Of drag queen story time leaders
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.000]  Being busted
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.000]  Kidnapping children, raping children
[08:50.000 --> 08:51.000]  A lot of them have child rape convictions
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.000]  Of 3 year old, 5 year old, 6 year old
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.000]  Albert Garza, a registered sex offender
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  Was among those participating
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  He served time for aggravated sexual assault
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.000]  Of an 8 year old in 2008
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  The system admitted on Friday
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  It did not conduct a background check
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  On Garza as policy dictates
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.000]  We've learned that part of the issue
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  Was that Garza listed his name as
[09:13.000 --> 09:14.000]  Nikki Salazar when volunteering
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  And did not provide a birth date
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.000]  Or social security number
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  It slipped through the cracks
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.000]  And he read to children 3 times
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  And a surprising number of them
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  Are family court judges
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.000]  Family court judges
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  Isn't that just interesting?
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  He was also the leader
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  Of Wisconsin's LBGTQP
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  Literally P society
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  And all over the place
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.000]  The leaders of the LGBT movements
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  Keep getting arrested
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  For having sex with 10 year olds
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  And 11 year olds
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.000]  Because the truth is
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.000]  It wasn't about gay marriage
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  It was always about sex with your children
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.000]  Because it's a satanic ritual
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  To drain off their energy
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.000]  To drain off their innocence
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  And drain off their future
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  The only thing they like better
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  Is chopping your children up
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  With a meat cleaver while they rape them
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  And I'm sorry to tell you that
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.000]  But that's what the big boys do
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  Media blackout
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.000]  On elite pedophiles
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  Cases
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  To banned odd video
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  In the John Bown section
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  You know I was ready to go here
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  For massive news to cover
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  But I wanted to play that right up front
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  So we all understand who we're dealing with
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  And we can put the senate report on screen
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  From five years ago
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.000]  Senate bipartisan commission found
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.000]  Tens of thousands of children
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  Smuggled into the United States
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Were turned over to child predators
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  Who sold them to sex dungeons
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  So remember that
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  When you see all the horrible conditions
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  That these migrants are in
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  Joe Biden said
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.000]  If I get elected
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  Immediately surge the border
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  They show up in Joe Biden t-shirts
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  They show up waving Joe Biden flags
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  This is all over the news
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  And then Joe Biden orders the wall
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  To not be completed
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  And orders them to be basically
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  Released into the general country
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.000]  Even though many of them are as young
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  As three years old kidnapped
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  From their home countries
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  Some of these children have come
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  To be smuggled in by Hispanic males
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  From Latin America
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  Who have nothing to do with them
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  When they're done with them
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.000]  Especially little girls
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  They are handed over for sex slavery
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  But that's okay
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  Because Tim Cook's gay
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  And it's okay
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  He runs death camps in China
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.000]  And it's okay because Joe Biden's liberal
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.000]  And it's like they said last week
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  When the press secretary was asked
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  They said
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  All the small businesses are closing
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  She said it's alright
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  We appointed a woman
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.000]  Over the Small Business Commission
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  So I gave somebody a cigarette
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  And a firing squad
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  Or maybe a last meal
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  But it's not even that
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  She said but he spoke to your plight
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  When we talked about
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  All the horrible things
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  That are happening in the country
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  I mean, Biden's not going to do anything about it
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  But he's going to speak
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  He's going to speak to your plight
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.000]  When the troops are eating rotten food
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  And getting food poisoning
[12:20.000 --> 12:21.000]  And sleeping on the floor for several months
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  She said, well, he hasn't done anything, sure
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  But he said he was concerned
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  Shouldn't that be enough for you?
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  Oh, there's a lot of virtues signaling
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  A lot of talk
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  But yeah, Kamala Harris must think
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  That's amusingly
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.000]  Goes off on child sex trafficking
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  Up 1,967%
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  The border sector
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  Are going to play that segment for you
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  Next segment
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  By the way, it's not just thousands of migrants
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  Photographed hundreds of times
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  Wearing Joe Biden shirts
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  Where are they getting them?
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  From the UN, from the State Department
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  From the Democratic Party
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  From the George Soros Foundation
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  That are all on record funding this
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.000]  But you try to cover it
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  Twitter, Facebook, Google
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  They will take you down
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  To horrible squalor facilities
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.000]  Even worse than under Obama
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  Trump cleaned it up
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  And basically stopped it
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  But now Twitter is taking down those photos
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  Anything to suppress humanity
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  Anything to enslave
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  As long as it's liberal
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  As long as it's a liberal running it
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  Well, then it's okay
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  And here it is
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  Here's the photo
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  It's at GatewayPunna.com
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]  It's also on Infowars.com
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  Mexico
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  It's not just the crowds that have them
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  Surging into the country
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  And the photos of the illegal aliens
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  Wearing the Biden shirts
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  It's flying over the facility
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  Here's the article right here
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  This is very, very important
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  This is a military takeover
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  This is a globalist operation
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  To break the country
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  We are all just here witnessing it
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  What an insane time
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  GAO General Accounting Office
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  Launched its probe into
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  Biden freezing border wall funding
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  It was already funded by
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  Previous administration
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  You're not supposed to do that
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  Feds moving child migrants
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  Into San Diego convention centers
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  So they can then give a tour
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  Biden said for CNN only
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  Of an empty facility
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  Or one of the few kids in it
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  Claiming it's okay
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  Absolutely incredible
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.000]  That's just some of the news
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  On that front
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  Then we have our good little buddy
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  The Islamists
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  They took down his Facebook
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  They took down his Twitter
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  We saved it
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  And we're posting it
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  As we speak to Infowars.com
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  What Facebook doesn't want you to see
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  Of the mass shooter
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  At the grocery store in Boulder
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  A few days ago
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  He was a big huge leftist promoter
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Open borders promoter
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  Trump hater
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  America hater
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  And white person hater
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  And he went and killed 10 white people
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  But if you try to show what he said
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.000]  And how he hated white people
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  They will take it down
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  Because they're busy having the fact checker say
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  He's white
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  And he was attacking people of color
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  And Obama even said
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  This was a racist, misogynistic attack
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  And Michael Moore said
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  This man is the perfect example
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  Of American culture
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  This poor little Muslim
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  That came here from Syria
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  Like Ilhan Omar
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  And all the rest of these people
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  Bitching and complaining
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  He was reportedly threatened to kill
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  His white classmates
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  Calling them all racist
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  When he lose a wrestling match
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  He would call them all racist
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  And say, I'm gonna kill you
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  That's in the major Denver newspaper
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  Incredible
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  Kill the white people
[15:55.000 --> 16:24.000]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  We're not a human species
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  To mutate us into a form that they can control
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.000]  Like a pawn on a chessboard
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  The bottom line is they want to play God
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  They are playing God
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  And the news is only gonna tie it around
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  Our necks from here on out
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  So many other people want to be positive
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  They want to put out fake news
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  And want to only cover limited amounts
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  What's happening with the new world order
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  But at the end of the day
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.000]  It's all about the population
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  It's all about world government
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  And all its ashes and nightmare being built
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  Only admitting it can turn around and stop it
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  Alex Jones here with the new M4 War sale
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  And it is a fantastic sale
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.000]  It is many of our best selling products
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  That just so happened to also be selling out
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  But despite that they're 50% off
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  And free shipping on these select items
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  Again, all these are selling out
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  Except for Rainforest
[17:15.000 --> 17:16.000]  It finally came back into stock
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  It's amazing, it's 50% off
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.000]  And free shipping
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  The Cabochill, the Vaso Beach, the Alpapower
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  All of these are best sellers

[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  Or AAA-253-3139

[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  Plus all of the Emirates Essentials
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  Essential oils, natural deodorants,

[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  A whole host of products
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  The entire Emirates Essentials line
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  Is close to selling out
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.000]  More coming in a few months

[17:56.000 --> 17:57.000]  A 360 win
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  The Alex Jones Show
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.000]  And all glory goes to God
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  At his son, Jesus Christ
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  Thank you all for your support
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  I am Alex Jones, your host
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up later in the broadcast
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  And I'll get back into the giant
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  Human trafficking, smuggling, pedophile operations
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  That the left was so pissed
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  They weren't getting any more
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  A little Hispanic and a little African
[18:53.000 --> 18:54.000]  And a little Asian and a little Arabic
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  And little European children
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  European children being smuggled out of Europe
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  And the US
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  Brown children being smuggled in
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  You always take them away from their families
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  Away from their people
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  Away from their language
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  You don't want to kidnap white kids in the US
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  Or other kids for that matter
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  And then have them still here
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  Because they can speak English
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  You take them to a non-speaking English area
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  And that's how all the sex trafficking operates
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  You know, the Democrats heavily involve it
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  That's why they always claim they represent children
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  Oh, the children of mass shootings
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  The Democrats care about them
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  They don't want to get in the womb
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  Kids, they couldn't gang rape or sacrifice
[19:32.000 --> 19:33.000]  So they'll try to make them transgender
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  And chop their testicles off
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.000]  It's all about hurting your children
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  And as soon as you figure that out
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  These are demonic monsters
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  The sooner we beat them
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  They are a cult
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  Most of them are pedophiles
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  Mid-level Democrats sit up are pedophiles
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  Remember that
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  You don't even get in the club unless you rape children
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  And so we're going to give you more of that information
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  For the last lines of defense
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  They're not perfect, but they're not pedophiles
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  On average, one of the lowest concentrations of them
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  And that's why they know to just target any Democrat
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.000]  Any Democrat operative
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  And they're going to be a pedophile half the time
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  That's why they're getting busted every day
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.000]  While the Democrats are so pissed
[20:12.000 --> 20:13.000]  They have a certain lockdown, killing the dollar
[20:14.000 --> 20:15.000]  Flooding our borders, trying to bring everything down
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  That's their only hope because time is running out for them
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  Let me tell you what else is coming up
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  We have Joe Hoff with the Gateway Pundit
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.000]  With huge exclusive news
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.000]  Breaking exclusive location
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  An origin of COVID-19 pandemic identified
[20:28.000 --> 20:29.000]  Between two of China's biological warfare facilities
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  In Wuhan
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  We've known that for a while, but now they've got smoking gun
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  Information
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  We've got huge COVID-19 martial law
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Rollout news
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.000]  We have Matt Damon worshipping
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  Bill Gates, completely seconding an evil
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  We have BLM holding over a hundred people hostage
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  Every count of this is a felony
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  So now they don't just come into restaurant and smash glasses
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.000]  And have glass thrown in your eyes
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  And throw your food on the ground and throw coffee on you
[20:57.000 --> 20:58.000]  Now they hold you hostage
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  And the media and the police are just in these blue cities
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  Are sitting there and going along with it
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  That footage is coming up in the last segment of this hour
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  And it ties into the suppressed Facebook and Twitter
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  That they deleted of the shooter
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  Who's now confessed to shooting
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  Because he hates white people and hates America
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.000]  And they're desperately and bolder
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  Trying to suppress the execution of 10 white people
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  And saying that it was a white supremacist attack
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  And Obama is currently saying it was a white supremacist attack
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  And a misogynistic attack
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  This is upside down world
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  That is coming up as well
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  Also, COVID-19 funding's being siphoned off
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  Here's an example of Seattle Fox News reports
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.000]  Five million of COVID-19 money
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  Going to fight anti-Asian bias
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  Where they teach that whites hate anti-Asian bias
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  And they teach that whites hate anti-Asian bias
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  And they teach that white people hate anti-Asian bias
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  And they teach that white people hate anti-Asian bias
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  And they teach that white people hate anti-Asian bias
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  Where they teach that whites hate Asians
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  And whites are bad
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  When the lowest crime rate in America
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  Is white on Asian crime
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  Look it up for yourself
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  The highest crime rate in the US
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.000]  Is it just so happens it's black on black
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.000]  After that it is black on Asian
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  And black on Hispanic
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  It's just a fact
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  I'm not demonizing anybody
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  It's just facts
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.000]  And so incredible white people
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  In Boulder
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.000]  Did you hear it was 10 black people died
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  Did you hear that
[22:19.000 --> 22:20.000]  Oh, the weird white crazy in-cell
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  That went and killed the poor sex workers
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  That happened to be Asian
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.000]  Oh, he did it because they were Asian
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  No, he did it because he was a demonic in-cell pervert
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  But are there white killers?
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  Absa-freaking-lutely
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  Whites are the third most
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  Dangerous group in the United States
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  Just statistically
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  Men commit 95% of violent crime
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  It doesn't matter
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.000]  It doesn't matter because 90% of men
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  Aren't committing crimes
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.000]  Just don't put out fake statistics
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.000]  That's all coming up today
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.000]  And huge Bitcoin news as well
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.000]  From the Federal Reserve
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Max Kaiser joins us
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  Tamara to talk about that
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  But we have Joe Hoff joining us
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  Then Drew Hernandez
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  That amazing investigative journalist
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  That's caught all the incredible antifreeze
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  Around the country
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  And it's caught incredible exclusive footage
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  He'll be sharing with us in the third hour today
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  Then I will be hosting the fourth hour
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  With Roger Stone
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  With a lot of big political news
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.000]  And his point of where's the plan
[23:22.000 --> 23:23.000]  By Americans and by conservatives
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.000]  To fight the globalists
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  There isn't one right now
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  So as usual, we will launch the blueprint
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  Or victory
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  With a big enough megaphone
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  With you out there to get the word out
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  That's all coming up as well
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  I want to get back to the globalist
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  For the trafficking of children
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  Next segment because we're going to need some time
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  I'm going to play this clip from Fox News
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  With the Texas Lieutenant Governor
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  And others laying out exactly what's going on
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  But first, if you're a TV viewer
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.000]  You're probably noticing I don't normally
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  Have a bunch of products up in front of us
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  But I wanted to remind myself to do this today
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.000]  Before the first half hour of the broadcast
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  Was over
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  A, these are great products that are game-changing
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  And, of course, it also funds this operation
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.000]  Which then makes the world a better place
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  And stands in defiance against the globalist
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  And they're attempting to shut us down
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  So it's a 360 win
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.000]  And so we had that big sale
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.000]  Everything free shipping in the store
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  Everything 40 to 60% off
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  So many things sold out
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  Or were close to selling out
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  We had to cut the scale back
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  But we still have free shipping on select
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  Best-selling items
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  All sold out, out of power
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  Totally sold out
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  We had prostigards selling out soon
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  Dr. Jones' natural toothpaste
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  Actually, the charcoal, it's amazing
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  Selling out soon
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  All of it about to sell out
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.000]  Dr. Jones' extra-shrink, cabochil
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  And regular-shrink selling out soon
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  All M-Rex essentials, including the three
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  Organic hand sanitizers
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  That smell so good with organic essential oils
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  The healthy alternative
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  To the toxic hand sanitizers
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  Those are all 50% off
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  Also, anybody that spends $75 or more
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  In the store will get a free gift
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  Worth $10 or more as well
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  And they're free shipping
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  Again, on that
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  Infoorstore.com
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  Or AAA-253-3139
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  But what's the new part of the sale
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  Because some things are selling out
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  And we're off the list
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  We're adding four things
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  That are very close to selling out
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  That is the original best-selling
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  Deep-Earth Crystal
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  Highest-quality good halogen iodine
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  You're going to find
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  We have to get a DEA license
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  Even get this little manufacturer
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  Until it's put in this state
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  It's not under DEA control
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  Because it's a precursor
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  Obviously, a lot of things
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  It's so essential to the entire body
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  So essential to so many chemical
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  Things in the body and in nature
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  It's that magic
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  It's not absorbed the other types of iodine
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  But X3 is for folks that want something different
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  It's different strokes, different folks
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  Try it out
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  Then we have X2 in a spray bottle
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  So you can aerosolize it on your skin better
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  Or in your throat
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  And get coverage down in your esophagus
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  We have that 50% off and then
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  We have this baby
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  This is the strongest surface sanitizer
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  You're going to find out there
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  Do not take this orally
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  This is poison, ladies and gentlemen
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  This is super-grade, super-industrial
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.000]  Nacin iodine
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  No one has ever come out with something like this
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  That's nascent
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  They use this in hospitals
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  Everywhere else, similar types
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  This is for surface like stainless steel porcelain
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  Not for fabric and things
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  It's 50% off nascent iodine surface spray
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  High-powered cleaning agent
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  The nuclear option
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  All the iodine products
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  At infowarstore.com
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  3.61
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  So please take action today on the sales
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  A lot of the stuff is close to selling out
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  That's why it's the big mega blowout sale
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  Or my time and rattle off
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  The success is info versus that
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  If you're paying attention
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  You know we've done together
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  But I'll tell you this
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  The technocrats are really up in their game
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  And they are trying to destroy
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  All independent forms of media
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  They're trying to shutter
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  And silence the human resistance
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  So now is the time
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  To understand that everything we've talked about
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  Has been proven accurate
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  Everything you warned your friends and family
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  About is going to have to be true
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  The power structures are to silence
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  Those of us that they can
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  But it's up to all of us
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  To not let them silence any of us
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  We have the power
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  But the sun is setting on humanity
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  And setting on free speech
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  To make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  So be the tolerbearers you are
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  Look I've proven
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  That info wars information
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  Is some of the best in the world
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  It's just absolutely on target
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  The globalists can't stand us
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  Because we've studied how they operate
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  They want to keep you in the dark
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  I believe in humanity
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  And I want to see you empowered
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  Because I know that John F. Kennedy was right
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  Raising tide raises all ships
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  Now the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  The compounds we have
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  And infowars.com are the very best
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  Sourced, wildcrafted, organic
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  And natural products you're going to find anywhere
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  Whether it's natural defense
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  Or whether it's Ultra-12
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  Or whether it's X2 or DNA Force Plus
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  Or Prostagard or Vasovitz
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  These are all cutting-edge, top-of-the-line products
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  That will help you and your family
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  At the same time from the info war
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  So don't procrastinate
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  Take action today at infowarsstore.com
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  Randy Dewright
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  Thanks for holding it on the air
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  First of all, let me say I love your products
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  I am a granny
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  And for all the senior citizens out there
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  That may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  Or age spots as they're lovingly called
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  My skin is just really gorgeous, actually
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  People think I'm 55 years old
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  But I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to do
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  But when I started taking it
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  But, you know, over a period of time
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  I started noticing, okay, you know
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  This is a ticket, this is working
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  This is wonderful, you know
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  And it really has totally cleared up my skin
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.000]  Brain Force Plus, by the way
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.000]  One of my all-time favorite products
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  I completely owe my ability to do this job
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.000]  I owe my ability to have graduated college
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  Four or five years ago
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.000]  I owe it completely to Brain Force Plus
[30:09.000 --> 30:10.000]  One of the most powerful nutraceuticals you will find
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  I put it right up there with Turbo Force
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  I love Turbo Force, it's great
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.000]  But when you don't have time
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.000]  Or you don't have the wherewithal to drink
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.000]  A bottle of water
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.000]  Take two capsules of Brain Force Plus
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  And you will launch into the stratosphere
[30:25.000 --> 30:26.000]  You will go to the moon
[30:27.000 --> 30:28.000]  You will not know where all your energy came from
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.000]  And then you will remember it
[30:30.000 --> 30:31.000]  But there is no crash
[30:32.000 --> 30:33.000]  That's the important part about Brain Force Plus
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  Is there is no crash
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  It's not like drinking three cups of coffee
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  To get that same amount of buzz
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  Because you don't come crashing down
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  You also don't get the jitters
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  At least I don't
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  You don't get the anxiety
[30:48.000 --> 30:49.000]  You don't get all of the things that usually come with
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  Drinking coffee or energy drinks
[30:52.000 --> 30:53.000]  Brain Force Plus clean natural energy

[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  www.brainforce.com
[30:57.000 --> 31:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  I'm alive
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  I'm alive
[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  And I'm breathing clean fresh air
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  I'm alive
[31:36.000 --> 31:37.000]  I'm alive
[31:38.000 --> 31:39.000]  My friends, you're alive
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.000]  We're here together
[31:42.000 --> 31:43.000]  And the globalists cannot stand it
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  So it is a fact
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  That Obama worked with the UN
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.000]  To set up UN refugee camps
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.000]  In Central America
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  So that they could begin massive invasions
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  Starting about eight years ago
[31:56.000 --> 31:57.000]  In the United States with giant caravans
[31:58.000 --> 31:59.000]  You remember those huge caravans
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  A few years before Trump got elected
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  Would smash into San Diego
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  They would smash into South Texas
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  They would smash into Arizona
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.000]  And the Yuma area
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  And it would get really, really bad
[32:16.000 --> 32:17.000]  And then Trump got in
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.000]  And pulled the money of those countries
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  If they didn't start blocking
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  And build better fencing
[32:24.000 --> 32:25.000]  And so he basically completely stopped it
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.000]  Remember just three years ago
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  When giant caravans were smashing into the U.S.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  And the national news
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  Would say it doesn't exist
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.000]  In fact there's a little short
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.000]  One-minute intro
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  That's got John Stewart actually on it
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  And he went on national news
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.000]  And said it's totally made up
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.000]  There's no caravans
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.000]  Everyone from the border
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  And Trump says they're coming from plane
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  And they're coming by boat
[32:53.000 --> 32:54.000]  And everybody's like well quick get in the bunker
[32:55.000 --> 32:56.000]  But it was all true
[32:58.000 --> 32:59.000]  And so there is even your Washington Post
[33:00.000 --> 33:01.000]  Even Jeff Bezos' publication
[33:03.000 --> 33:04.000]  Of course that's five years ago
[33:06.000 --> 33:07.000]  Admitting that Obama
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  Placed
[33:14.000 --> 33:15.000]  Thousands and thousands of children
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.000]  With sex traffickers
[33:17.000 --> 33:18.000]  And they found the article
[33:19.000 --> 33:20.000]  There's John Stewart a few years ago
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.000]  Making jokes and saying it doesn't exist
[33:23.000 --> 33:24.000]  Just like Joy Behar
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.000]  And just like Nadler saying
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  There is no such thing as Antifa
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.000]  And by the way black lives matter
[33:32.000 --> 33:33.000]  Has never engaged in any violence either
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.000]  No they just kidnapped 100 people
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  Yesterday according to law
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  I'll show you that next segment
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  So when you see this going on
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  And when Saki says
[33:43.000 --> 33:44.000]  Just have somebody
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.000]  Ten or younger with you
[33:47.000 --> 33:48.000]  You'll get in
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  She's saying bring smuggled children
[33:52.000 --> 33:53.000]  Bring us children
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.000]  And she's doing it up there
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  But it's alright because she's a woman
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.000]  It's like Tim Cook runs giant death camps in China
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  He's gay
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.000]  Hey they're shut down to small businesses
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.000]  But a woman runs a small business organization
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.000]  So it's okay
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  And hey Saki is a woman
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  And you know she wears pink dresses
[34:11.000 --> 34:12.000]  And the states wears pink sweaters
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  So does Oprah
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  They're all wearing pink
[34:17.000 --> 34:18.000]  They're non-threatening
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  And they're smuggling children
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  Just like I told you a year ago
[34:23.000 --> 34:24.000]  Cuomo is knowingly sending people with a flu
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  And with colds into nursing homes
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  Calling it COVID
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  Sending people with fevers
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  Into nursing homes to get a high death count
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  To say it's COVID
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.000]  Over half the death of the state
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  16,800 last count
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  More than 13,000 than 16,000
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  It's almost 17,000
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  Never released new numbers in about a month
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  Or it is it can be over 20,000
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  That's over over half the death of New York
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  Wail
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  And you just why would you do that
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  When you know it's stone cold murder
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  Well why'd they do it in over 20
[34:57.000 --> 34:58.000]  Democrat controlled states
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  And I told you a year ago
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  They're going to bust Cuomo I can tell
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  To send fear into
[35:05.000 --> 35:06.000]  The Michigan and the Pennsylvania
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  Nurses did the same crap
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.000]  The New Jersey governor knows he's in trouble
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.000]  So he came out and defended sending people
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.000]  That were sick into nursing homes
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.000]  Remember Cuomo gave immunity to nursing homes
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  Executives after big campaign donations
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  And then the big banks want old people dead
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  And they want to set the precedent to kill old people
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  And once they've done it
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  Well now they've got all those companies
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  By the shorthairs
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  That's how corruption works
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  You get people into the evil
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  And you get people into the bad
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  Or after they're born or when they're in their mother
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.000]  Now we're not just killing old people
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  Now we're smuggling children in
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  And a weird crazy-eyed woman
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  Sits up there and giggles and laughs about it
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  And says just bring a 10-year-old with you
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  Or younger, you'll get in
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  Hey come to the party
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  Just bring a six pack of beer or a bottle of wine
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  No no no
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.000]  Entry into Mordor means bring a child
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  Imagine you're going to Count Dracula's Castle
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  Hey what do you want Count
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  Just make sure you bring me a child
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  For my ladies of the night
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  Oh listen to them
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  The children of the night
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.000]  With beautiful music they make
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.000]  Imagine they're like oh I got brought a little kid
[36:15.000 --> 36:16.000]  Come right in my friend
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  We'll drink the blood together
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  But instead it's we'll torture and rape them together
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  And then put them on welfare and siphon the money off
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.000]  And then put the kids on psychotropics
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.000]  Because they're depressed
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  And then call them disadvantaged
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  And then get more money from the state
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  And get a little kid
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  With whoever's identity they give it
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  And I remember I only worked for a summer
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  At a large
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  Carpet cleaning company
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  Because even back
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  I don't know 25, 30 years ago
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  Whenever it was it was about 30 years ago
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  Now I'm getting old
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  I can admit 25 dollars an hour
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  But let me tell you why you got to do that
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  Because you go to these houses that have
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  Cat crap everywhere, fleas everywhere
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  You walk in and they all jump on your legs
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  And you're picking up furniture
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  And moving it clean as fast as you can
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  Trying to throw up
[37:06.000 --> 37:07.000]  Because you're cleaning up all the cat urine
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.000]  Or whatever
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.000]  But that wasn't why I quit the job
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  I'd go to these houses and I'd be like
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  What's this?
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  Like three rooms with dirty mattresses
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  Five-year-olds, eight-year-olds
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  Weird-looking pedo, potbelly dudes
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  And wife-beater shirts
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  And I'd be like
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  And I'd go to these houses
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  And they were warehousing kids
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  And they get paid to keep the kids
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  To drug the kids, to have sex with the kids
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  And to sell the kids out
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  And so all over Austin
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  They've got underage slave brothels
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  Run by potbelly PBPs
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  That's why I started calling them
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  Potbelly pedophiles
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  So they always got potbellies
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  I mean I had a little bit of potbelly
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  Now it's not been so stressed out with the election thing
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  Just to give a potbelly to me and your pedophile
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  And I didn't figure out quite what it was years later
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  I was like I have a bad feeling
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  What is this? These kids look really desperate
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  Sometimes they try to get out of the house
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  They're like
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.000]  Drag them back
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  So that's going on
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  All
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  Over the place
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  That is happening
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  All over the world
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  That is unfolding
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  And they are hungry and they want more
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  So that's why everywhere they're promoting this
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  Senate Governor here in Texas
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  Talking about sex offenses
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.000]  Are up nearly 2000%
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  In one border sector alone
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  There it is
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Six of our Senate ladies
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  Six Republican ladies went to
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  The border today as moms
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  And they went to the Del Rio sector
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  Where they reported back to me that
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  Sex offenders
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  Are up 1,967%
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  967% in just the Del Rio sector of Texas.
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.000]  Now, sex offenders are defined, Shannon, by people who we've already arrested for
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  committing sexual offenses against children, and they're crossing back two, three
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  times in this country.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  And she laughs about it as the vice president.
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  This is such a serious situation to the sovereignty of our country, to the
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  safety of our citizens and to these people.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  And I'm an elected official.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  When I know there's something serious, I don't laugh about it.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  I don't joke about it because it's wide open.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  There is no control on the border.
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  They're now apprehending people and turning them over without even giving them a
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  court date, not that that mattered.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  There are hundreds of thousands of backlog.
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.000]  So there's Dan Patrick trying to speak sense to Democrats.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  Mr. Patrick, at the top, they're devil worshipers.
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  At the middle, they're sociopaths.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  At the bottom, they're gullible idiots.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  The Democratic Party is a decadent, savage cult of scum.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  And it's happened in many other cultures in history where the scum takes over.
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  They create a gang.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  They take over civilization.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  And the civilization's over.
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  It collapses.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  And the chai comms and the globalists have allowed all this on purpose to bring
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  us down.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  They don't allow this kind of stuff in China.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  They run death camps and take the organs.
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  But, you know, you snatch a kid off the street over there.
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  They just execute you.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  But here it's OK.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  And this is their time.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  Their time to have their way with our children.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  And it's a total takeover.
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  And so when you look at a Democrat, when you look at Saki, when you look at Kamala,
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  they are enablers.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  They are there.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  The globalists put women in those positions.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  They say, oh, look, it's women.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  They love the children.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  Or they have men dressed like women, like the Health and Human Services Deputy Ed,
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  who is obsessed with state funding of chopping small children's tentacles off.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  It's all about hurting children.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  They don't want to just rape them.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  They want to hurt them bad.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  So as soon as you realize that, you'll understand everything.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  And believe me, people have now figured out, I don't have hyperbole here.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  This isn't exaggeration.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  This is who they are.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  They want you.
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  They want your future.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  They want your children.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  They want you dead.
[40:48.000 --> 41:17.000]  We'll be right back to show you Black Lives Matter kidnapping over 100 people being praised for it.
[41:18.000 --> 41:24.000]  We have a lot of these high-end, super-pure quality essential oils in basically every popular
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  sentence out there.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  Then, of course, we have the natural shampoo, organic.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  We also have the body wash.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  It's all there.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  And our best-selling organic deodorant from Enrich's Essentials.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  50% off.
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  And free shipping, part of our big blowout sale that's taking place right now.

[41:49.000 --> 41:57.000]  50% off and free shipping right now at infowarstore.com on these select items.
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.000]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  this is all a test.
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  This experience, this mindfulness planet is a reckoning.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  And it really does come down to that.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  God is the author of us having free will.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  The population has been trained to submit to what you're told and it's all going to pass.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold,
[43:13.000 --> 43:14.000]  being totally enslaved.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  move.
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.000]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[43:23.000 --> 43:28.000]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign,
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying,
[43:43.000 --> 43:49.000]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  The people are awakening.
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS
[44:11.000 --> 44:17.000]  especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets
[44:17.000 --> 44:22.000]  when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  what's going to happen in mass movements.
[44:24.000 --> 44:31.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  In their own words, they admit it.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.000]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.000]  They're Faraday cages.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  They work absolutely great.
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  because it's not their business.
[44:54.000 --> 45:23.000]  Thank you for watching.
[45:25.000 --> 45:33.000]  Yes, it is.
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  And the globalists think they got time on their side for playing checkers.
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  I am playing 3D chess, 5D chess.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  But I tell you, it hurts to actually look at things at that complex level.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  And it'll give you headache.
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  And I assure you, the globalists aren't thinking 3D chess because they don't care.
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.000]  They want the power now.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.000]  They want the control now.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  They're smart, but not smart enough to not get destroyed in the process.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  Smart, but not smart enough.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  Well, let's look at it right now.
[46:06.000 --> 46:11.000]  And again, I love all God's children.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  But you know black people are being set up for a big fall worldwide.
[46:15.000 --> 46:21.000]  When the globalists aren't poisoning them and killing them with poison vaccines and GMOs and HIV and the rest of it,
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  they are then spoiling the living hell out of young black people in the U.S.,
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  sending them to universities to teach them to hate America,
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  to teach them basically Barack Obama's poison.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  And I look at the videos of Black Lives Matter.
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.000]  They're so bad.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  I can't even watch them.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  I mean, going into restaurants, they don't care.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  They're going to black home restaurants and start attacking white people.
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  They'll go into, I mean, in Dallas, there's all that footage of them going into black-owned restaurants
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  and literally starting fist fights with the black owners trying to kick them out
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  as they smash white people, black people, you name it, dinners in front of them.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  Because they don't care about Black Lives Matter.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  It's about keeping us shut down, intimidating us.
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.000]  You ask, why would somebody do something this over the top and this crazy?
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  They do it because they've been told by Soros to go do it.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  They're paid to do it, and they're seeing how far they can push us.
[47:11.000 --> 47:17.000]  And guess what? We keep putting up with it so it's going to get worse.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  The article's up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  It's also from gatewaypundit.com.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  BLM Mob traps 100 customers inside grocery stores.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  We're shutting stuff down.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  S, down.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  SH, you know what? Down.
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  And they kept them in there for a long time.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  Now, let me show you under federal and state law.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  This is Title V, offense against the person, Chapter 20,
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and smuggling of persons.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  And that's what O.J. Simpson went to jail for over a decade for.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  And these were folks he found out were counterfeiting his stuff, and he was pissed at him.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  I might say he was right, but, you know, I kind of get it.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  I've had similar thoughts before.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  People screwing me over, but he actually acted on it.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  And I'm not defending O.J. Simpson.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  I'm just saying it turned out they were running a scam on him.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  But he goes up there and wouldn't let him leave and basically held him there.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  Now, that is a crime in their hotel room, and he went to jail for that, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:13.000 --> 48:19.000]  O.J. Simpson found guilty of armed robbery and kidnapping.
[48:19.000 --> 48:27.000]  Meanwhile, Democrat Senator Tammy Duckworth says she won't vote for any white Biden nominees unless they're gay.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  Again, the Black Lives Matter George Soros agenda.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  Black Lives Matter protesters mobilized in Rochester, New York
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  because a cop was in a questionable shooting and the grand jury didn't indict him.
[48:41.000 --> 48:53.000]  So they go to a grocery store, a Wegman's grocery store, and trap the estimated 100 people in.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  Some reports are this went on for at least an hour.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  You know, what do you got to go home to your kids?
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  What do you got a grandparent to take care of?
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  I mean, I'm sorry, and I'm not a guy shoot my mouth off.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  But if a couple hundred people came and blocked me inside a grocery store and I had to go somewhere,
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  I can't help it.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  I'm going to get violent.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  And then it's going to be called a race war.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  No, some white people blocked me in a grocery store.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  I'm going to start kicking their ass.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Brown people, I don't give a damn.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  At a certain point, folks, this is out of control.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  And if we put up with this, we'll put anything.
[49:24.000 --> 49:31.000]  So we're going to show you the video right now for radio listeners.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  But this is being praised on Facebook and Twitter as a good thing.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  They just go randomly to a grocery store.
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.000]  And there's black people, white people you name it inside and block everybody in and start screaming at people.
[49:45.000 --> 49:52.000]  And they surrounded the whole building and the emergency exits and wouldn't let people out.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  And look, I'm a man, so I'm still pretty tough at 47.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  I'm still being intimidated and angry by this.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  Imagine being a woman.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  Imagine being an old person.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  Imagine being some 80-year-old woman on her walker trying to get some food.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  This is sub-behavior.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  It's criminal and it's disgusting.
[50:08.000 --> 50:16.000]  And the police need to stop kissing the ass of these type of globalist thugs and need to start arresting them for racketeering.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  What do you think the Italian mafia got in trouble for?
[50:19.000 --> 50:25.000]  They'd send in 10 thugs to a grocery store and break a few things or threaten to burn it down if you didn't pay them protection money.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  And they got taken to jail for that and they should.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  But when black people do it under Soros' orders, it's supposedly okay.
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  And it's disgusting and it's crazy and it's nuts.
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  All right, go ahead and roll the footage of Rochester, New York.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Go ahead and turn the audio on.
[50:44.000 --> 51:01.000]  Let's go.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  There's the old lady on the walker.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.000]  And this went on for over an hour and people couldn't get out.
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  And let's say what it is.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  This is the equivalent of KKK.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  This is a bunch of black people and white people.
[51:14.000 --> 51:22.000]  And I guess it looks like there's some brown people there that are literally angry randomly at random people at a grocery store.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  And you see in the video, there's like an hour of it.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  The old lady on the walker looks like she's about to have a heart attack.
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.000]  And then she tries to get out the back and they yell at her.
[51:34.000 --> 51:44.000]  So again, and this is just, this video is the beginning of it, hundreds of people surrounded the grocery store, all these big fat welfare queens.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  And again, nothing gives you your fat, but man, all these people bitching about, this country sucks.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  You weigh like 400 pounds, man.
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  You wouldn't last 10 minutes in Africa.
[51:54.000 --> 52:01.000]  But you come here or you get airlifted here when you're a little girl like Ilhan Omar and saved from a rival tribe trying to kill her in Somalia.
[52:01.000 --> 52:10.000]  And then she says America's evil and she says a white supremacist attacked her by the grocery store in Boulder, Colorado.
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  I mean, hell, if some of these black folks killed these people, they just say it was a white supremacist because it's about lying to everybody and it's about getting away.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  And we've literally got videos, yeah, of the white people begging the white people, I'm sorry, I'm white.
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  I'm sorry, I'm evil.
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.000]  Oh, please don't be, don't be angry with me.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  And you have this racist pig monster.
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  And again, bitching about the country where she lives, where she's getting, where he's 400 pounds.
[52:37.000 --> 52:47.000]  Dem senator Tammy Pigworth says she won't vote for any white Biden nominees because white men are bad.
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  Baker, who declined to service to gay couple, super refusing to make a gender transition cake.
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  So your little shop's got to make somebody's cake.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  All the big other private companies don't have to have Christians or conservatives on them.
[53:00.000 --> 53:07.000]  I get it, even though they have liability protection as a utility.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Absolutely insane.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  But now let's move on from Pigworth.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  Let's move on from that racist pig to this stack of news right here.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  And it's on info wars dot com.
[53:18.000 --> 53:26.000]  And this needs to get out because every time Facebook or Twitter tries to block something, you've got to go to websites that are telling the truth that are still there.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  And the answer to the censorship and get it out.
[53:30.000 --> 53:38.000]  She bolder shooters post Facebook deleted to cover up his Democrat radical Islamic anti Trump in seldom.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  We start the next hour.
[53:39.000 --> 53:49.000]  I'm going to read over this how he couldn't get a girlfriend and hated women, how he loved Islam, how he loved Obama, how he wanted open borders, how he wanted to kill Trump.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  And then we can then discuss how they tried to spend that and try to cover that up.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  But guess what, Mark Zuckerberg?
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  Guess what Jack Dorsey?
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  Guess what Tim Cook?
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.000]  Guess what Barack Obama info wars is still on air and other sites are there.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  And when you delete stuff, we've already got copies of it.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  I was here last night and I said they're going to delete that.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  They're like, look at all this stuff.
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  I said, save that.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  Others had already saved it today.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  They took it down.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  Boom, it's on info wars dot com right now.
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.000]  And you can use the fact that info wars is so demonized and so attacked and said, Hey, you've heard him lie about info wars that you've heard them inoculate you to not visit it.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Find out why.
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  Go see it for yourself.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  You're an adult.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  You deserve to see what you're not supposed to see.
[54:33.000 --> 54:42.000]  You're going to see an anti white, anti Christian, anti American, crazy person who got saved from his hell hole in Syria and brought over here when he was a teenager.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  And now he used that.
[54:44.000 --> 54:51.000]  It's all admitted to intimidate white people and beat up white people and say he was going to kill white people.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  See it in the Denver newspaper.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  I can't believe the Denver Post is even telling the truth about this.
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  Yeah, Boulder shooter threatened fake hate crime charges against classmates.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  He attacked.
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  They've got the teachers and the victims all on record and he would just scream, You don't stop me.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  I'll declare a hate crime on you.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  I'll kill you.
[55:10.000 --> 55:20.000]  And Barack Obama, I'm going to play the clip coming up says he was a white man attacking minorities and women because they don't respect you and they do this.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  And Barack Obama has an inferiority complex.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  He has a chip on his shoulder.
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  He is a race based person.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  He's mad at his mother who was a prostitute sex opera of the CIA in porn.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  He hates women and he hates white people.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  He hates himself.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  On the right back with our number two.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  Stay with us.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  God bless you all.

[57:38.320 --> 57:42.640]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say
[57:42.640 --> 57:46.160]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country
[57:50.520 --> 57:53.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:53.360 --> 58:09.320]  There's a man going round taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame
[58:09.320 --> 58:19.280]  Everybody won't be treated all the same there'll be a golden ladder reaching down
[58:19.280 --> 58:28.960]  We've known this for over a year but now it's confirmed witnesses and documents have come
[58:28.960 --> 58:35.080]  out that the Wuhan lab did release the bio weapon and it was to empower China so they
[58:35.080 --> 58:38.200]  could take over the world and that's now all confirmed even mainstream news is admitting
[58:38.200 --> 58:43.080]  it Joe Hoft has the exclusive there's a lot of context in China obviously he used to live
[58:43.080 --> 58:47.360]  over there he's going to be joining us from the Gateway Pundit coming up the bottom of the hour
[58:47.360 --> 58:52.720]  than we've got a bunch of other really incredible informative guests coming up and next segment
[58:52.720 --> 59:00.200]  is going to be huge I want to encourage listeners and I want to encourage viewers to do something
[59:00.200 --> 59:06.840]  about the globalist takeover and there's no other place out there that is really developing
[59:06.840 --> 59:12.760]  a plan to block the globalists and to expose their operations completely that is doing
[59:12.760 --> 59:20.040]  it at any level similar to info wars Tucker Carlson is promoting populism and American
[59:20.040 --> 59:29.120] ism at a splendid level and is doing a very slick professional loving balanced job and
[59:29.120 --> 59:33.280]  there are a lot of other people that are hitting on all cylinders and I'm proud of them and
[59:33.280 --> 59:38.960]  I sleep at night knowing they're there and there's so much up and coming talent in the
[59:38.960 --> 59:45.320]  fight of every race color and creed it makes me proud of everybody but the enemy knows
[59:45.320 --> 59:51.520]  that info wars nine times out of ten is the genesis point of major resistance movements
[59:51.520 --> 59:56.560]  that are devastating the new world order's operations and so I'm not going to spend time
[59:56.560 --> 59:59.280]  getting into all the things they do to us I'm not going to say the things that they're
[59:59.280 --> 1:00:03.320]  doing that have an effect the things that deflect the things that don't have an effect
[1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:06.800]  because I'm not going to give the enemy any idea of where to keep attacking but let me
[1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:13.760]  just tell you this do not sit there and expect info wars to be here forever I've had a lot
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:18.560]  of classy family that had cancer and was dying and you just hear that that member of the
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:22.920]  family is dead they were at work one week totally nice got their affairs in order so
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:27.960]  manly so tough so feminine so tough that they just died make no big deal about it and donate
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:33.680]  your bodies of science and stuff like that I'm not a stoic as some of my ancestors and
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:40.400]  I don't have cancer but America has cancer and this operation has a giant globalist squid
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:47.320]  attached to us gnawing on our face okay and I just let it sit there and I know how far
[1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:54.400]  it can go until it gets to our orderies and I'm laying eggs real fast escape pods too
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:58.080]  we'll just see how they do getting caught in the whole underwater jet stream here and
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:02.200]  what they'll grow into and what they'll do and I also need to grow a bunch of eggs to
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:07.720]  use that analogy if I'm a fish with a big thing attached to me eating me so I need energy
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:12.160]  to be able to make sure that all those things that we're ensuring in the future continue
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:16.040]  on because that's the main mission and I've and I've looked at all the different possible
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:23.280]  future scenarios and the globalists are so off the chart so crazy now there's a good
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:27.000]  chance that they'll go ahead and just kill me and at a certain level I kind of look
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:31.600]  forward to that because in the big great burden atmospheres of pressure that I have to carry
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:35.680]  out this mission will be going I love life I'll never commit suicide if they if I die
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:40.200]  it wasn't suicide I'm just saying I literally have no more fear I've been through this so
[1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:44.760]  long I've done so much that I don't fear death I don't fear anything I may lose my whole
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:48.760]  family I may lose my children I mean hell the whole world's about to go I mean at this
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:54.720]  point all that matters is our souls but you've got for me a total commitment as strong as
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:59.000]  I can be I will fight it does that mean I'm gonna go off the rails and act crazy yeah
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:05.560]  because I'm I'm I'm burnout folks I'm fried when you fight evil like this at a level
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:11.120]  like this this long you don't just care about them you don't just not care about them killing
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:15.000]  you you don't just not care about you start getting the point where there's no inhibition

[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:46.680]  who's the great investigative journalist who showed some of the most powerful footage around
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:51.360]  the country of Antifa and their peaceful burning of cities with BLM he's been down to the border
[1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:54.680]  and has a lot of exclusive footage about the humans finally and more that we're going to
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:05:00.480]  be showing you coming up next hour but let's get into this right now because we're not
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:06.120]  supposed to show you this and again I have stacks of news about YouTube Google Facebook
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:14.920]  Twitter all of them actively suppressing any information about the shooter in Boulder
[1:05:14.920 --> 1:05:20.960]  being an Islamist that hated women hated Trump and hated white people and it was obviously
[1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:27.120]  all 10 white people in a multiracial grocery store full of different people that he executed
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:31.960]  and again even if you could say the guy you know is quote Syrian so Arabs are a mixture
[1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:39.480]  of Caucasian quote Asians from the East and Africans some have different derivations of
[1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:44.200]  that but it doesn't really matter he didn't like white people so that's why Obama is
[1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:49.080]  saying that it's white people that did this and I've got his quotes I've got the video
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:55.360]  coming up but here it is see Boulder shooters post Facebook deleted to cover up his Democrat
[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:03.720]  radical Islamic anti-Trump in seldom you need to go share this yes you know he's an Islamist
[1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:08.280]  this you know he's an ISIS sympathizer you know he went there to kill white people but
[1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:17.160]  Obama that lying globalist supremacist anti-human dirtbag and Joy Bayhar and all the rest of
[1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:23.520]  the scum are up there telling you still that this was done to kill brown people and they
[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:29.680]  just sees on every damn thing they can to do this ladies and gentlemen so let's start
[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:37.000]  showing people some of the things that are in the article that's at info wars dot com
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.760]  and you can actually pull it up on the side of your show folks but here it is hashtag
[1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:48.080]  need a girlfriend lived in a seven bedroom house rich family when he lost a wrestling
[1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:54.640]  competition he told her buddy I'm gonna kill you Ahmed al-isa yeah if these racist Islamophobic

[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:10.400]  on Trump sucks you know what al-isa who's a Syrian migrant shared an article explaining
[1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:18.680]  why refugees and immigrants are good for America and then a bunch of anti-Trump crap he goes
[1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:22.520]  on to say Trump inherited a growing economy and the unemployment rate was low the economy
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:28.040]  was upward spiral he won because of racism yes that's right all you think about race
[1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:34.720]  he shared a video of Muslim woman allegedly kicked out of a Trump rally she was disrupting
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:41.040]  it oh well women can't even go to rallies in your country so you know he goes on advice
[1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:48.840]  from the Prophet me quotes Islam and quotes Muhammad oh people listen to me and earnest

[1:07:54.280 --> 1:08:01.320]  give your wealth to zakat perform Haji if you can afford to the last term of the Prophet
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:08.440]  Muhammad the Prophet said a Muslim plants a tree or sow seeds and then a bird or a person
[1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:15.560]  or animal instrument it is regarded as a charitable gift the Muslim and the Christ church mosque
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:20.840]  were not the victims of a single shooter they were victims of the entire Islamophobia industry
[1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:26.480]  that vilified him so he went and killed a bunch of white people and it goes on and on
[1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:32.360]  then you've got his anti-American anti-Christian anti-white anti-God anti-Trump father that

[1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:51.720]  news tells 15 year old 14 year old girls have sex with a Muslim they're better to show the
[1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:59.080]  newscast I can show you the children's shows they show in government schools and they put
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:05.880]  full run men with your underage daughters have sex with them here he is Justin Syrian born
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:12.000]  boulder shooter Ahmed al-Esa's identity was previously known to the FBI because they were
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:20.560]  tracking him as a ISIS terror sympathizer of course Obama funded ISIS Biden calls for
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:24.560]  abandoned assault weapons and high capacity magazines following boulder shooting and does
[1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:34.160]  fake crime hate crime all 10 victims of border shooting suspect Ahmed ESA are white and it
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:39.280]  goes on and on and on there's a whole report out he had from Ben Warren on info wars dot
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:47.320]  com and we had ISIS sympathies go read it for yourself and how they scrub the page shows
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:54.560]  your market shooter was anti-trump pro refugee activist now let's move on to Tucker Carlson
[1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:59.120]  says Obama is a racist arsonist I want to play this clip here in just a moment so you
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:02.600]  can see Tucker talk about it but Obama like scores whether Democrats call for gun control
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:07.160]  citing racism and misogyny he's the one that shipped millions of guns into Syria to turn
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:12.120]  it over to ISIS and al-Qaeda and in Mexico the former president statement read it is
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:16.480]  long past time for those with the power to fight the epidemic of gun violence do so it
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:21.160]  will take time to root out the dissatisfaction racism misogyny that fuels so many of these
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:26.040]  senseless acts of violence but can we make it harder for those with hate in their hearts
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:33.320]  to buy weapons of war this is a racist attack on minorities and women because you know they're
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:38.920]  all the same group but there's Tucker Carlson talking about it then we've got Senator Cruz
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:43.840]  getting on the offense the Republicans ought to be having hearings right now on fast and
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:48.440]  furious when the devil oh you want our guns you shipped over two million guns ordered
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:55.640]  gun shops to sell to the CIA she dipped it into Mexico then ship them over to Syria and
[1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:59.760]  other areas for the Arab Spring Obama funded go after Obama for being an international
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:05.600]  gun runner to terrorists instead of sitting there and taking his crap anymore here is
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:09.560]  Tucker Carlson after the mass killings in Atlanta last week none of which seem to have
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:14.440]  anything whatsoever to do with the race of anyone involved Omar tried her best to make
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:18.960]  Americans hate each other even more that's how she's repaying the country that rescued
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:24.920]  her from a refugee camp in Africa law enforcement Omar said was zero evidence of any kind works
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:30.720]  to protect quote the humanity of white mass murderers what does that even mean we have
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.760]  no idea though obviously it is bristling with racial hostility so MSNBC just rolled with
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:42.960]  it scapegoating is the evil cousin of white supremacy and together they reinforce the
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:49.440]  notion that white is always in the right the indifference to lives not white must stop
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:55.440]  the disregard for the fear of white terror must stop we must not be cowed by the terror
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:04.160]  unleashed by white men drowning in the deep end of racism xenophobia and misogyny yes
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:10.120]  good for the country white supremacy that's the culprit no matter what the color the criminal
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:15.600]  was doesn't matter the criminals color because it's systemic racism and like carbon monoxide
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:21.000]  it's an invisible poison that is suddenly a very common view on the left is certainly
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.760]  Barack Obama's position more than any other contemporary American leader Barack Obama
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:31.040]  is a racial arsonist he emerges at our most vulnerable moments to deepen the wounds that
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:36.360]  divide us he shows hate what is Barack Obama do this we'll take a psychiatrist to answer
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:40.560]  that question fully though it seems obvious the deep loathing of some kind plays a role
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:44.960]  it must play a role today Obama took a break from becoming one of the richest men in the
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:50.480]  world to issue a statement blaming racism and misogyny for today's killings so a guy
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:55.480]  who appears to be white shoots a group of white people and Barack Obama calls it racism
[1:12:55.480 --> 1:13:01.040]  that's enough reports on employers I wanted to show you Mustafa Ali say his dad in the
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:08.640]  big seven bedroom house bitching he's praising ISIS attacking Israel in the US saying ISIS
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:18.080]  is good and there you go so and his dad wanting to kill the Shiites so I mean this is you import
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:23.160]  al-Qaeda you get al-Qaeda you import ISIS you get ISIS and you know when he lost a wrestling
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.800]  match he said I'm gonna kill all you white people that's what they've told the Boulder
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:31.480]  news and then the Denver news so there you go that's the facts that's the reality it's
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:37.040]  why we're on air so you can see the level of incredible deception these people are engaged
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:40.960]  in aren't when I come back I want to get into the move to take your guns now we've got a
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:45.440]  fight back against this and the path to victory of the Ted Cruz has taken and people say oh

[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:58.080]  come right back stay with us you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet

[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:05.360]  a lot of credibility but I don't care about that I care about beating the new world order
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:10.040]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer

[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:32.200]  It's literally just broke minutes ago you put it in the search engine there is no news coverage
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:37.280]  of this yet but it's from an impeccable source and so you know it's true we'll get it to
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:41.280]  you as soon as it unfolds I told you I was coming back next segment there's a war on
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:46.400]  the second amendment they've got a plan to totally ban the guns Biden has admitted it
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:51.720]  well now the NRA is reporting it's their case they were fighting the U.S. Court of Appeals
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:56.320]  the Ninth Circuit that's the one in San Francisco just ruled that there is no right to carry
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:02.000]  either openly or concealed in public this ruling impacts RTC laws right to carry in
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:09.160]  Arkansas Hawaii California Arizona Oregon Washington and Montana that was the case
[1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:14.480]  dealing with this is unbelievable and you notice Trump got two Supreme Court justices
[1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:23.080]  in three good Lord and they all voted against him because they know the Democrats will simply
[1:17:23.080 --> 1:17:28.840]  pack the court Democrats said you vote for us you nine or we will make you not as powerful
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:33.920]  and we will pack the court up to twenty one or twenty five judges and they said fine cut
[1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:38.880]  children's genitals off kill babies after they're born take over the elections let the illegals
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:47.720]  vote and take the guns yeah trust the plan folks trust the plan I told you they're taking
[1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:54.560]  over and Trump was a last-ditch effort and the people felt so confident that he was invincible
[1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:58.680]  you see what happened no we're in deep trouble and only admitting how much trouble we're
[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:04.280]  in are we going to get out of this and we've got to go on the offense it's great that Ted
[1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:07.520]  Cruz comes out and says hey a mass shooting like this before he even knew that it was
[1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:12.480]  a lies that was a racial attack he did the right thing and he said it's the right for
[1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:18.560]  us to defend ourselves 99% of gun use is legal and lawful the good people are the majority
[1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:24.400]  of every race color and creed we have a right to defend ourselves Obama and the Democrats
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:28.720]  all have bodyguards in Minneapolis they defunded a third of the police department and then
[1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:33.960]  they hired for millions was like a million and a half dollars around the clock twenty
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:41.320]  four hours a day hired bodyguards at $50 an hour with guns to stay at their houses in
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:45.840]  a van and to be with them right beside them when they go to the bathroom or anywhere I
[1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:51.880]  must say that again in Minneapolis the city council hired for millions of dollars a year
[1:18:51.880 --> 1:19:00.680]  contract to have private security twenty four hours a day with a gun right next to them
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:05.360]  I have that I have to it's a big expense I don't have the first thing out of kind of
[1:19:05.360 --> 1:19:09.160]  we can't operate is that because we have people out there it's going on only sort of doing
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:13.840]  it about three years ago but imagine the difference is you buy products from us you believe in
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:17.480]  us I'm able to have security here at the office and then I'm going to leave it at that because
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:21.520]  we've had them come to the house we have to do that ladies and gentlemen because I've
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:25.760]  got to be working I can't be looking over my back all the time but I'm not for defunding
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:29.840]  the police and I'm not for taking your guns I'm glad you've got a second amendment I've
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:36.240]  got one too but quite frankly I'm so oblivious to threats I've got to have somebody watching
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:44.120]  my back because I just get in a mower I don't give a damn but just again imagine these people
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:49.400]  saying you can't defend yourself with crime doubling and murders over doubling but but
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:55.480]  but they're going to have taxpayer paid for bodyguards these people are evil they're
[1:19:55.480 --> 1:20:01.080]  out of control Governor Newsom got a three point six million dollar house given to him
[1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:07.240]  by a donor totally illegal nobody's going to prosecute him Joe Biden's got all the bodyguards
[1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:11.240]  in the world Barack Obama's got all the bodyguards in the world but you're not allowed to protect
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:17.800]  yourself here's Ted Cruz Senator Cruz laying it out every time there's a shooting we play
[1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:26.800]  this ridiculous theater where this committee gets together and proposes a bunch of laws
[1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:32.880]  that would do nothing to stop these murders Senator from Connecticut just said the folks
[1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:37.400]  on the other side of the aisle have no solutions while the senator from Connecticut knows that
[1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:42.560]  is false and he knows that's false because Senator Grassley and I together introduced
[1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:48.480]  legislation Grassley Cruz targeted at violent criminals targeted at felons targeted at fugitives
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:54.840]  targeted at those with serious mental disease to stop them from getting firearms to put
[1:20:54.840 --> 1:21:01.360]  them in prison when they try to illegally buy guns what happens in this committee after
[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:06.480]  every mass shooting is Democrats proposed taking away guns from law-abiding citizens because
[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:11.920]  that's their political objective but what they propose not only does it not reduce crime
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:17.760]  it makes it worse the jurisdictions in this country with the strictest gun control have
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:22.840]  among the highest rates of crime and murder when you disarm law-abiding citizens you make
[1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:32.600]  them more likely to be victims if you want to stop these murders go after the murderers
[1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:38.320]  Grassley Cruz came to a vote on the floor of the Senate in 2013 it got a majority vote
[1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:43.360]  on the floor of the Senate 52 senators voted for Grassley Cruz in the Harry Reid Democratic
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:50.240]  Senate nine Democratic senators voted for Grassley Cruz the most bipartisan support of any of
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:57.600]  the comprehensive legislation so why did it pass into law because Democratic senators
[1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:00.960]  including many of the senators in this room including the senator from Connecticut who
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:06.640]  just said Republicans have no answers filibustered the law and prevented it from passing demanded
[1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:14.120]  60 votes if Grassley Cruz had passed into law Sutherland Springs very likely would not
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:20.920]  have happened why is that because the shooter there the murderer there had a conviction
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:25.640]  in the Air Force that the Obama Air Force failed to report to the background check system
[1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:30.080]  and Grassley Cruz mandated an audit of all of the convictions to make sure the background
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:35.480]  check database has those felonies in it not only that Grassley Cruz mandated that when
[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:41.400]  a felon tries to illegally buy a firearm that the Department of Justice prosecute them
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:46.320]  the Department of Justice has a long and I think indefensible practice of not prosecuting
[1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:52.680]  felons and fugitives who tried illegally buy guns if Grassley Cruz had passed the gun crimes
[1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:59.360]  task force that it had created would have charged prosecutors with going after gun criminals
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:04.840]  locking them up and putting them in prison that's how we prevent these that we will learn
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:11.200]  in the coming days and weeks the exact motivation of the murderers in Atlanta and Boulder Colorado
[1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:17.080]  we'll learn and that was a few days ago now we know what was it in cell mad at women mad
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:20.680]  at them at the prostitutes and he wanted to kill a bunch of them because he was a sex
[1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:24.920]  addict and this guy was an anti-white anti-American guy we now know that just a day later it's
[1:23:24.920 --> 1:23:30.680]  all come out now but notice that Biden is proposing we're showing the articles for TV viewers
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:34.200]  radio posters I'll tell you about it that they just swatting millions of people and
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:38.520]  try to civil war and that they just take guns from law abiding citizens but leave criminals
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:43.760]  alone like they do in the cities they control so it's just incredible all right Joe Hoff
[1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:47.240]  we're going to shift gears this is a big deal on the night so we'll be tracking that very
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:52.240]  very closely that's just now breaking overturning concealed carry period and this is just you're
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:55.880]  like oh it's a pre-portal overturn that don't hold your breath folks because we don't put
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:24:01.000]  pressure on them they don't fear the American people's political action they fear the mainstream
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:04.760]  media they fear the stacking of the court because nobody calls the bluff of the left
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:12.240]  and so the left is buffaloing us stampeding us and it's only gonna get more crazy go after
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:16.920]  him for fast and furious get on the offense go after him for the child smuggling across
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:22.680]  the border do you like Ted Cruz does but almost everybody else sits there afraid people said
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:26.840]  that Ted Cruz is a jerk he's does not matter he's got guts and guts is enough ladies and

[1:24:54.040 --> 1:25:01.680]  a planetary corporate plan for world government but world government is only the control grid
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:07.760]  now inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:13.360]  and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:19.320]  of all carbon based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:25.400]  the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe they have been
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:31.560]  inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:36.840]  out this transformation I know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:44.520]  globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the information
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:50.880]  to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is the
[1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:55.760]  alien takeover of earth I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate
[1:25:55.760 --> 1:26:00.680]  on air about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the public
[1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:04.040]  is so dumbed down that they don't care that we are stealing their future from them that
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:09.640]  we are poisoning them that we are sterilizing them that they deserve to be killed yes that's
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.040]  the position of the globalist they play god and they think because we don't stand up they
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:19.320]  have a right to do this to us and I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:25.280]  me they tried to join them but metaphysically at a spiritual level I have the Holy Spirit
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:29.280]  I'm the connection to God and I know that God does not like that so I cannot join the
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:34.840]  animal but I'll tell you at a selfish level I get very very mad at people that go along
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:39.200]  with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on them
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:45.720]  whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger you're not God and treating
[1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:50.160]  other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:52.920]  universe doesn't like and that's a fact.
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:57.960]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:03.800]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in

[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:17.600]  According to ancient Samoan legend Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa who
[1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:21.880]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:26.600]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:27.840]  loosen up a little.
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.680]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.

[1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:14.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:41.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show Joe Hoff is a very busy man major corporate business
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:47.520]  manager and auditor lived over in Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, you name it, of course
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:53.720]  joined forces with his brother with the amazing pro-liberty pro-truth website gatewaypunna.com
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:58.760]  the gatewaypunna.com Joe Hoff so he twisted his arm to come on for just two short segments
[1:28:58.760 --> 1:29:03.360]  because you know he's been right at the tip of the spear the cutting edge for over a year
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:08.160]  this came out of Wuhan and it was a psychological warfare weapon but it still could kill some
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:12.760]  people they didn't have the proper vitamins and nutrients and he's had his nose directly
[1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:16.640]  to the grindstone on this and election fraud but nobody else so I read the article had
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:20.640]  a lot of new information that just confirmed a lot of the older information it's a breaking
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:27.840]  exclusive the gatewaypunna.com location of origin of COVID-19 pandemic identified between
[1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:32.240]  two of China's biological warfare facilities in Wuhan where we know Bill Gates and Fauci
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:39.240]  were funding at least 11 programs into gain of function coronavirus Chimeras and so he's
[1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:45.600]  got it all right here it is a lengthy article but absolutely critical with all the documentation
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:50.280]  so in the next 25 minutes I want to try to give him the floor to walk through all this
[1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:56.000]  and why this is such such a big deal doesn't matter the UN funded and financed by China
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:00.120]  pro-communist who tells us oh no hell we're told by Joe Biden it's the American virus
[1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:05.520]  of the European virus but Joe Hoft is here to break down what it really is so great job
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:10.600]  on this from from day one but now it really you've got them here so thanks for joining
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:15.920]  us and tell us about it thanks Alex it's great being here too by the way always a pleasure
[1:30:15.920 --> 1:30:22.880]  yeah I was thinking and reminiscing a bit too from the last time we chatted maybe about
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:28.720]  this was well a year ago was it was in March last year that we first talked where we talked
[1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:35.720]  about how we done covered that the WHO's estimates for the COVID of being around three and a
[1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:40.520]  half percent and you were in Asia then you've come back to America now that's right that's
[1:30:40.520 --> 1:30:45.160]  right and there was a late call from me from Hong Kong at about 11 at night Jim and I joined
[1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:51.280]  you and and yeah we we uncovered that we could see that these numbers weren't accurate that
[1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:57.800]  they had overstated the mortality for the COVID and they weren't with they weren't and yet
[1:30:57.800 --> 1:31:04.080]  they were using the flu as a as an alternative measurement and yet it was calculated totally
[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:09.880]  differently and where they add in of 25 or so million people for the flu in the US to
[1:31:09.880 --> 1:31:15.160]  determine mortality but they weren't doing that with COVID so it really sounded horrible
[1:31:15.160 --> 1:31:18.480]  and that was the time where the whole world's starting to freak out about all that was going
[1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:25.120]  on so I I like what you shared there early on Alex just in the intro here is just about
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:33.600]  the fact that this was as much biological type of warfare as it as it was it was it was used
[1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:40.640]  to just shut down the world economy and so as a as a fear tactic as much as anything
[1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:48.520]  as well maybe maybe even more so yeah we were we were right then and last summer they the
[1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:56.320]  WHO on the CDC announced that oh we yeah we've overstated the mortality rate and there's
[1:31:56.320 --> 1:32:00.880]  now millions of people that have had COVID and yeah the mortality rates not going to
[1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:06.360]  be three and a half percent is going to be close to the flu so that's some things that
[1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:11.320]  you know happened since since we last talked quite a bit as as you all know so been quite
[1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:20.680]  a year so anyways today we uncovered a document that's been apparently been available in in
[1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:27.920]  China for a bit for a bit of time and that document shows a map a pretty rudimentary
[1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:37.200]  map of Wuhan and what it was it was it was initially showing was where the where the
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:44.600]  first cases of COVID were coming out in Wuhan and you can see from that map and I saw you
[1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:51.440]  showed it here just a minute ago that the the food market in that map you'll see is
[1:32:51.440 --> 1:32:59.360]  that red dot which is up apparently on this map it's it's showing north of the area that's
[1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:07.080]  really black which is the area where the most cases were initially found and then that area
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:14.600]  that's really really dark where this is signifies the most cases is between a couple biological
[1:33:14.600 --> 1:33:21.720]  warfare facilities one is the entity that we've talked about for a long time maybe four we
[1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:28.200]  started reporting on this that Wuhan Institute of Virology back in April last year and where
[1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:35.720]  it looked like yeah this is what's going on something was released from there and then
[1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:41.160]  where that is another entity they're calling this label the biological preparations Institute
[1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:49.480]  BPI it's the yellow square on that map and between these two facilities is where they're
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:59.520]  saying the initial cases the the the large number of initial cases were first identified
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:06.880]  so giving us you know more you know I guess more evidence that this thing wasn't just
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:13.840]  something that was natural that occurred in the food market that red dot no the big the
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:18.720]  large number of cases comes between the black star there in the yellow box which are these
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:25.160]  two institutes where they've been studying and researching and and trying to build not
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:34.400]  just coronavirus flues but the vaccines as well so and we have the mainstream media in
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:39.120]  thousands of articles Reuters AP New York Times celebrating China did it right they're open
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:43.280]  for business they produce more billionaires and all billionaires combined in one year
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:49.720]  of you know America's done China's open for business they admit that this was basically
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:56.480]  something they used to shut their competition down I agree Alex and that's the thing that
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:02.160]  nobody seems like in the US is really willing to take a stand on and maybe maybe we can
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:08.120]  you know again today when I was in Hong Kong Hong Kong I could see over the three years
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:16.640]  of President Trump that he had totally destroyed the competition namely China in the economic
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:22.880]  and battle that had been ensuing over the last or the prior decade or so Trump Trump
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:28.240]  crushed China he made them into a paper tiger in very short order and he just did a few
[1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:34.960]  things and he stood up to him first of all he had the attitude that hey we're gonna we're
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:42.080]  gonna deal with you and and he he didn't come at them as a adversary so much I can remember
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:47.840]  him saying and the people in China admired the fact which Trump came over at the first
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:53.800]  time that he said hey I don't blame you guys I blame our politicians who put us in such
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:36:00.920]  a horrible situation I'm not starting a war we've been in a war for 40 years it's been
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:05.800]  a trade war and we're now just fighting back that's right he said it but the thing the
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:10.480]  facts are they they have you know you have done and he I remember him saying this to
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:15.600]  she and I'll tell you the people that I know in China were very impressed by this he said
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:21.720]  to she you're doing what you should do you are you know you're standing up for your people
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:26.760]  and you've been doing it and he goes I don't blame you that's what you're supposed to do
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:31.440]  and he said but but we've got to change thing in our things in our country because we've
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:36.480]  been given away the farm basically and and instead we have all these traders and boy
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:41.360]  didn't we see last week up in Alaska how they totally disrespect Biden and his people they
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:46.560]  say look we own you're a joke yeah it's there they're total joke they know they know the
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:53.760]  election was stolen they know Biden has no no reason to be there they know and they probably
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:59.360]  maybe even helped the the Biden team now they're just making fun of Biden it's because they
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:03.880]  own them and there seems to be a major panic on the left the one more segment with a show
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:08.920]  off and I want to ask you where this goes now but the evidence is overwhelming that obviously
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:12.440]  came out of the main Wuhan lab and then people back and forth from that lab were spreading
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:15.680]  it at the other lab they were going to each day so you have the main lab we're almost
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:19.040]  all the outbreaks are they have the other sub lab we're almost all the other wrestlers
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:25.200]  were in the little bitty tiny areas it's right there for anybody to see what happened and
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:29.800]  you guys have gotten the document and put it out and it's just it's just absolutely
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:33.800]  incredible but everybody wants us to move on and forget about putting blame where blame
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:40.080]  is due don't forget illegal testing they couldn't do in the US Obama and Fauci moved six years
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.280]  ago to Wuhan so again just like fast and furious they were shipping guns to Syria they were
[1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:48.600]  shipping the illegal bio weapons program to Wuhan they use it against us now we're still
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:55.240]  under lockdown China isn't Alex Jones here with the new info or sale and it is a fantastic

[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:11.120]  ethos and a culture and ingenuity art and skill and strength the other is based on the
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:18.040]  massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it America is transferring
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:23.560]  out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:28.120]  slavery that's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:31.920]  they point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave

[1:43:10.240 --> 1:43:15.360]  without the GatewayPundit. I got two questions in the ten minutes we got left or nine minutes
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:20.440]  left. Other key points about the COVID rollout, the lockdowns never ending, the government's
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:24.680]  liberals saying, oh, this is permanent, how obvious this is, should we get on offense
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:29.600]  and call for Fauci and Gates and others to get trouble? And where do you see all this
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:34.600]  going with the broken border and world government and what would you call this period we're
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:39.640]  in with? Obviously the wheels coming off everywhere in America in such grave danger. I don't even
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:44.120]  want to fight with liberals anymore. Come to wake up and why do they have such a death
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:46.960]  wish for themselves and all of us, Joe?
[1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:57.240]  Those are media and great questions, Alex. They sure are. It's kind of like a similar
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:44:02.880]  question would be, what do we do now with this election being stolen? Kind of similar.
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:07.760]  So what do you do? A lot of people are feeling disheartened and a lot of people are feeling
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:13.640]  maybe scared and or confused and really need some sort of leadership. And certainly there
[1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:21.360]  are people out there that are ready to charge and to take the lead. The thing I think that's
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:26.800]  really important is to get to the truth. And if we can get to that, then that can lead
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:31.640]  us, you know, itself. And, you know, so like with the election, I think it's important
[1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:38.040]  for us anyways, we want to continue to report on how that was stolen, every incident of
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:43.520]  fraud that we can identify. We want to shine light on it. We want to bring dark, you know,
[1:44:43.520 --> 1:44:51.400]  brightness to that dark. And so I think similar with, you know, in regards to your questions
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:56.920]  with COVID and what's going on with the world and stuff like that, the best thing that we
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:45:05.600]  can do, one of the best things is certainly to shine the light on this dark, dark time
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:12.720]  and these days that are just so challenging for people. And, you know, so that's exactly
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:19.960]  what we can do. I think in stepping back and looking at COVID, I think there was a lot
[1:45:19.960 --> 1:45:26.400]  of forces that were going on there. And, but certainly a big one was the fact that Trump
[1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:31.200]  was crushing them economically. They had won that game and then Trump came in and showed
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:34.000]  that they were just nothing. He really, he made it.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:37.560]  But he thought it was all one-sided and totally rigged by economic elites in the West selling
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:38.560]  us out.
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:44.520]  Yeah. And, but he, but, but through his actions and within a very short period of time, he
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:49.800]  really destroyed their economy. And there isn't, and they didn't let that word out,
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:55.160]  but it was absolutely the case. And I, and there were study after study. There was the
[1:45:55.160 --> 1:46:03.000]  big thing that China had done, what has done, which what the US did back in 2008, way overbuilt.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:09.160]  There's these buildings all over China that are empty. And, and somebody's got to pay
[1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.720]  the bill on those things and they're not getting paid. And so the country, there's estimates
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:15.880]  of trillions and trillions of dollars.
[1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:19.360]  That's right. And the global is totally only invested there. So all their investments were
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:22.640]  in trouble too. That's why everything is a prop China up right now.
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:28.640]  Yep. That's right. And they, and Trump, Trump caught them at the right time. And if you
[1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:33.200]  recall, he, he, he, you know, he forced them into sign in an agreement and they tried to
[1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:38.560]  renege on him in one of the first agreements. So he said, fine, he made it painful for them.
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:42.600]  And they had to come to the table, really crawling to the table, eager to sign a trade
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:47.320]  deal with them. And he knows how to do deals. You know, if you, what a, what a, we learned
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:53.680]  from Trump, isn't it, isn't it one great quality in a leader is to be able to cut a deal and
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:55.600]  Trump knows how to do that better than anybody.
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:58.960]  Absolutely. And it's a tree by its fruits. I've always said, I love Trump. He's been
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:02.680]  a great president. But then I was in a video a year ago where I said, devil's advocate,
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:06.800]  if I only cared about myself, I'd say F Trump, because he's lost the money I've lost, even
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:10.320]  under attack. And I'd be like, screw him. I hate him, but I don't, because I actually
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:13.960]  care about the country. They edited that out where at least it said it was a secret video
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:18.480]  with three point lighting me sitting in a chair. But no, I'm more proud of Trump ever.
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:22.200]  And I think the left now gets, they stole the election, their minions. And I think you're
[1:47:22.200 --> 1:47:28.040]  getting real Trump regret syndrome that people want him back as they see what Kamala Harris
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:31.360]  and Biden are turning into. We're only two months into this. Where do you see it going?
[1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:35.320]  Yeah, look at the border. I mean, it's just, it's just atrocious. Look at China coming
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:40.320]  into that meeting up in Alaska. And by the way, that guy who they set up as Secretary
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:46.600]  of State's Joe Pisa, he worked with the Bidens with China in the past. So he was bartering
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:47.920]  for the Bidens in the past.
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:52.360]  Now they have total disrespect. They're like, we own you, dude. What are you doing? And
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:57.280]  that's what, and with Trump's notice, notice when he came in, they showed him total respect.
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:02.360]  Remember Obama, his last trip to China, they forced him to come out the back of the freaking
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  airplane.
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:07.800]  Yeah, explain to people about Asia, explaining like Japan, we beat them, they groveled to
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:12.280]  us, not in a fake way. They believe might makes right. Same with China. So when we sit
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:15.800]  there and grovel to them, it makes them totally disrespect us.
[1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:22.600]  Yeah, absolutely. And they respected Trump big time. And so that leads us to really,
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:28.080]  you know, you know, year and a half ago, when this thing was released. And the biggest question
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:34.200]  that needs to be answered, was it done intentionally or not? There's rationale. The one reason for
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:40.000]  for why it might be have been intentionally is because Trump was crushing them economically.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:44.960]  And I can tell you, Alex, two stories. One, I talked to a CEO who I know in China and he
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:50.080]  was out golfing with a couple of his buddies, couple other CEOs. And this was about two
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:55.440]  years ago, they were saying they were saying that the economy is terrible, not just bad
[1:48:55.440 --> 1:49:01.840]  terrible in China. And then another guy I know had a plant of 5,000 employees in southern
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:08.320]  China, and he was moving it to Southeast Asia. And that was Trump's that was Trump's initiative.
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:12.360]  The media never told me Vietnam had a partnership with us. And let's explain that. There been
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:17.160]  an artificial flow of everything for 40 years in China. Trump just took off the bad controls
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:21.480]  that were fraudulent, made the table flat again. And so the jobs that started racing
[1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:25.760]  out of China, which is a good thing is they're only exploiting their people. That's right.
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.840]  And if they're not going to play by the rules that are fair to everybody else, let's move
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:36.040]  that business to other countries that are willing to do that, like Japan or India or
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:41.640]  Southeast Asia. And that's what Trump did. My friend who had this plant, he said they
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:46.480]  first went to Vietnam to get it to find some property. They couldn't find any. It was all
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:53.440]  getting taken by people leaving their corporations leaving China. He had to go to Thailand to
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:54.440]  get his.
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:58.600]  I agree closing. You brought up election fraud. If we don't stop HR one, we can forget it.
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:03.080]  That cements the fraud. You said that I said that we were able to question the media said,
[1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:06.840]  now Mitch McConnell, who said two months ago, we must accept the election. Well, now he
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:10.120]  says HR ones a fraud. Now here's the clip.
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:15.640]  The big item here in the Senate this week are the hearings on HR one, the Democratic
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:22.600]  plan to take over all of American elections and centralize them here in Washington. It
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:25.920]  is replete with problems.
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:31.800]  Yes, it submits what they just did in the election five months ago. So why the about
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:33.200]  face by McConnell?
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:39.600]  Yeah, what a clown. Isn't he isn't he something else? Like, you know, what I think is it because
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:45.000]  his information is coming so slowly to him? Is that it? I mean, we could see this. We
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:49.680]  knew this when they stole this election before we were all you were never going to do it
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:50.680]  before it happened.
[1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:55.880]  Yeah, yeah. And we knew it. And it's like, if you let them do it once, what makes you
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:51:00.400]  think they're not going to do it twice? And quite frankly, Alex, how many times have they
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:01.560]  done this in the past?
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:04.880]  Oh, exactly. All the a lot of these blue sinners aren't blue. They're just under permanent
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:05.880]  fraud.
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:07.920]  That's right. I absolutely agree.
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:12.200]  We only got 30 seconds. Please join us against them at 30 seconds. Do you have optimism?
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:15.240]  There's a lot of movement. I see it again. We're pundit. A lot of states and others
[1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:19.000]  are moving and finding the fraud, though it's not on the national news.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:23.840]  That's right. Yeah, Georgia has announced they're they're coming out with an audit in
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:28.680]  Fulton County, which is Atlanta, where there's just full of full of fraud. As a matter of
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:33.520]  fact, I was talking to somebody just a moments ago saying it's probably all the 200,000 or
[1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:39.000]  so ballots that they might look in that area. They might all be fraudulent. And Arizona
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:45.800]  is pressuring their the people there are wanting an audit. The Senate has now voted
[1:51:45.800 --> 1:51:51.040]  to have one. It's now getting down to who's going to do it. And in Wisconsin yesterday,
[1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:57.880]  they finalized their vote to do an investigation into the 2020 election. There was fraud all
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:51:58.880]  over everywhere.
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:02.560]  And we've got to keep pushing in the idea that we can't question things. He's on America
[1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:07.760]  and dangerous. Joe Hoff. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you, Alex. Powerful as always.

[1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:48.360]  you're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey Alex, welcome. Would like to say first
[1:53:48.360 --> 1:53:53.080]  off thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn
[1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:57.200]  people. I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:54:03.960]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life.
[1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:09.240]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:15.480]  back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:22.480]  This is Matthew 24 verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:29.200]  you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:34.320]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another right where we're at brother.
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:38.760]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:46.720]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country. You're listening to the
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:55:16.560]  Alex Jones show why are there so many useless extra people when robots are so much more smart.
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:29.680]  People are human. People just break my heart. I thought a shot that will solve all my problems.
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:39.680]  If only you'll roll up your sleeves. Someday you'll get it. The vaccine is an option. It's
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:49.080]  not. I'm trying to get everybody to take my new gene therapy back. We're going to introduce
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:55.120]  a little sterilization like we did in Kenya. We're going to introduce perhaps some nanobots.
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:56:03.280]  That'll be fun. Something to fix to the brainstem and engage in physical control of behavior.
[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:10.160]  My goal here is, you know, most likely a much more smaller population that's more controlled.
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:15.440]  Already people are so very compliant, which is great. Everyone wore their masks so quickly
[1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:20.760]  and easily. I was very, very pleased with that. But there's another step we can take,
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:27.040]  which is a total atomic automation of the human soul. That's what I'm really hoping
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:35.920]  for. I hope you'll join me. Step into my clinic. Your upgrade is ready. The transhuman age
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:48.800]  has begun. I've got a shot that will make you compliant. Stereoil and stupid or two. Someday
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:57:04.800]  you'll get it. The vaccine is an option. Your body's my nanobots to me. All of us going to hell. Thank you for making it easy.
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:15.360]  Hello, useless eaters. As your unqualified, not-elected global human health overlord,
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:20.480]  I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence over society
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:26.080]  and share some of my plans for you and your future. When I amassed my fortune in computer
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:31.840]  software, I demonstrated that I was willing to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:38.000]  monopolistic control to destroy my competitors. Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:44.240]  as a humanitarian. With my for-profit foundation masquerading as a charity, I can advocate for
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:50.400]  population reduction and sponsor mass human experiments with unproven vaccines in vulnerable
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:57.360]  populations. Like my father, a powerful banker, eugenicist, and Rockefeller crony himself, it's
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:58:02.560]  always been my ambition to decide who lives and, more importantly, how many have to die.
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:08.320]  Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health, it's really all about controlling
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:16.080]  and culling the human herd for fun and profit. In November of last year, I hosted Event 201,
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:22.720]  a war game simulation of a global pandemic. Leaders from private corporations, global banks,
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:27.760]  governments, and the media got together to strategize ways they could align and lock
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:34.240]  step when responding to a worldwide health crisis. Using a coordinated campaign of fear
[1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:40.240]  mongering, intimidation, social shaming, and economic blackmail, we realized that we could get
[1:58:40.240 --> 1:58:46.480]  around dangerous philosophies like individual liberty and national sovereignty. With an obedient
[1:58:46.480 --> 1:58:52.800]  population, we would be free to implement our own top-down solutions like forced quarantines,
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:59.440]  social distancing, contact tracing, and mandatory testing as a means to seize technocratic control
[1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:06.240]  of society. Now imagine my excitement when we had the opportunity to release, uh, declare our own
[1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:12.320]  global pandemic. It was my chance to look like the Nostradamus of public health and to position
[1:59:12.320 --> 1:59:19.440]  myself and business partners like Dr. Fauci as the de facto authorities on response and solutions.
[1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:24.960]  Through exaggerated doomsday scenarios and computer simulations, our petty control
[1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:29.840]  process, we have an amazing investigative journalist, Drew Hernandez joining us. He's traveled all
[1:59:29.840 --> 1:59:34.800]  over the border to bring us this exclusive information straight ahead. We'll be right back.
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:38.480]  And by the way, last week I pointed out that they have been playing for the control of the world.
[1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:43.840]  I don't mean the end of the world itself, the end of the system. The end of the world as we know it.
[1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:56.080]  You don't like the song? Get back back.
[1:59:56.080 --> 1:59:58.560]  Ranny Dewright. Ranny Dewright. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:04.160]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and, um, for all the
[2:00:04.160 --> 2:00:09.120]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:15.040]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last couple of
[2:00:15.040 --> 2:00:22.640]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already
[2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:26.960]  taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:31.440]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:37.120]  happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know,
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:42.080]  this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:48.160]  put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:49.120]  cleared up my skin.
[2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:02.640]  It's the InfoWars. Hour number three of March 24th, a live Wednesday transmission.
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:10.240]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. We're gonna be talking to Drew Hernandez,
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:15.360]  let's get a journalist here in just a moment. But first, a little bit of one the only.
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:27.120]  It's an old Alice Cooper bringing us in.
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:32.960]  You know, it's concert. It sounds better than he does.
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:34.560]  Digital.
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:38.160]  Really, not everybody heard people sound that good.
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:47.200]  Yeah, we don't have a nice guy anymore. They told us he was dirty. Now we got a really dirty guy,
[2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:51.360]  the Triton Puppet. They are putting their foot down on our neck and letting us know.
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:02:00.240]  Massive human smuggling taking place. A 2,000% increase. Now being reported on the Texas border
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:05.920]  by the Lieutenant Governor, 1,900 something percent. And you've got Kamala Harris saying,
[2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:10.640]  she doesn't care about the border, laughing about it. You've got Biden saying, if I get elected,
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:14.640]  surge the border. And now that it's happening, they're wearing Biden shirts and they're trying
[2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:18.160]  to cover up the total squalor, the human trafficking, the kidnapped children.
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:23.840]  It's a mess. And Drew Hernandez has sent us a bunch of exclusive videos. We'll get him off
[2:02:23.840 --> 2:02:27.200]  the rest of the hour here in a moment. But first, just in case you think I'm joking,
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:31.680]  here is Biden saying, if I get elected, immediately surge the border. And now
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:38.000]  she got asked about this, the press secretary, Saki, not a Japanese rice wine, but the press
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.720]  secretary, and she said, oh yeah, just bring a 10-year-old or younger with you. So it's like
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:46.240]  a get out of the hell free car, bring a kidnap kid, a lot of them are kidnapped. I mean, this is
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:51.840]  just total lawlessness in front of everyone. But instead, the whole FBI is busy trying to arrest
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:55.920]  people that, you know, walked on the steps of the Capitol. Only like 10 people got violent,
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:00.240]  one got pooped on things, fine, arrest them. But the biggest attack in U.S. history, Pearl Harbor
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:05.200]  9-11, give me a break. The real Pearl Harbor 9-11 is our border right now being collapsed.
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:09.520]  Because this UN resettlement operation, here is the puppet chief.
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:14.960]  What we do as president is several more things, because things have changed. I would in fact
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:21.200]  make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border. All those people are seeking asylum.
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:25.440]  They deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We're a nation that says, if you want to flee
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:30.160]  and you're fleeing oppression, you should come. You've got to prove you're being oppressed. And
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:33.840]  you're not a Democrat, global astuge. Well, Drew Hernandez is an investigative reporter,
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:41.440]  commentator and host of Drew Hernandez Live. He's at Twitter, DrewHLiveLivesMatterOfficial.com.
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:46.400]  Drew, we always love your work, covering Kenosha and so many other big events. You've got so much
[2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:51.360]  of the daring, dangerous footage. And so it's good to have you here for the next 52 minutes
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:56.320]  with us of this hour. Where do you want to start? I mean, because I've been trying to get you on
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:00.080]  for a while, you've been too busy, which I understand. But this time you wanted to come on,
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:02.960]  you've got something to say, so we're really excited to have you here. And I appreciate you.
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:08.880]  Well, let's start here. Let's start with what this really is, right? The globally elites,
[2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:13.360]  what do they do? They change the demographics. They change the geographics. They don't want
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:18.560]  sovereignty. They don't want borders. They don't want USA, no borders, no USA at all, right?
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:21.920]  They don't want that at all. They've done this in Europe. They've done this in Germany. This is
[2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:26.960]  nothing new. I believe this is what they wanted to do with Hillary Clinton, but the rise of populism
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:31.760]  happened and Donald Trump came and kind of postponed their plans. But now that the Biden puppet has
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:36.480]  been installed in the White House, it's back to business. And now they're using Hispanics. They're
[2:04:36.480 --> 2:04:41.520]  sending Hispanics and Latinos from Latin America, from Central America to push into the United
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:46.320]  States to change the demographics, to change the geographics. They're using these people.
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:51.040]  They're being pushed into human slavery. They're being pushed into human prostitution. The women
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:55.600]  get raped on the journey from Central America through Mexico to the United States Southern
[2:04:55.600 --> 2:05:00.320]  border. And the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about it. People like AOC, people like Rashid
[2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:05.040]  Tlaib at staged press conferences, acting like they're crying, that they care about the migrants,
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:10.240]  all of a sudden are absolutely silent. Politicians only use Latinos. They only use Hispanics as
[2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:14.960]  political pawns. And what's taking place right now is literally the great reset. We all know what
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:19.760]  this is, Alex. This is build back better. When they say build back better, they're not saying make
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:24.640]  America great again for the independent everyday Americans that are working every single day.
[2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:30.080]  Build back better is a message to the global elites to build back their system better for
[2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:33.680]  themselves. And what they're doing with these immigrants, with these migrants coming from
[2:05:33.680 --> 2:05:39.280]  Central America is accomplishing just that. If you guys run clip one, you guys will see very
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:46.080]  clearly that this is over 100 yards, 200 yards. This is Yuma, Arizona of just open, incomplete
[2:05:46.080 --> 2:05:50.480]  border. That is Mexico you're looking into right there. And on the right side, that is the United
[2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:54.720]  States. And Americans need to see this stuff. And let's be clear that the border patrol
[2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:59.200]  two weeks ago said that they were ordered to stand down and stop apprehensions. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:04.320]  Absolutely. And that's another point. I was talking to border patrol agents here in Arizona at the
[2:06:04.320 --> 2:06:08.880]  Southern border. And the first thing he told me was, I'm really not allowed to communicate with you,
[2:06:08.880 --> 2:06:14.400]  but he did unofficially anyways. So they are under unofficial gag orders. Why, Alex? Because they
[2:06:14.400 --> 2:06:19.040]  don't want the optics to come out. They don't want the data to come out. Those are the two things
[2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:22.800]  that these border patrol agents are under unofficial gag order on. They're not allowed to
[2:06:22.800 --> 2:06:26.720]  communicate data. They're not allowed to communicate any optics. They can't book any ride
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:31.040]  alongs with the media. It's full suppression censorship. And they said Donald Trump was the
[2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:36.640]  fascist. The last time I checked fascists were the ones who censored and suppressed the media.
[2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:41.200]  That is what the Biden administration is doing right now as we speak. And where are all these
[2:06:41.200 --> 2:06:46.240]  left-leaning journals? All these left-leaning freaking woke wookies that are sitting there,
[2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:49.760]  virtue signaling, saying they're defund the police in 2020, but all of a sudden,
[2:06:49.760 --> 2:06:54.080]  after the January 6 Capitol riots, they're all hand in hand working with the FBI,
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:58.320]  getting Trump supporters thrown in prison. Where are they now? They're silent because they don't
[2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:03.200]  care. And it doesn't fit their political purposes. It doesn't give them any political gain. And
[2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:08.320]  they're exploiting children. Take a look at clip six. If you guys can run that for me right now.
[2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:14.560]  Go ahead and run clip six. This is White House claims. They're actively turning people away
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:20.080]  at the border of this video prison. Otherwise, here's the video you shot on guys. Joe Hernandez
[2:07:20.080 --> 2:07:25.600]  here still down here in Yuma, Arizona at the southern border. If you can see right behind me,
[2:07:25.600 --> 2:07:30.240]  here's where the wall. This is another part of the wall where it ends. And then over here,
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:37.440]  this is what is called the Normandy section of the border. This is all this is going to do is
[2:07:37.440 --> 2:07:42.800]  stop cars. It is completely open. If you look out into the distance, if you look further,
[2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:48.960]  it is just completely open. All this is going to do is stop cars. It's not going to stop people.
[2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:56.400]  And actually, we have a group of migrants over here. Some of the border patrol agents,
[2:07:56.400 --> 2:08:01.200]  they're they're doing this all day. Families are coming across. They're just walking over claiming
[2:08:01.200 --> 2:08:07.280]  asylum. Not too sure if they're actually families. But here right now, this is happening around the
[2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:11.840]  clock all day long where they're just coming straight across the border. And right now,
[2:08:12.400 --> 2:08:16.560]  we actually do have some families here that have been apprehended. And it looks like they're
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:23.120]  awaiting transportation to detention facility. This is just happening all day long. And it's
[2:08:23.120 --> 2:08:32.000]  pretty interesting. So here we go. Take a look. And Biden told everybody to come up here.
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:36.400]  As long as you kidnap the kid with you, you're going to get in fine. This is a crime against
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:41.760]  humanity. Then they fill up the local facilities in all tens of thousands. Now they're busing
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:47.520]  them to Democrat facilities to city auditoriums, the military bases. This is just incredible.
[2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:52.640]  How bad is this going to get drew? And will anybody hold Biden accountable for this crime?
[2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:58.480]  I don't think he will. I think it's clip three and clip five as well, where you actually I got
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:04.320]  some footage of I was monitoring the actual cartels. You can see them on video. I don't know
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:08.160]  if it's clip three or clip five, but you can see they're called coyotes, obviously, but they're
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:13.120]  also called Falcons. These it's literally Alex like a black market Uber service. They'll charge
[2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:17.600]  these people thousands of dollars. The cartels, I think the most recent reports are making $14
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:22.880]  million a day a day. So what they do is they get these people, they'll charge them thousands of
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:27.360]  dollars. They'll put them into debt and then they'll give them what they call safe passage.
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:32.480]  They'll drop them off at the southern border and they'll have them just cross the open passages,
[2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:37.120]  the incomplete border and get sent to the United States. You guys see there in the video,
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:41.040]  the border patrol will apprehend them and take them to a detention facility and to answer your
[2:09:41.040 --> 2:09:46.240]  question, this literally is a crime against humanity. This is human smuggling. This is human
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:51.360]  trafficking. This is literally what this is and it's going to get worse. And here's why Alex,
[2:09:51.360 --> 2:09:56.800]  listen to this. This is not some QAnon children getting raped conspiracy theory. This is confirmed
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:00.880]  what I'm about to tell you from border patrol agents themselves. Border patrol agents have been
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:06.720]  briefing me that they cannot, they're having trouble identifying if these migrant families are
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:12.560]  actually related, if they're actually families. Yeah, they can do DNA testing, but not for hundreds
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:16.480]  of thousands of people that are coming over the southern border every single day. So get this,
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:21.520]  Alex, listen to this. So now the Biden administration, Jen Sackie sits there and tells the entire
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:28.400]  world that it's a good idea to spend $86 million to put migrants into hotel rooms. There could
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:34.960]  potentially be pedophiles and rapists, unidentified quote unquote families being put in hotel rooms
[2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:40.480]  unsupervised. We got to go to break, but you're totally right. It came out in the New York Post,
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:44.960]  even in Reuters, even in Washington Post that thousands and thousands of children,
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:51.760]  Obama knowingly plays with child smugglers. Brainforce Plus, by the way, one of my all-time
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:57.280]  favorite products. I completely owe my ability to do this job. I owe my ability to have graduated
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:01.840]  college four or five years ago. I owe it completely to Brainforce Plus, one of the most powerful
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:06.640]  nutraceuticals you will find. I put it right up there with TurboForce. I love TurboForce. It's
[2:11:06.640 --> 2:11:11.440]  great, but when you don't have time or you don't have the wherewithal to drink a bottle of water,
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:18.080]  take two capsules of Brainforce Plus and you will launch into the stratosphere. You will go to the
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:22.400]  moon. You will not know where all your energy came from. And then you'll remember, but there's no
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:27.120]  crash. That's the important part about Brainforce Plus is there's no crash. It's not like drinking
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:32.400]  three cups of coffee to get that same amount of buzz because you don't come crashing down. You also

[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:36.560]  Well, this just came out. Got a big announcement. That's because President
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:43.840]  Andres Manuel Lopez Orbador, or AMLO, by the way, was a socialist and everything, but like Trump,
[2:13:43.840 --> 2:13:49.040]  as he found out he was a man of the people, says the migrant crisis has been created by Biden.
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:55.200]  Blames him. He says expectations were created that with the government of President Biden,
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:59.760]  there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:04.240]  and also from our country, going across the border, thinking that it's easier to do so.
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:09.040]  He said of his daily morning thing, and he went on to criticize Biden. And we've got Biden saying,
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:14.080]  do it. This is insane. You understand that the most dangerous part of Mexico is that U.S. border
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:18.320]  and the Guatemalan border. That's where the drug dealers, the Saudis are. The left makes jokes
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:24.640]  and goes, well, Trump says that dogs are going to get people. No, that's the name of the smugglers.
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:28.720]  Hundreds of thousands killed, mass graves everywhere. They routinely rape and murder
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:32.640]  the people. 80% of the women get raped. This is not a joke. And there's what our guest,
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:37.360]  Guru Hernandez, was just talking about. There's no migrant surge in the U.S. Southern border.
[2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:41.840]  Here's the data. The Washington Post tried to spin it. But then you go back to Washington Post
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:46.800]  five years ago, admitting with the headline, Obama knowingly placed children with human
[2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:52.240]  traffic or sex smugglers. So that's exactly what you were just getting to drew in these clips.
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:57.280]  You're going over for radio listeners. You can narrate it. Where do you see all this going?
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:01.360]  Because, okay, Biden stills the election. Okay, he's Butcher in the country. Okay,
[2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:06.480]  he wants to bring in an underclass taken control. But the whole world sees this.
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:12.160]  Where do you see this going? Let me give you two points, Alex. I can do this in under five minutes.
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:17.360]  Number one, I see this going, you're going to see a lot of dead migrants on the Mexican side of the
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:22.720]  border. And here's why. Because not all of them, we have over 100,000 people, hundreds of thousands
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:27.920]  of people that are making the journey from Central America to the southern border at the United States
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:33.760]  and the Mexico side. Why you literally have migrants showing up in TJ with freaking Biden,
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:40.000]  let us in t shirts. They're waving Biden 2020 flags. And the Biden administration is still
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:45.040]  going to sit here and act like it is not their fault. While Biden was running while Kamala Harris
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:49.520]  was running, all these left leaning Democrats, socialist radical communists, in my opinion,
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:54.240]  and globalists were literally virtue signaling, and they were dog whistling to these Latin American
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:58.960]  countries when you come out and say, Hey, this administration is going to be gone. Trump is
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:02.960]  going to be gone. We're going to come in. We're going to give 11 million undocumented immigrants
[2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:08.160]  in the United States citizenship. You are literally signaling to these desperate people
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:13.600]  that now is their time that rhetoric literally signals to desperate people that it is now their
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:18.480]  time. So once that happens, Alex, when they make this journey from Central America, they get kidnapped,
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:22.880]  they get raped, and they get murdered. Some of them don't even make it. Thousands of them don't
[2:16:22.880 --> 2:16:26.800]  even make it to the southern border of the United States because they get kidnapped, raped, or
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:31.360]  murdered on the way. And let's say they do make it, Alex. Let's say they do make it to the southern
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:37.040]  border and they don't get granted asylum and they get turned away and they get put back into Mexico.
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:44.000]  Now you have Central Americans, let's say coming from Honduras in Mexico now without any citizenship,
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:49.200]  nowhere to work, nowhere to go, no way to provide for themselves or their kids. And now they're
[2:16:49.200 --> 2:16:55.120]  stuck in Mexico because Biden and these virtue signaling Democrats and globalists signaled them
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:59.760]  to come. And now it's their responsibility and these people are going to die by the thousands.
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:05.040]  They'll either get recruited by cartels or they'll get killed because they'll just die because they
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:09.920]  have no way to eat or provide for themselves in Mexico. Listen, Mexico doesn't want this.
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:14.800]  All these radical leftist activists, they won't say what I'm about to tell you guys.
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:20.640]  Mexico doesn't want illegal immigration because it increases the criminal cartel enterprises.
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:25.040]  It puts millions of dollars into their pockets and they don't want this. How do I know this?
[2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:30.240]  Because the Mexican government has come out, the president himself has put out his concerns
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:35.040]  that his concerns with illegal mass immigration coming from Central America is what? Is the
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:41.360]  criminal cartel enterprises thriving and making millions of dollars? And Biden and Saki sit there
[2:17:41.360 --> 2:17:46.160]  with their elitism acting like nothing is happening and everything is okay. We're going to see more
[2:17:46.160 --> 2:17:50.960]  people dying in Mexico. And I don't want to hear for one second. And that's right. Just interrupt
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:55.280]  because you're on fire. And Mexican president just announced, we put the article up there,
[2:17:55.280 --> 2:17:59.680]  Major Crackdown Illegals, because they get, and I said this yesterday, just like Mexico got
[2:17:59.680 --> 2:18:04.720]  collapsed by this, all this illegality, we're collapsing as well. And it was Merkel and others
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:11.200]  that openly told others to flood Europe. This is a George Soros UN plan and Biden is following
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:16.000]  it. Please continue. Absolutely. And here's my second point, Alex, just to go with exactly
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:23.520]  with what you're saying. These people exploit human beings. These people exploit human beings.
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:29.520]  I'm under the personal belief that right now, after the 2020 election, the non-white, the largest
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:35.200]  non-white voting bloc is not the black community. It's not the Asian community. It is the Hispanic
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:40.880]  community now. This is why you're seeing virtue signaling Democrats turn their eyes on the Hispanic
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:45.600]  community now because they want to use them simply as votes. That's all they want. That's all they
[2:18:45.600 --> 2:18:49.760]  care about. They are turning, in my opinion, I think the black community is about to be thrown
[2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:53.440]  by the wayside and they're going to turn their attention to the Hispanic community and start
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:59.120]  to pander to them. And I have proof of this because Biden himself at the end of 2020 had a
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:03.760]  conference call with a bunch of black activists, black lives matter activists, very well known
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:08.480]  ones. And he told them the exact same thing. He told them, I'm not afraid of you guys. It's the
[2:19:08.480 --> 2:19:13.280]  Hispanic community now that we have to look at. So it all makes sense, Alex. They're literally
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:17.760]  migrating these people. They only see them as commodities. They only see them as votes. They
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:22.080]  pander to these communities. We listen. As a Hispanic man, I'm going to sit here and say this
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:27.200]  in front of the entire world. I will not allow myself to become nothing but a political pawn.
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:31.360]  These communities mean more than this. This is not a left or right issue. This is not a Democrat
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:35.920]  or a Republican issue. These communities are human beings. The Democrats do not care about
[2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:40.320]  Hispanics. Do not think for one second that they care about this because if they did,
[2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:44.880]  they would not put these communities, Alex, in these positions to be human trafficked,
[2:19:44.880 --> 2:19:50.400]  raped and kidnapped at all in any way situation, anywhere, anywhere in the world. It doesn't matter
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:55.840]  what your politics are. You cannot put human beings in this position for political gain and
[2:19:55.840 --> 2:20:01.120]  they won't even address it. Democrats won't even address it. Some are to give some credit where
[2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:06.240]  it's due, but the White House will not address it. The White House will not accept it because
[2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:11.120]  Orange Man is gone, Alex. Now that Trump is gone, there's no one to blame. And even when they do
[2:20:11.120 --> 2:20:14.960]  blame Trump, it makes no sense. Nancy Pelosi sits there in front of the world and says,
[2:20:14.960 --> 2:20:19.840]  oh, it's the past administration. We inherited a bad system and that's why this is happening. No,
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:25.360]  it is your fault. It is your fault. You don't care about Hispanics. And what is Biden going to do
[2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:29.360]  is all the Mexican governor, his mayors and president rightfully blame him. What is he going
[2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:37.120]  to do as Mexico and everybody blames him? Biden? Yeah. I think the pressure is on this administration.
[2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:42.400]  Listen, Alex, I'm not going to make any illusions to any conspiracy theories or anything like this
[2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:46.640]  because I know you get into some hot water when it comes to the mass shootings, but I will say this
[2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:52.080]  and I will put it this way. I'll tell the people, don't allow these things that happen in the media
[2:20:52.080 --> 2:20:57.840]  to distract you from what's taking place. Project Veritas, undercover investigative journalists,
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:03.120]  release photos of inside the migrant detention facilities showing the American people.
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:08.320]  It goes against the unofficial gag orders that the administration put on the border patrol agents
[2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:12.320]  not to communicate with the media. They're trying to hide these things. And then all of a sudden
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:16.160]  there's a mass shooting that takes place. I'm not saying it stays. I'm just saying don't get
[2:21:16.160 --> 2:21:21.520]  distracted because immediately Democrats, Joe Biden, the radical left, they do not hold back.
[2:21:21.520 --> 2:21:26.160]  They seize the opportunity to jump on gun control, to jump on taking away the guns,
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:30.720]  to jump on attacking your 2A, to distract the public from what's taking place at the southern border.
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:35.600]  Dr. Hernandez, you are super inflago. Stay right there. You're dead on right. Dr. Hernandez,
[2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:40.640]  our guest, right back on the other side of this break. Incredible times. They're breaking all sovereign
[2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:44.880]  nations. They hate everybody. They're ruthless civil corporations and they are involved in
[2:21:44.880 --> 2:21:49.760]  massive human trafficking and smuggling. We'll be right back. I'm not going to sit here and waste
[2:21:49.760 --> 2:21:56.960]  your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full versus head. If you're paying attention,
[2:21:56.960 --> 2:22:04.640]  you know we've done together. But I'll tell you this. The technocrats are really upping their game
[2:22:05.200 --> 2:22:10.240]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter and
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:15.840]  silence human resistance. So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:20.240]  has been proven accurate. Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[2:22:20.240 --> 2:22:25.840]  So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structure should have silenced those of us
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:32.960]  that they can't. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power.
[2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:39.360]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we
[2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:48.800]  find hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bears you are.
[2:22:52.480 --> 2:22:58.240]  Look, I've proven that Info Wars information is some of the best in the world. It's just
[2:22:58.240 --> 2:23:03.200]  absolutely on target. The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate. They
[2:23:03.200 --> 2:23:07.920]  want to keep you in the dark. I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know
[2:23:07.920 --> 2:23:14.640]  that John F. Kennedy was right. Raising tide raises all ships. Now, the supplements, the vitamins,

[2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:56.240]  I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents
[2:23:57.360 --> 2:24:03.040]  of the enemy. A lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh no, it's 3G chest,
[2:24:03.040 --> 2:24:07.440]  5G chest, he's invincible. And I understand why people learn to believe that because this is
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:11.520]  scary what's going on. The global government and the New World Order. Now that people woke up
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:15.440]  to the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save them from. Well, Trump sure has held
[2:24:15.440 --> 2:24:20.400]  track. My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:24.480]  the drug, once you buy it and sign that executive order. We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:29.120]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed and now people are going to feel
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:34.560]  the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated this is
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:39.760]  trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:45.520]  lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in, folks.
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:52.400]  The swamp is deep. Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it. The entire New World Order system
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:58.320]  is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:02.720]  so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:08.640]  and destiny we have being given free will. Being given free will, being given consciousness,
[2:25:08.640 --> 2:25:15.360]  is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system. And the fact that you're able to
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:20.000]  commune with God, the fact you're able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.120]  in the ocean or the beauty of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge,
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:30.480]  the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:36.240]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist. Don't
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:41.360]  worship the NFL. Don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:46.320]  because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while
[2:25:46.320 --> 2:26:02.240]  you still have it, while you still have it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:18.560]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:27.840]  All right, Drew Hernandez has been on a few times before and he's always passed it, always great
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:33.680]  mind, but he is really angry and he should be because I don't care what color you are. We're
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:38.960]  all humans. We all bleed red blood. We all have fathers and mothers who are once children. We
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:44.240]  love children. Massive exploitation of the third world and the final piece that I want to add here
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:50.240]  and he's had a lot more to add is that I told you over a year ago, a global lockdown will take
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:55.040]  bad situations in Latin America, Africa and areas of Asia, Middle East and make them intolerable.
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:59.200]  And then the UN that's heavily involved in human smuggling and the refugee centers they built
[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:04.160]  are going to collapse those countries into us and then the UN will use them as client
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:09.920]  replacement migration population to replace the once free people with an underclass they control.
[2:27:09.920 --> 2:27:15.040]  So they're planning to keep them down forever and that's how you bring once free countries
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:19.120]  into checkmate and then every country suppressed just like the third world is by these big
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:24.800]  corporations in the UN. Then meanwhile, when they run slave camps in China, Apple and others fund
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:29.920]  Black Lives Matter. So it's all very, very cynical and people better wake up to it very,
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:35.120]  very quickly. The lockdowns have starved over 10 million extra people. So the 15 million people,
[2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:38.800]  25 million has starved to death last year and the numbers are only getting bigger. They want
[2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:44.240]  more lockdowns. And so this is a plan that UN says will use migrant flows, the threat of disease
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:48.400]  for global government because it's a global problem. Drew Hernandez, you've got other clips
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:52.720]  we haven't gotten to. You're on fire. So the rest of the two segments I want you to have the floor
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:56.880]  and keep giving us this report. I guess spending the last month or so on the border really got you
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:28:03.600]  angry. Yeah, I believe it's clip one or two. One of the clips with the unfinished border wall
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:12.960]  pieces. Yeah, let's roll that one. Here's clip one. I think it's another one. Let me see. Let's go
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:19.120]  into play clip two. There's a curiously remaining border wall place. You go ahead. On the Mexican
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:29.840]  side of the border. This is where the incomplete border wall is on this side. And there's Mexico
[2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:45.600]  and here is all of the remaining unused border wall parts. It's all just sitting here. It's just
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:59.760]  sitting here waiting to be put together package. And because of Joe Biden, this has all been brought
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:11.280]  to a halt. All of this. All of this literal attack on our very essence, our very existence.
[2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:18.720]  This is a cartel drop zone right here. It's just completely open just to give you guys some depth
[2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:25.520]  as to what this really is. It's yes, it's the incomplete border wall pieces, but this is literally
[2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:30.560]  right next to a cartel drop zone and it is completely open. United States is completely open.
[2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:33.920]  And remember day one and day two, he signed a record number of executive orders.
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:36.960]  One of them stopping all of this, even though it was already all paid for.
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:42.080]  Yep. And the cartels had a big smile on their face because that meant dollar signs.
[2:29:44.720 --> 2:29:48.640]  Well, we know the big cartels. Remember when Pelosi said MS-13 are God's children,
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:53.680]  we know they're laundering money through them. Absolutely. And they don't care about these human
[2:29:53.680 --> 2:29:57.920]  beings. Look at that. You're looking into California right there. That's back into Mexico. It's
[2:29:57.920 --> 2:30:09.360]  completely open. Hundreds of thousands of dollars just rotting away. Now, let me give you guys
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:16.080]  something real quick. Right now, a child, the cartels are charging these migrants around $3,200
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:21.200]  a head for a little kid. I believe it was the New York Times, the New York Times, right?
[2:30:21.200 --> 2:30:26.960]  Interviewed an actual mother. She claimed that she paid nine grand to the cartels to be granted
[2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:32.000]  safe passage into the United States to be human smuggled by coyotes and falcons, the cartels,
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:37.440]  right? Let me ask you this. For your viewers, do you think these migrants just have nine grand
[2:30:37.440 --> 2:30:42.000]  just chilling in their back pocket ready to go? Of course they don't. So how do they do this?
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:47.120]  The cartels are organized and they function in the United States as well. They have safe houses,
[2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:51.760]  they have pool businesses, they have construction businesses, anything you could think of of where
[2:30:51.760 --> 2:30:56.560]  an undocumented Mexican that can't speak English can work at, right? Just use your imagination.
[2:30:56.560 --> 2:31:01.600]  They own these kinds of businesses in the United States. So the cartels work on both sides. They
[2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:05.200]  will actually set up, and I've interviewed Border Patrol agents that have looked into this stuff
[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:09.680]  and they've discovered this stuff. It's confirmed. The cartels in the United States will set up
[2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:14.240]  routing accounts, checking account numbers. They will set up bank accounts for these migrants
[2:31:14.240 --> 2:31:19.120]  in the United States. They'll charge them in Mexico, let's say nine grand, so they get sent over,
[2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:23.120]  they get caught, they get released, they get sent to their businesses in the United States.
[2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:27.360]  They're legitimate businesses, but they get paid under the table. They don't get paid minimum wage,
[2:31:27.360 --> 2:31:32.800]  they get paid peanuts. So these people are enslaved to the cartels in our country, paying
[2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:39.760]  off a debt of possibly nine grand, making peanuts their entire life. This is human slavery. This
[2:31:39.760 --> 2:31:45.520]  is what this is. And people need to understand these Hispanics and these Latinos are being exploited
[2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:52.480]  in this way for dollar signs. And it's cartels that do this stuff on both sides in Mexico and in the
[2:31:52.480 --> 2:31:56.800]  United States. And listen, I don't, anyone that's listening to right now, listening to me right
[2:31:56.800 --> 2:32:01.280]  now, I don't care about your politics. I don't care if you're a Republican. I don't care if you're
[2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:04.880]  a Democrat. I don't care if you're a liberal. I don't care if you're a conservative. I don't,
[2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:10.000]  I don't care. I don't care. You should care about these human beings. I know people will probably
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:14.320]  like, oh, you sound like a leftist. You sound like AOC right now. No, AOC is silent. She's not saying
[2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:17.680]  anything anymore because it's not politically beneficial to do so. I agree. Why do you think
[2:32:17.680 --> 2:32:23.600]  Big Tech is censoring this info? Big Tech is censoring this information? They're absolutely
[2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:27.840]  censoring it because of why, Alex, because they don't want the optics to come out because they
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:32.400]  don't really care because they're probably most likely have some kind of connection to these
[2:32:32.400 --> 2:32:38.240]  things. This, this spider web goes extremely deep. There's a reason why they don't want to address it.
[2:32:38.240 --> 2:32:42.800]  I've asked border patrol agents themselves. I'm like, why, why don't they talk about this?
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:48.000]  Why won't politicians really talk about these things? And the answer I got from him, because
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:52.480]  he's been working the border for more than 10, 15 years, he says, listen, they don't want to get
[2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:57.040]  involved with the cartels. And border patrol agents have told me, we believe that the reason
[2:32:57.040 --> 2:33:02.800]  why they don't address these things is either A, out of fear, they fear these cartels or B,
[2:33:02.800 --> 2:33:06.880]  there's a possibility that they're somehow involved with these things. I'll just leave it at that.
[2:33:06.880 --> 2:33:10.400]  Well, I know you've seen mayors and their brothers and everybody right here in Texas,
[2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:15.440]  who will literally have dungeons with, with, with mainly Hispanics that they've kept who
[2:33:15.440 --> 2:33:19.280]  didn't pay the money. Or you'll hear, well, they'll just leave them in a tractor trailer in 15,
[2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:24.320]  20, 30 people. You see it every few weeks, just die because somebody down the line didn't pay money.
[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:28.720]  So they'll have chain migration where say the men come in, now their daughters and sons are coming
[2:33:28.720 --> 2:33:34.320]  in, their wives, if they don't pay this absorbent amount, they just kill them in a tractor trailer.
[2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:38.000]  They just leave them out in 120 degree heat. They all died inside there. It was 100 outside,
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:44.160]  120 inside. So I mean, we know what's going on. They had the mayor's brother here in Austin
[2:33:45.120 --> 2:33:51.280]  a decade ago, caught with chained up slaves, all Hispanic in cages. But because he was Hispanic,
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:55.680]  the media covered up, well, so big deal, he's got slaves. I mean, that's what we're talking about.
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:00.800]  This is pure evil. Yeah, it's pure evil, especially when you look at the Mexican side of things.
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:05.360]  I've had some conversation with some investigative journalists in Mexico too, and the horror stories
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:11.200]  are insane. When Americans dog whistle to these third world countries, when you give the smallest
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:16.720]  glimpse of hope, they will take it and they will do anything and everything to get to this country.
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:20.560]  Now we know there's devastating conditions happening in these countries in these third world,
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:26.160]  fourth world countries, but it's irresponsible of the United States, Democrats, to dog whistle to
[2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:30.880]  these countries that it's time to come. They may not officially say it, but their rhetoric is
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:35.520]  communicating this to these people. These are desperate people that do want a better life.
[2:34:35.520 --> 2:34:39.600]  Hell, Joe Biden, wait a minute, Joe Biden said, if I get elected immediately, sir,
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:44.960]  do you have a right to be here? Absolutely. And they're showing up, Alex, they're showing up with
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:50.960]  Biden led us in t-shirts. And Jen Psaki has the nerve to sit there and tell the American people
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:55.600]  that there's not a crisis, that children coming on a company through the Southern border is not a
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:35:00.560]  crisis. That's a literal quote from the White House. And by the way, the representative of
[2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:06.560]  the Southern border in the White House literally admitted on CNN. This is your leadership, America.
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:12.560]  This is your White House. They literally admitted that their message of telling migrants to go
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:18.320]  away and not to come is going out less than the cartels message. Basically, the White House is
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:25.360]  on record, Alex, admitting that they're losing to the cartels. 80 million, right, Alex? 80 million
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:30.080]  people voted for this. This puppet that can't even get up Stair Force One. 80 million people
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:34.480]  voted for this, Alex. They voted for human trafficking to just be normalized and not be
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:39.600]  addressed. 80 million, right, Alex? And this giant exploited mass of people is going to undercut
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:44.080]  everybody's jobs, everybody's pension and turn us into a third world country, which is the globalist
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:48.080]  plan. Unbelievable. Stay right there. We'll talk about how to fight back with Drew Hernandez.

[2:36:48.080 --> 2:37:03.080]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck. The big, globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:37:03.080 --> 2:37:21.080]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.

[2:37:49.080 --> 2:38:00.080]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins? Why do you have multiple high quality iodines? Why do you do that? Because different strokes for different folks.
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:11.080]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists, and they say, hey, a lot of people love Deep Earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth crystal iodine, and the two other types, because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:24.080]  Boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3. Is it better than X2? You decide, it's different strokes for different folks. Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping, and that is down and out.
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other. Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates at infowarstore.com and free shipping.

[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:59.080]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:17.080]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:30.080]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover. In their own words, they admit it. So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:37.080]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're Faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:49.080]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's another business. Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:10.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:47.080]  You're restored with facts and lies. I had a name, but never mind. Never mind.
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:57.080]  Yeah, that's Leonard Cohen. He also has the song Everybody Knows. The dice are loaded. Everybody knows the captain lies. Everybody knows the war is over.
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:41:09.080]  It's not really, ladies and gentlemen, but things are really out in the open now. People know that there's a massive fraud that we are facing. I'll be hosting the fourth hour today with Roger Stone with a lot of big breaking exclusive news.
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:15.080]  How do we formulate a plan to challenge the globalist? How do we move forward? You know, giving in is just going to make it worse.
[2:41:15.080 --> 2:41:22.080]  And now we see the election stolen and we see the Mexican president who had an election stolen once from him coming out saying Biden's bad, Biden's a fraud.
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:30.080]  You see all these other Mexican governors and mayors saying the border being opened is wrong. People get that everybody's being exploited here and it's only to get worse.
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:39.080]  We let these big corporations do this. This is the U.N. running all of this, ladies and gentlemen, four big corporations. The lockdown, all of it is a planetary takeover.
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:46.080]  So in the eight, nine minutes we have Lev Drew Hernandez want to commend you. Tell us more about what you found on the border, what's coming up next.
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:53.080]  We'll follow you at DrewHLive on Twitter or the great website livesmatterofficial.com.
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:42:01.080]  Yeah, you guys can follow me. I'm on GAB as well, DrewHLive. I'm very active on GAB because I don't know how much longer I'll be on Twitter, especially exposing these things.
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:10.080]  So you guys can follow me on GAB, DrewHLive, obviously Twitter, DrewHLive. And I have my own show. I do it on YouTube as well. Just search Drew Hernandez.
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:19.080]  But Alex, what's taking place at the border is it literally is a nightmare because when you think about these things, especially let's talk about COVID now as well.
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:27.080]  How does COVID play into this? Isn't it interesting how the theology or the belief system of the left has just kind of like run into itself?
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:34.080]  Because with all the lockdowns and Americans having to stay in their houses and Americans can't go out, you can't even go to the supermarket without a mask on.
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:40.080]  And like some crazy Karens coming after you and screaming in your face. Everyone is freaking out. Everyone has to be stuffed into their rooms.
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:48.080]  No one can go out any longer. But now, now that is the radical left narrative, right? With the global elites that have dumped that into this country.
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:53.080]  But now they've decided to push the button and pull the lever of mass migration.
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:43:01.080]  So now they have an interesting problem that's running into itself where the COVID narrative where social distancing six feet apart, you can't be in the same room.
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:10.080]  The Super Bowl is a super spreader event. The Trump campaign rallies are super spreader events, conservatives gathering in anyway, churches are super spreader events.
[2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:19.080]  But now we have a migrant surge at the border. They're literally shoulder to shoulder hundreds of thousands of people being stuffed into detention centers, being stuffed into border patrol cars.
[2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:25.080]  I just showed you the footage shoulder to shoulder. There are spreads now of COVID-19 apparently.
[2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:34.080]  But the point I'm trying to make is their narratives are clashing because they can't come out and say, hey, we can't have these hundreds of thousands of people coming across the border
[2:43:34.080 --> 2:43:38.080]  because they're going to bring COVID into our country and they're going to spread all over the place.
[2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:47.080]  But now they're going to sound like bigots according to their own theology saying and they're going to sound like xenophobes saying we can't have people come into the country because they have viruses and they're dirty.
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:55.080]  So it's their ideology. Alex is just imploding upon themselves. And I think part of what God is doing in America and what I pray for.
[2:43:55.080 --> 2:44:06.080]  I sincerely pray for is that God opens the minds of millions of people to be enlightened and to see that their narratives and their directives and their theologies in the world.
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:13.080]  All they do is they clash with each other. They don't make sense and they implode. They're not healthy for the American people.
[2:44:13.080 --> 2:44:17.080]  They're not healthy for humanity, Alex. I'm preaching to the choir. You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:22.080]  Their ideologies end on a dead end road and they fall and they crash and they burn.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:27.080]  And my prayer for America right now, Alex, is that people would be enlightened.
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:31.080]  It's we the people. It's millions of people. That's always been my concern, Alex.
[2:44:31.080 --> 2:44:40.080]  You have millions of people that identify with the left that actually believe Jen Sackie when she comes out and she says there's no crisis at the border.
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:46.080]  But your Hernandez comes out and gives you footage showing you. She's literally saying that, oh, we're not. We're not bringing in migrants.
[2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:48.080]  They're being turned away at this point.
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:55.080]  I agree. We're not worried about the leftist. They believe what they point. They want to just feel morally superior, but never want any responsibility.
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:45:01.080]  Absolutely. They're the radical woke wikis. I don't even call them leftists anymore. They're just wokists. That's what they are.
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:07.080]  Their ideology makes no sense. We all know they're radical left-leaning, radical communists, radical globalists.
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:12.080]  We know these people don't actually even really believe anything. They just do what they're told.
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:22.080]  When you have millions of activists, all these virtue signaling white activists, the clips that you play to the DSA at the beginning of this show, none of these people care about what I'm talking about.
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:31.080]  None of these people want to hear that their rhetoric is causing thousands, hundreds of thousands of Hispanics to be put in some serious, dangerous situations.
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:40.080]  We need immigration reform and we need it now. The Biden administration needs to not only address it, but start to seriously take some steps to reverse this.
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:48.080]  I don't care if they're Hispanic, black, white, whatever. I've been around these leftists here in Austin for 27 years on air.
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:55.080]  They're a ruling class. The left knows they're bringing in slave labor. They know they're bringing in an underclass. They know that and want more people to rule over.
[2:45:55.080 --> 2:46:03.080]  The average leftist is not some well-meaning person. At the management level, these are some cold-blooded people.
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:09.080]  A lot of these people, they're just blind, Alex. A lot of these people are just told what to believe and you're absolutely right.
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:14.080]  That's a big point that I've been making as well is when you take a look at, because a lot of people just get annoyed, right?
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:19.080]  A lot of people are just like, okay, we're sitting here. We're complaining about these things all freaking day long.
[2:46:19.080 --> 2:46:26.080]  But what is really the fact of the matter with what's going on in the hearts of these people that view these things? It's pure evil.
[2:46:26.080 --> 2:46:33.080]  That's what this is. This is pure evil and people, they identify it. They see it. They know it's happening and they turn to blind eyes.
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:40.080]  And by the way, Drew, I look at you. You have nice, focused eyes, intelligent eyes. I look at Saki or Brian Skelter.
[2:46:40.080 --> 2:46:45.080]  I mean, if I saw them walking down a hallway, an alley at night, I'd be scared. I mean, she looks like a psycho from a movie.
[2:46:45.080 --> 2:46:51.080]  Brian Skelter looks like a psychotic. So does Joe Biden. So does Kamala Harris. She had a half a percent support with Democrats.
[2:46:51.080 --> 2:46:58.080]  So even their people reject them. I mean, you had Tulsi Gabbard looks loving and good and you just feel like she's not perfect.
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:03.080]  Your gut tells you she's good. Your gut tells you Trump's good. You look at these people that's a freaking monster.
[2:47:03.080 --> 2:47:09.080]  I mean, put her back on screen. Put her back on screen. She looks like such an evil demon and she is one.
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:14.080]  So the cover of the book does match the interior.
[2:47:14.080 --> 2:47:22.080]  Not only not only do their looks come off very, very frightening, Alex, but their actions as well, their actions speak louder than their words.
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:29.080]  Their actions speak louder than their looks could ever speak because what they are doing is turning a blind eye to evil.
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:37.080]  And when you turn a blind eye to evil and you attempt to suppress it and lie about it, you know, you're dealing with some pretty, pretty evil people.
[2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:40.080]  I mean, Kamala Harris went viral the other day, right, Alex?
[2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:46.080]  Reporters have been asking Kamala Harris, Hey, do you have any, do you have any trips planned for the border?
[2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:51.080]  What's going on with the board? And she laughs with she laughs with her evil little.
[2:47:51.080 --> 2:47:56.080]  Like some crazy hyena. It's like, who voted for these people?
[2:47:56.080 --> 2:48:04.080]  Why did you vote for this crazy hyena that laughs about kids being human trafficked, raped and kidnapped at the border?
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:08.080]  That's your response as the leader, the vice president of the United States.
[2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:13.080]  That's your response. You laugh. That is a clear definition of who these people are.
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:18.080]  When they're asked about the crisis, when they're asked about these things taking place, they laugh.
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:23.080]  And why do they laugh, Alex? Because they don't care. And because they're pure evil. They're pure evil.
[2:48:23.080 --> 2:48:24.080]  That's exactly what this is.
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:28.080]  You're right, Drew. I've had a lot of great guests on, but you're one of the best in a long time.
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:32.080]  I hope you'll join the other shows, American Journal in the Morning, I'll destroy her in the war room.
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:34.080]  And I hope you'll join us again soon.
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:38.080]  And we'd love to talk to you more about the reporting you're doing on the border and hopefully work with you on that.
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:41.080]  God bless you and thank you so much for your time today.
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:43.080]  Absolutely, Alex. Thank you. Love you guys.
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:47.080]  Wow. Well, that guy's telling the truth. That was an amazing interview and that gives me hope for the future.
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:50.080]  Roger Stone is coming up in the next hour.
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:58.080]  We will not be here. We will not be able to support and sponsor so many other reporters and so many other people that come on here to expand their platform without you.
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:06.080]  So know this, kind of like the old days and still today, Christians that couldn't go around the world to preach the gospel, they would pay missionaries to do it.
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:11.080]  And that's basically what this is. I want to stay on air. I passionately don't want to give it to the globalists.
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:14.080]  I don't want them to win. They're trying to shut us down. They're attacking us a lot of different ways.
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:17.080]  I'm not going to spend my time getting into all that.
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:23.080]  Just know this, when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you are literally sabotaging the entire New Old Origin.
[2:49:23.080 --> 2:49:29.080]  So we have the new Mega Blowout Sale 50% off plus free shipping on these top selling items.
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:36.080]  Vaso Beach sold out. Alpha Power sold out. The Vitamin Refusion sold out.
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:43.080]  It'll be back in soon, hopefully. We have Living Defense, the next little probiotic antiparasite.
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:51.080]  People love that's 50% off plus free shipping. All Ionine products, X2, X3, the super topical spray that's super strong.
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:56.080]  All of that, 50% off. Learn about the good halogen. It's amazing.
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:50:02.080]  infowarstore.com, Brainforce plus 50% off, free shipping, and so much more.
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:10.080]  And again, all the Emirates Essentials, people will, I'll be outside and spray a little bit of this on my hands, just so natural it's infected.
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:15.080]  I like the eucalyptus, but also the peppermint. Then of course, the lavender is amazing.
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:21.080]  All natural Emirates Essentials, big old bottle of this. It's 50% off hand sanitizer. People love it.
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:26.080]  That is selling out very, very quickly, but we got to move all this product out the door to just find the operation.
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:32.080]  So get it all at infowarstore.com or call 12-3-888-253-3139.
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:36.080]  And this sale is going to have to end very, very soon because a lot of this is about to sell out.
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:38.080]  We'll be right back now.
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:42.080]  Alex Jones here with the new Info War Sale, and it is a fantastic sale.
[2:50:42.080 --> 2:50:46.080]  It is many of our best-selling products that just so happened to also be selling out.
[2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:52.080]  But despite that, they're 50% off and free shipping on these select items.
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:56.080]  Again, all these are selling out except for Brainforce. It finally came back into stock.
[2:50:56.080 --> 2:50:59.080]  It's amazing. It's 50% off and free shipping.
[2:50:59.080 --> 2:51:04.080]  We've got the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the cabbage shill, the vaso beets, the alpha power.
[2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:11.080]  All of these are best sellers, 50% off and free shipping at infowarstore.com
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:15.080]  or AAA-253-3139, and it funds their operation.
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:21.080]  Plus, all of the Emirates Essentials, essential oils, natural deodorants, shampoos, conditioners,
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:25.080]  a whole host of products. The entire Emirates Essentials line is close to selling out.
[2:51:25.080 --> 2:51:29.080]  We're coming in a few months, but despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:32.080]  they're all 50% off as well with free shipping.
[2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:37.080]  Just follow the banners at infowarstore.com to huge savings, and it funds the Info War, a 360 win.
[2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:44.080]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:53.080]  Even before I had an access to this show in the mid-90s, I wouldn't call that movie and thought,
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:57.080]  man, that was fun. In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas,
[2:51:57.080 --> 2:52:00.080]  and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:02.080]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:05.080]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy.
[2:52:05.080 --> 2:52:09.080]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  because these topics are so huge or so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:18.080]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you.
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  They enjoy destroying humanity. They enjoy manipulating ideas
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:25.080]  and using people's ignorance against them.
[2:52:25.080 --> 2:52:28.080]  That, for me, is really such a disgusting.
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:32.080]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole Info War crew
[2:52:32.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  that we will never join the globalists.
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:53:02.080]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:09.080]  Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, a think tank started 23 years ago in 1998,
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:16.080]  has conducted dozens of exercises on simulated pandemics and bioweapons attacks,
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:22.080]  including Operation Dark Winter in 2001, where one of the main objectives
[2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:26.080]  was how to force vaccinate an uncooperative population.
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:34.080]  The Atlantic Storm in 2005 addressed the logistics of mass vaccinations and military quarantines.
[2:53:34.080 --> 2:53:41.080]  Clade X in 2018 pushed for radical fast-tracking of vaccine production.
[2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:48.080]  Crimson Contagion was a massive exercise launched in January of 2019.
[2:53:48.080 --> 2:53:55.080]  It involved scores of organizations, public and private, from both the federal and state level.
[2:53:55.080 --> 2:54:03.080]  Crimson Contagion lasted for over half a year and was based on a severe pandemic that originated in China.
[2:54:03.080 --> 2:54:10.080]  In October 18th of 2019, Johns Hopkins partnered with the World Economic Forum
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:16.080]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to sponsor Event 201,
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:23.080]  a simulation wherein an outbreak of a bat coronavirus kills 65 million people.
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:29.080]  The culmination of all these studies was published in November of 2019.
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:35.080]  The CSIS Commission on Strengthening America's Health Security urges the U.S. government to, quote,
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:41.080]  replace the cycle of crisis and complacency that has long plagued health security preparedness
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:47.080]  with a doctrine of continuous prevention, protection and resilience.
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:53.080]  In other words, they're calling for the medical tyranny we are now seeing manifest around us.
[2:54:53.080 --> 2:54:58.080]  Signed by former military, big pharma and U.S. representatives,
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:55:03.080]  the CSIS document calls for continuous rapid vaccines,
[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:10.080]  while also warning that the vaccines may go wrong and start spreading more disease.
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:14.080]  And on that subject, what disease are we talking about?
[2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:20.080]  After a year of COVID-19, the numbers show us it is no more deadly than the common cold.
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:26.080]  And even the WHO admit that all the PCR tests from 2020 are meaningless.
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:31.080]  And they had the vaccine before the mysterious outbreak ever occurred.
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:37.080]  The agenda is now clearly about endless vaccinations for everyone.
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:42.080]  New mRNA vaccines that have never gone through human testing until now.
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:47.080]  The same controversial technology as the CRISPR tech,
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:52.080]  wherein one can easily splice human DNA and permanently modify it.
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:55.080]  They say the possibilities are endless.
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:56:00.080]  So now we can target nearly any sequence in our own genetic code at will.
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:04.080]  Jennifer Doudna, who won the Nobel Prize for CRISPR,
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:11.080]  tried calling for a worldwide moratorium on any clinical application of gene editing using CRISPR.
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:13.080]  But no one seemed to care.
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:16.080]  Not only does there seem to be zero regulation,
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:20.080]  but anyone can cheaply buy and learn what they need to online
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:25.080]  to permanently change the genome in practically any living creature.
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:38.080]  The mRNA vaccine is based on CRISPR technology.
[2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:44.080]  China recently used CRISPR tech to genetically modify babies to be immune to HIV.
[2:56:44.080 --> 2:56:48.080]  And as a result, lessened their lifespans.
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:52.080]  Just like C.C.S. warned, it all may go wrong.
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:58.080]  And when it does, big pharma at all is free from any and all liability.
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:04.080]  The solution will be more gene-altering vaccinations until they finally get it right.
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:05.080]  Or not.
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:09.080]  Eventually, and certainly sooner rather than later,
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:14.080]  an unaltered natural human body will be considered a biohazard.
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:19.080]  And full control over the human genome will become the new normal.
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:25.080]  Without argument, we are now in the era of genetically modified humans.
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:27.080]  There's about two minutes left.
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:29.080]  The report is extremely important.
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:31.080]  It's a banned-out video on the Gregory section.
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:33.080]  The age of genetically modified humans has arrived.
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:35.080]  This is a genetic takeover.
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:37.080]  We'll be right back with Roger Stelman's huge news.
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:38.080]  Please stay with us.
[2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:52.080]  Granny Do Right.
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:53.080]  Granny Do Right.
[2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:54.080]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[2:57:54.080 --> 2:57:55.080]  Go ahead.
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:56.080]  Challenge.
[2:57:56.080 --> 2:57:58.080]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:05.080]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:09.080]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:12.080]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:15.080]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:17.080]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:58:17.080 --> 2:58:22.080]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:26.080]  well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:58:26.080 --> 2:58:29.080]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:35.080]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK, you know, this is a ticket.
[2:58:35.080 --> 2:58:36.080]  This is working.
[2:58:36.080 --> 2:58:37.080]  This is wonderful.
[2:58:37.080 --> 2:58:41.080]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:57.080]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:59:02.080]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[2:59:02.080 --> 2:59:07.080]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:11.080]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:16.080]  Everybody knows the good guy's loss.
[2:59:16.080 --> 2:59:20.080]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[2:59:20.080 --> 2:59:22.080]  The poor stay poor.
[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:25.080]  The rich get rich.
[2:59:25.080 --> 2:59:29.080]  That's how it goes.
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:34.080]  Everybody knows.
[2:59:34.080 --> 2:59:39.080]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
[2:59:39.080 --> 2:59:44.080]  Everybody knows the captain line.
[2:59:44.080 --> 2:59:53.080]  Everybody got this broken feeling like their father or their dog just died.
[2:59:53.080 --> 2:59:58.080]  Everybody talking to their partners.
[2:59:58.080 --> 2:59:59.080]  Everybody.
[2:59:59.080 --> 3:00:03.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[3:00:03.080 --> 3:00:07.080]  I woke up at 5am this morning and I went down and got a cup of coffee and got in front of
[3:00:07.080 --> 3:00:09.080]  my desktop computer in my office.
[3:00:09.080 --> 3:00:11.080]  And I said, let me see what the enemy's doing.
[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:15.080]  Let me go on over to CNN.com.
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:19.080]  And I went on over to CNN.com and I saw right up there at the top of the page.
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:21.080]  It's moved down a little bit down the page.
[3:00:21.080 --> 3:00:23.080]  Today, I'll show it to you here in a moment.
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:24.080]  Aren't traffic crew will pull that up.
[3:00:24.080 --> 3:00:25.080]  Just go to CNN.com.
[3:00:25.080 --> 3:00:27.080]  I've been in control of Roger Stone.
[3:00:27.080 --> 3:00:33.080]  You see right there that the Justice Department is looking at him.
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:37.080]  Key Trump ally draws review scrutiny from prosecutors.
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:40.080]  Yes, there is the video.
[3:00:40.080 --> 3:00:45.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, he gave a speech and Oath Keepers was there.
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:46.080]  Oh, my gosh.
[3:00:46.080 --> 3:00:48.080]  And one of the people went to the Capitol.
[3:00:48.080 --> 3:00:49.080]  They got arrested.
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:54.080]  And so they're looking to arrest Roger Stone and me too.
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:01:00.080]  And now we've got all these articles dealing with this.
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:02.080]  Tucker Carlson covered it last night.
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:06.080]  Former DEA official went to hear President speak.
[3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:08.080]  Never set foot inside US Capitol.
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:10.080]  Never committed a single crime.
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:12.080]  Gets fired.
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:15.080]  Mark Ember him.
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:17.080]  Oh, but it happened to somebody else.
[3:01:17.080 --> 3:01:19.080]  They're trying exclusive.
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:23.080]  Why is a loyal New York City police officer from Staten Island being
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:28.080]  persecuted for his off-duty political support of Donald Trump
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:31.080]  and his friendship with Roger Stone?
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:34.080]  We're going to talk about Sal Greco, who I've met before,
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:39.080]  with Roger just quietly being his real security for free, a family friend.
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:43.080]  And so there you go was Roger never even went to the speech that day
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:45.080]  because they couldn't get him to the VIP entrance.
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:46.080]  There was like a million people there.
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:49.080]  He didn't even go to the Trump speech.
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:51.080]  But oh, he's the mastermind.
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:52.080]  You know, we could joke about this.
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:56.080]  I happen to see a video re-uploaded to YouTube this morning that I've been looking.
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:02:01.080]  And it was them basically, you know, making fun of me going,
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:05.080]  oh, look, Jones laughed four years ago when they were calling Roger Stone
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:06.080]  and him Russians.
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:08.080]  And I'm joking at dinner with Roger and my wife.
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:10.080]  I'm going, oh, look, the clams are Russian.
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:12.080]  And oh, look, you're a Russian.
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:13.080]  But see, it wasn't funny.
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:16.080]  And they indicted Roger later and all of it was a fraud.
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:17.080]  So he joins us now.
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.080]  He's on the road to an important mission.
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:20.080]  We appreciate him pulling over to do this.
[3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:21.080]  We'll let him go in about three segments.
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:23.080]  Roger, good to have you here.
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:24.080]  Wow.
[3:02:24.080 --> 3:02:28.080]  So just, just simply, simply amazing here.
[3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:32.080]  What in the world is going on?
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:38.080]  Seeing this movie, what happens is because of the grace of God and the fact that I escaped
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:44.080]  the deadly snare of set by Congressman Adam Schiff and Robert Mueller,
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:47.080]  and that I'm not dying of COVID in a prison.
[3:02:47.080 --> 3:02:54.080]  The blood loss, the hatred, the vitriol for me and for my family has reached,
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:56.080]  reached, you know, tsunami level.
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:02.080]  When that happens, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MNBC,
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  the usual suspects, the same people who for two years said I was a Russian asset
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:11.080]  and I was collaborating with WikiLeaks, none of which was true,
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:14.080]  none of which the government even claimed.
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:20.080]  They are now back with a new narrative using essentially guilt by association
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:28.080]  and innuendo to imply that I and you and others were somehow involved
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:32.080]  in the illegal acts at the Capitol on January 6th.
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:37.080]  Things I found appalling and shocking and that I have no knowledge of
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:40.080]  and wouldn't have supported had I known about it.
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:45.080]  I'd have turned whoever was involved in because it was a stupid idea,
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:51.080]  not only illegal, but politically counterproductive and anti-democratic.
[3:03:51.080 --> 3:03:54.080]  That's not what we were in Washington for.
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  We're in Washington for peaceful protest.
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:02.080]  We're in Washington to protest the irregularities and the anomalies
[3:04:02.080 --> 3:04:04.080]  in the voting returns.
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:06.080]  We have a First Amendment right to do that.
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:09.080]  We weren't calling for toppling of the government.
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:13.080]  We were following a constitutionally mandated process
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.080]  for the settling of election disputes
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:22.080]  and the ultimate declaration of a winner of the Electoral College.
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:24.080]  It didn't go our way.
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:25.080]  The courts wouldn't hear it.
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:28.080]  The Congress decided otherwise.
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:29.080]  The game is over.
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:34.080]  Joe Biden is your president, at least legally now.
[3:04:34.080 --> 3:04:39.080]  That's not but raising questions about the election
[3:04:39.080 --> 3:04:45.080]  or speaking about apocalyptic terms about the choices America faces.
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:48.080]  That's not calling for insurrection or violence.
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:52.080]  And Roger, haven't we been proven apocalyptically correct
[3:04:52.080 --> 3:04:55.080]  with the border collapse, the Mexican president saying that
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:05:00.080]  Biden's created an international crisis, the fuel prices exploding,
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:03.080]  the dollar in trouble, China laughing at us publicly.
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:06.080]  I mean, Joe Biden is an emergency.
[3:05:06.080 --> 3:05:09.080]  Well, all those things are true.
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:13.080]  So programmatically on issues, I think we've been proven right.
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:17.080]  But this is the latest attempt of the deep state
[3:05:17.080 --> 3:05:20.080]  to silence their most effective critics.
[3:05:20.080 --> 3:05:24.080]  This is born of hatred, of bloodlust.
[3:05:24.080 --> 3:05:27.080]  They're not happy to have destroyed me financially.
[3:05:27.080 --> 3:05:30.080]  They're not happy to have dragged my name through the mud
[3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:34.080]  while I was gagged by a federal judge and couldn't defend myself.
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:37.080]  They weren't happy to destroy my wife's health.
[3:05:37.080 --> 3:05:41.080]  They weren't happy that I have to have professional security
[3:05:41.080 --> 3:05:45.080]  when I travel outside my home area because I've had so many incidents
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:49.080]  as you have in airports and restaurants, on streets.
[3:05:49.080 --> 3:05:52.080]  You know, some people don't know how to...
[3:05:52.080 --> 3:05:55.080]  And here's why we've got to have security on top of it.
[3:05:55.080 --> 3:05:58.080]  They attack you and then they lie and call the police.
[3:05:58.080 --> 3:06:02.080]  You've always got to have a professional, retired law enforcement witness
[3:06:02.080 --> 3:06:06.080]  just to deal with the cops when the left attacks you and then calls the police.
[3:06:06.080 --> 3:06:08.080]  That's how diabolical they are.
[3:06:08.080 --> 3:06:10.080]  That's exactly right.
[3:06:10.080 --> 3:06:15.080]  Look, I had always used two off-duty D.C. police officers
[3:06:15.080 --> 3:06:18.080]  and a retired officer from Prince George's County
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:21.080]  who provided professional security for me and my family
[3:06:21.080 --> 3:06:25.080]  during the many hearings I had prior to my trial
[3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:30.080]  in which I was ordered by the court to be present and during my trial itself.
[3:06:30.080 --> 3:06:33.080]  They were unavailable on January 5th and 6th.
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:37.080]  Like many of the speakers on the events of those days,
[3:06:37.080 --> 3:06:42.080]  I was provided voluntary security by the oath people.
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:45.080]  No, I didn't know any of them on an intimate basis.
[3:06:45.080 --> 3:06:49.080]  My interactions with them were entirely professional, efficient.
[3:06:49.080 --> 3:06:51.080]  They were very polite and they helped protect me
[3:06:51.080 --> 3:06:54.080]  because I could not move in any direction without...
[3:06:54.080 --> 3:06:56.080]  We've got to talk about this for going to break,
[3:06:56.080 --> 3:06:58.080]  but I twisted your arm to go.
[3:06:58.080 --> 3:07:01.080]  I even gave you a little bit of money because I know you're broke.
[3:07:01.080 --> 3:07:03.080]  You'll fly up there.
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:05.080]  And I remember you saying, I have no money for security.
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:07.080]  Are you going to handle it?
[3:07:07.080 --> 3:07:09.080]  And I said, yeah, get with me, but you never ended up getting with me
[3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:12.080]  because the town was so mobbed you couldn't even find me.
[3:07:12.080 --> 3:07:14.080]  And so Oath Keepers helps you out.
[3:07:14.080 --> 3:07:18.080]  But the fact that some fraternal organization of police and military
[3:07:18.080 --> 3:07:21.080]  that followed the Constitution gave you security
[3:07:21.080 --> 3:07:24.080]  does not make you a party to what a few of them did
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:26.080]  taking a stroll in the Capitol. Stay there.
[3:07:26.080 --> 3:07:29.080]  And I should have talked about this when we got Roger on.
[3:07:29.080 --> 3:07:31.080]  Some good news when we come back.
[3:07:31.080 --> 3:07:33.080]  And so Roger will tell us story of what happened to him
[3:07:33.080 --> 3:07:38.080]  and the reason it's important is they're trying to frame the entire country.
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:41.080]  My medical doctor got a visit because they were in DC
[3:07:41.080 --> 3:07:43.080]  where the speech weren't part of the Capitol.
[3:07:43.080 --> 3:07:45.080]  It's crazy, but look at this big CNN report.
[3:07:45.080 --> 3:07:49.080]  DOJ refers former Capitol riot prosecutor,
[3:07:49.080 --> 3:07:52.080]  former U.S. attorney Michael Sherwin
[3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:57.080]  to internal investigation after 60 minutes interview
[3:07:57.080 --> 3:08:01.080]  where he said, we know it's insurrection and we're going to get him.
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:06.080]  And we now know he's ordered people to set me up to set Roger up.
[3:08:06.080 --> 3:08:10.080]  I've had the fed send me letters, subpoenas, freezing,
[3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:15.080]  you know, data saying don't destroy anything under his pinheaded orders.
[3:08:15.080 --> 3:08:17.080]  And so again, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:08:17.080 --> 3:08:20.080]  what he's doing is pure political persecution, totally illegal,
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:23.080]  destroys any of the cases they have against anybody out there,
[3:08:23.080 --> 3:08:28.080]  and it just shows the lawlessness of these Obama and Hillary people.
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:30.080]  So that's a big deal for Roger that they're now admitting
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:34.080]  this is the guy gunning for us, demanding they cook up cases on us,
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  now under internal review for criminal activity.
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:41.080]  It is criminal, by the way, to try to go rig juries against us.
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:43.080]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:46.080]  Straight ahead. Stay with us.
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:48.080]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:50.080]  It's very bittersweet.
[3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:53.080]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:08:53.080 --> 3:08:55.080]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:57.080]  I care about beating the new world border.
[3:08:57.080 --> 3:08:59.080]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[3:08:59.080 --> 3:09:02.080]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:04.080]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[3:09:04.080 --> 3:09:07.080]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:10.080]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end.
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:12.080]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:15.080]  So please pray for us and please buy the products

[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:32.080]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:35.080]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.

[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:52.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:05.080]  Well, the big news here is that Michael Sherwin,
[3:11:05.080 --> 3:11:08.080]  the former U.S. Attorney, just got quietly removed
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:13.080]  for unethically going on 60 minutes and saying,
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:16.080]  we know it's sedition, we know Trump's involved.
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:18.080]  Total course craft, I can tell you.
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:20.080]  Obviously, no evidence of that.
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:23.080]  And the Democrats even bragged they helped set the whole thing up for Vakaturit.
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:26.080]  We did have some useful idiots that didn't go into the Capitol.
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:27.080]  It wasn't Pearl Harbor, though.
[3:11:27.080 --> 3:11:31.080]  They're certainly exaggerating a billion times.
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:33.080]  But imagine this.
[3:11:33.080 --> 3:11:36.080]  Again, I get up this morning and there is CNN,
[3:11:36.080 --> 3:11:38.080]  Front Page, Roger Stone.
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:41.080]  He's under criminal investigation.
[3:11:41.080 --> 3:11:43.080]  And again, I was there just like the WikiLeaks going,
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:44.080]  come on, come to DC.
[3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:45.080]  Come, come speak, please.
[3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:46.080]  No.
[3:11:46.080 --> 3:11:47.080]  No.
[3:11:47.080 --> 3:11:48.080]  It's a bunch of idiots running it.
[3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:49.080]  They don't know what they're doing.
[3:11:49.080 --> 3:11:50.080]  They're all morons.
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:52.080]  And of course, he got there, and it was true.
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:55.080]  I'm not against the people, but it was a giant cluster.
[3:11:55.080 --> 3:11:56.080]  You know what?
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:11:59.080]  And then now they want to put him in prison.
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:00.080]  Hell, they'll probably get died as both.
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:02.080]  I mean, the more innocent you are, the more it happens.
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:06.080]  And so here we are again, here is, we'll go right back to Roger here,
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:07.080]  who Skype just broke up.
[3:12:07.080 --> 3:12:16.080]  Here is, here is a part of the CNN demonization report on screen
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:18.080]  for you right there.
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:23.080]  Key Trump ally draws renewed scrutiny from prosecutors.
[3:12:23.080 --> 3:12:27.080]  And then again, next segment, I guess we'll play some of that clip.
[3:12:27.080 --> 3:12:28.080]  Our computer just froze up.
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:33.080]  So Roger, this is bizarre, it's surreal, but you're the one that told me,
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:34.080]  no, this is serious.
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:36.080]  They'll probably come after us both.
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:39.080]  And now it looks like they're going to try it, or maybe they're going to run out of gas
[3:12:39.080 --> 3:12:42.080]  and realize that these witch hunts are blowing up their face.
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:43.080]  What do you make of all this?
[3:12:43.080 --> 3:12:47.080]  What do you make of Michael Sherwin and the fact that he's been removed?
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:51.080]  Because he's been personally demonizing UNI.
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:55.080]  I'm not going to comment on Mr. Sherwin until I've had a chance to read all that, Alex.
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:57.080]  But here's the point.
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:13:03.080]  An honest investigation, a truthful investigation will prove that I've done nothing wrong,
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:05.080]  and I don't believe you have either.
[3:13:05.080 --> 3:13:10.080]  If we have an honest investigation, we can clear this up very quickly.
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:15.080]  But what we see in the media is guilt by association and innuendo.
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:19.080]  It doesn't matter whether it's the Guardian that had an outrageous PCS today,
[3:13:19.080 --> 3:13:25.080]  or CNN, who for two years insisted that I was a Russian spy working with WikiLeaks.
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:27.080]  Now they're back with a new lie.
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:31.080]  It's defamatory, it's false, it's baseless.
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:36.080]  There is no evidence, and there's no crime.
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:42.080]  Earlier CNN was saying that because I had said to a rally Tuesday the 5th
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:47.080]  that this was an epic struggle between good and evil, between dark and light,
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:53.080]  between the godly and the godless, an apocalyptic view of our situation,
[3:13:53.080 --> 3:13:58.080]  that that was an incitement to violence for those who assaulted the Capitol.
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:00.080]  No, I don't think so.
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:06.080]  That's First Amendment protected speech, and I didn't promote violence or lawlessness.
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:09.080]  Plus, compared to Democrat speech, that's tame.
[3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:11.080]  They're out saying burn the cities down.
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:15.080]  But you can go find CNN has a special report in which they say
[3:14:15.080 --> 3:14:20.080]  here's proof that Stone was involved in inciting the riot at the Capitol.
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:25.080]  It's nonsensical, but I've lived with two years of it, and it's the same actors.
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:32.080]  CNN, MSNBC, The Guardian, The Daily Beast, and all the other low-rent,
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:37.080]  left-wing news outlets recycling the same crap.
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:42.080]  The only advantage now is at least I'm not gagged, and therefore I can speak out
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:46.080]  and say this is nonsensical, it's baseless, it's false.
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:51.080]  It's not even logical because no one with any kind of political intellect
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:55.080]  could think that an attack on the U.S. Capitol, trespassing,
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:15:00.080]  destruction of public property, and menacing lawmakers would help the president's cause.
[3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:02.080]  How could you believe that?
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:04.080]  So it's insulting on top of it all.
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:07.080]  Sure, that's like in the cartoons when Yosemite Sam blows himself up.
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:10.080]  I mean, we wanted a 10-day investigation, we probably had the votes.
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:13.080]  The storming ruined us getting the votes.
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:15.080]  This is the last thing we'd want.
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:18.080]  Yeah, it's completely illogical.
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:24.080]  But again, I'm a high-value target because I, through the grace of God,
[3:15:24.080 --> 3:15:27.080]  and I thank God every day for the fact that I'm alive and well
[3:15:27.080 --> 3:15:30.080]  and that I'm able to be on with you, Alex,
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:35.080]  but through the grace of God, the Soviet-style show trial
[3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:39.080]  that I was subjected to in Washington, D.C. was exposed.
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:43.080]  The epic corruption of the jury for a woman was exposed.
[3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:46.080]  The makeup of the jury was exposed.
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:50.080]  The pretrial motions by the judge were finally analyzed.
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:57.080]  And the president had the strength and the courage and the wisdom to grant me clemency.
[3:15:57.080 --> 3:16:02.080]  And the hysterical left in America is still apoplectic about this.
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:06.080]  The bloodlust for me and my family is beyond belief.
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:10.080]  As you know, my life was involved in a politically motivated attack
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:12.080]  outside our home about a month ago.
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:15.080]  This is de-regure. This is the way it goes.
[3:16:15.080 --> 3:16:19.080]  I can't go to the local mall or the local, you know...
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:20.080]  And they're getting more and more crazed.
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:21.080]  So let me bring this up.
[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:24.080]  I know you don't want to stir up any trouble with federal prosecutors,
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:26.080]  but the former U.S. attorney would just remove yesterday,
[3:16:26.080 --> 3:16:28.080]  just broke Michael Sherwin.
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:32.080]  He had said he was investigating Trump with no evidence but thought Trump was involved.
[3:16:32.080 --> 3:16:34.080]  He had said he was investigating all of us.
[3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:37.080]  He's now been removed for basically misconduct,
[3:16:37.080 --> 3:16:41.080]  being political, and ordering prosecutors to basically go...
[3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:43.080]  I mean, you don't have to have prosecutors say,
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:45.080]  this is what happened, now go make it so.
[3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:48.080]  That's illegal. So it's a big deal.
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:53.080]  I agree. I am hopeful that the Biden Justice Department will look at the facts here
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:57.080]  and indict and charge those who actually broke the law.
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:17:02.080]  If they learn that other knuckleheads were involved in the illegal assault on the Capitol,
[3:17:02.080 --> 3:17:04.080]  they too should be prosecuted.
[3:17:04.080 --> 3:17:06.080]  I said that on the very first day.
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:12.080]  I denounced the storming of the Capitol on parlor shortly after it happened.
[3:17:12.080 --> 3:17:16.080]  Unfortunately, the parlor archives are no longer available.
[3:17:16.080 --> 3:17:22.080]  But this whole attempt to take down the entire America First movement
[3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:28.080]  by tying us falsely, baselessly, to the actions of a handful
[3:17:28.080 --> 3:17:31.080]  is really, I think, pretty transparent.
[3:17:31.080 --> 3:17:33.080]  I agree. Do one more segment with us.
[3:17:33.080 --> 3:17:36.080]  Roger Stone here with us exclusively on InfoWars.
[3:17:36.080 --> 3:17:40.080]  Tucker Carlson talked about this former high-level DEA official.
[3:17:40.080 --> 3:17:42.080]  No criminal record. Went to hear Trump's speech.
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:46.080]  He's lost his job. Your good friend who I've met was a great guy,
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:49.080]  Sal Greco, this decorated NYPD police officer.
[3:17:49.080 --> 3:17:56.080]  I want to talk about the level of persecution because they're now firing people
[3:17:56.080 --> 3:18:02.080]  that I know who are just Republicans, wives and husbands from jobs.
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:07.080]  So it's not just Trump people now. They're moving into firing just Republicans.
[3:18:07.080 --> 3:18:08.080]  This is like racketeering.
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:10.080]  Roger, we've got a few minutes. How do we counter this?
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:11.080]  What do we do about this?
[3:18:11.080 --> 3:18:14.080]  Because sure, you're ground zero, I'm ground zero, Trump's ground zero.
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:17.080]  But for people that watch this get persecuted, they're next.
[3:18:17.080 --> 3:18:19.080]  How do we respond to this type of bullying?
[3:18:19.080 --> 3:18:21.080]  Well, there are laws.
[3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:25.080]  You can't hire somebody in most states for their political views.
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:29.080]  A New York police officer is not allowed to be involved in politics
[3:18:29.080 --> 3:18:32.080]  when they're on duty and in uniform.
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:36.080]  On vacation days or their days off, their personal politics is their business.
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:40.080]  As long as they don't misrepresent themselves as representing the NYPD.
[3:18:40.080 --> 3:18:45.080]  Officer Sal Greco became a very good friend of mine on Instagram.
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:47.080]  He was helping to me and my family.
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:49.080]  No, he never worked security for me.
[3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:51.080]  He was never armed around me to my knowledge.
[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:53.080]  He never abused his badge.
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:56.080]  But now he's being persecuted because he was my friend.
[3:18:56.080 --> 3:18:59.080]  Sal Greco has done nothing wrong.
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:01.080]  That's right. In fact, you told me, I always say security.
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:03.080]  He was there as an assistant.
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:06.080]  He worked out whether he'd drive you, he helped you out.
[3:19:06.080 --> 3:19:11.080]  He was a friend, but he was not armed and never abused his authority.
[3:19:11.080 --> 3:19:14.080]  But he was entitled to do that on his vacation day.
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:18.080]  He wasn't involved at all in any way in the events of the Capitol.
[3:19:18.080 --> 3:19:22.080]  He was with me the entire time and we never left our home.
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:28.080]  What we know, Roger Stone, this is un-American persecution.
[3:19:28.080 --> 3:19:32.080]  This is the crap of communist China, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia and its BS.
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:34.080]  And I don't think Americans are being intimidated by this.
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:36.080]  I think they're getting pissed.
[3:19:36.080 --> 3:19:37.080]  There's going to be a major backlash.
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:39.080]  The question is, I hope it's not violent.
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:40.080]  It needs to be peaceful.
[3:19:40.080 --> 3:19:42.080]  The globalists want violence. We do not want that.
[3:19:42.080 --> 3:19:45.080]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[3:19:45.080 --> 3:19:48.080]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me.
[3:19:48.080 --> 3:19:53.080]  And it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support.
[3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:54.080]  Constantly.
[3:19:54.080 --> 3:19:58.080]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:19:58.080 --> 3:19:59.080]  And we're all this together.
[3:19:59.080 --> 3:20:02.080]  And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say,
[3:20:02.080 --> 3:20:05.080]  hey, I've got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:05.080 --> 3:20:06.080]  But it's true.
[3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:09.080]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:12.080]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:20:12.080 --> 3:20:14.080]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:20:14.080 --> 3:20:16.080]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:20:16.080 --> 3:20:20.080]  We're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out in the open,
[3:20:20.080 --> 3:20:21.080]  our credibility is going up.
[3:20:21.080 --> 3:20:23.080]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:23.080 --> 3:20:25.080]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:25.080 --> 3:20:27.080]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:29.080]  And America is still quasi-free.
[3:20:29.080 --> 3:20:31.080]  You can't have info wars has been proven right.
[3:20:31.080 --> 3:20:34.080]  Being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:34.080 --> 3:20:37.080]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:38.080]  So thank you all.
[3:20:38.080 --> 3:20:39.080]  And get an infowarstore.com.
[3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:41.080]  Get some great 2020 election shirts.

[3:20:46.080 --> 3:20:50.080]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:51.080]  Hell, I've been on air 27 years.
[3:20:51.080 --> 3:20:53.080]  And only the last year or so have I said that.
[3:20:53.080 --> 3:20:57.080]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[3:20:57.080 --> 3:20:59.080]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us.
[3:20:59.080 --> 3:21:01.080]  And they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:04.080]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air.
[3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:07.080]  And please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:10.080]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can.
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:12.080]  And get a book. Get a film.

[3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:19.080]  Because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[3:21:19.080 --> 3:21:21.080]  I need your help more than ever now.
[3:21:21.080 --> 3:21:25.080]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:27.080]  So pray for us. Word of mouth.
[3:21:27.080 --> 3:21:30.080]  Tell folks about the broadcast however you can.
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:36.080]  And buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[3:21:36.080 --> 3:21:39.080]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films.
[3:21:39.080 --> 3:21:41.080]  All of it nurtures the soul.
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:43.080]  All of it empowers humanity.
[3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:45.080]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[3:21:45.080 --> 3:21:47.080]  Thank you so much.
[3:21:47.080 --> 3:21:50.080]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:52.080]  America is about to have its energy cut off.
[3:21:52.080 --> 3:21:54.080]  Its borders destroyed.
[3:21:54.080 --> 3:21:57.080]  Its dollar brought down to nothing.
[3:21:57.080 --> 3:22:02.080]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[3:22:02.080 --> 3:22:05.080]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:10.080]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God.
[3:22:10.080 --> 3:22:12.080]  Stop living in fear.
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:15.080]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[3:22:15.080 --> 3:22:17.080]  The enemy can't help itself.
[3:22:17.080 --> 3:22:21.080]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[3:22:21.080 --> 3:22:26.080]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it.
[3:22:26.080 --> 3:22:30.080]  We should, but once it comes through, once it hits us,
[3:22:30.080 --> 3:22:34.080]  once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us,
[3:22:34.080 --> 3:22:37.080]  we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:40.080]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[3:22:40.080 --> 3:22:43.080]  You're going under judgment just like all the children that were aborted.
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:45.080]  This is the truth.
[3:22:45.080 --> 3:22:47.080]  This is the Info War.
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:50.080]  I actually bought this at Blocks UHF Frequency.
[3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:55.080]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us,
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:58.080]  not just tracking and recording our GPS location,
[3:22:58.080 --> 3:23:04.080]  but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery.
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:10.080]  Now with the Info War's privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[3:23:10.080 --> 3:23:11.080]  Excellent.
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:16.080]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[3:23:16.080 --> 3:23:21.080]  And you can too at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:28.080]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers
[3:23:28.080 --> 3:23:32.080]  are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[3:23:32.080 --> 3:23:37.080]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[3:23:37.080 --> 3:23:43.080]  Support the Info War and get your Info War's privacy pouch today.

[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:21.080]  Roger Stone's our guest.
[3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:24.080]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and when he leaves us here in about 10 minutes,
[3:24:24.080 --> 3:24:25.080]  we'll go to break.
[3:24:25.080 --> 3:24:27.080]  I'm going to come back with several clips.
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:31.080]  Biden now at almost every event he does says,
[3:24:31.080 --> 3:24:33.080]  do I take the mask off or are I leaving on?
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:35.080]  What do I do?
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:37.080]  Do you have my confidence?
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:38.080]  Okay, you've got my confidence?
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:39.080]  Then we tell the press to leave?
[3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:41.080]  Okay, tell the press to leave.
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:43.080]  He just says, you know, I'm supposed to go.
[3:24:43.080 --> 3:24:44.080]  I'll just resign.
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:47.080]  I mean, I don't even know who I am.
[3:24:47.080 --> 3:24:54.080]  And he's clearly degenerating very, very quickly.
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:58.080]  Meanwhile, Saki tailspins when asked about 100 Biden's 3.5 million payment
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:02.080]  from Moscow and the mayor's wife, we're going to play that the moment
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:03.080]  for Roger Stone.
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:06.080]  Roger, everything you got accused of, and I know you wish Biden,
[3:25:06.080 --> 3:25:08.080]  well, you don't want to fight with these guys.
[3:25:08.080 --> 3:25:09.080]  You've been through enough.
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:12.080]  Everything they accuse you of is now coming out about the Biden
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:14.080]  clan and all of them.
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:16.080]  Is any of that bittersweet for you?
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:18.080]  Or what is that like?
[3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:21.080]  Well, you still notice that it doesn't lead the mainstream media.
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:25.080]  You're not going to find it on CNN or ABC News.
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:27.080]  They try to pretend it's not happening.
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:29.080]  But it is an epic corruption.
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:32.080]  What would have happened if it was Donald Trump Jr.
[3:25:32.080 --> 3:25:35.080]  who did these deals or Eric Trump?
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:37.080]  Why it would have been, it would have led CNN.
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:40.080]  It would have led NBC and ABC News.
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:45.080]  But this story essentially was suppressed during the election.
[3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:52.080]  And it is extraordinary because once again, right out of the playbook
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:57.080]  for the left, they accuse us of exactly what they are doing.
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:01.080]  The epic corruption of the Clintons and the Bidens is there for everybody
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:05.080]  to see, but the mainstream media is just not interested.
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:08.080]  By the way, you never talked about this, but I was talking to people
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:10.080]  a few years ago when they first indicted you and they said,
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:13.080]  you know, Roger quietly helped round up a whole Russian spy ring
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:17.080]  that was trying to infiltrate lobbyists back in the 80s and early 90s.
[3:26:17.080 --> 3:26:18.080]  And I asked you about it.
[3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:19.080]  You said, yeah, it's true.
[3:26:19.080 --> 3:26:22.080]  I looked it up and even found the New York Times mentioning it.
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:26.080]  I mean, you cut your teeth with Nixon, the guy that helped run the stuff
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:30.080]  with Eisenhower and of course McCarthy.
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:33.080]  So the idea that you're working for the Russians is just like saying
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:35.080]  Superman works with Lex Luthor.
[3:26:35.080 --> 3:26:37.080]  Well, it's even worse than that.
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:41.080]  Alex, I have members of my family who were mowed down by Russian tanks
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:44.080]  in the streets of Budapest in 1956.
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:48.080]  I came to politics through anti-communism, first by Barry Goldwater,
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:50.080]  then by Ronald Reagan.
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:54.080]  And I was always attracted by the hardline policies of Donald Trump,
[3:26:54.080 --> 3:27:00.080]  who was a realist and who recognized that China had supplanted the Russians
[3:27:00.080 --> 3:27:02.080]  as our number one global rival.
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:04.080]  By the way, neither one of them are any good.
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:08.080]  They're both totalitarians and we denounce both their systems of government.
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:14.080]  So the idea that I was a spy for the Russians was ridiculous and insulting.
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:19.080]  And then, of course, on November 3rd, 2020, this election day,
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:24.080]  only months ago, at midnight, the U.S. Justice Department was forced
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:29.080]  by court order to release the last remaining unredacted sections
[3:27:29.080 --> 3:27:33.080]  of Robert Mueller's secret report in which he admitted that he had never found
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:37.080]  any factual evidence that I was colluding with the Russians
[3:27:37.080 --> 3:27:41.080]  or collaborating with WikiLeaks or that they couldn't even support the idea
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:46.080]  that I knew about John Podesta's emails being preloined and published in advance,
[3:27:46.080 --> 3:27:49.080]  which I didn't, and I never claimed that I did.
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:56.080]  So the whole thing was a witch hunt and now we're being subjected to witch hunt 2.0.
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:27:59.080]  I'd like to close down the Stone Legal Defense Fund.
[3:27:59.080 --> 3:28:04.080]  I've still got a few harassment, civil suits I have to ride out,
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:07.080]  but I'd like to close that part of my life.
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:11.080]  Now, I'll probably have to go out and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more on...
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:15.080]  Yeah, well, you told me when this broke a month ago I was laughing as if we did.
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:16.080]  He said, don't laugh.
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:17.080]  He'll probably indict us.
[3:28:17.080 --> 3:28:20.080]  I mean, it's just because reality has nothing to do with it.
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:22.080]  Let me play the Socky clip, as I mentioned.
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:23.080]  This just happened about an hour ago.
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:29.080]  Here's the press secretary, Socky, and here she is just totally blindsided,
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:32.080]  broadsided, T-boned by a Hunter Biden question.
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:33.080]  Here it is.
[3:28:33.080 --> 3:28:37.080]  There was a report last year from the Senate Finance and Homeland Security Committees.
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:43.080]  It claimed that the wife of Moscow's former mayor paid a company associated with the president's son,
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:46.080]  $3.5 million.
[3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:49.080]  There was no explanation for this alleged payments,
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:52.080]  and I'm wondering if you could tell us if that claim is accurate
[3:28:52.080 --> 3:28:56.080]  and if so, what the $3.5 million was paid for?
[3:28:56.080 --> 3:28:57.080]  I'm not familiar with that claim.
[3:28:57.080 --> 3:29:00.080]  It doesn't sound like it's backed up by a lot of evidence.
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:03.080]  If you have evidence or specifics, happy to discuss it further.
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:04.080]  The committee's report.
[3:29:04.080 --> 3:29:06.080]  So you haven't asked about this?
[3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:09.080]  I'm not familiar with the report at all.
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:10.080]  And it's a confirmed report.
[3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:11.080]  It's not debated.
[3:29:11.080 --> 3:29:17.080]  It's like a $3.6 million house connected to drug cartels given to the governor of California.
[3:29:17.080 --> 3:29:20.080]  Roger, to me, the big story is here,
[3:29:20.080 --> 3:29:22.080]  well, that's a real photo.
[3:29:22.080 --> 3:29:23.080]  She just saw her in a Russian outfit.
[3:29:23.080 --> 3:29:25.080]  Is that the media is suddenly turning on Biden?
[3:29:25.080 --> 3:29:27.080]  Is that because Trump isn't there to blame anymore?
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:29.080]  What's happening, Roger?
[3:29:29.080 --> 3:29:32.080]  Well, I think I don't know who asked that question.
[3:29:32.080 --> 3:29:34.080]  That would be important to know.
[3:29:34.080 --> 3:29:38.080]  But I think that those who are, you know,
[3:29:38.080 --> 3:29:42.080]  running the show here have to recognize that the president's infirmities
[3:29:42.080 --> 3:29:46.080]  are going to become clearer and clearer to the American people.
[3:29:46.080 --> 3:29:51.080]  I feel badly for the old guys who want to know the truth because they just think he's being used.
[3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:53.080]  Oh, I think he's definitely being hung out.
[3:29:53.080 --> 3:29:54.080]  So who controls him?
[3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:56.080]  I mean, obviously, Obama, right?
[3:29:56.080 --> 3:30:02.080]  Well, look, I think that you have a power sharing arrangement between Ron Klain,
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:06.080]  who ran Vice President Al Gore's staff,
[3:30:06.080 --> 3:30:11.080]  and Susan Rice, who ran foreign policy during the Biden years.
[3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:13.080]  I think that they are in a power sharing arrangement.
[3:30:13.080 --> 3:30:20.080]  I think Barack Obama is, at a minimum, a major influence on the policy going forward.
[3:30:20.080 --> 3:30:26.080]  And by the way, Biden admitted yesterday that he talks to Obama daily and that he is a major influence.
[3:30:26.080 --> 3:30:28.080]  So that's not up for debate.
[3:30:28.080 --> 3:30:32.080]  Well, and we know that Susan Rice is launching weekly with the Vice President
[3:30:32.080 --> 3:30:36.080]  to tutor her on foreign policy, which as a member of the Senate,
[3:30:36.080 --> 3:30:39.080]  I'm not sure she really needs to be tutored.
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:45.080]  So clearly they recognize, just based on the actuarial tables, things don't look good for Joe Biden.
[3:30:45.080 --> 3:30:47.080]  No, we don't wish him any ill will.
[3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:52.080]  But it's just, it's a reality and it's reality that's becoming clearer and clearer to the Americans.
[3:30:52.080 --> 3:30:55.080]  How do you see that playing out with Kamala Harris?
[3:30:55.080 --> 3:30:57.080]  He's even more unpopular.
[3:30:57.080 --> 3:31:01.080]  Well, she's certainly going to have to answer for in terms of the war on drugs,
[3:31:01.080 --> 3:31:08.080]  the racist war on drugs, which she enforced with Glee as a prosecutor in California.
[3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:12.080]  But clearly they are preparing for some kind of transition.
[3:31:12.080 --> 3:31:17.080]  You notice yesterday, Tucker Carlson reported that the government now brands everything
[3:31:17.080 --> 3:31:23.080]  as coming from the Biden-Harris administration, as opposed to from the Biden administration.
[3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:25.080]  That's never before, never before and done.
[3:31:25.080 --> 3:31:28.080]  You've got to join us again later in the week or next week, because you talked privately with me about
[3:31:28.080 --> 3:31:31.080]  there's no plan, no one's launching a coherent plan to counter them.
[3:31:31.080 --> 3:31:33.080]  So look at your calendar this week, next week.
[3:31:33.080 --> 3:31:36.080]  Roger, I want to do two hours of you with an article you write for us,
[3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:40.080]  or Gateway Pundit, I don't care, with bullet points for the future, what needs to happen,
[3:31:40.080 --> 3:31:42.080]  who we need to draft by General Flynn.
[3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:46.080]  We need to get that publicly out in the ether, because as bad as the Democrats are,
[3:31:46.080 --> 3:31:47.080]  I don't see a Republican plan.
[3:31:47.080 --> 3:31:51.080]  Spend two minutes on enclosing on what you would do right now.
[3:31:51.080 --> 3:31:53.080]  Well, there are a handful of leaders in the party.
[3:31:53.080 --> 3:31:57.080]  For example, Congressman Matt Gaetz is somebody I keep an eye on, Jim Jordan.
[3:31:57.080 --> 3:31:59.080]  There are folks with plans.
[3:31:59.080 --> 3:32:03.080]  They're just not in the leadership of the party today, but make no mistake about it.
[3:32:03.080 --> 3:32:06.080]  We are the America first party.
[3:32:06.080 --> 3:32:08.080]  We are the party of Donald Trump.
[3:32:08.080 --> 3:32:10.080]  If he runs again, I'm for him.
[3:32:10.080 --> 3:32:16.080]  If he chooses not to, I'm for whoever is best to carry that agenda forward of putting America first.
[3:32:16.080 --> 3:32:19.080]  We have lost a battle, but we have not lost the war.
[3:32:19.080 --> 3:32:24.080]  Step one, we must have a free, unfettered access to the internet.
[3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:27.080]  That is the key to our future political success.
[3:32:27.080 --> 3:32:30.080]  And Alex, I want to come back with you soon and talk more about that,
[3:32:30.080 --> 3:32:36.080]  because internet censorship and the de-platforming of anybody who doesn't follow their narrative
[3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:40.080]  is the single most important issue in the country.
[3:32:40.080 --> 3:32:42.080]  We can't fix election laws.
[3:32:42.080 --> 3:32:44.080]  We can't have fair, transparent elections.
[3:32:44.080 --> 3:32:49.080]  We can't clean up the Republican Party and we can't nominate the right person in 2024
[3:32:49.080 --> 3:32:57.080]  until we end the control and censorship of all mass communications by big media and big corporate tech.
[3:32:57.080 --> 3:33:02.080]  That's right. You are also going to be filing reports every few days for info wars.
[3:33:02.080 --> 3:33:05.080]  You're going to be launching a band.video page.
[3:33:05.080 --> 3:33:07.080]  So you can put up unfiltered unfettered.
[3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:10.080]  Got a big interview with you in Florida that's got a lot of historical content.
[3:33:10.080 --> 3:33:13.080]  That's going to be premiering tomorrow here on the air.
[3:33:13.080 --> 3:33:15.080]  Roger Stone, thank you so much for the time.
[3:33:15.080 --> 3:33:17.080]  Look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:21.080]  Alex Jones, you're a great American and a great friend. It's great to be with you.
[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:22.080]  Appreciate you, buddy.
[3:33:22.080 --> 3:33:24.080]  Yeah, they really want to capture him like capture the flag.
[3:33:24.080 --> 3:33:25.080]  They want to put him in jail.
[3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:27.080]  They want to put me in jail.
[3:33:27.080 --> 3:33:31.080]  And it's the idea that we did that capital thing is just ridiculous.
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:33.080]  That is freaking ridiculous.
[3:33:33.080 --> 3:33:34.080]  But who knows?
[3:33:34.080 --> 3:33:36.080]  I mean, Roger's been right all along.
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:38.080]  We'll probably go to prison for it for all I know.
[3:33:38.080 --> 3:33:41.080]  All right, final segment jam packed with a ton of news.
[3:33:41.080 --> 3:34:00.080]  I got ready for you to say what the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:34:00.080 --> 3:34:04.080]  Info wars has been banned.
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:08.080]  Arrested.
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:11.080]  Attacked and threatened.
[3:34:11.080 --> 3:34:14.080]  Because we are effective.
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:16.080]  The great awakening is here.
[3:34:16.080 --> 3:34:18.080]  Go to banned.video.
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:22.080]  Download the videos and share.
[3:34:22.080 --> 3:34:30.080]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[3:34:30.080 --> 3:34:45.080]  Never give up the fight.
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:46.080]  Gerald and South Carolina.
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:47.080]  Go ahead.
[3:34:47.080 --> 3:34:48.080]  You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[3:34:48.080 --> 3:34:49.080]  Hey, Alex.
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:50.080]  Welcome.
[3:34:50.080 --> 3:34:55.080]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people.
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:57.080]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[3:34:57.080 --> 3:34:58.080]  Okay.
[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:04.080]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[3:35:04.080 --> 3:35:06.080]  Living defense saved my life.
[3:35:06.080 --> 3:35:10.080]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[3:35:10.080 --> 3:35:12.080]  Living defense brought me back.
[3:35:12.080 --> 3:35:14.080]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible.
[3:35:14.080 --> 3:35:17.080]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:20.080]  This is Matthew 24 verse nine.
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:25.080]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you.
[3:35:25.080 --> 3:35:29.080]  And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:34.080]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:36.080]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:40.080]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say.
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:46.080]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:51.080]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:35:52.080]  People ask me all the time, they go,
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:55.080]  Joe, you want cocaine or you want meth? How are you so excited?
[3:35:55.080 --> 3:35:58.080]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[3:35:58.080 --> 3:36:01.080]  Force masks, force inoculations.
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:04.080]  Open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved.
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:06.080]  I'm sorry. I'm a fighter.
[3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:09.080]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:11.080]  And so I'll just say this.
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:14.080]  I try to be calm. I try to be focused.
[3:36:14.080 --> 3:36:18.080]  I don't know what I do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[3:36:18.080 --> 3:36:21.080]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:25.080]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the Info War,
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:27.080]  that's not me patting you on the head.
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:30.080]  You are 99% of the equation.
[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:33.080]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products,
[3:36:33.080 --> 3:36:37.080]  infowarstore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce,
[3:36:37.080 --> 3:36:38.080]  it changes the world.
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:40.080]  So you are the Info War.
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:42.080]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:44.080]  Thank you for all you've done.
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:46.080]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalists.
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:49.080]  My enemies are your enemies.
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:52.080]  They're the globalists. They're the Starmast.
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:57.080]  They are a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil-worspers.
[3:36:57.080 --> 3:37:02.080]  Vampires, wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory,
[3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:07.080]  that are setting up a false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda,
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:15.080]  drugs, and electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:21.080]  to mutate us into a form that they can control, like a pawn on a chessboard.
[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:24.080]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God,
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:28.080]  and the news is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[3:37:28.080 --> 3:37:32.080]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news,
[3:37:32.080 --> 3:37:35.080]  and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order,
[3:37:35.080 --> 3:37:39.080]  but at the end of the day it's all about the population, it's all about world government,
[3:37:39.080 --> 3:37:42.080]  it's all about the end of the human system as we know it,
[3:37:42.080 --> 3:37:46.080]  and on its ashes a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:52.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:38:03.080 --> 3:38:08.080]  Welcome back, it's the final segment of the four hours of the Alex Jones Show.
[3:38:08.080 --> 3:38:13.080]  The crew has done an incredible job of only throwing one fit today behind the scenes.
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:16.080]  I'm pissed off at the loveless, but they put up with me.
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:19.080]  They are doing a supertitive job very thankful to the crew,
[3:38:19.080 --> 3:38:23.080]  and all of our radio affiliates, all of our listeners, and of course my family.
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:29.080]  Okay, tomorrow, Max Kaiser is joining us, and I always liked Max Kaiser,
[3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:33.080]  I always respected Max Kaiser, but he's one of the smartest people I know now.
[3:38:33.080 --> 3:38:36.080]  He told me ten years ago, he said it's going to replace the dollar,
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:40.080]  it'll be the world currency, it'll be worth $50,000 of Bitcoin,
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:45.080]  and I just blew him off, and just because, you know, I hear so much speculation,
[3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:50.080]  and now he's been proven right, and he says the big time for Bitcoin is only coming.
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:54.080]  So the matter of it goes up, the matter of it goes down, that's what he's saying,
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:39:00.080]  and now the big banks are taking it, Tesla's taking it, Bitcoin soars,
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:04.080]  after Elon Musk says Tesla now accepting Bitcoin, and here's the big key,
[3:39:04.080 --> 3:39:09.080]  Powell says Federal Reserve is considering proprietary cryptocurrency,
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:12.080]  so that's when you know that that's what they're planning to do,
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:16.080]  and so even if it ends up being bad, and part of the casual society and evil,
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:21.080]  regardless, we have to tell people what we think the best investment's going to be,
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:24.080]  because I've always been, hey, it's speculative, I don't trust it, whatever,
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:28.080]  and I'm not saying pile into it now, but clearly it's being adopted,
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:32.080]  and something is never going to be this valuable and then lose all of its value,
[3:39:32.080 --> 3:39:35.080]  so we'll talk about it with Max Kaiser at the start of the show tomorrow,
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:42.080]  we've got a big broadcast for you tomorrow, but I'm definitely going to go from,
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:46.080]  you know, only studying Bitcoin to, oh, you're selling out if you're going to Bitcoin,
[3:39:46.080 --> 3:39:49.080]  whatever, our fiat currency's even worse, it's all crap,
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:52.080]  and I'd rather see other cryptocurrencies be dominant than what the Federal Reserve
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:57.080]  and the globalists, which are offshore banks, come out with, so Max Kaiser tomorrow,
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:00.080]  what I respect is people that are accurate, people that are over the horizon,
[3:40:00.080 --> 3:40:03.080]  people that have long-term strategic understanding,
[3:40:03.080 --> 3:40:06.080]  and he sure as hell's got that on a bunch of fronts, he's a major trailblazer,
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:09.080]  so that is coming up tomorrow.
[3:40:09.080 --> 3:40:12.080]  Let's go ahead and hit these clips, and I got a Matt Damon clip, it's pretty sick,
[3:40:12.080 --> 3:40:15.080]  and again, I can show you 20 of these, you've all seen them,
[3:40:15.080 --> 3:40:18.080]  but this is one from yesterday and one from today where he's like,
[3:40:18.080 --> 3:40:22.080]  all right, we're here, do I leave my mask on? Yes, sir, you leave it on, okay,
[3:40:22.080 --> 3:40:26.080]  I'll leave my mask on, I mean, is he drugged? Not just Alzheimer's?
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:29.080]  He did it again today, VP Harris, thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence.
[3:40:29.080 --> 3:40:35.080]  Then it's time for the press to leave, so he's talking to him like he's a child.
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:37.080]  Here's those clips back to back.
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:39.080]  Thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence.
[3:40:39.080 --> 3:40:40.080]  Well, thank you.
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:41.080]  Well, thank you very much.
[3:40:41.080 --> 3:40:47.080]  Now we're going to get down to business here, and Ron, who am I turning this over to?
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:50.080]  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:54.080]  I think it's time for our President to press to leave, though. Thank you.
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:57.080]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:01.080]  By the way, stop, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:07.080]  The image of that thing like a puffer fish or a cobra's fan opening of him,
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:10.080]  I mean, just the image of this is so dystopic,
[3:41:10.080 --> 3:41:16.080]  it's even crazier than him falling down three times, going up the Air Force One gantry stairs.
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:20.080]  Look at the bizarreness. Play that clip one more time.
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:22.080]  Mr. President, for your confidence.
[3:41:22.080 --> 3:41:24.080]  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:29.080]  I think it's time for our President to press to leave, though. Thank you.
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:34.080]  Time for the press to leave, because he's freaking out of his mind.
[3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:38.080]  They're having to give him blood transfusions and put him on speed to get him going.
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:40.080]  That dude is gone, man.
[3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:43.080]  I heard from Secret Service sources myself, and also Dan Bongino said it,
[3:41:43.080 --> 3:41:45.080]  that he doesn't even know who he is most of the time.
[3:41:45.080 --> 3:41:52.080]  They had to drug him up, roll him out for limited periods. This is just so biblical.
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:57.080]  They still the election, and now we have this. Here's the next clip from yesterday.
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:00.080]  I'm not going to play the whole thing. We're just like,
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:03.080]  Ah, Luke, I'm your father, Luke.
[3:42:03.080 --> 3:42:05.080]  You like to take my mask off?
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:09.080]  They're like, yes, sir, you keep your mask on. Here it is.
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:13.080]  I guess I'm supposed to keep this on.
[3:42:13.080 --> 3:42:16.080]  I guess I'm supposed to keep this on, correct?
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:17.080]  Yep.
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:23.080]  So, good afternoon, almost getting an evening.
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:31.080]  Before I began, as the congresswoman said earlier today at the White House,
[3:42:31.080 --> 3:42:35.080]  I addressed the mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado.
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:38.080]  While the investigation is ongoing,
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:45.080]  and I spent time in the telephone with the Attorney General as well as the head of the FBI,
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:48.080]  the investigation is still ongoing.
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:51.080]  My heart goes out to the families of the victims and survivors.
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:53.080]  Of course, the Chinese disrespect us. Get him off the screen.
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:43:00.080]  Man, I mean, what the hell happened to us?
[3:43:00.080 --> 3:43:04.080]  Get rid of Trump and steal the election to put that in, that rotting carcass?
[3:43:04.080 --> 3:43:08.080]  Might as well look like a dead rotting dog with maggots all over it up there.
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:12.080]  I mean, the Secret Service all acted manly and tough.
[3:43:12.080 --> 3:43:15.080]  We're protecting our president. What a joke.
[3:43:15.080 --> 3:43:18.080]  We all make ourselves a joke by legitimizing this.
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:22.080]  Wow.
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:29.080]  Speaking of jokes, Matt Damon, Damon Damon, Matt Damon,
[3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:32.080]  climate change will most impact the poorest people.
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:36.080]  Oh, you mean when you cut their power off and make them obsolete
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:38.080]  and tens of millions starved to death with the COVID lockdown?
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:40.080]  Didn't COVID tell them it's a lockdown?
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:43.080]  It's okay. You're a liberal.
[3:43:43.080 --> 3:43:47.080]  And then I've got another Matt Damon headline here where he says,
[3:43:47.080 --> 3:43:50.080]  Bill Gates has taught him, here's the headline,
[3:43:50.080 --> 3:43:55.080]  Matt Damon, Matt Damon, Matt Damon,
[3:43:55.080 --> 3:43:59.080]  Bill Gates taught me humanity moving in the right direction.
[3:43:59.080 --> 3:44:01.080]  He will teach us how to move.
[3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:04.080]  Bill Gates will teach us how to live.
[3:44:04.080 --> 3:44:07.080]  The guy that wants to depopulate is the guy that wants to bring in world government,
[3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:09.080]  the guy that wants to kill old people.
[3:44:09.080 --> 3:44:14.080]  Well, thank God he's here. He will guide us with synthetic meat and depopulation
[3:44:14.080 --> 3:44:16.080]  and kill the old people.
[3:44:16.080 --> 3:44:18.080]  And now Matt Damon, what a pathetic actor.
[3:44:18.080 --> 3:44:21.080]  He's always been known in Hollywood as a totally empty shell.
[3:44:21.080 --> 3:44:25.080]  People that know him say he laughs at everybody and flies on private jets everywhere,
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:26.080]  but that's okay for him.
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:29.080]  And then now Bill Gates has obviously paid him to say this.
[3:44:29.080 --> 3:44:32.080]  Bill Gates, billions of tax free money a year for PR,
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:36.080]  to tell us that Bill Gates will lead us into the light, into the future.
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:40.080]  Here it is.
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:43.080]  Well listen, he's absolutely brilliant.
[3:44:43.080 --> 3:44:48.080]  And I mean, I've certainly learned from his example.
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:50.080]  I've certainly watched him carefully.
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:52.080]  He's done incredible things.
[3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:54.080]  And anywhere you go in the world,
[3:44:54.080 --> 3:44:58.080]  when you interact with an organization that has Gates money,
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:01.080]  it's always the smartest money in the room, right?
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:04.080]  They really, they're wonderful.
[3:45:04.080 --> 3:45:09.080]  And he is, look, I mean, if you listen to him, he's always optimistic.
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:12.080]  And I think that is a key takeaway,
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:15.080]  to look at the trajectory of humankind, right?
[3:45:15.080 --> 3:45:21.080]  And because it's so easy to become nihilistic and dark about this stuff.
[3:45:21.080 --> 3:45:26.080]  And we are going in the right direction and there are solutions available.
[3:45:26.080 --> 3:45:29.080]  And I think that's what he says, I've seen him say quite often.
[3:45:29.080 --> 3:45:31.080]  And that's what we say as well.
[3:45:31.080 --> 3:45:33.080]  There are solutions.
[3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:39.080]  This one we're talking about, you know, is ready to reach hundreds of millions of people, right?
[3:45:39.080 --> 3:45:41.080]  That's an exciting thing.
[3:45:41.080 --> 3:45:43.080]  And so that's probably my biggest takeaway.
[3:45:43.080 --> 3:45:45.080]  Alright, turn him off.
[3:45:45.080 --> 3:45:49.080]  And of course, what he wants is cutting off energy to the third world, stars and death.
[3:45:49.080 --> 3:45:53.080]  Matt Damon, Kim Jong-il.
[3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:55.080]  Now my servant, Matt Damon.
[3:45:55.080 --> 3:45:59.080]  I mean, Matt Damon is a whore, he's a fraud, he's a scammer.
[3:45:59.080 --> 3:46:04.080]  And here he is selling us lives, selling us disinformation, selling us poison.
[3:46:04.080 --> 3:46:07.080]  And I'll cover this more tomorrow on my regular show, 11 a.m.
[3:46:07.080 --> 3:46:09.080]  The 3 p.m. Central Warms, coming up with Dr. Wood Squire.
[3:46:09.080 --> 3:46:13.080]  Please don't forget, I'm not funded by Bill Gates, I'm not funded by Matt Damon.
[3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:16.080]  And Matt Damon doesn't want you to protect your immune system.
[3:46:16.080 --> 3:46:18.080]  He doesn't want you to be fertile, doesn't want you to have good iodine.
[3:46:18.080 --> 3:46:20.080]  All the iodine products are rare sale.
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:24.080]  All four of them are 50% off with free shipping, part of the big blowout sale.
[3:46:24.080 --> 3:46:26.080]  So is Brainforce Plus.
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:28.080]  So is Prostaguardia, though it's selling out.
[3:46:28.080 --> 3:46:30.080]  Basil Beats and Apple Power did sell out.
[3:46:30.080 --> 3:46:36.080]  We've got the fluoride-free concentrated activated charcoal toothpaste
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:38.080]  that my dad designed as a retired dentist.
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:40.080]  That's 50% off, that's selling out.
[3:46:40.080 --> 3:46:45.080]  Thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[3:46:45.080 --> 3:46:50.080]  And almost for God, even though it's selling out, living defense, 50% off parasite cleanse.

[3:46:56.080 --> 3:46:59.080]  And believe me, Matt Damon hopes you don't stand with us, he wants to shut us down
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:03.080]  so you can take that Bill Gates money and sell the population of Africa.
[3:47:03.080 --> 3:47:06.080]  Because he's a liberal after all, he made the movie Elysium, so everything's okay.
[3:47:06.080 --> 3:47:08.080]  He wants to be on Elysium, folks.
[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:10.080]  He wants to make Earth healthy, populate us.
[3:47:10.080 --> 3:47:15.080]  Owen Schreuer in T-minus, like two minutes, will take over with the war room.
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:16.080]  He's loaded for bear.
[3:47:16.080 --> 3:47:18.080]  Owen Schreuer, tell us what's coming up.
[3:47:18.080 --> 3:47:24.080]  Matt Damon, Matt Damon, Matt Damon.
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:26.080]  No, Alex, getting serious though.
[3:47:26.080 --> 3:47:28.080]  You had an incredible interview with Drew Hernandez.
[3:47:28.080 --> 3:47:34.080]  I'm going to take a snippet of one of the clips from his interview and really expand on it.
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:39.080]  This is not like he was saying, this is not conspiracy theory, conspiratorial stuff.
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:47.080]  They're taking adults, middle-aged men, and putting them in hotel rooms with children.
[3:47:47.080 --> 3:47:52.080]  I mean, if you don't see how there's a problem with that, I don't know what's wrong with you.
[3:47:52.080 --> 3:47:54.080]  And they're not even sure whose kids they are.
[3:47:54.080 --> 3:47:57.080]  But hey, but Stocky said just bring your kids on up.
[3:47:57.080 --> 3:48:04.080]  So I mean, Alex, if I do want to get conspiratorial, I would say this is a gang initiation for Kamala Harris
[3:48:04.080 --> 3:48:08.080]  to see what she can do with this sex trafficking at the southern border.
[3:48:08.080 --> 3:48:11.080]  So yeah, Harris is now in charge of the trafficking at the southern border.
[3:48:11.080 --> 3:48:12.080]  Let's see how you do, Kamala.
[3:48:12.080 --> 3:48:15.080]  You want to climb the ladder? You want to be power hungry?
[3:48:15.080 --> 3:48:18.080]  Here you go. Let's help us sex traffic these kids across the border.
[3:48:18.080 --> 3:48:19.080]  Take care of that for us.
[3:48:19.080 --> 3:48:20.080]  Maybe then she can be president.
[3:48:20.080 --> 3:48:21.080]  I agree.
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:24.080]  And we'll see if they'll scapegoat her like Governor Cuomo.
[3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:25.080]  All right, everybody tune in.
[3:48:25.080 --> 3:48:26.080]  Band.video.
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:27.080]  Infowars.com for our show.
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:28.080]  This is all over.
[3:48:28.080 --> 3:48:30.080]  It's the war with Owen Troyer.
[3:48:30.080 --> 3:48:45.080]  Stay with us.
