[00:00.000 --> 00:15.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:15.960 --> 00:23.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:23.240 --> 00:28.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we knew that a global tyranny was coming.
[00:28.480 --> 00:32.720]  An anti-human, satanic, Mark of the Beast world government system.
[00:32.720 --> 00:38.480]  But now in 2018, I can officially tell you, it is emerging.
[00:38.480 --> 00:42.080]  It's here and attempting to completely take over.
[00:42.080 --> 00:44.880]  Prophecy is fulfilled.
[00:44.880 --> 00:49.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have news here where they're taking people, six-year-old children,
[00:49.040 --> 00:53.600]  because the school says the child wants to be transgendered, and then they begin sterilization
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.720]  with chemicals, and then they castrate them.
[00:57.720 --> 00:59.240]  It's all here.
[00:59.240 --> 01:02.320]  Google's not going to let you say he or she when you type in now.
[01:02.320 --> 01:04.160]  They're removing it.
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.480]  World government's being announced.
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.840]  The UN's been caught running giant child kidnapping rings, and currently is involved, and it's
[01:09.840 --> 01:12.960]  confirmed in the huge invasion taking place.
[01:12.960 --> 01:14.640]  Our reporters are on the ground.
[01:14.640 --> 01:16.040]  We've got intel from the Border Patrol.
[01:16.040 --> 01:19.720]  They're getting ready to try to go back over the border in the next two days.
[01:19.720 --> 01:20.720]  Our reporters will be there.
[01:20.720 --> 01:21.720]  It's all coming up.
[01:21.720 --> 01:28.440]  A report from our crew on the ground, on the California-Mexico border.
[01:28.440 --> 01:33.600]  It is Monday night, November 26, 2018.
[01:33.600 --> 01:36.720]  We're standing on the southern border of the United States.
[01:36.720 --> 01:40.200]  Right behind me is San Ysidro Port of Entry.
[01:40.200 --> 01:45.240]  Just yesterday, hundreds of non-U.S. citizens attempted to illegally cross into the border
[01:45.240 --> 01:47.120]  right here.
[01:47.120 --> 01:52.840]  Our sources in Mexico tell us that this was just a test for a much larger attack, which
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.560]  is what it certainly seems to be.
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.280]  The United Nations has been responsible for funding and organizing this unprecedented
[02:03.280 --> 02:10.600]  migrant invasion against sovereign nations for a few years now.
[02:10.600 --> 02:15.960]  They are trying to set a precedent in international law, challenging the sovereign right of nations
[02:15.960 --> 02:19.640]  to secure and regulate their own borders.
[02:19.640 --> 02:26.860]  For a nation without borders has no sovereignty and is not a nation anymore, which is precisely
[02:26.860 --> 02:31.240]  the goal of this malevolent globalist utopia.
[02:31.240 --> 02:38.400]  Smash us all together violently and claim the spoils when the dust settles.
[02:38.400 --> 02:45.000]  The United Nations call it replacement migration, an act as if they have some sort of legal
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.120]  authority over the lives of all human beings.
[02:49.120 --> 02:55.280]  But it is an illegal and hostile invasion, pure and simple.
[02:55.280 --> 02:58.240]  This invasion, however, is very unique.
[02:58.240 --> 03:01.400]  Border defenses are not threatened with invading armies.
[03:01.400 --> 03:08.440]  Rather, they are threatened with so-called civilians, claiming to seek a better life.
[03:08.440 --> 03:15.520]  The nation's legal citizens are threatened with the shame of being called racist or xenophobic.
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.720]  And so the only nations who have successfully managed to defend their borders from this
[03:19.720 --> 03:28.160]  invasion are those who maintain a strong sense of individualism, culture, and national identity.
[03:28.160 --> 03:35.440]  But countries such as Germany, Sweden, France, and the UK have so far failed this test of
[03:35.440 --> 03:38.800]  individual strength.
[03:38.800 --> 03:45.240]  These once great nations are falling at the threat of shame being cast by the United Nations
[03:45.240 --> 03:49.120]  and their NGO proxies.
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.440]  If they can break through the borders, then a precedent is set and the floodgates are
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.440]  open.
[03:55.440 --> 04:01.920]  And now it is happening in the United States.
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.800]  The fact that the United Nations has finally begun their invasion on the U.S. border is
[04:06.800 --> 04:08.680]  no surprise.
[04:08.680 --> 04:11.240]  Many of us saw this coming.
[04:11.240 --> 04:16.800]  The surprise and great disappointment is seeing how many Americans seem willing to sacrifice
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.800]  their freedom so they can virtue signal to the rest of us and protect their fragile egos
[04:22.800 --> 04:26.000]  from being labeled racist or xenophobic.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.760]  But if you cannot secure your home, then you have no home, and you have no nation.
[04:32.760 --> 04:37.920]  And this is precisely what the globalists want, order out of chaos.
[04:37.920 --> 04:38.920]  History is being made.
[04:38.920 --> 04:41.920]  This is Greg Rees for Infowars.com.
[04:41.920 --> 04:47.120]  And that's some of the first-rate people we've got joining the team.
[04:47.120 --> 04:50.320]  Greg's been here already six months, moved him from Hawaii, and he's knocking out of
[04:50.320 --> 04:51.320]  the park.
[04:51.320 --> 04:54.920]  And it's your support of Infowars that allows us to continue to build this operation in
[04:54.920 --> 04:57.040]  the face of total globalist attack.
[04:57.040 --> 04:58.040]  We don't have a choice.
[04:58.040 --> 05:00.320]  Our children are at stake.
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.360]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[05:04.360 --> 05:09.560]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[05:09.560 --> 05:12.520]  It literally dumps the population down.
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.640]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[05:16.640 --> 05:19.400]  gone through two permutations.
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.560]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the globalists
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.520]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:25.520 --> 05:30.320]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[05:30.320 --> 05:31.320]  That's been incredible.
[05:31.320 --> 05:36.720]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[05:36.720 --> 05:38.960]  of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[05:38.960 --> 05:43.440]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[05:43.440 --> 05:49.520]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[05:49.520 --> 05:53.000]  it even more bioavailable.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[05:56.080 --> 06:21.400]  discovery, X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[06:21.400 --> 06:27.320]  The United States of America is under military attack.
[06:27.320 --> 06:33.120]  Europe has been captured by the globalists and is being broken up and then swallowed
[06:33.120 --> 06:36.320]  into a larger world government system.
[06:36.320 --> 06:45.960]  The family and any form of independence is being savagely destroyed.
[06:45.960 --> 06:51.520]  And third-world populations, already exploited by the global crime cartel, are being dumbed
[06:51.520 --> 07:00.760]  down, weaponized, and then marched in to the West to bankrupt our social safety net and
[07:00.760 --> 07:05.680]  to siphon the money off to Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, the Soros Group, and others that
[07:05.680 --> 07:08.040]  administer it.
[07:08.040 --> 07:12.880]  Once the West is collapsed, there will be nothing but a giant mass of poor people worldwide
[07:12.880 --> 07:18.960]  controlled by globalist technocrats.
[07:18.960 --> 07:28.040]  Their most vicious assault and their most naked assault is against children, children
[07:28.040 --> 07:34.760]  who are defenseless, children who can be easily brainwashed, children who can be easily screwed
[07:34.760 --> 07:51.720]  up when authority figures that they genetically are predisposed to listen to carry out incredibly
[07:51.720 --> 08:00.120]  vicious programs to destabilize them.
[08:00.120 --> 08:14.240]  Now our reporters are on the ground in Tijuana, Mexico, and we've got guides in law enforcement.
[08:14.240 --> 08:18.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.920]  They're going to be joining us for their first live report, Regrees and Others, coming up
[08:23.920 --> 08:30.720]  in the third hour.
[08:30.720 --> 08:38.160]  Now remember, just two weeks ago they were telling you that this immigrant illegal alien
[08:38.160 --> 08:41.640]  invasion did not exist.
[08:41.640 --> 08:47.760]  You supposedly don't have a memory to remember that it does and did exist and that their
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.760]  bald face lying to you when Jim Acosta told Trump there is no caravan.
[08:53.760 --> 08:56.600]  Trump said yes, they're there, they're in central Mexico.
[08:56.600 --> 08:57.600]  Are you saying they're actors?
[08:57.600 --> 08:58.600]  Are you saying it doesn't exist?
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.200]  And Acosta said yes, I'm saying it doesn't exist.
[09:02.200 --> 09:11.840]  That is a form of mind control called gas lighting.
[09:11.840 --> 09:18.360]  We have confirmed from the military and ICE and from the Mexican side, from the very best
[09:18.360 --> 09:25.760]  sources out there, that there is about to be a massive attack in two to three days.
[09:25.760 --> 09:36.320]  I was told that information yesterday from multiple sources, I ran it by another very
[09:36.320 --> 09:43.000]  trusted source who's known to most of you and they concurred that that is indeed the
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  case.
[09:44.000 --> 09:54.200]  Obviously, ICE and the U.S. military have moles inside the Soros operations and it is
[09:54.200 --> 10:00.840]  Soros that is cornerbacking it with U.S. taxpayer money and what Trump needs to do is cut off
[10:00.840 --> 10:11.400]  the money to U.S. aid because it's going directly to foment people kidnapping children
[10:11.400 --> 10:16.480]  and using them as human shields as the president and as the head of the board patrol has said
[10:16.480 --> 10:19.640]  and the media is trying to spin it like Trump's claiming it.
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.520]  It's a fact when they break through, they hold the children up as shields.
[10:24.520 --> 10:30.720]  It's a fact that this is done with Middle Easterners as well when they come into Europe.
[10:30.720 --> 10:40.960]  It's a fact that they are being led by these U.N. non-governmental organizations and it's
[10:40.960 --> 10:47.400]  a fact that there are almost no women and children in the group so when you saw the
[10:47.400 --> 10:52.800]  cropped photo put on every major news site and all over TV and promoted by corporate
[10:52.800 --> 10:59.560]  establishment media, the woman who looks like she's had a couple extra meals here and there
[10:59.560 --> 11:07.640]  are two little girls in diapers and underwear with no shoes obviously stripped down by the
[11:07.640 --> 11:13.520]  camera people to make it look even more desperate and then you've actually got all the camera
[11:13.520 --> 11:21.400]  men surrounding for the photo shoot but then one that's put on CNN by Don Lemon or you
[11:21.400 --> 11:22.960]  go find it anywhere in the news.
[11:22.960 --> 11:32.080]  Up in caravan woman children, hit Google images and you'll see this everywhere cropped.
[11:32.080 --> 11:38.440]  I even saw photos where they photoshopped sand behind her head where it looked like
[11:38.440 --> 11:41.600]  she was out there by herself.
[11:41.600 --> 11:47.120]  This is deception ladies and gentlemen.
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.880]  That is doctoring, that is staging, not zooming in on Jim Acosta trying to grab the microwave
[11:53.880 --> 11:58.400]  and pushing the interns arm down.
[11:58.400 --> 12:08.800]  Now when we come back I'm going to break down what the master plan is for your children
[12:08.800 --> 12:15.920]  and for all the children of this world and the absolute pure evil being carried out by
[12:15.920 --> 12:22.880]  the United Nations and by Soros and by the Clintons whose foundations have all been caught
[12:22.880 --> 12:32.760]  up to their eyeballs in child and adult female trafficking and I'm going to show you all
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.720]  the mainstream news articles from years ago that they think you don't remember and then
[12:37.720 --> 12:42.160]  point out that Trump is saying there's grabbers, there's child grabbers, well it's admitted
[12:42.160 --> 12:47.200]  that they grabbed children, children, a bunch of children have been grabbed off the streets
[12:47.200 --> 12:54.360]  in Mexico by the smugglers, especially a two or three year old, you can grab that child
[12:54.360 --> 12:57.320]  and then you're going to get more aid, you're going to get more charity, you're going to
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.440]  get more everything and then once you get to the US you can shell them and the Democrats
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.040]  show up with the different Catholic charities and others and the children are never seen
[13:06.040 --> 13:10.040]  again, some are found dead.
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.640]  So that's what's going on here and so this is a total free-for-all and once they get
[13:14.640 --> 13:20.080]  here under Obama they just let them load on buses, load on trains, load on vans and they're
[13:20.080 --> 13:25.200]  never seen again.
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.480]  But you see the compliant media shows photos of a woman with these little kids in their
[13:29.480 --> 13:36.560]  diapers or in their underwear running, all staged and say the answer is let her get
[13:36.560 --> 13:42.000]  across with the kids and look at those kids, they don't really look like their kids do
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  they?
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.080]  Just saying, don't look like her much do they?
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.720]  All I know is she just took them thousands of miles and they don't have shoes and they're
[13:51.720 --> 13:58.640]  wearing diapers and underwear, she didn't like potty training either, she got like three
[13:58.640 --> 14:07.880]  four-year-olds don't wipe their ass, now this is a staged photo, it's admittedly staged,
[14:07.880 --> 14:11.400]  make you look as scary as possible, stick a diaper on that one, have this one in their
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.920]  underwear, get a whole big giant group of international camera people around, there's
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.480]  video from the other side too, they're carrying people 360 all around her staging her running,
[14:20.480 --> 14:23.280]  running, running because you got to have some women and children in there and there's some
[14:23.280 --> 14:26.960]  real women and children in there and there's video of it, there's men wearing masks with
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.120]  kids, they're crying and they go no, no, no, we've been to El Norte before, yes, we business
[14:33.120 --> 14:40.800]  men, ha, ha, ha, yeah, we business men and as they come up through Guatemala and Mexico
[14:40.800 --> 14:49.560]  they grab your child and then they bring them up here and they get top dollar and the Democrats
[14:49.560 --> 14:54.720]  are waiting with their buses and no one even gets the names of the children and they just
[14:54.720 --> 15:02.360]  get on the buses under Obama and they disappear forever, oh and even the Washington Post, the
[15:02.360 --> 15:08.320]  New York Times, they all had to admit it, they all had to admit it, it's in a Senate
[15:08.320 --> 15:16.160]  report, document cam shot please, here's the Senate report, United States Senate permanent
[15:16.160 --> 15:19.920]  subcommittee of investigations protecting undocumented alien children from traveling
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.240]  and other abuses, the role of the office of refugee resettlement and how the UN's involved
[15:25.240 --> 15:32.080]  and how Obama allowed the trafficking of children that then disappeared, that's the Washington
[15:32.080 --> 15:35.760]  Post, New York Times even had to admit it, but now a few years later they defend it all
[15:35.760 --> 15:40.120]  and say nothing's happening because now the pedophiles and the traffickers are in full
[15:40.120 --> 15:44.960]  control of the media and most of the government and Trump's trying to fight it and they say
[15:44.960 --> 15:50.840]  you shut up Trump, there's no kids getting hurt, now you let them load us on those buses
[15:50.840 --> 15:57.160]  and disappear, oh Netflix has a new movie coming out that's pro pedophilia, shows little
[15:57.160 --> 16:02.480]  girls getting raped, trading involves financial risk it is not suitable for all investors,
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.720]  marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation, it's creating 10.8 billion

[19:54.040 --> 20:01.040]  We're all living in America, America. It's wonderful. We're all living in America, America.
[20:24.040 --> 20:37.480]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us. We're going to cover
[20:37.480 --> 20:45.200]  the heart of the globalist program, dehumanization, deindustrialization for the general public,
[20:45.200 --> 20:51.160]  and sterilization of our children. And to do that, they have to package it as a wonderful
[20:51.160 --> 20:58.760]  human right promoted by the United Nations through UNESCO and then all treaty signers
[20:58.760 --> 21:06.600]  of that then have their education system under the UNESCO program set up by, of course, Julian
[21:06.600 --> 21:13.440]  Huxley, oldest Huxley's brother, the former head of the World Government Society, the
[21:13.440 --> 21:19.080]  former head of the World Eugenics Society, and the founder of the World Transhumanist
[21:19.080 --> 21:25.000]  Society. He wrote in the 50s, first we will blur between men and women, and then we will
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.440]  end the family itself, and then we will begin the sterilization of the children as a right,
[21:31.440 --> 21:39.400]  giving children the rights of adults by age five. And now in the U.S., six-year-olds are
[21:39.400 --> 21:44.680]  being taken, and chemical castration is beginning if the school convinces the child they want
[21:44.680 --> 21:50.160]  it, if the mother and father say no, after the child has mentally traumatized the child,
[21:50.160 --> 21:55.480]  the child is taken, and in some countries the testicles are chopped off right away, but
[21:55.480 --> 22:01.880]  in others they just begin the toxic hormone blockers, which also stunt growth and massively
[22:01.880 --> 22:09.120]  cause cancer, but this is just, this is happening. It's all done, the abuse, the torture, the
[22:09.120 --> 22:15.920]  evil, it's all done in the name of a wonderful right, it's wonderful, but let's start at
[22:15.920 --> 22:26.320]  the other end of this. The U.N. is world famous if you actually study the news and court cases.
[22:26.320 --> 22:30.840]  Until about a year ago, now the corporate press is so controlled they won't even report
[22:30.840 --> 22:37.280]  on it. Reuters reported on thousands of missing children, tens of thousands missing, hundreds
[22:37.280 --> 22:45.920]  found dead, snuff filmed by the U.N. in one country alone, Haiti. We broke it two years
[22:45.920 --> 22:51.120]  before with precision. AP report documents child sexual abuse by U.N. peacekeepers in
[22:51.120 --> 22:56.680]  Haiti. Just like the tens of thousands of kids brutally raped, including satanic rituals
[22:56.680 --> 23:01.800]  by so-called Catholic priests in Pennsylvania alone, no one's going to be indicted because
[23:01.800 --> 23:09.720]  even the fed said it would bring down civilization. Up to 15 men at a time, raping little boys
[23:09.720 --> 23:21.480]  as young as six, and they would tell them when dozens of men deposited their fetid sperm
[23:21.480 --> 23:29.560]  into them that it was the sacrament of Christ. Look it up. So now the gang raping of little
[23:29.560 --> 23:35.340]  children in Catholic churches and it's the Pope says no more investigations and orders
[23:35.340 --> 23:44.120]  it ended two weeks ago. This is a group of devil worshipers that take over every institution.
[23:44.120 --> 23:53.000]  Now, let's look at this headline. Obama administration placed children with human traffickers. The
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.480]  Washington Post, remember that? But the border patrol chief comes out and says they're using
[23:58.480 --> 24:02.680]  kids as human shields, which is on video, and that many of them are kidnapped kids just
[24:02.680 --> 24:07.200]  like a homeless person will kidnap your dog and then use it to get donations. No one even
[24:07.200 --> 24:11.720]  feed them. Never wonder why the homeless have the poor dogs just to get money off you. Well,
[24:11.720 --> 24:17.320]  it's the same if they have the children as a shield. Donald Trump warns of migrant grabbers
[24:17.320 --> 24:23.360]  of children on the border. Mainstream media attacks him, says it's not true, actively
[24:23.360 --> 24:31.360]  covering up. Oh, but look at this. US placed immigrant children with traffickers report
[24:31.360 --> 24:35.880]  says Senate report show the Senate report a moment. That's the New York Times. But see
[24:35.880 --> 24:41.360]  that was two years ago. They won't do that now. No, because they've been fully taken
[24:41.360 --> 24:47.080]  over around 100 migrant caravan members have been kidnapped by human traffickers. London
[24:47.080 --> 24:52.520]  Independent. That's two weeks ago. But Cortez Congresswoman Cortez calls for sending 5000
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.280]  case workers to border to process visa applicants. That's what Obama would do just let him in.
[24:57.280 --> 25:05.080]  That's what she means just to help the trafficking report UN shame report reveal shame of UN
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.760]  peacekeepers all over the world. The UN's main business is actually trafficking women
[25:09.760 --> 25:15.760]  and children because they've got international diplomatic immunity. That's what they do.
[25:15.760 --> 25:23.080]  AP exclusive UN child sex ring left victims but no arrest. Hundreds dead, thousands missing.
[25:23.080 --> 25:28.400]  It's a huge report. Go read it. Word for art. We told you years before UN sex trafficking
[25:28.400 --> 25:34.080]  whistleblower fetid in film. 80% of Central American women girls are rape crossing into
[25:34.080 --> 25:42.040]  the US. Huffington Post. They're desperate. Then they're right. Migrant women face sexual
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.480]  assault. Where do you think the rapers go? They got to be part of the UN part of the
[25:45.480 --> 25:50.200]  refugee camps. Part of all of it. Is rape the price to pay for migrant women chasing
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.840]  the American dream? And here's the Senate report for TV viewers. It's all right there.
[25:55.840 --> 26:02.520]  The UN involved all of it. But when I talk about Robert Mueller knowing that Jeffrey
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.000]  Epstein was doing this on his Alita Express with hundreds of little girls and world leaders
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.640]  having sex with them and it turned out that Mueller was running cameras in there to set
[26:11.640 --> 26:16.200]  all these people up in blackmail. The media covered for him and said that I said he was
[26:16.200 --> 26:24.160]  raping children. When I specifically said he doesn't do it, he just runs it. Oh, let's
[26:24.160 --> 26:31.360]  be scared of him. Oh, we all know. Delivering uranium on tarmacs and the Russians, everything
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.200]  else and then running around and dying all these innocent people. You're going to stand
[26:35.200 --> 26:40.680]  up for these kids. Most heavy aren't men. You're not. You're going to bow down to this
[26:40.680 --> 26:46.200]  monster. Let me tell you something. He'll face God. Robert Mueller will face God and
[26:46.200 --> 26:53.040]  God will bring vengeance upon him. Don't you worry about that? I don't wish any harm on
[26:53.040 --> 27:05.200]  the little chinny chin chin of him. But you see these people are monsters. Oh, but don't
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.960]  worry. Netflix girl sparks controversy over underage unity and it shows the naked little
[27:10.960 --> 27:18.720]  girl who's a boy and then there's another Netflix show about girls and sex trafficking
[27:18.720 --> 27:24.840]  being raped and then they show that and it's just a way to get it on the air. Netflix is
[27:24.840 --> 27:30.560]  girl sparks controversy and again, this is a total deception. It's a boy. They call it
[27:30.560 --> 27:41.440]  a girl and then show a boy with male genitals and say that the ballerina is really a girl
[27:41.440 --> 27:47.080]  in 1984. The ability to say two plus two equals four is freedom. The ability to say men or
[27:47.080 --> 27:54.840]  men, women or women is freedom. But again, that's the cult. They can put Caitlyn Jenner,
[27:54.840 --> 28:02.280]  Lee Bruce Jenner, an ugly old man who hit and runs people up there with his snaggle
[28:02.280 --> 28:09.360]  teeth and his old ugly monster nose and call him the woman of the year and how gorgeous
[28:09.360 --> 28:16.400]  he is. They even have art where they sell it for like $10 million and it's dog feces.
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.240]  You ask, why would they do it? Because it's a satanic gift when they buy that art for
[28:20.240 --> 28:25.080]  $10 million a pile of dog manure and don't give it to starving children. It's celebrating
[28:25.080 --> 28:33.720]  the ugliness. It's celebrating an old ugly man with a huge giant male member and saying
[28:33.720 --> 28:41.280]  it's a woman. It's all about upside down world to just absolutely destroy logic. And you
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.560]  see it. It's all about sexualizing your children to suck the energy and then rape their future
[28:45.560 --> 28:51.320]  and steal their identity and absolutely brain damage them in the most horrible abuse ever
[28:51.320 --> 28:56.520]  with a bunch of perverts and pedophiles being the new high priest of corrupting and brainwashing
[28:56.520 --> 29:05.920]  your children before they want revenge on the common housefly. Well, after 10,000 years,

[33:03.120 --> 33:25.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:25.960 --> 33:32.960]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting World
[33:32.960 --> 33:54.360]  Live. It's Alex Jones. I have read the classified reports. I have read the Italian reports,
[33:54.360 --> 33:58.240]  the Russian reports, the U.S. reports. I've interviewed the top psychiatrists that work
[33:58.240 --> 34:03.320]  in the prisons. I have looked at every angle of it. I have read tens of thousands of news
[34:03.320 --> 34:08.760]  articles over the years where they've even caught in castles in France, in one time
[34:08.760 --> 34:13.760]  on a Rothschild estate, a bunch of kidnapped women, some of them dead in cages, dead bodies
[34:13.760 --> 34:20.400]  of little kids, and it just hits the news and it's gone. Snuff films where they're 20 men
[34:20.400 --> 34:26.600]  are raping toddlers and blowing their heads off. I'm sorry to have to talk about all this,
[34:26.600 --> 34:32.440]  but this is going on. I have personally seen thousands of articles over the years. Now they've
[34:32.440 --> 34:37.560]  got such control of the press, you don't see it as much, where the U.N. and any war zone
[34:37.560 --> 34:43.000]  literally grabs good-looking teenage girls off the street and children and loads them
[34:43.000 --> 34:50.240]  on C-130s and flies them into the Middle East. Saudi Arabia actually has harems of kidnapped
[34:50.240 --> 34:57.800]  women. Other areas do as well. And Bill Clinton flies into these different Arab-emirate areas,
[34:57.800 --> 35:03.240]  some areas even worse than Saudi Arabia, and there's famous sultans that literally have
[35:03.240 --> 35:08.080]  kidnapped men, women, and children, whatever you want. And Jerry Epstein would fly there
[35:08.080 --> 35:14.440]  with Bill Clinton over and over again. I mean, the police reports, I've had congressmen on,
[35:14.440 --> 35:20.800]  I've had state reps on who were raped by these satanic cults that have taken over the Catholic
[35:20.800 --> 35:27.960]  Church in Pennsylvania. They've been on this show and it's in the police reports and confirmed
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.200]  and they've got priests admitting that the 10, 15 men, I don't want to talk about this
[35:32.200 --> 35:41.160]  on air, but it's happening. We'll get your little kid inside of the church at night and
[35:41.160 --> 35:49.240]  rape them right in front of the statue of Christ, right in front of the crucifix. And
[35:49.240 --> 35:55.320]  that's exactly what satanists do. It's about blaspheming. And I'm not going to get everything
[35:55.320 --> 36:02.400]  else they do, okay? But it's like the piss Christ that was, you know, that Mel Gibson
[36:02.400 --> 36:07.360]  got mad about 30 years ago, where for hundreds of thousands of dollars, US taxpayer money
[36:07.360 --> 36:15.520]  was paying for a photo of a crucifix in a glass of urine that a gay photographer took
[36:15.520 --> 36:21.120]  was dying of AIDS. Oh, you're dying of a pestilence and you're blaspheming Christ and
[36:21.120 --> 36:29.040]  oh, here's a bunch of money. These are satanic sacraments. And so when you can go corrupt
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.840]  a child and confuse them and make them think they're a girl or a boy or there isn't any
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.840]  gender and get them to opt in and go around their parents and have the state trick your
[36:38.840 --> 36:47.960]  child into being sterilized chemically or by castration, that is so incredibly powerful
[36:47.960 --> 36:54.080]  to a satanist that is destroying the life force and the potential of a child. And you
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.720]  look at these children, they have the highest rates of suicide, the highest rates of incarceration,
[36:58.720 --> 37:07.680]  the highest rates of drug abuse and they just look like dead zombies. And if you're around
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.440]  Hollywood, you'll see the controllers and they'll have a gaggle of grown men that look
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.640]  like brainwashed brain damaged little boys and they're all being led around behind these
[37:16.640 --> 37:23.720]  keepers that are sucking their energy. And they'll tell you that's what they're doing.
[37:23.720 --> 37:30.040]  Psychic vampires. Let's show for TV viewers the Netflix girl sparks controversy. Oh, it's
[37:30.040 --> 37:35.840]  a girl who's really a boy and they have an actor doing it and show him naked in his genitals
[37:35.840 --> 37:45.680]  in simulated pedophilia. And this is about the total assault. Look at this. Mom six says
[37:45.680 --> 37:52.560]  mom says six year old son is transgender. Dad disagrees. Now he might lose his son and
[37:52.560 --> 38:04.120]  the little boy is set for chemical castration. And he's in a blue city. So bye bye testicles.
[38:04.120 --> 38:14.000]  Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone. Mama's gonna put all her fears into you. What's that
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.840]  pink fluid song? I mean, I know it's from the wall, but it's all about the abuse. I
[38:20.840 --> 38:27.040]  mean, you look you look at all this. This is so evil and it's conscious. And you look
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.920]  at all these parents, those are kids, they all look real weird and real weak and real
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.680]  sucked out. And there's like, they're like zombies. But when they do bad evil stuff,
[38:34.680 --> 38:39.120]  they kind of get excited and go, it's it's it's so much fun to them to do this to your
[38:39.120 --> 38:49.760]  own child. And see the news is daddy's bad. Oh, and then on info wars.com Swedish headmaster
[38:49.760 --> 38:54.160]  wears dress to school to break norms. And of course, it comes out in the news that they
[38:54.160 --> 38:59.000]  were told don't tell your parents about it, but encourage the little boys to wear dresses
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.800]  and tell the little girls they're the boss. All this is about is destroying our young
[39:04.800 --> 39:11.400]  men. You were going to invade destroy a culture you would teach men not to be men, women
[39:11.400 --> 39:20.240]  not to be women. And then you would bring in outside vicious third world populations.
[39:20.240 --> 39:27.840]  This is all a rampant satanic exercise. Mom says six year old son is transgender. Dad
[39:27.840 --> 39:35.080]  is freeze. Now he might lose his son. And it goes into the article here that he's not
[39:35.080 --> 39:40.800]  affirming James is transgender, but he's not emancipated. The boy six years old, the mother
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.920]  is the one bringing all of this in dressing him like a boy because she has the main custody
[39:45.920 --> 39:51.320]  right now. And now she wants him totally terminated because the father's talking to his son saying,
[39:51.320 --> 39:55.320]  son, you're being brainwashed. You're being I want this father on son. You don't have
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.720]  to do this. Oh, there's in Houston, they have drag queen story time for your five year olds
[40:00.720 --> 40:05.440]  at the schools. And so parents are protesting it. And the news is talking about in Texas,
[40:05.440 --> 40:10.920]  how bad these parents are. You don't want big old beach men and clown makeup to come tell
[40:10.920 --> 40:15.560]  your kid and shake their ass on their face and say, I've played the videos, shake your
[40:15.560 --> 40:20.280]  booty. You can be a boy. You can be a girl. You can be anything. A boy can be a girl.
[40:20.280 --> 40:26.720]  A girl can be a boy. I'm wearing a demon outfit telling you this, there's nothing wrong here.
[40:26.720 --> 40:36.960]  And if they can do that, they can do anything. But it says right here, they tell the teachers,
[40:36.960 --> 40:40.480]  don't tell the parents what we're doing. So you think the schools are locked up to stop
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.800]  mass shooters? No, not when the left is controlling them. They're all locked up and parents can't
[40:44.800 --> 40:49.440]  get in because there's some stuff going on in there. Just like at the Catholic, let me
[40:49.440 --> 40:52.840]  give you a big newsflash. I'm not Catholic. I'm not defending the corruption of the Catholic
[40:52.840 --> 40:57.960]  church, but the Catholic church got exposed because the left wanted to fully take it over.
[40:57.960 --> 41:04.640]  It's as bad or worse in every major institution because there is a cult that wants the energy
[41:04.640 --> 41:10.640]  of children. Low levels just want to corrupt them and have sex with them. Higher level
[41:10.640 --> 41:16.800]  wants to torture. At the Dracula level, they're not real vampires, but they spiritually are.
[41:16.800 --> 41:25.240]  They torture your children to death. Some people are then inducted into the cult if
[41:25.240 --> 41:33.480]  they think they have vicious, evil potentiality. And I grew up in the richest county in Texas
[41:33.480 --> 41:41.560]  at the time and I brushed into the edge of this. I brushed into the edge of it. I would
[41:41.560 --> 41:48.040]  never took part in it, but I brushed it. So let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.560]  You better think long and hard which side you're on here because the devil's real, Satan
[41:52.560 --> 41:58.040]  worship's real, and the whole world government system is going to be about brainwashing children,
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.680]  confusing them, drugging them so that they can then be so confused they lose their free
[42:02.680 --> 42:11.160]  will and so they can be fully, spiritually, asanguated. These full grown men, some of
[42:11.160 --> 42:18.200]  them weighing 400 to 500 pounds, wearing G-strings, shake their wart-covered asses in the face
[42:18.200 --> 42:26.680]  of three-year-old boys and girls. They wear satanic outfits. They wear Dracula teeth.
[42:26.680 --> 42:32.000]  And they just, I mean, there's somebody we can't even show you that we shot in Austin
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.720]  at these public events where there are grown men with nothing but glitter on their genitals
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.280]  standing there, writhing and hugging on little boys and girls. What we're showing you on
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.280]  screen is the light stuff because we're on TV stations around the country. I cannot show
[42:47.280 --> 42:51.360]  you all of it. This is why they took us off YouTube. They told us because we would show
[42:51.360 --> 43:00.000]  the abuse of children. They're going to cut your balls off. That's right. The globalists
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.680]  know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[43:04.680 --> 43:10.600]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the population
[43:10.600 --> 43:15.640]  down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world,
[43:15.640 --> 43:20.840]  we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good,
[43:20.840 --> 43:24.680]  but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we
[43:24.680 --> 43:30.400]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2. That's been incredible.
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.720]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.440]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed
[43:40.440 --> 43:45.440]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[43:45.440 --> 43:52.440]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen,
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.600]  you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available
[43:57.600 --> 44:02.760]  at m4slife.com. As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's
[44:02.760 --> 44:08.480]  nutritional needs. With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able

[45:00.640 --> 45:06.720]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air. Obviously
[45:06.720 --> 45:10.640]  water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing, and I've had water filtration sponsors
[45:10.640 --> 45:14.680]  since the day I got on air, and over the years I learned a lot about water filtration, I
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.440]  learned what the best was. Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest, stainless steel
[45:19.440 --> 45:23.200]  unit that does the most gallons an hour. It's amazing. Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves
[45:23.200 --> 45:27.480]  the good stuff in the good minerals. Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatreonSupply
[45:27.480 --> 45:32.040]  that have developed these filters ordered a huge amount of them this year. He has a
[45:32.040 --> 45:37.600]  glut of them. He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted,
[45:37.600 --> 45:44.680]  it's $200. It's $127. He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.360]  bucks on them, so they're going to sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift of life,
[45:49.360 --> 45:56.360]  the gift of health. It's amazing. Alexa Pure Pro at InfowarsLife.com or InfowarsStore.com

[46:59.120 --> 47:04.080]  all for your support.
[47:04.080 --> 47:30.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.080 --> 47:46.720]  So, imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago that in 2018, in 1998, if somebody told
[47:46.720 --> 47:50.680]  you they would move against the family publicly, say the word mother and father is bad, he
[47:50.680 --> 47:55.160]  or she would be removed by Google. Google's announced that AI will even let you type or
[47:55.160 --> 48:02.120]  search he or she. And that they would be targeting children nationwide at age five telling them
[48:02.120 --> 48:05.840]  that they're really another gender. And then if they could get the child to say they want
[48:05.840 --> 48:11.920]  to be another gender, that the government can emancipate them without even a court case,
[48:11.920 --> 48:16.000]  giving them alcohol, whatever is in dangerment, pedophiles trying to have sex with this endangerment,
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.120]  but if you can set the precedent to emancipate them and let them make adult decisions, currently
[48:22.120 --> 48:29.560]  it's age eight, that they are chemically sterilizing little boys in the U.S. And I've got the Houston
[48:29.560 --> 48:34.040]  Chronicle and other reports here where we're the straight face, the father doesn't want
[48:34.040 --> 48:39.600]  a six year old son to sign the paperwork to be sterilized, he's six and a half in a year
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.520]  and a half, so the court's moving with his mother to terminate his parental rights because
[48:44.520 --> 48:53.720]  he doesn't want his son to be chemically sterilized. He's the abuser, he's the bad man, see upside
[48:53.720 --> 49:05.960]  down world. The LGBT pedophile community, you see, they take our tolerance and our openness
[49:05.960 --> 49:11.000]  and have headlines every time I talk about it. Alex Jones, another transgender rant.
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.600]  I'm a libertarian, if an adult man wants to go have his testicles savagely cut off and
[49:16.600 --> 49:21.240]  turned upside down and my God, you ought to watch the procedure, it's on YouTube, it's
[49:21.240 --> 49:26.480]  savage. Go watch the plastic surgery. If you're crazy and mentally ill, you want to cut your
[49:26.480 --> 49:30.920]  fingers off, go ahead and do it. I'm not going to have to pay for your nose job or having
[49:30.920 --> 49:38.280]  your tallywacker cut off, you got it? Or turned inside open like a fish filet, to say what
[49:38.280 --> 49:46.120]  they filet a flounder. Well, go watch it. Slice it open. I mean, it's hell on earth. Most
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.360]  of the people that do it end up committing suicide within 10 years or in a mental institution.
[49:50.360 --> 49:56.400]  Yeah, no kidding. And the weirdo psychologist and psychiatrist in the system that convinces
[49:56.400 --> 50:04.000]  you to chop your genitals off. Communilate yourself while the same government, the same
[50:04.000 --> 50:12.600]  federal court that's ruled that we got to pay for men to have their genitals cut off
[50:12.600 --> 50:22.040]  or for women to take testosterone to be quote men. Shame court ruled that Muslims can take
[50:22.040 --> 50:29.720]  their seven and nine year old daughters, drug them up illegally on barbiturates and then
[50:29.720 --> 50:36.400]  have a Muslim doctor cut their entire clitoris off. And I'm sorry to use these terms. This
[50:36.400 --> 50:41.080]  is the family show. But you know what? They're teaching your kids to chop their Johnson off
[50:41.080 --> 50:49.320]  when they're age five. So I better go on adult radio and tell you what's happening. Because
[50:49.320 --> 50:53.240]  you know, we had faces before say, Hey, please don't go there. Hey, I got video we shot in
[50:53.240 --> 50:58.960]  Austin at a public event of two year olds going up to men with only glitter with their
[50:58.960 --> 51:05.840]  Johnson hanging down with kids grabbing and hugging naked men with their genitals hanging
[51:05.840 --> 51:11.960]  out. And when we played that a year ago, some of our TV affiliates threatened to dump us.
[51:11.960 --> 51:20.640]  They're doing it to kids in public. I'm not the one doing it. But I get it. We're not
[51:20.640 --> 51:26.400]  going to show it here. By the way, YouTube did not have a problem with that. They thought
[51:26.400 --> 51:33.960]  that was wonderful. God almighty, if you're a radio listener, we're showing children giving
[51:33.960 --> 51:43.120]  giant fat transvestites money after they shake their huge butts in their faces. What planet
[51:43.120 --> 51:48.520]  are we on? We're on a planet where we're letting evil take over and these people are just the
[51:48.520 --> 51:57.480]  useful idiots. You know, Trump came out and said that the United Nations is smuggling
[51:57.480 --> 52:01.040]  the people in which is public fact. They say he's a liar. He then said they've got a lot
[52:01.040 --> 52:05.240]  of kidnapped kids are using as human shields. That's fact. He then said they got a lot of
[52:05.240 --> 52:11.280]  child grabbing going on. I just showed you last segment, AP Reuters, everything about
[52:11.280 --> 52:22.240]  not just thousands kidnapped, hundreds dead. But now the entire left and the entire corporate
[52:22.240 --> 52:27.400]  media suddenly has gone dark on all this. They used to report on it. I'm showing the
[52:27.400 --> 52:34.600]  Washington Post from two years ago. Obama administration placed children with human
[52:34.600 --> 52:41.600]  traffickers, Senate reports, some were killed and even snopes on this one says, well, it's
[52:41.600 --> 52:48.040]  true. They almost always lie. I told the truth there. Broken clocks are right twice a day.
[52:48.040 --> 52:52.560]  But now, no, none of it's going on. None of it's happening because people have decided
[52:52.560 --> 52:59.080]  to join with pure evil. And we got calls from Twitter. We got calls from others. We recorded
[52:59.080 --> 53:01.600]  the calls. I've been so busy. I haven't put them out. I think now's the time to put them
[53:01.600 --> 53:07.920]  out where we were talking to high level people. Paul talks to some of the like right up to
[53:07.920 --> 53:18.000]  below Dorsey. And I know I'm not supposed to get into it. I'm going to stop right there.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.960]  But it's a total Colton, San Francisco with giant feted disease tentacles reaching out
[53:22.960 --> 53:29.160]  across the nation. A once great state of California used to be rather than Texas, rather than
[53:29.160 --> 53:39.560]  Texas in the 70s and 80s. It is now bluest of the blue. PC's needles everywhere, crime,
[53:39.560 --> 53:43.120]  implosion, and its tentacles are invading the country. It says it's going to conquer
[53:43.120 --> 53:48.560]  Texas. I say deport Californians. Now, if you want to be a refugee status, you can come
[53:48.560 --> 53:53.720]  to the rest of the U.S. But we literally have to build a wall around California. I'm serious.
[53:53.720 --> 53:57.720]  Around its lawyers, around its corruption, all it does is attack the rest of the country.
[53:57.720 --> 54:03.280]  It is cancer. It's game green. And when the legs rotten and the toes have already fallen
[54:03.280 --> 54:09.520]  off, then we're going to lose the whole body if we don't saw that leg off. And I'm serious.
[54:09.520 --> 54:18.080]  I'm serious. Trump needs to move and we need to sever the California off and build a damn
[54:18.080 --> 54:22.600]  wall, man, because I live in Austin and it's ruined this town. These are hateful, stupid
[54:22.600 --> 54:27.200]  evil people. They're like locusts. They already ate California to the bone. Losers from all
[54:27.200 --> 54:30.800]  over the country that went there to be somebody. And now they've come here to buy Texas and
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.000]  boy, they're Californian. My text is bad. And I don't want to hear I'm authoritarian. Everywhere
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.600]  I go, the Californians march up. They're not even Californians. It's the scum and they
[54:39.600 --> 54:48.440]  go, you get out of here, our beautiful town. You know, when your ancestors were serfs,
[54:48.440 --> 54:55.320]  my ancestors were here creating state. And I'm not going to sit here and let you so it's
[54:55.320 --> 54:59.640]  a propaganda move. It's tongue and cheek, but I'm putting billboards up everything to
[54:59.640 --> 55:04.880]  port Californians, make them seek asylum, make them pledge that they're American, make them
[55:04.880 --> 55:12.000]  pledge that they renounce the California demon spirit. And then we welcome you, but the America
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.960]  must wall off the parasite California now. Or because they said they're going to export
[55:19.960 --> 55:26.840]  it, they're going to export it everywhere. So we got California caravans coming your
[55:26.840 --> 55:31.040]  way in coming, ladies and gentlemen. And I mean, if you're from Michigan and escaping
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.160]  with socialism, we love you. If you're from New York, escaping all of it, great New Yorkers,
[55:35.160 --> 55:38.840]  you're from Florida, wherever you're welcome. But let me tell you something. You're a globalist.
[55:38.840 --> 55:42.720]  You want to come here and try to get my guns and try to teach my kids how to chop their
[55:42.720 --> 55:49.200]  balls off. You can go jump right in the lake. Just get the hell out of here, you parasites.
[55:49.200 --> 55:54.520]  And you hate Christianity, you hate conservatism, you hate capitalism, but you're always fighting
[55:54.520 --> 56:01.080]  to get your fat ass in the middle of it. So you can suck our blood, you scum. You get
[56:01.080 --> 56:09.000]  the hell away from me and my children. I declare war on you. You declared on me, you got a war.
[56:09.000 --> 56:16.200]  We're about to pull out all the stops around here. And that said, I need massive funding.

[56:55.760 --> 57:01.000]  to be demonized and lied about by the collaborators and the cowards and the filth that have all
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.400]  signed on to worshiping the pedophilia and worshiping the devil worship. Well, guess
[57:05.400 --> 57:10.160]  what? I'm real proud to be enemy number one up against these people and thank God for
[57:10.160 --> 57:15.600]  Trump flying that banner of Americana and no compromise and no compromise for Christianity
[57:15.600 --> 57:21.080]  and everything. God bless President Trump. I'm proud to stand by and watch all the other
[57:21.080 --> 57:28.080]  cowards hedge their bets and double talk behind the president's back. Not me! Yeah, teacher,
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.320]  leave them kids alone. Stop trying to abuse those five-year-old boys. See, if they can't
[57:32.320 --> 57:38.320]  get the boys with the weaponized vaccines and the autism from 1 in 35,158 now, they'll
[57:38.320 --> 57:43.440]  get the rest telling their little girls and get them to sterilize themselves. All in all,
[57:43.440 --> 57:50.240]  it's a war on our boys and it's a war on our girls as well.

[59:01.680 --> 59:26.240]  the
[59:26.240 --> 59:30.920]  them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially I want to push all the way
[59:30.920 --> 59:35.080]  I've committed to do that I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going
[59:35.080 --> 59:39.720]  to happen but you've got a back ish and I promise you this I will never falter I
[59:39.720 --> 59:43.960]  will never waver at the spiritual level I physically will but I give you my
[59:43.960 --> 59:48.040]  commitment if you financially support us at foreshore.com to give you my
[59:48.040 --> 59:51.720]  absolute total commitment
[59:51.720 --> 59:57.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:15.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:23.040]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.680]  well one of my favorite guest Pastor Rodney Howard Brown's gonna be with us
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.960]  coming up in the next segment but I got to tell you
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.320]  evil is just coming out of the woodwork right now but so is good
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.840]  nationalism rebirth of Christianity all over the world
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.040]  nationalist are winning and are ahead in the polls so Pastor Brown has just
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.360]  turned Europe he said it's on fire I watched some of the videos on his
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.960]  website over the weekend after he told me about it it's amazing so we're gonna
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.960]  get to all of that coming up in the next segment some good news and our
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.080]  reporters are on the border they're in Tijuana they've already followed some
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.400]  amazing reports in foreshore.com that is coming up as well but here's part of
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.880]  John Bownes report that's very very important it's not the whole report but
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:15.320]  it's part of it China's baby DNA editing threatens humanity here it is. Dr. Lai
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.000]  Liang Shui at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health claim they're
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.120]  the first to successfully alter the genetic makeup of dogs this muscle is
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.720]  much stronger they doubled the muscle mass of these beagles through the
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.760]  process of gene editing we knocked out a gene which would ordinarily stop
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:40.000]  muscles from growing so these dogs became much more muscular lie told us back
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.680]  in 1987 in a lab in Osaka Japan the discovery of a clustered regularly
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.320]  interspace short allandromic repeats DNA sequence system or what is more
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.680]  commonly known as CRISPR sent shockwaves through the science community
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.840]  because of the chaotic modifications it could cause upon human DNA is there
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:06.560]  any way that you can encourage us to allow our compassionate evolution and
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.520]  our evolution of our moral conscience to evolve at the same rate as our
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.360]  technology the only way we can proceed is really to have you know an open
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.760]  community of people where we invite everyone to get involved it can't be
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.320]  just the elites doing something and everybody else you know sort of trying
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.640]  to figure it out and figure out how it's affecting them I'm a believer in the
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.720]  precautionary principle as I've just said and I think we have to worry about
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.600]  possible consequences of things that we do and the ability to edit our own
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.040]  genomes is one thing we ought to worry about I'm not sure it's so much an
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.200]  ethical problem as a as a more practical problem what what would the
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:54.560]  consequences be would the consequences be bad and they might be now Chinese
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.000]  scientists at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen are
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.120]  attempting to create the first gene edited babies utilizing CRISPR they
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:08.280]  intend on eliminating a gene known as CCR5 and creating genetically modified
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:14.720]  babies resistant to HIV smallpox and cholera it has surprised the scientific
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.920]  community itself even how rapidly it's been taken up and how what's what's
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.960]  amazing is the number of applications that people have come up with scientists
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.920]  have already used CRISPR to engineer mosquitoes to resist malaria it's also
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.040]  been used to create designer animals goats with longer hair and beagles with
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.160]  more muscles but does the bad outweigh the good aside from the possibility of
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.880]  weakening humanity and making it more susceptible to cancer for example
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.720]  scientists worry that once a species is modified it is changed forever if our
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.480]  original mosquito is AA and our new mosquito is AB or B is the
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:01.120]  anti-malaria gene the baby should come out in four permutations AA, AB, AA, BA
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:08.160]  instead with a new gene drive they all came out AB biologically that shouldn't
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.440]  even be possible gene drives are so effective that even an accidental
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.920]  release could change an entire species and often very quickly the other piece
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.040]  of bad news is that a gene drive might not stay confined to what we call the
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.920]  target species that's because of gene flow which is basically a fancy way of
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.280]  saying that neighboring species sometimes interbreed the last worrisome
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.000]  thing is that the technology to do this to genetically engineer an organism and
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.440]  include a gene drive okay it's something that the full reports on infowars.com
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.080]  but here's the bottom line the chai comms are the most godless satanic group
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:46.720]  on earth they are already creating a social score out where you get basically
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.800]  rounded up and arrested if you're a Christian so what are they gonna put
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.080]  into this these aren't humans these are humanoids we'll talk about it with
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:57.520]  pastor Rodney Howard Brown on a lot of other subjects straight ahead
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:02.920]  do you realize that when you spread the links from infowars.com when you spread
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.680]  the videos you are changing the world it's you that has defeated Hillary and
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.000]  the globalist it is you the info warriors across the planet that stood
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.120]  against the bullying that stood against the peer pressure that stood against the
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.840]  threats that have now changed the world and that's why you've been on the team
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.720]  supporting us praying for us and spreading the word you are the info
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.120]  ward and now because of their intensifying censorship it's more
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.560]  important than ever that everyone go to info wars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.920]  and sign up via email so there's no way the sensors can get between us with
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:41.080]  critical videos articles breaking news intel you name it and so now I ask you
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.760]  more than ever to share the info wars.com articles to share the videos to
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.840]  tell people by the local stations you're listening to the bare minimum you
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.880]  can do is sign up for the free newsletter at info wars.com forward slash
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:59.760]  newsletter we are the renaissance and we are winning
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:09.200]  when I grow up no when I grow up I want to see the globalist kicked off this
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.480]  planet
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:33.160]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:39.680]  resistance you're listening to Alex Jones well I could not think of a better
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:44.000]  guess to come on with us right now he was born and raised in South Africa
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.440]  travel here with his wife and family the 1980s as one of the most successful true
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.640]  Bible-leaving churches in the US and huge outreach globally pastor Rodney
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.160]  Howard Brown and he's with us for the rest of the hour killing Uncle Sam book
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:03.600]  comms his new book revival.com he has been in Europe and seen how literally on
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:09.280]  fire they are I saw some of the videos of thousands tens of thousands where he
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.920]  was going out and speaking with Christ and with the nationalism and with the
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.000]  understanding of the attack that's going on. Europe is just as awake as Eastern
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.160]  Europe from people that I know that live there Paul Watson lives in Europe most
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:27.600]  of the year lives in Spain now because England's collapsed so bad and I wanted
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.240]  to get Pastor Brown on he just got back to talk about what he's witnessed what
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.320]  he's seen but first just in general he predicted the South Africa taking the
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.760]  white farmers land even land they'd recently purchased it's now happening
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.320]  he predicted so much and now they've announced in thousands of newspapers
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.080]  hundreds of thousands of Brits to get microchips to be able to bank or work
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.200]  in government and now other country Sweden wants you to get a chip and
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.320]  thousands have to get on the train our bus and now they're pushing it here and
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:00.760]  total surveillance in human editing and oh China had clones years ago of humans
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:08.800]  it's all coming out in the open and two different Netflix shows promoting
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.560]  pedophilia one movie one show are out right now five-year-olds are being taught
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.200]  they're in other sex Google's coming out with AI or you can't even type in the
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.160]  browser or on a droid just like you have an iPhone won't let you send cuss words
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.600]  well now it's not gonna let you say he or she that's Reuters fearful of bio
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:37.320]  Google blocks gender-based pronouns from new AI tool see so people can't even
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.680]  write anymore they know how to do emojis and type but it won't let you just like
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.640]  China is working with Google where you can't send emojis of the Taiwanese flag
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.120]  it's all here everything we've talked about confirmed but I'd like to say
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.000]  being on air 23 years that oh I was first to talk about this but you know
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.680]  where I heard all this was that we evangelical churches that we went to
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.960]  when I was a child else with the Baptist churches and you know go to Methodist
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.880]  churches went to family churches we go to different churches but I was in the
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.720]  evangelical church is one thing and I'd sit there and think this sounds like
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.160]  science fiction but I had a spiritual experience I knew God was real as you
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.920]  get older you have more experiences you know just how real God is and the whole
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.160]  spiritual world that the enemy knows that is trying to keep you from it there
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.240]  aren't really atheist high-level let me tell you they're devil worshipers and
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.640]  that's coming out because the devil's biggest trick is saying he doesn't
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:35.560]  exist they want power over you and now everything foretold not by me 23 years
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.720]  ago not by those churches 40 years ago 45 years ago no what's in the Bible it's
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.560]  all happening exactly like it said and it's it gives me chills
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.360]  pastor Brown thank you so much for coming on with us I want to talk about
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.720]  prophecy and where we are historically and how important all this is and then I
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.760]  want to get into the good news that when the great evil comes in though that
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.640]  will cause this great awakening on it yes first of all again I was watching
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.360]  you before the previous hour you on fire people might not understand your
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.240]  passion Alex but when you know all these things then you know you can make this
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:17.680]  stuff up we living in the final hour the final grains of sand that coming
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.000]  through the hour gloss and as you know all that has to happen for evil to
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.080]  prevail is for good people to do nothing so your voice is important that's
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.800]  obviously why they try to shut you up but they're not gonna shut you up and
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.400]  they're gonna shut anyone up that will just stand up for righteousness and
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.600]  will proclaim and if something happens to us there'll be many that will come on
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:44.280]  behind us and take our place so you know it's it's like the Gideon's 300 you
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:50.080]  know the army of 300 so look we living in the final hour you you don't have to
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.600]  be a rocket scientist to see what's taking place the censorship the the
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.200]  corruption in the highest levels of government and as you said something
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.120]  which is so profound there's no atheists these people at the highest levels
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.200]  worship Lucifer and that's what people don't actually understand that the
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:14.480]  agenda is actually driven really from the pits of hell the only solution as far
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.200]  as what I can see obviously we got to get godly people in the government and
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.480]  people that will do good but is the gospel of Jesus Christ being proclaimed
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:28.000]  and people you know putting their life on the line you know the early church
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.400]  the church was built on the blood of the martyrs so we have to have radical
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.640]  people that will stand up in this hour so that's one of the things that I felt
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.240]  in my heart to do was to run to 300 cities of the world in the next two years
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.840]  and basically meet with leadership so I'm looking for like a hundred leaders in
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:53.840]  each city which we actually did 16 cities of Europe which I was shocked to
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.040]  tell you what I what I saw it was amazing to see actually affect what they
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.680]  are doing if people think you know maybe the governments are corrupt but they
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.960]  are there's an army of believers that is being raised up all across Europe and
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:12.360]  they behind the scenes they in the Ukraine they in Russia they in Bulgaria
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:20.520]  they in Hungary they in Bratislava they in Finland even Sweden Norway I mean it
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.240]  actually is very encouraging when you when you when you travel and then you
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.480]  meet people the grassroots level and they they made a decision we're not
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.080]  we're not going out quietly so here's the thing I think that the globalists
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.840]  have underestimated first of all they think that Christianity is just
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:43.240]  something that's just somebody's idea number one they think that it can be
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:48.760]  snuffed out they think that the Holy Spirit doesn't exist well of course you
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.680]  know that the Holy Spirit is omnipresent he's everywhere he's omnipresent
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:00.640]  he's omnipotent and he's omniscient and he's God so wherever people are on the
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.160]  earth that cry out he comes and reveals himself to them and they're from every
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.080]  background of society and then God let's expand on this because in it the
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.520]  Bible says this too but as the spirit of evil accelerates and gets more powerful
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.760]  I can feel the Holy Spirit and we're powerful as you said last time we met
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.560]  in private I can't even handle it like I used to sleep so good now I'm waking up
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.240]  at 2 3 in the morning like just like stop them fight them you there's
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.360]  something I'm supposed to do you're you're like think about the and then it
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.400]  keeps coming to me and it's something I'm not doing on air because you kind of
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.520]  feel humble and then you don't want to do it but it's it's but I know it's true
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.840]  we have to call on God we have to pray we have to realize it is an evil force
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.440]  we're against we're not going to be able to beat it and that's what the Holy
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.480]  Spirit's been telling me I know that's a very simple statement but it's also a
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.840]  very profound statement can you speak to that well without the first of all when
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.320]  Jesus walked the earth he told the disciples he said I'm going to go away
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.080]  but I will not leave you comfortless he said I'm going to send you another
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.800]  comforter he said he's with you now but he's going to be in you and you can read
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.840]  about that John 14 15 and 16 and then right at the resurrection just before he
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.880]  left he told the disciples he said to go tarry at Jerusalem and he said you
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:16.400]  receive power to be witnesses so I mean the disciples could have said Lord but
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.660]  we already we did what you told us we went in your name we cost our devils we
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:24.960]  laid hands on the sick but he said the Holy Spirit's going to come the promise
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.640]  of the father which was actually announced by John the Baptist who said
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.440]  I'm baptized with water but this coming one after me talking of Jesus who will
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.760]  baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire so it's that fire that comes into
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.440]  the life of a believer that stirs their believer up to do the extraordinary as
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.600]  you look through the Old Testament you see Moses couldn't deliver the children
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.440]  of Israel till he had a burning bush experience then you look at the others
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.320]  that were used of God from David or we I mean we can go through all the Bible
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:03.280]  characters but go to Elijah Elijah outran a chariot of horses so I mean the
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.520]  rains came it took on the prophets of bar Elisha followed in his footsteps had
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:13.760]  double the portion that Elijah had and so Jesus told the disciples go Terry at
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:21.720]  Jerusalem it's amazing we're gonna go to break and talk more about this but the
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.680]  enemy talks about this they know that when they come in to take over they
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.800]  know that it's gonna ignite this and and that's why they're getting so scared
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.720]  and as you said you were just in 16 cities pastor I want to come back and
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.920]  talk about the good news of the nationalism Marie Le Pen in the lead in
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:45.680]  France Italy electing a patriot Romania hungry Poland on fire the UK
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:51.040]  fighting back Merkel and her party being voted out of power we'll talk about it
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:57.360]  all with a major true barnstorming man of God who just came back from Europe the
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.320]  United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the Empire
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.720]  of the world George Washington had warned us against foreign wars the
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:12.240]  United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:18.000]  its former colony the US had to save the Empire was there ever a vote who do we
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.440]  fight for the deep state began with World War one the United States of Empire
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:29.920]  by James Dunn available at Amazon books hear that that's the sound of a house

[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:19.600]  you thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever but you wrote a
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:26.280]  poem of steamer to the violence of the sun live from the front lines of the
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:31.680]  information war it's Alex Jones
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:39.360]  you know Austin Texas is really a conservative libertarian town but then
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.160]  we've had election fraud for 30 40 years totally proven once the Democrats
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.680]  take control of a city you don't have any real voting anymore that's why they
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.680]  only have blue pockets though where they've stolen elections we've got
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.480]  internal polls other numbers the Republicans really won the Senate
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.640]  which they did and the House but you saw the election fraud everywhere and now
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.680]  just as Europe was hit with 15 million military aged men we're being hit and
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:07.080]  they are kidnapping kids and smuggling a man and using them as human shields all
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:12.160]  last hour I showed all that then the UN involved in child sex trafficking as
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.920]  their business not even a side business and pastor Rodney Howard Brown has
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.960]  traveled the entire world he's one of the top real evangelical pastors that
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:25.920]  goes forth you know to all the four corners of the planet and he is bringing
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.600]  us very positive news very uplifting news very good news we're gonna run some
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.480]  b-roll of this that's got some music over it but but but he's gonna describe
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:40.080]  what you're seeing for TV viewers and radio listeners and this dovetails you
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.240]  know I trust verify of the nationalist of the Christian revival in Europe in
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.480]  Brazil everywhere where you can have real elections people are voting against
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.200]  the New World Order but that's why the censorship that's why the oppression
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.800]  that's why the targeting of the children young to screw them up before they can
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.160]  think that's why these bullies target our youth so Patrick Brown we've got a
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.440]  longer segment coming up it's about seven minutes left in this one please
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.040]  give us this great report and and thanks for sharing your time with us
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.840]  revival.com all right well yes what I felt to do because without the help of
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.240]  the Holy Spirit we will not be able to come back what is taking place I don't
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.160]  care who people are you could be a politician a preacher if you do not
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.400]  have the fire the Holy Ghost you will not make it in the hour that's coming
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.000]  back you might not like what I'm saying but I'm just telling you they're gonna
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.960]  ship your saddle home you either get on fire for God or forget about it this is
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:42.360]  not the time to play games so what I felt to do Alex rather than go and try to
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:46.840]  do some big arenas was just to go to churches and use them like an upper room
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:53.280]  one-night meeting and get believe for a hundred leaders in each city I'm gonna go
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.920]  to 300 cities in the next two years that's 30,000 leaders to get ignited with
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:04.200]  the purpose whether they business people politicians or pastors and so we
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:10.920]  started we started in Stockholm Sweden on the from the first night from there
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.320]  well Stockholm was it was a great meeting people came so hungry for God I
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.400]  met people there that were just and of course I gave altar calls every night
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:25.200]  people got saved so you can see I'm using a church 630 in attendance that night
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.440]  223 people came forward in the altar call to recommit their life to the Lord
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.880]  and then we mobilized leaders right after that and spoke to them so 103
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:38.560]  ministers and leaders some of them business leaders there we went to Vest
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:43.600]  Fossen Norway which that's another thing I'll tell you about 502 that was an
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:49.360]  old paper mill 182 salvations and that is very historic for what happened in
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.720]  Norway a hundred and four ministers and leaders mobilized they're not traveled
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:57.440]  north to place called altar where they saw me people they followed the reindeer
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.360]  it's so remote in the northern part we only had 132 there but the tribal
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.760]  people with their beautiful dress they actually cooked for me 68 people got
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:10.920]  saved they said they're gonna visit all their villages 25 ministers and leaders
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:15.400]  mobilized there went to Helsinki met with pastors met with people in the
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:20.240]  Finnish government that ran for president 580 in attendance in that
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.840]  meeting and then gave the altar call 123 people gave their lives to Christ and
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:32.000]  then we spoke to leaders right after that mobilized them 140 leaders just
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.880]  giving them a mandate you've got to shake your your nation
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:41.920]  Ratsaslava 55 churches coming together 2200 I think in attendance the altar
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.800]  call that night was was epic 2250 in attendance they rented that arena
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.720]  themselves it was so hungry they said if we had more time we would have been in

[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:06.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:32.040]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner or later you've got to do that.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:39.440]  Everybody knows that I'm pretty sick of the fake Russia investigation even though I've been in the middle of it and I try to ignore it but
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.600]  lately you can't because it's been all over the news that the grand jury asked
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:52.840]  people about me and I'm not at liberty to get to it yet but they've tried to set
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.920]  me up it's it's unbelievable but I can tell you before everybody in the world
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:03.760]  and God that I have had zero connection to the Russian government or money from
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:10.480]  Russians or anything it's all pure bull and I remember Roger Stone not being
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:13.520]  able to get ahold of Assange and me getting mad at Assange and saying why
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.080]  do you not come on our shows that you go on New York Times's TV show are you an
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:24.840]  idiot so the claims that Roger got this stuff or the claims that he did it with
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:30.440]  Dr. Corsi I was involved in all of that at the time with Corsi and Stone both of
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.760]  them have worked for him for worse. Stone does right now and it's I mean I was
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.240]  squeezing them to get ahold of Assange everybody was it's no crime to try to get
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:45.240]  WikiLeaks but the idea that WikiLeaks is Russian and then by extent we are is
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:51.760]  just total baloney but it doesn't matter because the new stuff coming out is
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:35:00.160]  just insane. Daily Caller drum Corsi says he has defense agreement with Trump
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:09.240]  received limited immunity from Mueller. This stuff of course isn't crazy so I'm
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.840]  gonna try to get Roger to pop in later I was just looking at this and it makes my
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:18.560]  head spin but on to the good news here. Pastor Rodney R. Brown's here he just
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.360]  went to Europe and had one of the biggest revivals in Europe he's ever had I
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.960]  want to get the testimonials what he saw on the ground what he witnessed
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:30.440]  visiting 16 cities in all these countries from Poland or from Ireland to
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:36.560]  to everywhere basically so we'll be talking to him here in just a
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.760]  moment please don't forget that I need your prayers and I don't just count on
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.880]  them I absolutely you know need them they're essential so please keep praying
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.560]  for him full wars I know taken on the globalist we're gonna get demonized
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.400]  we're going to get attacked we're gonna get lied about we're gonna be a target
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:58.400]  because we really have reached billions of people but at the same time we also
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.760]  need financial support and I make it easy to do because whatever the best

[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.680]  filters cost them 90 something dollars to make they ordered too many this year
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:28.360]  they want to sell them so they'll have inventory problems and have to pay tax on

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:32.240]  Brown said you better have the Holy Ghost my only issue is is that it's about
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:37.160]  fire I kind of over rev like a race car because I'm on fire all the time and and
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:40.160]  the more I see and the more I know I just cannot believe other people are
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.600]  falling for this new world order so so pastor please continue with with with
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:49.200]  not just a big revival but what the people said what you heard a why
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.760]  globalism and its satanic system is in so much trouble from your amazing trip
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.880]  and then everybody also should check out your amazing website revival.com or
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:02.040]  killing uncle Sam book.com thank you again for joining us all right let me
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:06.600]  just say one thing you know what what I did there was just go to churches we've
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.320]  we've done arenas for years and all I have from those as pictures but local
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:16.720]  churches is where we have to build this engine room to take the city to take a
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:23.040]  nation as the church in Budapest doing so over the total trip was 23,200
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:31.320]  intendants 7,860 in the altar call and 3,800 leaders mobilized so it doesn't
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:37.160]  take that many Alex to if you can put the fire on just several but let me say
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.080]  this about what happened with Budapest and I mean I got some things I could
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:44.800]  share with you but maybe you don't want me to share them on the air of some
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.560]  supernatural things and actually took place of how we actually ended up in
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.720]  Budapest because we are wind of Bratislava we were not scheduled to go
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:57.520]  to Budapest that was our night off and through a series of events that really
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.840]  was involving I know people might not believe it but involving an angel of
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.840]  the Lord that spoke to the pastor to have me come I went to that church they
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.720]  these guys are shaking hungry they have a university they have a seminary they
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:15.960]  have a weekly newspaper they have a 24-hour news network which is the
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:22.120]  third largest in the country and it is my jaw dropped open because I was there
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:27.560]  20 years ago there's 70,000 members in the church and that church basically
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.760]  really when you look at it they put over a hundred people in government they
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:35.120]  actually formulated the Constitution for Hungary where that marriage was
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.640]  between a man and a woman and I spoke to the pastor and he said look he said he
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.120]  actually doesn't travel he doesn't go anywhere he said I'm just here for
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.520]  Hungary for the church and he said we're gonna shake our country so I mean I
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.880]  was so encouraged when I saw that but then also traveling to the other places
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:56.840]  and then also to see the people that love Trump from Finland to Bratislava
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:02.280]  they're wearing mega make America create great again hats France the
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:07.240]  pastors in France that said how they appreciate the president so whatever you
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.280]  see on mainstream media is this total bull and that's what I've read and so
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.640]  please speak to this pastor is that it's Hungary it was the church that
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.000]  reignited the nationalism that exposed it and that helped now get a good
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.080]  president elected and block the giant Islamic invasion and now the pastor
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.680]  saying if we don't have Christianity we don't have a culture Christianity is
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.560]  under attack and now it's spreading all over Europe and again that shows the
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:37.640]  power of that one church and you're saying you literally by by divine
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:42.960]  intervention got led to that church and this happened yeah because I wasn't
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.480]  scheduled to go there we had been there 20 years ago people said you want to go
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:50.520]  back to that church I said no I didn't call him he calls me so when I was
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:54.320]  sitting on the front row pastor Eric said to me my right-hand guy he said
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.640]  listen Pastor Shondor just texted his son-in-law and said would you come to
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:03.280]  Budapest tomorrow night and immediately I heard the Lord say go and strengthen him
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.720]  so I went there and then he told me he was praying and he said he had his eyes
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.000]  closed and he said he heard a voice say look up he looked up and there was an
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.120]  angel standing to the side and the angel said have Rodney Brown come to
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.280]  Budapest tomorrow night now people might not believe this but that's how I ended
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.360]  up at Budapest on Saturday night on the only night supposed to be my off night
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.520]  and let me tell you it was electrifying Alex if I took you there I've never
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.000]  seen anything like it in my life it was a five-hour service that's their regular

[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.480]  beyond imagination my whole team was blown away let's be clear and now I've
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:45.120]  read about that church it came from nowhere you were there 20 years ago is

[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:18.320]  we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:21.240]  good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:25.960]  supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.000]  brought you X2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying to
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.440]  block that we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:38.760]  of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.240]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:49.960]  vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and

[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:31.800]  explosive with roger stone is the american spectator taking him out of
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:37.680]  context that he believes trump is not gonna run for president he's gonna pull
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.080]  out the next year and a half and that's why he's been really defending pants
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.240]  saying he likes pants he loves pants i don't know if that's the case but roger
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:48.840]  hasn't been wrong very many times but trumps rhetoric is the opposite and i
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.480]  think trumps committed to the fight i i think roger's wrong is this an accurate
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:58.480]  statement from roger stone he'll be joining us coming up at six after then
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.160]  at the bottom of the hour our reporters are back and forth between teowanna and
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:08.480]  san diego pastor rodney howard brown one of the most globetrotting evangelicals
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:11.880]  the real deal out there does a great job as ministry here in the united states
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:15.360]  formerly from south africa he was getting into the big awakening that he's
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.240]  seen in europe and the miraculous things that are happening the fact that
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:23.640]  he ended up going back to the church in hungary that they admit helped detonate
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.840]  the whole nationalist awakening that's happening i talked to a lot of people
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.760]  who work and live in europe and the people that are ukrainian polish you name
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.320]  it and they tell me that there really is a huge awakening have you been to russia
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:42.240]  a and and b regardless what are you told about the christian awakening that we
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:46.040]  read about there is that accurate because some of the leftist people say
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:49.880]  oh that's all baloney putin's just saying he supports christianity on the
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.400]  surface but he's not really a christian even though it's admitted that he was
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.720]  baptized secretly when he was a little kid and stuff and that the church was
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.320]  just underground in the soviet union what's your intel on that pastor brown
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:06.800]  there are millions of believers across russia and the ukraine i mean i was in
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.560]  the ukraine two december's ago phenomenal large church we had six thousand
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:17.440]  people in attendance for that night and they he probably runs fifteen thousand
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:23.040]  members there so and the same is with russia all across russia even in places
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.040]  like Siberia which they're begging me to come there and i'm probably going to
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.720]  be going to russia in the new year but so for anybody to say that that's not
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.680]  happening they don't know what they're talking about russia you know when the
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:38.520]  walls came down that's what happened with the church in budapest that church
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.800]  was built underground that that pastor had suffered at the hands of the
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.760]  communists and and here's the thing too about hungry was hungry if you go back in
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.680]  its history was invaded by islam they killed all the hungarians so that's why
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:58.000]  hungaria hungry has such an adverse reaction towards radical islam because
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.160]  they understand what the agenda is they haven't forgotten their history they
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.800]  haven't genetic they haven't forgotten correct so you know and and here's the
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.520]  thing russia is a victim of the new world order as well as all these countries
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.880]  are being played like on a chessboard and the globalist play with all of them
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:21.400]  but the people are precious alex i mean i mean the the russians that drove in
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.400]  to the meetings in but the slava and the sums that came down to to kiss and our
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.040]  mold over they're hungry they're precious people and you must understand i come
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.520]  from south africa so we didn't like russians you know we felt the only good
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.240]  russian was a dead russian back when i was a kid growing up because of
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:43.760]  communism and the whole let's explain the russians and the cuban for funding
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:48.880]  invasions just north of you correct and of course they wanted to control the
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.840]  sea route and they wanted you know if they wanted the diamonds and they wanted
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.680]  everything that south africa had so i mean we had russian ak-47s all of our
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:02.320]  country russian limpet mines being blown up i mean the ANC had it start coming
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.840]  out of communist soviet russia so you know that's why we were totally adverse
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:10.720]  against anything to do they were coming in taking all of our young african men
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:15.000]  taking them to checkers the valkia and bulgaria training them to be freedom
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:22.400]  fighters so you know this is what's so well let's just say it the africaners
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.280]  held off the the africaners held off the 10 to 1 the big commie invasion and so
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:31.680]  you can you can say as an aficionado about what's happening that russia is
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:37.000]  different now totally totally and and now the russians have experienced
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.200]  freedom they don't want to go back under communism they they want freedom and
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:44.960]  and the and the freedom that came to russia really was the gospel of jesus
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:51.120]  christ these huge churches all over from st peteburg to moscow right up into
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:55.960]  into Siberia many of the many of the russian cities and then all the previous
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:00.040]  russian states that and the reason I know this is true it's not just you and
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:04.280]  not just the evidence of there but you hollywood's given interviews and made
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:08.160]  your leftist papers and said why they hate russia now when they loved it and
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:11.920]  bernie sanders with vacation there you know on his honeymoon as you go piss on
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:17.080]  christians basically literally now that russia is so christian and so pro family
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:20.960]  and bans brainwashing kids about transgenderism and all this stuff that
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:25.080]  you should do that's child abuse that's that's why the left-hates rush is so
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:29.280]  bad because rush is the one that got away
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:34.080]  correct but I mean you go back we talk about it in the killing of uncle sam the
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:38.320]  book that you talked about earlier and you see how the bolshevik revolution was
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:42.480]  actually funded out of the united states communism was actually funded out of a
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:48.160]  America Stalin was all of that you know the whole thing people actually don't
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.880]  know the history of what is actually taking place because the globalist play
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:57.080]  both sides of the fence so you can see clear the american left went in and set
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:01.760]  with british and set up the most fix to wipe out the christians and they saw
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.880]  the czar this week as they had their own problems and then now the very same
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:09.840]  leftist through soros and others the very same crowd the very same people are
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:15.360]  are trying to do that here they're making their leftist bolshevik move which I
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:20.800]  was I was standing at budapest in that big crowd you know a few weeks ago
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:25.240]  laughing my head off because yes solace trying to mess with florida trying to
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:28.840]  steal the election everybody was sending me messages pray I said I'm not
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:33.480]  praying we have prayed and they will not prevail and of course you know the
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:37.680]  outcome they didn't prevail but we were that close they're having a communist
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.960]  governor we were like right on the edge but I really felt that the Lord
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:45.800]  wouldn't give us victory it's the same with Trump you know everybody says oh
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:50.240]  this that the other thing I said listen we prayed God gave America a last-minute
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:55.120]  reprieve with Trump and he might not be an angel but let me tell you he's a
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:59.400]  wrecking ball even soros just said it last week he said Trump has almost
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:04.040]  destroyed the new world order so you can see we actually are winning they are
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:09.040]  they are not winning they're losing the New York Times that and people say oh
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:13.480]  Trump's really new world order Alex oh he sees one of them no all hell has
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.760]  broke loose they are trying to destroy anyone that supports him you read the
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.120]  whole Bible or history God always ends up raising up imperfect people like
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:26.120]  Trump because he is stubborn like a mule and and tough like a lion and and I
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.800]  know for a fact well you know him you prayed with him that Trump was always
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:35.400]  pro-christian but now he really has felt the spirit he says I've changed I know
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:38.560]  this is a spiritual battle I've had private conversations with him about
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.000]  the energy in churches and how much he loves God and how we need to have
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.440]  religious freedom in America and I'm like he's brought this up to me many
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:50.160]  times and and he's not telling me what I want to hear Trump gets it he really gets
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:55.920]  it yeah and I believe God is using him as a wrecking ball against the globalist
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:01.000]  agenda to give America one lost chance he is the problem Alex many in the church
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.240]  are sleeping they don't actually people think this is a Republican and Democrat
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.640]  situation fact is we had the house we had the Senate we had everything what do
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.560]  they do nothing because the Republican Party many of them is sold their souls so
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.440]  you know obviously in the midterms the thing flipped but that's so that the
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.720]  Republicans can craft to come back in 2020 and look like winners they're the
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:29.880]  whole things a big scam but nonetheless Trump president Trump is making huge
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.160]  strides and if anybody knows actually of what he's actually done and seeing the
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.280]  ground that's been gained for the church for the body of Christ no other
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.160]  president in the history of America since its founding has done what this
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:47.920]  president no president has gone to the pro-life rallies he did it no president
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:51.040]  has said leave Christians alone he's done it no presidents move with
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:55.720]  legislation to stop persecuting Christians Trump Trump Trump has been
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:00.600]  trying deliverable like you said the Republican establishment obstructed him
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:05.480]  40 plus Republicans basically resigned and left because they're bought and paid
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:09.760]  for they have thrown everything they can at Trump gut level I think he's gonna
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:13.520]  run for president again and I think he's gonna win I think Roger Stone's wrong
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.480]  no I believe he will win again and you know what I'm laughing at of course if
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:22.680]  you look at mainstream media on Twitter every third tweet is about some loser
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:27.400]  who says they're gonna run for president Trump will give him a nickname and take
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:32.000]  him out I mean I let get the bag of popcorn I mean really you're gonna
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.840]  watch look what happened in Brazil Brazil just had a Trump-style president
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:41.720]  win and I met the Brazilians they were in Europe and they said oh we had a great
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:45.760]  victory in our country so you could see the same thing happening even in Italy
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:51.080]  you could see the same thing happening it's on the rise and I know Teresa May
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.000]  is playing around with the whole Brexit thing but on the ground on the grassroots
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.400]  level the British people know we have to get free of this whole thing because the
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:04.400]  next thing is to take if they can take Turkey bring it into the EU that will
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:09.240]  flood England with millions and millions of Turks that's the end of the UK
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:13.840]  finish gone it's hanging on and I all vote how the
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:16.960]  Turkish dictator tells them just do five more minutes and talk about how you
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.000]  think the enemy will counter strike what people can do with Pastor Rodney
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.280]  Howard Brown straight ahead because this this is such an incredible time to be

[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:00.080]  that are enumerated on a piece of paper it consists of the things that we're
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:03.880]  willing to fight for the First Amendment the Bill of Rights the rest of the Bill
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:08.240]  of Rights are prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.680]  organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:17.720]  individuals you better understand that because they're taking them right now
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:23.320]  we have seen what they want to do they called it UN Agenda 21 now they call it
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:28.400]  the UN 2030 Agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.360]  out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities because
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:38.360]  that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone. It's the David Knight show.
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:41.360]  Never missed your show. Any day.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:48.360]  At info wars.com forward slash show.

[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:12.360]  Resistance to Titans is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:17.360]  It's a very important report that just went live at news wars.com and info wars.com.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:23.360]  We share it from news wars.com because they block info wars.com on almost every college system
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:30.120]  universities libraries Boeing the Pentagon still has leftists in it they're
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:34.200]  blocking info wars.com there but not news wars.com we'll still probably start
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:37.000]  blocking that we'll have more sites we continue to tell you about to get around
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.120]  the globalist but Trump was right children smuggled traffic from migrant
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:46.360]  caravan and it's all the proof right there but of course the mainstream media
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:52.480]  says he's wrong pastor Rodney Howard Brown I know there's an awakening happening
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:56.360]  and we've been positive and I want to be positive but at the same time that the
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:00.200]  the globalist are moving with the mark of the beast with world government with
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:04.160]  sexualizing our children and it's suddenly activating everywhere I don't
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.040]  even have to look for it and it's in my face and it makes me feel guilty that I'm
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:13.040]  not doing enough so just and I respect you as a pastor but watching you for over
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.000]  a decade online and so you're you know kind of my pastor how do you how do I
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.800]  deal with this because it's not even a guilt thing it's more and it's beyond an
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:29.040]  anger thing it is a it is it's beyond frustration it's it's it's like being on
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:33.520]  fire and it's it's kind of a good thing when I'm taking action but the rest of
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:38.040]  the time it's just like I don't know how to explain it and I just I just and I
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:41.080]  maybe it's I guess it's supposed to be there all the time I know and Ezekiel
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:44.160]  talks about you know the fire in the bones and won't go away but it's getting
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:47.600]  worse because it's like the closer the enemy gets to taking over I just can't
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:53.080]  stand it yeah look here's the thing I mean everybody I think that's doing
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:56.480]  something always feels like they're not doing enough because I have a lot of
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:59.880]  ministers come around to see what I'm doing they say look in comparison what
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:03.920]  they doing they're not doing enough here's what I tell people everybody must
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:09.040]  do what you are able to do and within the abilities that God has given to you
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:13.840]  God gave you a voice it goes around the world obviously their voices they try to
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.360]  silence your voice but you're still there you're still doing so with every
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:22.040]  five of your being you continue to do it the same with me they're made up all
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:26.440]  kinds of lies about me I ignore it because it's actually funny now so you
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:31.640]  just stay focused and just keep doing what you're doing every day you know we
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:37.440]  felt to run to 300 cities one night meetings and and just mobilize leaders
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.080]  if I can mobilize a hundred leaders per city 300 cities that's 30,000 leaders in
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.680]  the next two years so what I try to tell people with a viewing business make sure
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:50.600]  that your business is attached to eternity make sure that what you're doing
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.720]  is involving souls and the harvest and bring the gospel of Jesus Christ otherwise
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:59.720]  your business is just for now and it'll fade away it will not count a hundred
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:05.280]  years from now and then anybody who whoever you are in government ministers
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:10.360]  make every shot count and don't look at the other people that maybe are doing
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.120]  more than you doing or have a bigger voice than you just let your voice be
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:20.440]  heard and ask the Holy Spirit to help you so even tonight before you go to sleep
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:25.680]  when you're just on your bed just say Holy Spirit come Jesus said you were to
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:29.800]  be my comforter come and teach me show me what to do that I can be more
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.800]  effective for you and then also one of the things I've learned Alex that I've
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.520]  got to be careful that I don't get taken down a rabbit hole or run down an area
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:41.840]  that I'm not supposed to be because there's a lot of things I can get
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:45.640]  involved in and then there's things that I shouldn't get involved in so I have to
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:49.520]  stay I've got to stay with the main mission what's the main mission and
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.360]  stay on the main mission which is igniting the fires for a Bible and
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:57.800]  winning souls and so if I stay with that everything else is a additive I
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:01.520]  remember when we did killing Uncle Sam everybody thought I'm going off the
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.160]  rails but I'm not I just added that to so people have context but what you said
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:11.360]  is absolutely essential and and it's the key to it is that it's Christians all
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.520]  over the world that are opposing the world government the New World Order
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:16.720]  because the globalist brainwashing with somebody who really has the spirit of
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:19.720]  God in them does it work doesn't mean we're perfect doesn't mean we go off the
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:24.280]  rails doesn't mean we don't know but it means that we still can really see
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:27.400]  through it and it's that discernment we've all got to pray for and you're
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.560]  absolutely right and when I've shot the Holy Spirit is only purchase as you need
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:33.840]  to pray more on there you just keep pointing out get right with God and
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.480]  then everything else will flow from that pastor revival.com killing Uncle Sam
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.480]  book.com thank you and thank you for the great news and your great work and all

[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:09.360]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:12.840]  bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:17.960]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:21.720]  hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.320]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:30.160]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:34.600]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:39.320]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:44.680]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:50.040]  it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:54.600]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery X3 now available
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:59.440]  at m4slife.com I'm standing in this briefing room right now there is no
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:04.560]  government official here but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.440]  people
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:20.760]  but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people the press is not the
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:26.040]  enemy of the people the press is not the enemy of the people
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:49.880]  maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:54.760]  sucks and fake news maybe we should go out all all journalists should go out
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:59.960]  on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:12.520]  we're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy of the people we're not
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:24.360]  the enemy of the people this is CNN
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:37.920]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:45.800]  waging war on corruption crashing to the lies and disinformation the number
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:52.880]  one nationalist pro-human pro-christian pro-capitalist broadcast in the world
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:58.360]  and the most hated demonized and lied about broadcast in the world
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:05.560]  cowards and bootlickers run from info wars patriots who love freedom and hate
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:11.320]  pedophiles run towards us we're taking on the monsters and we're getting victory
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:15.720]  after victory thanks to all of your support now as everybody knows I don't
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:21.880]  cover the whole Russiagate thing in the main every day the latest BS that comes
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:28.000]  out of Robert Mueller and all these America hating Democrats these 30
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.320]  something Democrats he's hired that run this operation Hillary's former top
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:34.880]  lawyer that helped cover up the foundation all of it the people that
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:38.720]  should be indicted for Russiagate our Robert Mueller and others I mean
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:43.720]  literally tarmac uranium you name it you know of course he got loved he's a
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:46.720]  great investigative journalist but a lot of the big breaking stuff he would put
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:53.040]  out was the New York Times 2015 Hillary Clinton's Russia problem I mean that
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.240]  used to be in the news that he would just go get the latest and they ask how'd
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:03.280]  you know about this because everybody knew so of course he's certainly good at
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.960]  building stuff up he's not just a good writer you know he's a good showman but
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:13.040]  instead of getting the minutiae of this there's big developments they're saying
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:17.000]  top story on drudgerport.com and it's on info wars.com let's put it on
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.440]  stream for TV viewers that supposedly Paul Manafort visited the Equatorian
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:27.760]  Embassy now WikiLeaks is offering millions of dollars and this is true they
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:33.600]  say it's total bull and we've seen stuff out of the news before oh general
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:37.400]  Flynn admits they're all Russian agents yay they're all and then of course it
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:42.520]  was a hoax and the ABC journalist had to resign so this is all being totally
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.680]  denied CNN says met with Ecuadorian president well they also say that he
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:50.800]  took the bust of Martin Luther King out and wasn't gonna win the president's
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:57.760]  seeing thousands and thousands of other bizarre lies that we all know about so
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.360]  we've got that you've got Dershowitz saying Mueller not going to produce
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:07.920]  balanced fair report that's like saying that Robert Mueller breathe there I
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:12.360]  mean this is just a fact and then the other big news which is a quote of Roger
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:17.520]  Stutter and I've heard Roger say this and I sure hope he's not wrong in an
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.240]  article for the spectator that's linked on drudgerport.com I'm innocent and I
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:25.800]  would take wouldn't take a deal would not take a deal if Mueller offered me
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:33.000]  one and then he gets into statements here about how he thinks Trump is not
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.800]  gonna run again and why so we'll we're gonna look at that so first we're gonna
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:42.600]  look at the WikiLeaks Manafort thing then we're gonna look at this last piece
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:46.560]  and then we're gonna look at course he quoted supposedly in some new book
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.420]  coming out who knows if this is true that that he had a secret deal with
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:56.560]  Trump for immunity and that he had a cover story for Roger Stone about
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:02.920]  WikiLeaks and all this stuff and this is getting really weird so first he
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:07.040]  says they're telling him to lie and then he says he's gonna plea and then he
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.200]  says he isn't gonna plea and he isn't gonna lie and now a book that would
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:16.320]  basically amount to saying that Stone is perjuring himself I mean this has got
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:22.720]  more turns in it than an action-adventure novel and then there's the other big
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.880]  thing Paul Manafort does his plea deal they take it away and say he lied about
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.600]  something so they're breaking their deal this is just unbelievable Roger Stone
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:37.040]  my head is spinning at this point so please take each point as you'd like
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.080]  I mean I just laid out four insane points what in hell is going on here yeah
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:45.600]  it's very hard to get to the bottom of it first of all let's start with the
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:49.640]  question of the president's running for reelection if you see it in context what
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:54.720]  I said was Donald Trump unlike previous presidents doesn't need to be president
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:12:00.280]  for his self-worth or his self-esteem this job has cost him two billion dollars
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:04.240]  personally unlike the Obamas and the Clintons who made money out of the
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:09.400]  presidency this is costing our president all I said was if the economy
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:14.240]  continues to come roaring the back as it has if he renegotiates the the
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:19.880]  multinational international trade deals to get us better individual trade deals
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:26.240]  with our trading partners if he seals our borders I could see him saying I have
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:31.800]  kept all of my promises to the American people and walking away and he will have
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:35.720]  gone down as one of our greatest presidents just the economic recovery
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:41.360]  already is historic so I didn't work was not saying that he would could not run
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:46.200]  for reelection I think he certainly could but at what cost himself and his
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:50.800]  family Alex every single day he's got to put up in the same kind of personal
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.280]  vicious personal attacks that you and I have to put up with only his are worse
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:00.400]  so that was that was my point this is not based on any internal knowledge it's
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:05.440]  just knowing the man perhaps he won't run if he's achieved his goals he's not
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:10.560]  hanging on for the status of being president it's not why he ran well if
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:13.600]  they got out of the way let him restore the Republic he obviously would have
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:16.800]  ended up leaving I agree with you but now he's had to stay in power just to
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:20.800]  defend himself and his family and he's a fighter so I think that he'll end up
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:24.960]  running again but but but I understand your point you're probably right and I
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:29.360]  have said otherwise on the record that if he's under impeachment or if there's
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.560]  any challenge to him that guarantees that he will run guarantees it all right
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:37.600]  well we've also got this linked up on news wars calm and we're gonna have the
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.360]  clarification of this video put out roger stone clarify statement on
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:46.480]  president trump not running in 2020 now let's move to what's really big here
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:49.760]  uh daily caller where you write a lot of articles
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:57.520]  has a story here uh that is out of control bizarre uh we're supposedly
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.360]  uh course he's saying he did a secret cover story for you we don't even know
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:04.080]  this is true uh that he even said this and it's in
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.480]  some book uh and that you did get wedgie leaks what in the world is going on
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:11.280]  here yeah it doesn't it's not even logical here's
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:15.120]  what jerry is saying he's saying that after my now iconic
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.440]  podesta tweet immediately after I contacted him and said
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:23.280]  I'm great I'm I'm getting great heat for this I need
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.360]  some cover story well I wasn't getting any heat
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:32.080]  it until podesta's emails were published six weeks later
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:35.680]  my tweet was not the slightest bit controversial it kind of went
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:40.720]  unnoticed so let me say it again my tweet was based on jerry coursey's
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:44.480]  original research into the russian business connections
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:48.480]  of john and tony podesta 15 days before I said
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.320]  pardon me five days before I said it would be podesta's time in the barrel
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.840]  roger we know we know what you've said five thousand times on air I'm saying
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:59.280]  what is this is this even true what's going on the coursey what do you know
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:03.360]  about this ridiculous article here's what we know a federal prosecutor when
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.800]  they put the squeeze on you can get you to say anything
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:10.160]  so according to what I have read coursey got
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:14.720]  use immunity for some specific testimony against me
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:17.760]  claiming that I had worked with him to concoct
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.400]  some cover story which is false everything I have said about my tweet is
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:26.160]  true now uh more importantly however where I
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:30.960]  think coursey walked was in the next step they wanted him to say that he or I
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:34.960]  received documents from wiki leaks and passed them on to Donald Trump
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.200]  that is false so now we know and that and that makes sense because first he
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:42.240]  says okay I'm gonna plea and now he's not gonna plea
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:46.400]  and he just saw him basically cheat manifold get him to plead
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.600]  and then they're now double backing on him this is insane
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:55.280]  my lord will they have coursey say that I'm a russian agent

[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:03.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:17.680]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:21.680]  well this is the biggest flurry of action in the last two years of the
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:26.560]  ridiculous russian gate fraud where people actually involved
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:30.720]  from robert mehler to hillary clinton to her lawyer who's the head head of
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:34.640]  prosecution yes the person leading the prosecution of
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:38.240]  russia gate is involved in russia gate that the head
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:42.560]  prosecutors literally involved with the foundation for hillary covering things
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:47.600]  up they are now claiming manifold
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.400]  was at a secret meeting with the saunch and i just left it in the break room
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:57.520]  the guardians now backpedaling saying it's not true this is just like when they
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.520]  said that general flinn had admitted they were
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:04.560]  all russian agents and it just totally wasn't true it was a
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:08.560]  giant lie well now the guardian is coming out
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:12.320]  saying okay maybe it didn't happen this is unbelievable and then now they've got
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:15.840]  an article in the daily caller of all places
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:19.600]  charon coursey says he has defense agreement with trump
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:24.080]  received limited immunity from mehler and made up
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:28.640]  the whole story of him figuring out that the wiki leaks would be about
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:32.720]  podesta and the campaign because they did get it
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:36.160]  basically from wiki leaks totally made up and this is
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:41.680]  supposedly in some book so i mean wow and this fits with
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:46.720]  first coursey's in all these meetings then they're going to indict him
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:50.400]  then he says okay well i'm not going to lie
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:54.480]  and then now we're back hearing he will plea bargain
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:58.160]  this is making my head spin so let's go right through
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:03.280]  this roger yeah it's really quite extraordinary if you looked at the
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:08.480]  indictment of the 17 russian intelligence
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:12.400]  officials there is a paragraph that says a us-based
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:16.560]  journalist uh was given the pass codes to some site
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:20.480]  by goose for 2.0 and may have downloaded podesta's
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:24.240]  emails well that journalist is most certainly not roger stone or alex
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:27.680]  jones that i can tell you was it jerry coursey and we
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:31.440]  don't know it that's certainly a possibility i find there's huge
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:37.120]  discrepancies between the uh the uh online america
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:40.160]  interview that course he gave two days ago and this new
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:43.680]  book that he has just released so he's all over
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:47.920]  the map here he also claims for example that i knew about the
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:51.760]  billy bush nbc grabbed them by the you know what
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:55.280]  disclosures in advance and that i asked jerry
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:23:00.480]  to contact the sange to ask the sange to speed up the wiki leaks disclosures
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:04.160]  to change the political narrative complete fiction
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:08.240]  why would i call jerry coursey so c roger i i think my instincts are right
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:12.000]  about coursey because i'm not trying to be mean here but
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.560]  we all know what happened when we were there with him
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:17.760]  earlier this year i guess it was in what was it in
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:21.520]  january it was in january was in february and in dc for that press
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:25.120]  conference we had about the censorship and all the lawsuits
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:29.840]  and i don't want to be mean to coursey okay i'm just gonna leave it but he was
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:33.200]  out of his gourd and i have all the witnesses
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:36.960]  falling down they they were calling an ambulance he'd stop breathing
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:41.440]  they had to put him in his hotel room bed he didn't know who he was the next day
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:45.120]  and i'm not trying to be mean then i see him in this oan interview
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:49.760]  sweating profusely breathing heavily uh and i and then now he's all over the
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:53.520]  map i mean i expect him to claim i wear a
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:58.240]  you know fur hat you know and and and and a married of adam here putin any
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:01.120]  moment i mean so you're like oh he's a hero
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:04.640]  because now he's come out and said i won't lie but then i guess he means he
[02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:07.760]  won't lie to a certain extent to incriminate himself
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:11.520]  and say he was talking to wiki leaks because i know you weren't talking to
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:15.200]  him i know i wasn't talking to him i know you were punched in the stomach
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:18.720]  when the billy bush thing came out and we're you know off record kind of like
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.320]  my god this may be it and i said buck up this is nothing it's a bunch of edited
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:25.280]  crap move forward and i'm not trying to shoot my mouth off here that's just
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:30.320]  what happened roger this is a load of crap and i am not involved with any
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:33.840]  stinking russians go ahead roger that's exactly right i was
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:37.600]  despondent when the billy bush thing came down and you were the one who said
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:41.680]  just steady the ship this too will pass you said the country's too upset and you
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:45.280]  turned out to be exactly right so look jerry course he's not going to
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:48.480]  make a very good witness for the government or anyone else because he's
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:51.440]  all over the map even and i'm not going to kiss his ass so he
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:54.480]  doesn't make stuff up just make up whatever you want with that criminal
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:59.040]  muller that goddamn russian asian muller excuse me lord i apologize
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:03.520]  just oh my god let them march in that federal prosecutor that's involved with
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:06.240]  russia i hope that i can't wait to get in
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:10.320]  front of that damn grand jury i'm so sick of this crap
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:14.640]  these are the damn traitors that hate the country they're the one selling us out
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.880]  we're the american patriot so's trump and i'm sick of it
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:23.040]  sorry i just roger this is a real blow up i'm gonna stop now
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:27.360]  go ahead i know i believe me i know you feel i just verbalize it in a different
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:31.600]  way uh look the whole thing is uh is uh uh we've lost
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:35.840]  side of the fact that there is no right the prosecutor is a god damn russian
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:40.240]  agent excuse me lord i'm sorry i'm gonna stop there
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:45.680]  dude they've got hillary's former bag lady at the foundation for uranium one
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:49.440]  running the prosecutor it's hilarious if it wasn't so sick
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:53.680]  these people are crazy they have no shame
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:57.680]  sorry go ahead roger and they see things that aren't there so
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:02.400]  if you read jerry's book um there's an email between jerry and me in which jerry
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:07.120]  tells me that pedestas emails have been stolen but there is no such email
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:10.640]  i've read the email in question it doesn't say anything close to that so
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:14.720]  these people get their exercise listen we also just say it privately about
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:18.000]  coursey about a year ago i said i gotta let him go he's crazy
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.360]  because on the phone and to everything he started believing all this Q and on
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:24.880]  crap he started saying he was talking to the president when he wasn't and i'm
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:28.720]  gonna leave it at that and and and he just is out to
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:31.920]  lunch man the guy has had a stroke or something
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.440]  one day he can talk normal the next day he doesn't know what planet he's on
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.080]  i heard there's a demon involved named rum
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:46.000]  sorry go ahead uh it's it's very hard to figure out why he's all over the place
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.600]  i do think he's drinking he has his tendency to break down into tears
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:52.240]  um uh you know oh you think he's drinking when we had to
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:58.240]  carry him out of the the palm steakhouse well i could not distinguish i mean
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:01.920]  his interview yesterday with oan was brilliant
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:06.640]  today he's saying the exact opposite in print and there's a total inconsistency
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:10.960]  there uh so um look it's more of the same bottom line
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:15.440]  no russian collusion no wiki leagues collaboration no advanced knowledge of
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:20.320]  these uh for cop to protest the emails so what is it this about now we're down
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:24.560]  to these tiny nitpicking perjury stuff oh you were wearing a blue tie that day
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:28.880]  but you said it was red so i mean this has reached an absurd point
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:33.120]  they don't run by a guy up to his eyeballs in real russian collusion with a
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:38.320]  strategic uranium weapons stockpile and the damn prosecutor
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:42.720]  literally is hillary's bad woman this would be like if i was a jew at
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:45.920]  nurenberg and they were saying that i was going to prison
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.160]  for for for helping hitler when i've been persecuted and then
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:56.560]  hitler's the judge i mean why not make hitler the judge at nurenberg roger
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:59.600]  well let's hope that matthew would occur the acting attorney general was
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.520]  listening because he is the man who can put an end to this entire
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:07.360]  charade millions of dollars two years of wasted time
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:11.040]  no evidence of russian collusion because it's a distraction
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:14.720]  it's a distraction from the crimes of the obamas and the clinton's
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.320]  it's a distraction from the fact that they use the power of the state
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:22.640]  to surveil donald trump's campaign for president all because that little ugly
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:26.720]  weasel podesta is pissed that we didn't that we blocked the
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:31.200]  heir apparent her highness wart face from getting into power so she
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:33.440]  could really rape the hell out of this country
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:36.400]  we've got our reporters on the border roger but i'm gonna come back with five
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:38.240]  more minutes for you i'm gonna let you host

[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:48.480]  assigns who were supposedly all in cahoots with she would never give us

[02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:30.960]  show host the country our president is under attack
[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:36.480]  and roger stone is with us rudge report dot com has top linked to this radio
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:39.040]  slash tv transmission right now which i appreciate
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:42.480]  drudge doing obviously roger stone's top linked on drudge report
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:45.440]  dot com with his statement that if the president could just be left alone to
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:48.000]  fix the country he would not run again
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.600]  which i agree with but then now we've got manafort supposedly meeting with a
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:54.800]  sange already the one in guardian is backpedaling changing their article
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:58.960]  saying now they're not sure that story is up on zero hedge dot com
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:03.600]  we have got this bizarreness with with dr. Jerome coursey
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:08.160]  who has worked for info wars until about eight months ago
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:11.280]  and i don't want to say mean things about coursey but
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:16.560]  i have experienced him basically what i would call dementia
[02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:18.960]  i'm just going to be nice and leave it at that
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:24.400]  and uh let's just stop there but my security guys had to
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:29.120]  literally put him in his hotel bed they called me said we should call an
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:33.120]  ambulance we believe you stop breathing i checked on him some more and said no
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:36.160]  let's just stand by but i had to have people go check on him
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:39.120]  okay so this is the stuff i'm dealing with and i don't want to sit here and
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:42.800]  bring all this out on air but i called roger up and i said i got to let him go
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.400]  because of this and all the rest of it he's been a very talented guy great
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:50.720]  patriot but now to have him supposedly in a book he's
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:54.720]  written that's coming out about how he's with the president and stone
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:58.240]  and he's getting documents and he had a cover story with stone
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:01.440]  after he after he's been all over the news denying this and saying he wouldn't
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:04.560]  lie this is crazy and then you get the
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:07.600]  manafort thing so roger you've got the floor for the next eight minutes we go
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:10.000]  to break and then my reporters are on the ground in
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.480]  mexico or go to them live and i know you've got to go to an interview but
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:15.680]  for the world here's your statement on i think this course he thinks front and
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:19.040]  center and then obviously then this manafort
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:21.760]  thing uh this supposed uh a meeting from the
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:24.400]  unreputable cnn and london guardians so roger
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:27.440]  set the record straight the world is listening right now
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:30.000]  sure and you know the white house follows drudge
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.720]  live time so the president will probably watch this so what's your message to
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:36.960]  trump what's your message on record well first of all let's
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:39.600]  address the question the president running for reelection i think it is
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:43.440]  possible that he could be so successful in turning this country around in the
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:46.560]  next two years if there anything like the last two years
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:50.800]  he may have achieved his agenda he may have to be able to just ride off into
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:53.680]  the sunset as one of america's greatest presidents
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:58.800]  that's all i was saying secondarily the whole notion that jerry coursey and i
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:02.400]  concocted some cover story because my tweet of
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:06.480]  august 21st the pedestrian's time in the barrel was controversial
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:10.720]  is false that didn't require any cover story there was no congressional
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:14.240]  investigation there was no molar investigation and my tweet wasn't
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:18.960]  controversial until six weeks later everything i said before the house
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:21.840]  intelligence committee that my tweet was based on
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:26.240]  research done by jerry coursey into the russian business activities
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:30.240]  of the pedestrians all available from public sources
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:33.280]  stands because it was truthful and correct then
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.440]  and it is truthful and correct now what's amazing alex is what federal
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:41.200]  prosecutors can get you to do under extreme pressure
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:44.400]  coursey said repeatedly that he was being squeezed to
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:48.080]  adhere to a narrative that he didn't agree with it wasn't true
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:51.280]  now suddenly he says well he took use immunity
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:56.320]  to testify against me i know the truth the truth is there is no russian
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:59.520]  collusion there is no wiki leaks collaboration
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:04.160]  there's still is no proof whatsoever that i received anything from wiki leaks
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:07.760]  or gucifer or the russians or anyone else
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:12.080]  including allegedly stolen or hacked emails and passed them on to donald
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:15.680]  trump and the trump campaign so why jerry coursey
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.320]  has a joint defense agreement with the president
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:22.960]  is a question for jerry coursey if he passed something on to the president
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:26.320]  i don't know about it if he got some documents
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:31.040]  i'm unaware of it well it's just that simple and now i'm paul maniforte
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:33.920]  if paul maniforte met with julie anassange
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:38.560]  in march of 2016 there would be surveillance camera video
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:43.360]  there would be a documentation in the log where you have to sign in
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:48.000]  the guardian admits that there is neither and paul maniforte never met with
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.120]  julie anassange in 2016 if he did he certainly didn't mention it to me
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:57.280]  this smells of fake news
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:00.400]  well i'm going to pull that clip up of joy bayhar earlier this year going
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:03.040]  yay general flint admits that their old russian agents
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:08.560]  Trump's going to prison yay all lies all the hoax from abc news put out on the
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:12.160]  view put out by a disgraced reporter uh ross
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.160]  and it's the same crud over and over again the reason i'm so angry is
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:19.120]  as you know you've talked to people that have been there your lawyer others
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:23.040]  at the grand jury they're bringing me up all the time that's how i know
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:28.240]  this is to infinity horsemaner and then i i haven't gone on record
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:32.000]  but several times i've been approached by prominent people
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.920]  literally saying you know the russians want to give you money and crap and
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:39.840]  then at least right back to the neocons right back to muller
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:43.280]  right back to a national security letter and i've gotten all to the highest
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:46.800]  levels i'll say that and so i have had enough of this
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:50.720]  crap and it's robert muller who's the agent with the tarmac and the
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:54.160]  uranium it's hillary it's the prosecutor they have
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:57.040]  hillary's former head of her lawyer for her foundation
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:03.040]  that oversaw all this crud it's it's insane it's like having al capone
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:07.120]  raised from the dead and then comes sit and organized crime trial over me
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:10.720]  when i have no criminal record it's it's like hitler presiding as the chief
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.240]  judge at nurenberg and then sending jews to the gas chambers
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:18.320]  i mean it's it's upside down bizarro world roger
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:21.680]  well and it's exactly why they want to shut info wars down
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:26.080]  they want to make sure that we don't have a platform to expose exactly what you
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:28.880]  just said they don't want anyone pointing out
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:33.920]  that the russian collusion delusion is a distraction from the real crimes
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:37.840]  of the obamas and the clintons crimes pertaining to surveillance
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:41.200]  crimes pertaining to their sale of our uranium
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:45.040]  reserves so it is uh you're right it's a kafka
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:50.560]  ask alice in wonderland world where the people who should be being prosecuted
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:53.920]  are doing the prosecuted well i mean listen half my family
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:58.000]  fought the russians and and did all sorts of stuff and the government knows
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.760]  that they know that i'm not involved with with foreign governments
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:05.680]  and but then they are and then they turn it around on us and i want trump and
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:09.040]  whitaker to take the gloves off and it's not because i'm scared of these people
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:12.800]  i'm scared for the country man these people are trash now let's let's the
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:15.840]  minutes we have left your message to president trump about what you think he
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:18.080]  should do you said two years ago in auguration
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:21.760]  illegal fires that go after him on that uh i mean all of this stuff
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:25.360]  comey lying to congress mean these people we we have them
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:30.960]  red-handed devin nunez said this two days ago it was widely covered
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:34.880]  president has information in his hands that he could declassify
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:38.400]  that would blow the entire cover on the
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:43.120]  muller obama clinton efforts to hijack the election
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:46.080]  and illegally illegally and unconstitutionally
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:50.560]  use a surveillance power of the state if he will simply declassify these
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:56.400]  documents it will be barack obama's time in the barrel
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:59.200]  now you told me weeks ago about that newness situation and you have high
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:02.160]  level congressional contacts he said don't go with it yet
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:05.440]  now i didn't even know newness had gone public so that that's good news
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:09.600]  what is trump waiting for he needs to fire it will politically
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:13.920]  he needs to launch the torpedoes ramming speed let's go
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:17.120]  it's interesting that in the british press there's a great deal of coverage
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:20.800]  over the fact that the government of the uk is really
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:25.200]  trying to pressure trump not to declassify these documents
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.200]  claiming that it shows their sources and methods what it will really show is
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:33.440]  they were working with the obama administration to spy on donald trump in
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:37.440]  his campaign that is what is holding this up mr president
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:42.160]  ignore the brits ignore the australians declassify the information
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:45.680]  let the american people see who the real criminals
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:49.360]  are because they're coming for you they're coming they have to discredit the
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:51.440]  nationalism they're never going to leave you alone
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:55.440]  they're going to sabotage the economy you and you know what i know trump's going
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:58.160]  to do it i know that's why they're so scared of what occur trying to undermine
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.120]  him right now and we just have to be men and we
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:03.600]  have to take action so basically everything we're
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:05.840]  seeing is bull maniforte didn't meet with assange
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:10.000]  they're already backpedaling uh you you the corsie
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.200]  bragging about stuff that didn't go on has got himself in deep due to it with
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.840]  moller uh and that's something we know of course he started
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:18.720]  doing uh and i'll just leave it at that i mean course he couldn't get his press
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:22.080]  passes i had to get him through my sources and sources right here close to
[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:25.280]  home i'll leave it at that and i don't want a bad mouth corsie but
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:28.800]  the point is he's been proven to be all over the map now and being deceitful
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:33.680]  and i told you my instinct was roger that he got his ass hot in the crack making
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:37.280]  crap up with all his writings and his cue and on crap

[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.600]  roger were basically working with wiki leaks and had cover stories and were
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:00.560]  working with trump good god and i guess they
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:03.760]  then had can talk to the story we kept saying i will
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:06.880]  testify i won't testify i will plea i won't plea
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:11.760]  i won't lie i won't lie so that when it comes out it sounds believable
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:16.720]  or as Corsi just out of his mind or as a daily caller lying and this didn't
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:22.240]  happen talk about sensational meanwhile trump
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:27.440]  knows that general motors has made record profits and never paid the u.s
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:30.400]  government back for the tens of millions obama gave them
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:33.280]  and what do they do they lay off a bunch of people at an ohio plant they're
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:36.080]  going to close and cudlow his chief advisor was just pointing out
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:38.560]  trump may take away the subsidies that gm has
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:42.800]  yeah how about you pay back all the money you got in the bailout
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:46.640]  and and how about you how about you don't buy back a bunch of your stock
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:49.280]  and pay yourself these these these executives
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:54.960]  10 20 30 million dollar bonuses these people are jerks and they're a bunch of
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:57.280]  globalists and a bunch of leftists and there's our president
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:00.640]  acting like a real blue collar classic democrat
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:03.840]  saying you need to get your ass in there and keep that factory open you got
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:07.760]  plenty of orders what is your stop making your parts in china
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:12.560]  and their answer is you're being mean to us these people make me sick
[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:16.720]  these globalists go out of their way to piss on this nation
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:20.240]  and where are the labor unions where are the democrats thanking him for jobs
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:23.920]  and then the and sticking up for america and wages going up
[02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:28.240]  no they don't care they just want to call him a racist and feel good idiots
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:32.400]  now our reporters greg rees and crue are down at the u.s side of the
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:35.520]  border they've been back and forth in mexico and they've got some bomb shell
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:39.680]  inside our intel in the next two days that they're going to assault with a
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:43.200]  bigger force it's just been a probe greg did a very important report that's
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:46.880]  up on info wars dot com a title breaking imminent
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:50.000]  invasion at us southern border the first attack
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.400]  sunday was just a probe and so greg rees great job you and drew
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:57.200]  of course trump has closed some of those border bridges
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:02.880]  tell us what you see there well we've been uh spending our time here around
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.000]  the border and it's interesting because just a couple days ago
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:10.080]  hundreds were trying to illegally pass and tear gas is blown off but
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:14.000]  last night and today it's business as usual it's it's rather quiet
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.800]  and we've been talking to a lot of the people passing through the border most
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:20.640]  of them don't speak english and thanks to our info wars translator
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:23.680]  down here we've been able to speak to a lot of them
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:27.360]  and they all feel the same way basically they all feel
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:31.600]  that they're upset with the migrants they're upset how it's been
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:35.680]  impeding on their personal lives one woman we spoke to was stuck over
[02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:39.360]  in america she's a mexican and she couldn't cross back over because of the
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:44.240]  shenanigans happening on sunday a lot of them expressed their support for
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:48.480]  trump and what president trump is doing one woman was saying how she's just
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:51.360]  sick of people talking about wanting free stuff and how people need to
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:55.600]  understand that they need to work for what they earn and so what we're hearing
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:58.880]  is just common sense from the other side of the border the same way that a lot
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:02.080]  of americans feel and a lot of people everywhere in the world feels
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:06.400]  so it's been refreshing to get that perspective now i know we're gonna have
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:09.280]  you hook up with some folks on both sides of the border
[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:12.960]  we've got military contacts ice contacts and mexican contacts
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:17.840]  they're very uh trusted and you're not going to say operationally what you
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:20.640]  guys are going to be doing but we've been called by
[02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:24.800]  three different sources now that they expect in two to three days and that
[02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:28.320]  was yesterday so that means the next two days for the main group that's over
[02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:31.440]  10 000 they now believe it's already shown up it was 2000 a couple weeks ago
[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:34.160]  five thousand this weekend and that they expect
[02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:38.960]  10 000 plus to try to rush and that they want images of children getting hurt
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:41.760]  to then blame trump and that's the narrative the media is putting out not
[02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:45.360]  illegal aliens coming up from other countries not a lot of these kids are
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:48.080]  kidnapped the president uh is is correct they're using them as human
[02:51:48.080 --> 02:51:51.200]  shields but the whole corporate press
[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:55.120]  is is is saying the president's a liar uh and so
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:51:58.000]  and and then i guess he's supposed to capitulate and just say the border's
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.560]  totally up and anybody that wants to come here
[02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:05.440]  alexander cortez uh is is is out there saying the very same thing
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:10.480]  so uh what's your view on that greg rees and what are the locals telling him
[02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:14.800]  well yeah the um around the election time when this caravan started i thought
[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:17.920]  it was an election stunt and maybe it's because i didn't want to accept the
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:20.080]  reality of it but now it seems very clear that
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:22.880]  what we're about to get here is what's happened in europe and germany and
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:26.560]  sweden france uh it seems very clear that that's about to
[02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:30.080]  that's about to be what happens uh we're meeting up with one of our sources
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:33.600]  later this afternoon is going to fill us up on some of the latest intel from
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:37.360]  teawanna side and that's what she's telling us is that it was a test sunday
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:39.520]  was a test and that they're planning a much bigger
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:43.840]  invasion uh it seems like sunday was just a a probe
[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:47.120]  and you can clearly see it with the mainstream media there there's only one
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:49.360]  picture i think i've seen of any women and children and that's the one that
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:51.200]  they're running with on the mainstream media
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:55.280]  talking about tear gassing people it's it's crazy that we're actually seeing
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:59.920]  this happen in real time in our own country now
[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:03.520]  and of course we will be uh crop that photo for everybody
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:06.400]  and and don't show that it was a staged photo of the woman with the kids
[02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:09.680]  but i guess it's less staged than you know trump standing over a little girl
[02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:16.000]  taking her away from her mommy like we saw last year which wasn't true either
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.960]  well we got a lot of the same uh a lot of the mexans over here were saying
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:21.040]  trump's doing the right thing and they appreciate
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:24.080]  what trump's doing and they don't want the migrants there either
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:27.840]  uh they want their their lives back they they don't want
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:33.920]  all the extra danger and uh and uh basically an invading army camping out
[02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:37.760]  in their town right now in teawanna uh causing all kinds of ma'am
[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:41.200]  child smuggling all kinds of real bad stuff's going on
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:45.280]  well of course in the u n one of its side businesses is is child smuggling
[02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:49.520]  and and women they kidnap me just type in u n caught kidnapping women children
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:52.640]  they do it all with the world hillary's involved her foundation's involved i
[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:55.440]  mean this is what they're doing and then of course even the washington post
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:58.800]  new york times i admit thousands of children they got smuggled in that
[02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:02.720]  obama let in without ids were taken and sold into slavery
[02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:06.800]  sex uh slavery uh sweatshops you name it that's all
[02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:10.400]  mainstream news here let me show tv viewers radio listeners all read it to
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:12.720]  you here's the washington post two years ago obama
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:17.120]  administration placed children with human traffickers senate report
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:20.320]  us border chief caravan used women children as human shields before
[02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:23.920]  uh rocking agents which is a fact donald trump
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:26.880]  warns of migrant grabbers of children at the border media taxing

[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:08.400]  but anyone who's critically thinking can look at this and see it's exactly the

[02:59:53.520 --> 03:00:05.520]  you
[03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:17.520]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:23.840]  you're a tv viewer you can see our cameras are trained on the san diego
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:27.520]  teowan up border and you can see there in the foreground
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:35.040]  the main migrant caravan arriving in the form of a giant trojan horse pinata
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:38.560]  CNN will probably run that and have snobs go fake news jones showed a giant
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:42.160]  pinata and said it was real it's called a joke
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:48.320]  it's called a joke uh greg rish and the crew have filed some amazing reports
[03:00:48.320 --> 03:00:52.240]  more reports are going to be filed tonight and tomorrow uh that was a probe
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:55.440]  sunday we're about a couple thousand trying to get over the border
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:58.560]  and they later admitted some did get across and get arrested
[03:00:58.560 --> 03:01:01.120]  and that means then they can go before a judge and get released that's the
[03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:04.720]  problem the president doesn't control these out of control judges
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:08.160]  and 35 million people have made it into the country illegally
[03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:13.520]  and are being organized by the democrats so greg other points uh obviously we
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:15.520]  don't want to get away with what we're going to be doing with this big stuff
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:19.760]  coming tonight tomorrow the next few days well yeah we're meeting up with some
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:22.960]  of our sources who have a lot of great intel for us and we're looking forward
[03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:26.160]  to getting filled in on everything that's going on
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:29.520]  the other thing i noticed is as you're walking along the
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:34.240]  the border fence uh last night and today and so far as the whole time we've
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:38.240]  been here you can see uh construction workers reinforcing the fence
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:42.480]  welding it there's a fresh concertino wire all on the top
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:45.600]  a lot of activity a lot of fortification
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:50.080]  uh and still so quiet for such a crazy time right now
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:52.400]  i mean when you look at what's happened in europe and you can see that's about
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:55.840]  to happen here it's an ominous silence almost
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:58.320]  and i'm kind of looking forward to getting into the teowana side more
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:02.480]  because i have a feeling things are a bit more hectic over there that's where
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:05.440]  everything sort of camped out well yeah over 10 000 now
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:08.640]  robbing stealing the mexicans are trying to deport as many as they can the first
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:12.400]  97 being deported today these are criminals trying to bust our border
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:16.720]  using children as as human shields now i know we've got national guard that's
[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:20.880]  army uh and then we've got the regular army out there i know the marines have
[03:02:20.880 --> 03:02:24.240]  always been on the border secretly that's no big secret anybody that knows
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:29.600]  you're a former marine yourself uh what other forces have you seen down there
[03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:34.240]  it's been fairly quiet we see a lot of border patrol you see uh
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:37.600]  honestly not as many as i would have expected to see you know it is sandiego
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:40.640]  it's a it's a marine core town one of the biggest marine core towns in the
[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:44.160]  country so there's plenty of military here
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:49.200]  um i would like to hope that there is some plans going on to help defend from
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:51.680]  this i think it's a great opportunity for the mexican
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:55.920]  government to get on a friendly side with america and maybe help us out
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:59.520]  as we've been hearing stories about them doing i'm not sure exactly what they're
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:01.440]  doing but we've been hearing some good things about what they're doing well
[03:03:01.440 --> 03:03:04.560]  there's a lot of double talk but the but the local governors and police and
[03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:07.040]  others know you can't have a broken border your country's gone
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:10.800]  they've got a strong border with uh guatemala it's been smashed
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:13.680]  and so they understand they need to have self preservation
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:18.240]  but the socialist uh president it has basically been putting a lot of double
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:20.240]  talk out he didn't want trump to cut the tens of
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:23.680]  millions off a year we give him but at the same time you know he wants to sit
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:27.440]  there in virtue signal uh and be part of this larger you know communist
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:30.560]  international uh but you know we're talking about smuggled
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:33.840]  children we're talking about the un here trump needs to cut the funding off to
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:37.440]  the un immediately that goes to george soros that's
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:40.800]  what really scares them when lou dobs talked about that and soros try to get
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:47.520]  lou dobs fired because it's true that's the key cut the head off of the snake
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:51.840]  start realizing that they're basically trying to set a precedent here
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:55.280]  uh if they can get thousands of people through the border that's that's a new
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:58.880]  precedent not just for open borders but for
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:02.160]  human smuggling if we can allow that to happen
[03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:05.440]  uh without bringing justice to it it's beginning to start
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:09.680]  a new precedent that's very very dark well you're right that president started
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:13.280]  with obama just saying you get here nobody checks you we load you on
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:17.440]  democrat buses wow what a surprise hundreds of thousands of people coming
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:20.560]  across millions over those years and a bunch of more kids and women being
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:23.280]  trafficked wow you mean you think some guy strong
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:26.160]  arming a couple of women or four or five guys with a woman a couple kids
[03:04:26.160 --> 03:04:28.960]  strong arming them the woman's got bruises all over her face you don't even
[03:04:28.960 --> 03:04:32.480]  ask questions just hey come into america and the guy's a carer with me and of
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:35.920]  course he's taking her to a slave dungeon unbelievable well
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:39.520]  greg rees and crew be safe out there the war rooms coming up later at three
[03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:42.400]  o'clock simple an hour you'll have updates paul joseph
[03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:47.120]  watson from her britannic majesties london is on the other side i'm alex
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:53.200]  jones and this is the info war spread those links it's an act of rebellion
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:57.840]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:01.920]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:06.240]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down
[03:05:06.240 --> 03:05:10.400]  and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world
[03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:14.880]  we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[03:05:14.880 --> 03:05:18.080]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us
[03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:22.080]  getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:25.600]  nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:29.280]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and
[03:05:29.280 --> 03:05:33.680]  secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:37.360]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[03:05:37.360 --> 03:05:41.680]  three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it
[03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:46.640]  supercharges it and makes it even more bio available
[03:05:46.640 --> 03:05:49.600]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:55.600]  incredible discovery x3 now available at infowarslife.com
[03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:09.520]  live from the info wars.com studios
[03:06:09.520 --> 03:06:21.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:32.480]  all right paul watson is taking over uh this hour of the transmission as he
[03:06:32.480 --> 03:06:35.440]  does every tuesday the fourth hour is always going to grab back
[03:06:35.440 --> 03:06:39.280]  from our best guest and infowars crew then the war room with our destroyer
[03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:45.680]  is in 54 minutes from now we had one of those rare drudge lengths at the top
[03:06:45.680 --> 03:06:51.360]  today when roger stohm was responding uh to the story out of context that he is
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:56.320]  um saying that trump's not going to run for office
[03:06:56.320 --> 03:07:03.280]  again and also that coursey has a book coming out where he's a secret agent
[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:07.600]  with trump and they're all working with the signs and all the rest of it
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:11.840]  sounds like all this talk about he won't tell a lie
[03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:17.120]  is either some type of dementia or it's a cover story so that when this
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:22.960]  outrageous lie comes out people then believe it i mean this
[03:07:22.960 --> 03:07:27.760]  is a big deal mueller finally found somebody i guess
[03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:32.640]  that'll make stuff up my head is spinning at this point
[03:07:32.640 --> 03:07:36.880]  and it's i've known coursey probably 14 15 years longer than that
[03:07:36.880 --> 03:07:40.960]  and he said so much good work and i've admired coursey but he just
[03:07:40.960 --> 03:07:47.360]  mentally degenerated about a year ago and i've talked about that and now but
[03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:50.000]  it's weird how the brain works sometimes he's dead on
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:55.840]  other times he's just a gibbering idiot and you know it's not just the demon
[03:07:55.840 --> 03:08:02.960]  alcohol it's it's it's something else and i i i just brace i guess i don't have
[03:08:02.960 --> 03:08:06.400]  any fear though because it's like bracing to here i'm going to get indicted
[03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:09.280]  for robbing a bank or something i've never robbed a bank never thought about
[03:08:09.280 --> 03:08:12.800]  robbing a bank but like knowing that mueller and all these people are like
[03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:16.000]  constantly asking about me and they're now talking to someone like coursey who
[03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:20.720]  could just make up anything at this point
[03:08:20.720 --> 03:08:26.800]  all right i'm married to latimer putin i'm a transgender woman into a man but
[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:30.320]  i don't have the surgery yet and the beard's fake and putin's my lover
[03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:34.080]  mind of course he has the evidence of course he was involved
[03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:38.640]  trump was involved they both urinated on me mueller was there he peed on me too
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:44.080]  um we were on the lead expression if you believe that then you believe that uh
[03:08:44.080 --> 03:08:50.000]  hillary clinton won in 2016 sorry to joke it's bad but i mean
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:53.440]  there's the photo i'm on a horse with my shirt off
[03:08:53.440 --> 03:08:58.320]  putin's on a horse with the shirt off and yes i transitioned from being a
[03:08:58.320 --> 03:09:01.840]  woman to a man but it still sometimes i go back the other way when my little
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:05.280]  pooty poots involved that's that's bush's nickname for my
[03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:08.960]  little poopy poop in fact well bush was involved
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:12.800]  george w was involved too i i've dated george w bush okay
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:16.080]  it's out there it's all true all right i'm gonna stop being sarcastic this is
[03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:20.080]  what happens when i get stressed out and i get angry
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:24.400]  because i'm getting really tired of this and i'm sick of it
[03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:29.280]  and i'm sick of people lying constantly and so the only way i can deal with it
[03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:34.800]  is just to start making jokes about it jack dorsi is being investigated for
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:38.560]  criminally lying under oath it's being reported in full wars dot com jamie
[03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:42.080]  white and it links through uh to the announcements
[03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:47.920]  that have been put out by congress uh that's that's that's that's huge news
[03:09:47.920 --> 03:09:51.600]  um paul watson has a big raft of things to cover someone try to hand the baton

[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:42.400]  and uh you're a slave you have no rights and then and then he's a billionaire
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:45.760]  the guy that owns alibaba so i just thought i'd add that also woman
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:50.160]  describes torture beatings in chinese attention camp but you won't hear a word

[03:12:01.360 --> 03:12:05.280]  thanks alex yeah there's a big story up on info wars dot com right now
[03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:08.960]  headline yale study finds that white liberals dumb down their vocabulary
[03:12:08.960 --> 03:12:12.560]  when speaking to black people again this is a
[03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:17.760]  research study out of yale university basically they did a study both of
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:22.480]  political campaign speeches by democrats and republicans and the general public
[03:12:22.480 --> 03:12:27.840]  found that when white liberals or white democrats are speaking to black people
[03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:32.000]  whether it be a campaign crowd or one on one in these tests
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:36.320]  they reduce their use of so-called competence words
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:40.640]  which mean words that describe their own skills so basically that's another
[03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:45.440]  way of saying they try to identify with minorities and with black people
[03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:51.120]  by pretending to be dumb again we go back to this time and time again
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:55.920]  the bigotry of low expectations when the mask slips
[03:12:55.920 --> 03:12:59.840]  the racism the implicit racism becomes more over
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:05.680]  within white leftists a new yale study was found that white liberals deliberately
[03:13:05.680 --> 03:13:08.880]  dumb down their vocabulary when speaking to black people in comparison to
[03:13:08.880 --> 03:13:12.400]  conservatives who don't they did studies they
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:15.920]  tested their political beliefs then they ran them through a
[03:13:15.920 --> 03:13:19.120]  a one-on-one conversation with a minority with a black person and found
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:22.320]  that conservatives do not dumb down their vocabulary
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:25.840]  to identify with minorities white liberals do
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:29.760]  according to the study quote white liberals tend to downplay their own
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:33.520]  verbal competence in exchanges with racial minorities
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:38.000]  and they went on to describe this as surprising
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:42.240]  and they said it could be seen as patronizing they tried to make excuses
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:44.720]  for the white liberals and saying oh they were just trying to
[03:13:44.720 --> 03:13:49.680]  overcompensate and be friendly and try to identify with black people
[03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:53.600]  no we've seen this time and time again well paul i mean i i've got
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:56.640]  in the past liberal friends or even some family that's kind of liberal and when
[03:13:56.640 --> 03:13:59.600]  they get around his spanish person it's not a doctor whatever they're like
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:04.560]  hello do you want taco and and that's how hillary
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:08.960]  remember in california with his fans like and i am latino
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:14.080]  and then oh and whenever uh obama will talk about something spanish he'll
[03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:18.320]  like overemphasize words and everyone else does this weird overemphasize
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:21.200]  patronizing and then democrats are very famous hillary
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:24.640]  when she's speaking to rural areas or southern areas or kentucky
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:29.760]  she goes how you doing there i had some possum pile this morning with granny
[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:34.720]  over at the cement pond well here hear it from her yourself here it is
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:42.160]  i don't feel no ways tired i come too far hillary clinton welcome to chair
[03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:45.760]  chats jaymey i'm delighted to be here i you know i love sitting here in rocking
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:50.880]  so uh thanks for giving me the uh the chance to do that
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:53.520]  and there's a lot more of that paul go ahead and take over i just had to pop
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:56.800]  back in to get a study show democrats are many more times likely to steal
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:00.160]  many more times likely to virtue signal and be fake and if i could how many
[03:15:00.160 --> 03:15:03.040]  times i've been out at demonstrations or whatever and the white leftist
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:06.000]  i'll see some black people show up they'll go all the sudden like hold on
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:09.840]  one moment racist yo bro what's up let's get down baby
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:13.280]  who and then why people are like oh what's what are you talking like that for
[03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:17.200]  so yes what they are is they're fake paul and conservatives are
[03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:21.200]  authentic and real when i get around black people i don't start going
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:24.800]  hey what's up brother let's get down today man let's go get some bitches
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:28.640]  because most people don't talk like that but again that's the whole mtv culture
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:31.760]  but when hillary gets around a southern area like alabama she's like
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:38.400]  hey you doing there boy i love the rebel flag here he is
[03:15:38.400 --> 03:15:41.920]  that was she when he first ran for president their symbol in the south
[03:15:41.920 --> 03:15:46.880]  was the rebel battle flag we'll be back with paul
[03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:53.520]  joseph wantson and hillary clinton

[03:17:54.320 --> 03:17:58.240]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:17:58.240 --> 03:18:01.520]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[03:18:01.520 --> 03:18:05.040]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
[03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:10.160]  concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:13.440]  particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the
[03:18:13.440 --> 03:18:18.080]  water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:18:18.080 --> 03:18:23.520]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:18:23.520 --> 03:18:27.360]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:31.200]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[03:18:31.200 --> 03:18:34.720]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:38.400]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[03:18:38.400 --> 03:18:43.680]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water
[03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:47.840]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[03:18:47.840 --> 03:18:51.120]  rain water supply but more importantly a good
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:57.120]  water filtration system will purify it we are kept afloat only by your

[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:23.840]  your host paul joseph watson
[03:20:23.840 --> 03:20:28.960]  we're back and we are talked about how leftists modify their behavior modify
[03:20:28.960 --> 03:20:32.800]  their speech modify their interactions with minorities
[03:20:32.800 --> 03:20:37.280]  with black people when in a one-on-one situation and also during campaign
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:39.360]  speeches as you heard there before the break
[03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:43.360]  hillary clinton completely changing her accent depending on the crowd
[03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:49.040]  to ridiculous levels because there's a new Yale study out today which is up on
[03:20:49.040 --> 03:20:52.400]  info wars dot com headline Yale study finds white liberals dumb down their
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:56.880]  vocabulary when speaking to black people that wasn't the headline of the study
[03:20:56.880 --> 03:21:01.040]  obviously but this is the uh the nuts and bolts of it in the study they claim
[03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:05.200]  oh they're just trying to overcompensate because they're do-gooders they're just
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:08.320]  trying to be friendly no they're being patronizing
[03:21:08.320 --> 03:21:12.560]  and condescending because they are actually implicitly racist in a lot of
[03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:16.960]  situations in fact i saw this in the flash the other
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:20.240]  day running through the park near where i live
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:24.880]  and there was this muslim woman with the full veil basically the full veil
[03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:29.440]  god only knows why she was running i say running she was more ambling along she
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:32.240]  was fat let's just put it that way she was very fat
[03:21:32.240 --> 03:21:37.360]  she had this full-on black veil and you know whatever she's doing exercise i'm
[03:21:37.360 --> 03:21:40.720]  running up behind and then this white leftist obviously
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:45.680]  leftist given the way she spoke to her was coming up behind her on a bike
[03:21:45.680 --> 03:21:48.480]  total stranger she didn't know this woman from anyone
[03:21:48.480 --> 03:21:53.360]  and just stopped this muslim woman and got in her face politely but then raised
[03:21:53.360 --> 03:21:57.200]  her voice and she was like oh good for you good for you
[03:21:57.200 --> 03:22:01.040]  that's really good you should continue exercising that's really good
[03:22:01.040 --> 03:22:04.240]  and you can tell she's being condescending and this muslim woman just
[03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:07.840]  responded in like a south london accent she looked a bit perplexed
[03:22:07.840 --> 03:22:12.080]  and a little bit terrified and it was virtue signaling in real
[03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:15.360]  life and that's what we're talking about here
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:20.000]  white leftist talking down dumbing down their language
[03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:23.760]  when they're around minorities people of color whatever you want to call it
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:28.320]  and this has proven in this Yale study they compared it to conservatives and
[03:22:28.320 --> 03:22:33.120]  they don't do it the the bigoted mean nasty deplorables
[03:22:33.120 --> 03:22:37.760]  they don't do the same thing this is from the study quote
[03:22:37.760 --> 03:22:42.080]  they designed a series of experiments in which white participants raster respond
[03:22:42.080 --> 03:22:45.040]  to a hypothetical or presumed real interaction partner
[03:22:45.040 --> 03:22:48.240]  for half of these participants their partner was given a stereotypically
[03:22:48.240 --> 03:22:51.920]  white name such as emily and for the other half their partner was given a
[03:22:51.920 --> 03:22:56.000]  stereotypically black name such as lakisha participants raster
[03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:58.960]  select from a list of words for an email to their partner
[03:22:58.960 --> 03:23:02.560]  for some studies this email was for a work related task for others this email
[03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:06.640]  was simply to introduce themselves each word have been previously scored
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:11.360]  on how warm i.e friendly or competent i.e intelligent it appears
[03:23:11.360 --> 03:23:14.960]  the word sad for example scored low for both warmth and competence
[03:23:14.960 --> 03:23:18.720]  melancholy on the other hand scored high for competence and low warmth
[03:23:18.720 --> 03:23:23.680]  so they found this is straight from the study quote liberal individuals were
[03:23:23.680 --> 03:23:26.960]  less likely to use words that would make them seem highly competent
[03:23:26.960 --> 03:23:30.480]  when the person they were addressing was presumed to be black
[03:23:30.480 --> 03:23:34.160]  rather than white so those more intelligent words
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:37.360]  when they're talking to a black person they don't use them
[03:23:37.360 --> 03:23:40.480]  because they think the best way to identify with a black person
[03:23:40.480 --> 03:23:44.320]  is by acting dumb because they're actually racist
[03:23:44.320 --> 03:23:47.920]  no significant differences were seen in the word selection of conservatives
[03:23:47.920 --> 03:23:52.480]  based on the presumed race of their partner so conservatives didn't dumb
[03:23:52.480 --> 03:23:56.960]  down their vocabulary a more crude interpretation
[03:23:56.960 --> 03:23:59.920]  this is what i wrote would be that the white liberal is essentially saying i'm
[03:23:59.920 --> 03:24:02.560]  a dumb ass just like you will get along fine
[03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:06.000]  so they're trying to dumb down their behavior modify their vocabulary
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:10.080]  because they think that will make them identify better with this minority
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:13.280]  the researchers concluded that the propensity for white liberals to
[03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:17.040]  simplify and adapt their vocabulary when talking to minorities
[03:24:17.040 --> 03:24:20.080]  was quote kind of an unpleasant surprise
[03:24:20.080 --> 03:24:23.760]  it's not a surprise but they thought it was a surprise and quote could be seen
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:30.160]  as patronizing so they literally amend their vocabulary the words they use
[03:24:30.160 --> 03:24:33.440]  and it just makes them come across as more patronizing more
[03:24:33.440 --> 03:24:38.160]  condescending the study emphasizes how white leftists
[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:41.920]  while white leftists are keen to virtue signal about how much they respect
[03:24:41.920 --> 03:24:45.520]  people of color when it comes to judging their intelligence
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:49.440]  the opposite is true and i compare it to a different
[03:24:49.440 --> 03:24:52.640]  article and study which we featured before
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:55.920]  headline poorer conservatives more generous than
[03:24:55.920 --> 03:24:59.280]  wealthy liberals so again the liberal will virtue signal
[03:24:59.280 --> 03:25:03.120]  all day about how loving how inclusive
[03:25:03.120 --> 03:25:07.200]  how embracing of diversity they really are when it comes to actually talking
[03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:11.440]  to a person of color they turn into a different person
[03:25:11.440 --> 03:25:15.600]  they dumb themselves down similar situation in
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:21.280]  britain again they demonize white working class people as deplorables as
[03:25:21.280 --> 03:25:24.240]  bigots as racists when those white working class
[03:25:24.240 --> 03:25:27.760]  people because they're poorer are more likely to interact with
[03:25:27.760 --> 03:25:30.640]  black people with muslims on a day-to-day basis
[03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:35.040]  it's the white middle class leftist that never interacts with any of those
[03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:39.040]  people unless they're hiring them to keep their house clean or wash their car
[03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:42.240]  or do their yard work or whatever and when they do so
[03:25:42.240 --> 03:25:46.560]  again they talk down to them but again poorer conservatives more generous
[03:25:46.560 --> 03:25:50.880]  than wealthy liberals this is another study less well-off families from red
[03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:53.760]  states donate a relatively higher and growing
[03:25:53.760 --> 03:25:57.120]  proportion of their money to charity while those at the top are being given
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:00.560]  a sim i've been giving a smaller share as their
[03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:04.480]  income has increased so even as they got more wealthy they gave less money to
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:07.280]  charity of course you go on their twitter page and
[03:26:07.280 --> 03:26:10.640]  like every other tweet is retweeting charities and
[03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:15.360]  promoting you know do good at causes do they actually give to those charities
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:19.840]  no the studies say they don't so it's all about projecting
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:23.280]  virtue signaling how much of a good person they are
[03:26:23.280 --> 03:26:26.960]  when it actually boils down to handing over the cash
[03:26:26.960 --> 03:26:31.360]  is non-existent while poorer conservatives do tend to give more to
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:35.360]  charity very interesting study and you can
[03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:38.320]  compare this to what's happening in portland
[03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:43.680]  over the past few days headline portland protesters urge united states to
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:47.600]  accept central american refugees waiting at the border
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:51.680]  so big protests in portland this week the progressive trendies
[03:26:51.680 --> 03:26:57.520]  just love refugees they love migrants except if you're migrating from california
[03:26:57.520 --> 03:27:00.400]  and we've got a clip about this which we can play right now
[03:27:00.400 --> 03:27:03.840]  in which case they hate your guts and literally
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:07.600]  all over portland they stick up stickers for the state of california
[03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:12.320]  crossed out they hate migrants if they're migrating from within america
[03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:15.680]  but again they love the refugees let's go to this clip right now
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:19.840]  portland couple woke up to find hateful graffiti outside their home
[03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:24.480]  telling them to move back to california the homeowners had just moved in a few
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:27.520]  months ago kgw's kyle aboshi is live in northeast
[03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:32.320]  portland's rose city neighborhood with the details kyle
[03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:35.840]  christina's homeowners are trying to clean up the ugly vandalism you can see
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:38.960]  behind us with some fresh pain but it doesn't help to erase the hateful
[03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:42.480]  messages they encountered this morning the couple woke up to find their car
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:46.560]  tagged with graffiti which read go back to california and get out of pdx
[03:27:46.560 --> 03:27:50.320]  their rose city home was also spray painted with hateful messages
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:53.760]  the couple moved into the home only a few months ago neighbors say
[03:27:53.760 --> 03:27:58.640]  they did a wonderful job fixing the place up breaks my heart because these
[03:27:58.640 --> 03:28:01.120]  people are young and they're new to the city
[03:28:01.120 --> 03:28:04.160]  and
[03:28:04.160 --> 03:28:07.440]  they put so much work into this place and then to have someone come along and
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:11.840]  do something like this is obscene
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:16.160]  i had a chance to speak with the homeowners just a few moments ago and
[03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:20.960]  they think this vandalism may be related to a road rage incident that occurred
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:24.320]  yesterday they said there was an incident with another driver and that
[03:28:24.320 --> 03:28:28.080]  driver allegedly said go back to california similar to the
[03:28:28.080 --> 03:28:31.280]  graffiti that was painted on their car and their home
[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:34.880]  so again leftists in portland they're all about welcoming migrants and
[03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:38.000]  refugees except migrants from california which they hate again
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:42.000]  it's about saying one thing projecting one image but then when it comes down to
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:46.720]  it following through on a completely different schedule we'll be back in the
[03:28:46.720 --> 03:28:49.360]  next segment this is the alex germshaw life info wars

[03:32:01.840 --> 03:32:06.160]  that it lowers iq it literally dumps the population down
[03:32:06.160 --> 03:32:10.320]  and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world
[03:32:10.320 --> 03:32:14.800]  we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[03:32:14.800 --> 03:32:18.000]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us
[03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:22.000]  getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:25.520]  nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[03:32:25.520 --> 03:32:29.200]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and
[03:32:29.200 --> 03:32:32.560]  secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine
[03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:36.080]  but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[03:32:36.080 --> 03:32:40.240]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine
[03:32:40.240 --> 03:32:46.560]  and vitamin c it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available
[03:32:46.560 --> 03:32:49.520]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[03:32:49.520 --> 03:32:52.960]  incredible discovery x3 now available at info wars
[03:32:52.960 --> 03:32:55.520]  live.com
[03:32:57.280 --> 03:33:05.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:08.080 --> 03:33:11.920]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[03:33:11.920 --> 03:33:15.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now
[03:33:15.840 --> 03:33:24.320]  your host paul joseph watson we're live and we are going to talk about sweden
[03:33:24.320 --> 03:33:27.120]  my favorite country which is often the butt of jokes
[03:33:27.120 --> 03:33:31.280]  and for very good reason and here's another one swedish headmaster wears
[03:33:31.280 --> 03:33:37.440]  dress to school to break norms stunning and brave a headmaster in
[03:33:37.440 --> 03:33:41.120]  sweden wears a dress and nail varnish to school in order to break norms and set
[03:33:41.120 --> 03:33:44.880]  an example for students i want to show the students
[03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:48.160]  that it's actually okay for a guy to wear a dress if he wants to
[03:33:48.160 --> 03:33:51.760]  the chances are that this isn't in a migrant heavy
[03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:56.080]  area in sweden of course in germany they've had a massive problem with
[03:33:56.080 --> 03:34:01.120]  bullying of both students and teachers in those areas in fact one case
[03:34:01.120 --> 03:34:05.760]  which springs to mind is when a blonde german girl went to school without a
[03:34:05.760 --> 03:34:09.040]  hijab in this migrant heavy school in germany
[03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:13.200]  and she was bullied she was beaten up she was victimized basically
[03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:16.320]  the parents went to the teacher in the school in germany
[03:34:16.320 --> 03:34:18.960]  and said what are you going to do about this she's getting bullied
[03:34:18.960 --> 03:34:23.840]  the answer from the headmaster was put her in a hijab
[03:34:23.840 --> 03:34:27.600]  we're talking about a blonde christian german girl
[03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:30.800]  the answer to being bullied and beaten up by muslim migrants is apparently to
[03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:35.600]  put her in a hijab and maybe this swedish headmaster would agree
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:38.800]  he says i think it's important to show the students you can look however you
[03:34:38.800 --> 03:34:41.760]  want he says it's nothing i do every day but i want to show that it's possible
[03:34:41.760 --> 03:34:44.320]  to break norms but basically he's been going to school in
[03:34:44.320 --> 03:34:47.360]  a dress and nail varnish for the past three years
[03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:51.680]  meanwhile the me too school lesson has been introduced for 15 year olds in
[03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:55.120]  sweden in order to take a stand against macho culture
[03:34:55.120 --> 03:34:59.840]  and sweden itself is taking a stand against macho macho culture
[03:34:59.840 --> 03:35:05.680]  by having men sterilize themselves swedish men seeking voluntary
[03:35:05.680 --> 03:35:12.480]  vasectomies has risen by 70 percent at 70 percent from 1400 men in 2013 to
[03:35:12.480 --> 03:35:16.640]  2417 2017 and cities like stock home the number of
[03:35:16.640 --> 03:35:20.640]  men sterilizing themselves has doubled over the last five years
[03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:23.600]  meanwhile the gang rapes are on the rise wonder why
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:27.920]  sweden's got a 1.78 birth rate well below the replacement rate for 2.2
[03:35:27.920 --> 03:35:31.280]  children this compares to over two children for women from
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:36.960]  women from migrant backgrounds so that's going on in sweden
[03:35:36.960 --> 03:35:40.400]  where they literally have um microphones in the streets to catch
[03:35:40.400 --> 03:35:44.560]  to catch the screams of women being raped but they won't build police stations
[03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:47.200]  in these areas because they get fire bombed and grenade
[03:35:47.200 --> 03:35:50.960]  attacked because diversity is our strength
[03:35:50.960 --> 03:35:54.960]  over in the uk head a headline at a bright part uk lawmakers call for
[03:35:54.960 --> 03:35:58.880]  Islamophobia to be officially classed as racism
[03:35:58.880 --> 03:36:01.920]  this is a report from a group of british parliamentarians who've demanded
[03:36:01.920 --> 03:36:05.760]  that Islamophobia be officially classed as a form of racism in the uk
[03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:09.040]  claiming countries deeply prejudiced and unfair towards muslims
[03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:12.560]  because apparently we've got this massive explosion of
[03:36:12.560 --> 03:36:18.880]  hate crime in the uk up 17 recently now if you actually look at what is being
[03:36:18.880 --> 03:36:23.520]  reported and investigated by thousands of police officers
[03:36:23.520 --> 03:36:27.440]  as to what is a hate crime it makes for very interesting reading
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:31.600]  now bear in mind that we've got stabbings at all time highs
[03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:35.680]  acid attacks at all time highs in some months london is more dangerous than
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:39.280]  new york per capita but no we've devoted thousands and
[03:36:39.280 --> 03:36:42.400]  thousands of police officers and resources to tackling
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:46.240]  mean tweets and mean comments on the street
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:49.760]  these were the hate crimes that were reported and investigated in the uk
[03:36:49.760 --> 03:36:54.160]  recently a dog pooping outside someone's house
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:58.400]  that's right a dog was investigated for a racist hate crime
[03:36:58.400 --> 03:37:01.840]  because it pooped outside someone's house it was non-white
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:05.280]  that's that's a legitimate news story that's not the onion
[03:37:05.280 --> 03:37:09.360]  a dog barking at someone that was reported and investigated as
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:14.000]  a potential racist hate crime because again they have to investigate it if
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:17.600]  the victim perceives that it's a hate crime
[03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:20.800]  so it's up to the victim if they perceive it as a hate crime they call the
[03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:24.960]  police the police are duty bound to investigate it
[03:37:24.960 --> 03:37:29.680]  there's no objective standard for what constitutes a hate crime if the victim
[03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:33.520]  says it's a hate crime it's a hate crime or at least potentially
[03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:37.440]  a bus driver's racist look a bus driver looked at someone in the wrong way
[03:37:37.440 --> 03:37:41.920]  they got offended that's a hate crime a dispute over a parking spot that was
[03:37:41.920 --> 03:37:46.160]  turned into a potential hate crime a traffic accident where the victim was
[03:37:46.160 --> 03:37:49.520]  non-white that was reported as a hate crime
[03:37:49.520 --> 03:37:55.200]  and someone losing a tennis match because they said the umpire was
[03:37:55.200 --> 03:37:58.720]  racist so is it any surprise that hate crime is up
[03:37:58.720 --> 03:38:02.560]  17 percent and more in the uk recently if
[03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:08.000]  such ridiculous instances are being reported and investigated as hate crimes
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:12.160]  but this new parliamentary report blames prevalent islamophobia
[03:38:12.160 --> 03:38:15.920]  for divisions hate crimes and even terror attacks that's right being mean to
[03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:20.240]  muslims causes terror attacks which ironically is in and of itself
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:24.480]  islamophobic because you're saying that muslims can't handle their feelings
[03:38:24.480 --> 03:38:27.120]  being hurt saying that they will react with violence
[03:38:27.120 --> 03:38:31.120]  if you hurt their feelings or offend them again the bigger tree of low
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:35.120]  expectations that in itself is islamophobic but they're saying that
[03:38:35.120 --> 03:38:39.520]  being mean to muslims or criticizing islam which is what this is all about
[03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:44.080]  is islamophobic it rejects concerns or claims
[03:38:44.080 --> 03:38:47.120]  criminalizing comments about islam will restrict free speech and calls for an
[03:38:47.120 --> 03:38:51.680]  official definition of islamophobia examples of islamophobia listed
[03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:55.120]  including claiming its terrorism to support an independent
[03:38:55.120 --> 03:38:58.400]  palestine calling Muhammad a pedophile which is a fact it's in the
[03:38:58.400 --> 03:39:03.200]  quran that they want to classify that as a hate crime telling the truth in fact
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:06.320]  i think it was a woman in demarc that recently got prosecuted for saying
[03:39:06.320 --> 03:39:09.600]  exactly that and claims of muslims spreading islam
[03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:13.120]  by the sword or subjugating minority groups under their rule
[03:39:13.120 --> 03:39:17.440]  which is exactly what they do with the rape gang so all these factual
[03:39:17.440 --> 03:39:21.520]  instances of actual things happening or things that are actually in the quran
[03:39:21.520 --> 03:39:24.080]  they're all going to be racist hate crimes they're all going to be banned
[03:39:24.080 --> 03:39:29.360]  which brings me to this islamic sexual abuse of Sikh children pushed to one
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:34.000]  side for years so again we talk about subjugating a minority of people
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:38.240]  a bombshell expose released november 26 revealed how gangs of predominantly
[03:39:38.240 --> 03:39:43.280]  Pakistani men remember 84 percent of rape gangs are
[03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:47.760]  made up of either Pakistanis or Bangladeshis in the UK
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:51.520]  Pakistani men have sexually preyed on Sikh girls in the UK for decades
[03:39:51.520 --> 03:39:54.960]  authorities recklessly ignored the abuse due to concerns over
[03:39:54.960 --> 03:39:59.600]  you guessed it political correctness so again when people say oh
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:02.560]  political correctness is just being nice to people
[03:40:02.560 --> 03:40:09.760]  no it's damaging and harmful rather than 1400 girls trafficked into sex slavery
[03:40:09.760 --> 03:40:12.800]  the perpetrators the gang rapists were not caught
[03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:16.480]  because of political correctness that came out in the report the police didn't
[03:40:16.480 --> 03:40:20.000]  want to investigate it because they didn't want to be seen as racist so
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:25.040]  political correctness does cause direct harm now this new study published by
[03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:28.960]  the Sikh meditation and rehabilitation team charity
[03:40:28.960 --> 03:40:33.040]  documented in shocking detail how young members of the Sikh community have
[03:40:33.040 --> 03:40:37.440]  been systematically groomed by muslim men since the 1960s
[03:40:37.440 --> 03:40:41.200]  girls would be lured by fashionably dressed adult Pakistani men
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:44.800]  traveling in flamboyant vehicles to predominantly Sikh dominated areas and
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:49.120]  schools after initial contact they'd be groomed by one man who would then pass
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:53.920]  the victim on to other family members so now this has come out this is a scandal
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:57.200]  that's been ignored for decades and decades
[03:40:57.200 --> 03:41:01.040]  but in parliament they're talking about banning criticism of Islam which is what
[03:41:01.040 --> 03:41:03.920]  it will turn out to be
[03:41:03.920 --> 03:41:08.480]  jailed grooming gang rapists given chance to see victims child by council
[03:41:08.480 --> 03:41:12.880]  yes it gets even worse i'll play this clip after the break
[03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:16.320]  but this is one of the actual victims speaking out on twitter about this
[03:41:16.320 --> 03:41:19.600]  but a jailed sex offender was given the chance to play a part in the future of
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:24.560]  the child of a woman he raped the man who was reportedly part of a
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:27.920]  grooming gang was contacted in jail by a council who gave him a chance to seek
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:32.000]  visits from the child this is out of the times of London
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  the newspaper did not name the local authority or the child's parents well
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:39.920]  the mother herself as you just saw there went on twitter and did name the local
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:43.520]  authority and guess who it was yes it was
[03:41:43.520 --> 03:41:47.200]  Rotherham again the same local authority that betrayed
[03:41:47.200 --> 03:41:52.720]  that ignored 1400 child victims for well over a decade in that part of the
[03:41:52.720 --> 03:41:56.640]  world as they tried to report the fact they were being groomed they were being
[03:41:56.640 --> 03:42:01.040]  abducted they were being raped in some instances they would literally
[03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:05.600]  the father of the child would go to the house where the victim was being raped
[03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:09.360]  call the police from the house the police would show up and arrest
[03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:13.040]  the father that's how endemic this corruption is in
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:16.960]  Rotherham which is not far from where i used to live in Sheffield
[03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:20.640]  it is understood a senior ministry of justice official met the mother last
[03:42:20.640 --> 03:42:22.960]  week and has promised to explore whether it was
[03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:27.360]  a case of an individual social worker making a mistake
[03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:31.120]  it's not a mistake it's endemic in that council
[03:42:31.120 --> 03:42:35.200]  has been for over a decade and they still haven't caught all the people
[03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:39.680]  who were involved in that horrific initial mass abduction
[03:42:39.680 --> 03:42:44.160]  and grooming of young girls typically young white girls in other areas exceed
[03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:47.200]  girls in those areas of the united kingdom but no it's
[03:42:47.200 --> 03:42:50.560]  those who need to be punished for our mean words on the internet we'll be back the

[03:48:38.880 --> 03:48:43.920]  now there's a video i posted on info wars.com this morning which was
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:48.480]  a migrant in germany joking about basically how there are
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:51.920]  no germans left in some german cities at least in the daytime
[03:48:51.920 --> 03:48:55.120]  because they're all at work let's go ahead and roll this video now i'll talk
[03:48:55.120 --> 03:48:57.440]  over it because obviously it's in german
[03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:01.360]  so it's introduced with this guy basically laughing his head off in a car
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:05.120]  he says an african asylum seeker a black guy is walking around the city of
[03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:09.440]  nuremberg he talks to the first person he sees and says thank you for taking me
[03:49:09.440 --> 03:49:13.360]  in that i may live here for giving me health
[03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:18.560]  insurance a place to live food to eat and everything else the person says
[03:49:18.560 --> 03:49:22.720]  i'm not german i'm albanian the african says oh excuse me
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:26.480]  he continues walking and speaks to the next person he says thank you
[03:49:26.480 --> 03:49:29.920]  i may live in germany thank you for everything you do for me
[03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:33.920]  the person says i'm not german i'm turkish the african says oh
[03:49:33.920 --> 03:49:38.160]  excuse me he continues walking and speaks to the next person he says thank you
[03:49:38.160 --> 03:49:41.920]  for allowing me to live in germany that he took me in as a refugee
[03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:46.000]  the person says i'm not german i'm arab the african asks
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:49.520]  where are all the germans the arab looks at his watch and says
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:56.320]  probably working so they're literally laughing you've seen the stories about
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:49:59.440]  the refugee centers in germany where they
[03:49:59.440 --> 03:50:03.120]  basically complain about the lack of food not the lack of food the quality of
[03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:06.960]  the food is not good enough and the lack of a wi-fi signal
[03:50:06.960 --> 03:50:10.480]  is the headline out of business insider the number of migrants claiming
[03:50:10.480 --> 03:50:14.080]  welfare benefits in germany exploded last year
[03:50:14.080 --> 03:50:18.800]  and this was in 2016 so it's way worse now the number of migrants claiming
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:23.120]  german welfare benefits saw by 169 percent last year
[03:50:23.120 --> 03:50:27.200]  typically in all these european countries in sweden for example
[03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:32.080]  the majority of welfare payments go to migrants and yet we still hear this
[03:50:32.080 --> 03:50:35.760]  lame inaccurate argument over and over again that we need to import vast
[03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:39.120]  numbers of people from africa from the middle east
[03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:43.760]  as a labor force because europeans ethnic europeans aren't having babies yet
[03:50:43.760 --> 03:50:48.000]  when we do import them they go straight on welfare make videos like that
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:52.400]  laughing about how what few germans there are out on the street in the daytime
[03:50:52.400 --> 03:50:56.560]  basically not even there they're all at work funding the lifestyle of
[03:50:56.560 --> 03:51:02.080]  newly arrived migrants who are laughing in their face about it
[03:51:02.080 --> 03:51:06.240]  related to that story right here men of migrant background her firecracker at
[03:51:06.240 --> 03:51:10.800]  hebrew speaking journal in berlin an israeli journalist later
[03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:14.000]  tweeted that she know cameraman had been called to police to give a statement
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:17.920]  although she refused to label the attack as anti-semitic so basically it was a
[03:51:17.920 --> 03:51:21.360]  news reporter on camera reporting from berlin these
[03:51:21.360 --> 03:51:23.840]  migrants come up behind her stop laughing at her stop
[03:51:23.840 --> 03:51:28.480]  harassing her she shows signs of disapproval and they respond by
[03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:31.680]  throwing a firecracker at her that's one of their favorite things to do we saw
[03:51:31.680 --> 03:51:34.560]  that during the mass rape of women in cologne on new
[03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:39.520]  years eve 2015 the left says oh are you afraid of fireworks
[03:51:39.520 --> 03:51:44.080]  well yeah if someone's throwing one at your face it's kind of an inconvenience
[03:51:44.080 --> 03:51:49.040]  Somali muslim arrested for attempting to mow down jews with car in front of la
[03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:51.520]  synagogue this was completely buried
[03:51:51.520 --> 03:51:54.640]  this happened a few days ago did you read about it in the news
[03:51:54.640 --> 03:52:00.320]  hardly any publications covered this los angeles police are investigating an
[03:52:00.320 --> 03:52:03.360]  incident friday night as a potential hate crime
[03:52:03.360 --> 03:52:07.040]  after Somali man 32 year old muhammad muhammad abdi
[03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:10.320]  while muhammad was not enough attempted to run down worshippers standing
[03:52:10.320 --> 03:52:15.280]  outside a handcuffed park synagogue according to witnesses abdi was yelling
[03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:21.040]  effing jews effing jews motive unknown abdi reportedly insulted another
[03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:24.000]  couple leaving the synagogue before getting into his car attempting to run
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:27.280]  over two men he later crashed into another car
[03:52:27.280 --> 03:52:32.240]  nearby which time he was arrested a quran was found on the dashboard of his
[03:52:32.240 --> 03:52:37.440]  car again motive unknown la pd announced muhammad muhammad abdi
[03:52:37.440 --> 03:52:40.080]  would charge with assault with a deadly weapon
[03:52:40.080 --> 03:52:44.880]  and with a hate crime specification so he was charged with the right charge but
[03:52:44.880 --> 03:52:49.680]  again he probably didn't see that story on cnn
[03:52:49.680 --> 03:52:53.680]  macron globalist poster boys polls plunged to historic low lapen
[03:52:53.680 --> 03:52:57.520]  now more popular of course over the weekend we had
[03:52:57.520 --> 03:53:02.800]  riots in paris and other major cities from people complaining about him
[03:53:02.800 --> 03:53:06.720]  raising the fuel tax to fight global warming they were all wearing their
[03:53:06.720 --> 03:53:10.160]  high-vis yellow jackets as a kind of inside joke
[03:53:10.160 --> 03:53:14.640]  because by law you have to have a high-vis yellow jacket in every single
[03:53:14.640 --> 03:53:18.640]  vehicle that's literally a law so they were out on the streets getting beaten
[03:53:18.640 --> 03:53:22.320]  and tear gassed because they're refusing to pay these taxes which
[03:53:22.320 --> 03:53:25.280]  Emmanuel Macron has instituted to fight global warming
[03:53:25.280 --> 03:53:31.680]  and now his approval is at the most unpopular french president in history
[03:53:31.680 --> 03:53:37.440]  at this stage of his presidential term he now registers a mere 26 approval
[03:53:37.440 --> 03:53:43.760]  according to figures by pollsters bva and in comparison to afd and other
[03:53:43.760 --> 03:53:47.680]  people like that he's he's not doing too well 26
[03:53:47.680 --> 03:53:51.760]  approval he was only elected just over a year ago
[03:53:51.760 --> 03:53:55.600]  people say trumps got bad approval figures you compare that to macron he's
[03:53:55.600 --> 03:54:00.560]  basically double absolutely incredible
[03:54:00.560 --> 03:54:04.160]  now back in america of course we have the situation at the border
[03:54:04.160 --> 03:54:08.720]  tear gas used once a month at border under obama how many celebrities did he
[03:54:08.720 --> 03:54:13.360]  tweeting their hysteria at that single use of tear gas
[03:54:13.360 --> 03:54:16.400]  over the weekend well it turns out the same tear gas
[03:54:16.400 --> 03:54:19.360]  agent that the trump administration is taking heat for deploying
[03:54:19.360 --> 03:54:23.760]  against a border mob is actually used fairly frequently including more than
[03:54:23.760 --> 03:54:27.920]  once a month during the latter years of president barack obama's administration
[03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:30.720]  another headline here says obama used tear gas at least
[03:54:30.720 --> 03:54:37.760]  80 times at the border between 2012 and 2017
[03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:42.320]  rt reports mostly men some not seeking asylum migrant caravan reporter appears
[03:54:42.320 --> 03:54:47.520]  to bust msn narrative an msnbc reporter and we have the clip here
[03:54:47.520 --> 03:54:51.360]  actually told the truth about the fact that these people are not seeking
[03:54:51.360 --> 03:54:55.440]  asylum the vast majority of of them are men who are seeking
[03:54:55.440 --> 03:54:59.680]  jobs who are seeking work in the united states illegally emigrating to try to
[03:54:59.680 --> 03:55:03.120]  get that work let's go to the clip this is the msnbc reporter
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:07.760]  actually telling the truth because some people look at these images and they
[03:55:07.760 --> 03:55:11.200]  listen to the president who says it's not women and children it's it's
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:14.960]  stone cold criminals so my first question is
[03:55:14.960 --> 03:55:19.200]  you're in that tent camp besides that family give us a profile
[03:55:19.200 --> 03:55:22.400]  of who is there mostly and what are they looking for
[03:55:22.400 --> 03:55:26.000]  because it seems as though to your point they don't actually have
[03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:30.400]  the necessary information so they know how to cross the border there could have
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:33.840]  people there could be people yesterday who were running because they thought it
[03:55:33.840 --> 03:55:36.720]  was their only chance
[03:55:36.720 --> 03:55:40.960]  right and it's very difficult because this has become such a polarizing
[03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:43.920]  issue if we kind of take a walk you'll be able to see for yourself
[03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:47.760]  again this is the inner sanctum of the shelter so
[03:55:47.760 --> 03:55:51.600]  you're gonna see a lot of families here a lot of women and children
[03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:55.840]  but the the truth is the majority of the people that are part of this caravan
[03:55:55.840 --> 03:55:58.720]  especially outside if we can make our way all the way over there
[03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:03.200]  will show you the majority of them are men so when this becomes a polarized
[03:56:03.200 --> 03:56:06.400]  political issue in the united states you have people on one side
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:10.480]  that point and say there are women and children here and that is true
[03:56:10.480 --> 03:56:14.720]  and then there are others who point and say these are men that are trying to
[03:56:14.720 --> 03:56:18.160]  cross the border and that's true too from what we've seen
[03:56:18.160 --> 03:56:21.520]  the majority are actually men and some of these men
[03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:25.920]  have not articulated that need for asylum instead they have talked about
[03:56:25.920 --> 03:56:30.240]  you know going to the united states for a better life and to find work
[03:56:30.240 --> 03:56:35.040]  so they have a broken clock is right twice a day isn't it an msnbc report
[03:56:35.040 --> 03:56:38.800]  to actually admit the truth that most of them are men most of them aren't seeking
[03:56:38.800 --> 03:56:41.440]  asylum they're seeking work and they're illegally
[03:56:41.440 --> 03:56:46.320]  emigrating to try to get those jobs meanwhile american mirror reports
[03:56:46.320 --> 03:56:50.480]  dem reps and un inspectors to us border democratic
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:54.320]  representative barbara lee wants the united nations to decide who should be
[03:56:54.320 --> 03:56:57.040]  allowed into the united states and whether or not america has the right to
[03:56:57.040 --> 03:57:01.440]  protect her borders she tweeted accusing border
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:05.840]  agents of violating human rights quote i've called the un inspectors on the
[03:57:05.840 --> 03:57:09.520]  border and i reiterate that call today of course
[03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:15.040]  oscozio cortez also compared the migrants to jewish refugees
[03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:19.360]  flat fleeing nazi germany absolutely absurd comparison
[03:57:19.360 --> 03:57:24.400]  but the un has absolutely no jurisdiction within the united states so they can
[03:57:24.400 --> 03:57:28.560]  basically go whistle there aren't going to be any un troops at the border the
[03:57:28.560 --> 03:57:31.840]  border patrol and the national guard can do the job
