[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.760 --> 00:35.200]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35.200 --> 00:42.520]  Oh yes, my friends, it is Monday, the 18th day of March, 2013, and we're going to be
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.760]  live here for the next three hours, Lord willing. Popping in the second half of the second hour
[00:48.760 --> 00:55.600]  is a pro-Second Amendment advocate, a lady, Juliana Crowder, who's gotten a lot of national
[00:55.600 --> 01:01.240]  attention, breaking the stereotype that it's only men that enjoy shooting and use firearms
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.440]  to protect themselves, and really the condescension that women can't become proficient with firearms.
[01:06.440 --> 01:11.300]  And I've found women on average, once you get them around firearms, are better shots
[01:11.300 --> 01:16.920]  than men, because they can calm down a little bit more when they pull the trigger. And that's
[01:16.920 --> 01:21.460]  oversimplification, but that's been shown in some of the Olympic shooting.
[01:21.460 --> 01:26.520]  Side issue, she'll be popping in, Gerald Cilente has accurately predicted that it would start
[01:26.520 --> 01:30.100]  with bank holidays in Europe and spread to the United States. He's been saying that for
[01:30.100 --> 01:35.760]  about five years, he's gonna come on, and let's punch up DrudgeReport.com for TV viewers.
[01:35.760 --> 01:42.080]  Radio listeners just go there, DrudgeReport.com. Cyprus shuts banks until Thursday. Now, we
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.680]  put an article up about this yesterday on Infowars.com, and we had people on there saying
[01:47.680 --> 01:51.280]  it wasn't true, even though I was linked to the BBC and Forbes.
[01:51.280 --> 01:57.640]  I mean, that just shows this culture of denial. How long did I tell you that the Justice Department
[01:57.640 --> 02:02.320]  would go after News Corps? And that that's why News Corps was suddenly worshipping the
[02:02.320 --> 02:07.880]  New World Order and loving socialism. Holder investigates Wall Street Journal. And again,
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.160]  I'm not saying News Corps is perfect, not by a long shot.
[02:12.160 --> 02:21.400]  But you can't have the devil investigating a scoundrel. A scoundrel is not the devil.
[02:21.400 --> 02:26.640]  The Justice Department is a devilish crew right now, no doubt about it, who stays fast
[02:26.640 --> 02:32.640]  and furious, who were obviously involved intimately in Oklahoma City back in 95. The very same
[02:32.640 --> 02:37.560]  crew who were deputies are now in charge there. It's really scary.
[02:37.560 --> 02:45.440]  And if they can bring down Rush Limbaugh and News Corps, then everybody else is on target.
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.040]  That's what the White House memos via Media Matters said two years ago. They said they're
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.640]  gonna bring down the alternative media. And what do they see that as?
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.200]  If you even pay lip service to the Bill of Rights and Constitution, or criticize Al Gore
[02:58.200 --> 03:04.400]  and anthropogenic global warming fake theories, you are the enemy. Because they can sweep
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.720]  them aside, they can sweep everybody aside. And they're running this hoax right now that
[03:09.720 --> 03:13.960]  it's a mandate for Obama and total socialism.
[03:13.960 --> 03:20.280]  Here's some of the other headlines, new EU bailout plans, steal bank accounts, island
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.080]  set to seize personal savings. They're already doing it, that's why it's closed till Thursday,
[03:24.080 --> 03:34.680]  they always do that. The agreement is to do it, and the Parliament of Cyprus would not
[03:34.680 --> 03:38.800]  vote quickly enough today.
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.840]  So they've just said they're going ahead with the plan basically. Plan moves ahead as vote
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.440]  delayed, see this link right there. Putin, unfair, dangerous, Financial Times, here comes
[03:48.440 --> 03:54.040]  the bank runs. Germany, not our idea, even though it was their idea. Will Italy follow?
[03:54.040 --> 04:02.940]  That's an Infowars.com article with top German bankers calling for a 15% seizure of after
[04:02.940 --> 04:05.760]  tax money out of your bank account.
[04:05.760 --> 04:14.360]  Continuing, markets rattled, Euro tumbles, Dow drops, live feeds of that. And then of
[04:14.360 --> 04:23.040]  course, it's already causing bank lines to form in other European countries, you can
[04:23.040 --> 04:30.280]  look that up. There were lines in places like Greece and Spain yesterday to get money out
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.720]  of ATMs.
[04:32.720 --> 04:36.960]  And this is done by design to rattle the markets. I'll explain all this when we come back. This
[04:36.960 --> 04:44.880]  is a big deal. And we're gonna open the phones up specifically for stockbrokers, investors
[04:44.880 --> 04:49.840]  who want to call in and talk about this issue of the global financial meltdown.
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.160]  I'm not gonna talk about how many Easter bunnies can dance on the head of a pin or anything
[04:55.160 --> 05:01.120]  like that. We're gonna talk about this big mega issue today.
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.120]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[05:05.120 --> 05:10.200]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[05:10.200 --> 05:15.360]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.560]  your loved ones becomes ill? Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you

[06:00.360 --> 06:05.320]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[06:05.320 --> 06:10.080]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[06:10.080 --> 06:14.320]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[06:14.320 --> 06:19.720]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[06:19.720 --> 06:24.800]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[06:24.800 --> 06:30.560]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[07:58.480 --> 08:09.480]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[08:09.480 --> 08:21.480]  I know you deceived me, now here's a surprise. I know that you have cause there's magic in
[08:21.480 --> 08:34.480]  my eyes. I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles.
[08:34.480 --> 08:47.120]  Yes, we can see for miles and miles and miles. Yes, we know about the little tricks they
[08:47.120 --> 08:52.040]  play and they do the same tricks over and over again to country after country. Sometimes
[08:52.040 --> 08:57.000]  two or three times the same country in one decade like what they do in Mexico.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.980]  I remember being a little kid and my dad explaining currency devaluations and why we could go
[09:02.980 --> 09:08.960]  to Mexico with a couple hundred dollars and stay a week in a very nice hotels and eat
[09:08.960 --> 09:16.920]  and rent a fishing boat. And it was because their government had devalued their money
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.880]  because short term it allowed the elites to rob their population.
[09:22.880 --> 09:33.880]  And he explained to me the Weimar Republic, the devaluation of the German Deutschmark
[09:33.880 --> 09:41.200]  ahead of the collapse of the Weimar Republic into Nazi fascism. And my dad explained to
[09:41.200 --> 09:48.320]  me how they'd done this in countless third world countries and how the insiders were
[09:48.320 --> 09:53.680]  able to maneuver economies and implode them to consolidate them.
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.800]  So I just grew up getting history lessons everywhere I went and I thought that was normal.
[09:59.800 --> 10:05.080]  I thought it was normal for your parents to teach you about basic economics. Nowadays,
[10:05.080 --> 10:12.760]  I talk to adults who have business degrees and who are worth, in some cases, billions
[10:12.760 --> 10:28.720]  of dollars. Billions of dollars and they are not even really aware of what's going on.
[10:28.720 --> 10:38.080]  Or now if they are, they just have had it so easy in America and things have been so
[10:38.080 --> 10:44.120]  stagnant in a good way for so long and they've been so insulated, they're not even aware
[10:44.120 --> 10:47.800]  of what's going on.
[10:47.800 --> 10:54.600]  Now those are self made people worth $500 million, a billion dollars, $2 billion. Those
[10:54.600 --> 11:03.040]  are self made people worth billions of dollars. When you look at the insider true elite class,
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.800]  they are fully aware of the scam. And I'll tell you why, because they have orchestrated
[11:08.800 --> 11:20.900]  it. So when I say that I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles, it's no sleight
[11:20.900 --> 11:21.900]  of hand.
[11:21.900 --> 11:28.040]  It's no special trick. It's like being able to get up in the morning and see sun coming
[11:28.040 --> 11:33.320]  through the blinds and to open the window and see the sun rising. But you've got to
[11:33.320 --> 11:37.320]  be able to open your eyes and you've got to be able to stand up and you've got to be able
[11:37.320 --> 11:46.360]  to know what a sun is. And that's an oversimplification, but that's the point we've reached.
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.800]  The head of the Dallas Federal Reserve, also the head of the Kansas City Federal Reserve,
[11:51.800 --> 11:56.280]  both amongst some of the most powerful after the New York Fed that really runs everything.
[11:56.280 --> 12:00.880]  That's where Geithner came from. But they represent some of the smaller shareholders
[12:00.880 --> 12:07.360]  groups involved in the private 1913 deal. Those private shares that are ultimately valuable
[12:07.360 --> 12:09.640]  in this fraudulent economic system.
[12:09.640 --> 12:14.320]  You've got the Dallas Fed saying we have crony capitalism, the entire economy. I have his
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.080]  quotes here. I'm gonna pull these out in a moment. It's in Reuters. That we're in a critical
[12:19.080 --> 12:24.200]  moment and the crony capitalists are imploding the economy to consolidate it at the expense
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.520]  of us all. Now, why would the head of the Dallas Fed, a big insider, as well as the
[12:29.520 --> 12:32.120]  Kansas City Fed, and they've been critical the last few years.
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.920]  Now they're downright panicking. Why would they be publicly panicking? Because they're
[12:37.920 --> 12:44.320]  not pure evil. They wanna have a future for their grandchildren. They don't wanna fully
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.120]  destroy America and kill the golden goose. I mean, even if you're not a moral person,
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.240]  even if you're not really a good guy and don't care about other people, there's a reason
[12:53.240 --> 12:55.600]  to have a civilization.
[12:55.600 --> 13:01.600]  Because then there'll be nothing to even prey on for most of the parasite class, if the
[13:01.600 --> 13:10.280]  ultra parasite class wrecks everything in a scorched earth takeover. So I'm gonna get
[13:10.280 --> 13:15.560]  to that article here today. I'm gonna go over some of these headlines here. But let me direct
[13:15.560 --> 13:21.420]  you to infowars.com. If you're a radio listener, if you're a TV listener, you can see it punched
[13:21.420 --> 13:23.480]  up right now live.
[13:23.480 --> 13:32.800]  Proposed Cypriot, that's Cyprus, bank deposit theft, good news for gold. Gold's way up.
[13:32.800 --> 13:41.200]  Banking chief calls for 15% looting of Italians' savings. That's a Paul Watson article linking
[13:41.200 --> 13:46.160]  to the open announcements in the German press. The rape of Cyprus by the European Union and
[13:46.160 --> 13:53.320]  the IMF, zero hedge. Cyprus government's great bank robbery, a private accounts may set off
[13:53.320 --> 13:54.920]  bank runs across Europe.
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.320]  Yeah, it's already happening. I've gone and looked at some Intel. They're talking about
[13:59.320 --> 14:02.920]  long lines and things, not just there but in other countries. And now they've closed
[14:02.920 --> 14:05.960]  it. First it was gonna be just Monday, then to Wednesday, now Thursday. It'll probably
[14:05.960 --> 14:13.520]  end up being closed for a week. And then once it opens, they'll take 10 to now 12%. They're
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.400]  now saying 12. After banks steal money from accounts in Cyprus, they will start doing
[14:18.400 --> 14:19.520]  it everywhere.
[14:19.520 --> 14:27.440]  Michael Snyder reports, absolutely, Michael. Russia sending warship fleet to Mediterranean,
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.120]  Russian naval base in Cyprus coming next. And yes, there's reports in MSNBC and other
[14:33.120 --> 14:40.920]  places. I forgot to print that or text it to you guys. Will you print me? Russia offers
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.400]  Cyprus aid.
[14:42.400 --> 14:46.000]  And what they're saying is they'll come in and bail them out and then prop them up. So
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.800]  it's kind of like one gangster's coming in and saying, look, we won't take your bank
[14:49.800 --> 14:55.520]  accounts, just let us have a naval base. And then we'll give you some deals on gas with
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.760]  gas prom as well, the big Russian owned, Russian government controlled gas giant that holds
[15:00.760 --> 15:04.320]  Italy by the short hairs as well.
[15:04.320 --> 15:08.760]  So all of this is going on. I mean, these are the times war start. You got fleets cruising
[15:08.760 --> 15:18.200]  around, you got right out in the open, pure gangsterism. And it is no special feat. It
[15:18.200 --> 15:24.720]  is no trick. People like Alex, how did you know they would start just seizing money directly
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.600]  out of bank accounts across the board?
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.200]  And there it is, this guy knows Cyprus bailout saving shift amid Russian offer. Will you
[15:34.200 --> 15:41.120]  print that for me? Thank you. So I can go into it in detail. I was out late last night.
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.400]  I rarely do that. So I didn't get much sleep last night. Very interesting business meeting
[15:45.400 --> 15:49.720]  last night. Not really business, but it was a lot of business was discussed. I learned
[15:49.720 --> 15:58.720]  quite a bit about certain sectors of the world last night.
[15:58.720 --> 16:04.840]  You know, I'm just absolutely committed to staying calm during all of this. But the IMF
[16:04.840 --> 16:14.800]  and the World Bank are the global virtual reality outfits or uniforms that the private
[16:14.800 --> 16:23.720]  six global mega banks where they are the holding companies and then subdirectors of that of
[16:23.720 --> 16:28.920]  the Federal Reserve here in the United States, the Bank of England in England, obviously.
[16:28.920 --> 16:33.760]  But they've done this over and over and over again. Joseph Stichlitz who left the World
[16:33.760 --> 16:41.960]  Bank as their chief economist in 2002. Thousands of pages of documents were leaked to Greg
[16:41.960 --> 16:46.040]  Pallas. It was at the BBC. By the way, you guys get Greg Pallas the next few days. I
[16:46.040 --> 16:48.360]  meant to tell you, let's get Greg Pallas on.
[16:48.360 --> 16:52.360]  And Greg released a bunch of the documents. Then the British government started declaring
[16:52.360 --> 16:57.840]  national security and threatening denotuses. That's where they can shut down any press
[16:57.840 --> 17:08.360]  report that they don't want out. And they didn't release but a few hundred pages of
[17:08.360 --> 17:14.160]  them. And in those, it talked about the 112 point plan where the IMF and World Bank go
[17:14.160 --> 17:19.760]  into third world countries, buy off the leadership, have them shine on to globalist private debts,
[17:19.760 --> 17:26.680]  corrupt the country. And then a nation like Nigeria can get a billion dollar loan in 1979.
[17:26.680 --> 17:33.580]  And now they've paid back something like 90 billion on a billion dollars. And it's impossible
[17:33.580 --> 17:34.580]  to ever pay it back.
[17:34.580 --> 17:39.760]  And then finally you hear, well, now you owe another 100 billion on the 90 billion that
[17:39.760 --> 17:46.400]  you've already paid us off 1 billion. So we're gonna have debt forgiveness and the media
[17:46.400 --> 17:53.240]  is all, how nice. Lord Rothschild called for it or Bill Gates called for it or Davos called
[17:53.240 --> 17:54.240]  for it.
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.480]  They go, that's right, all your water, all your roads, your infrastructure, turn it over
[17:58.480 --> 18:05.080]  to us and we'll forgive your debt. And we're like, we gave it to them for free. They get
[18:05.080 --> 18:10.560]  everything, you pay hundreds of percentage points in interest in the aggregate, in the
[18:10.560 --> 18:19.480]  compounding interest and they call it a moratorium.
[18:19.480 --> 18:27.940]  What's the biblical term when you forgive a debt? It'll pop my mind in a moment, biblical
[18:27.940 --> 18:37.840]  term for the Jubilee. Yes, yes, we're giving you a Jubilee. We loaned you, in one case
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.200]  it was a billion dollar and with Brazil it was like 10 billion or something loaned him
[18:42.200 --> 18:43.200]  in the 80s.
[18:43.200 --> 18:47.440]  And then they paid back like 70 something billion and then finally refused to say we're
[18:47.440 --> 18:51.680]  not paying anymore, you've been paid. And then finally they've had a better economy
[18:51.680 --> 18:57.920]  since they did that. This is debt bondage. This is how this runs. This is why Mexico
[18:57.920 --> 19:03.200]  is so enslaved. It's why they always devalue their peso as a weapon against their peasants,
[19:03.200 --> 19:08.040]  as a weapon against their middle class. And it's the same weapon here.
[19:08.040 --> 19:12.640]  Mexico has more billionaires per capita for 120 million citizens, look it up, than any
[19:12.640 --> 19:19.340]  other country in the world. I mean, their nouveau riche elite live on 100,000 acre ranches
[19:19.340 --> 19:28.480]  and palaces. With jet copters and homes in Switzerland. And they have one of the poorest
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.600]  populations in the world by design. It's not like that's an accident there. And they're
[19:33.600 --> 19:38.240]  going to take our bank accounts here too. That's all been announced. That's what Homeland
[19:38.240 --> 19:39.240]  Security is for.
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.960]  That's what the drones and checkpoints and US intelligence agencies look at every American's
[19:43.960 --> 19:49.840]  bank account, Reuters. Flaunting it in your face. And those of us that criticize the New
[19:49.840 --> 19:54.440]  World Order, we're listed as terrorists by the Southern Poverty Law Center who then advises
[19:54.440 --> 19:58.860]  the police. We're going to break down what this takeover means and how we can stop it
[20:55.280 --> 21:01.560]  Gusset.com to get only the best all American jeans.

[22:29.440 --> 22:33.240]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[22:33.240 --> 22:37.480]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[22:37.480 --> 22:41.600]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[22:41.600 --> 22:45.520]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[22:45.520 --> 22:46.520]  army.

[23:54.920 --> 24:21.120]  choice is clear. Be unprepared or BePrepared.com. Last week, Bebe Grillo warns that Italy will
[24:21.120 --> 24:26.800]  be dropped like a hot potato and that Mario Monte, who was installed by the IMF and World
[24:26.800 --> 24:34.440]  Bank and the EU, was a bankruptcy receiver to implode the country. And he has been proven
[24:34.440 --> 24:42.480]  correct on that front. Here are the headlines up at Infowars.com. Banking chief calls for
[24:42.480 --> 24:49.800]  15% looting of Italian savings. And the United States per capita has, by some estimates,
[24:49.800 --> 24:55.560]  more public debt and more debt we've signed on to that's the banker's debt. Most of this
[24:55.560 --> 25:00.920]  is not our debt that even Italy does and Italy's about as bad as it gets with their big socialist
[25:00.920 --> 25:06.960]  welfare state. And again, they get you into that position and deindustrialize your country
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.320]  so that you don't have a choice.
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.160]  So that you don't have jobs, you don't have a way to work, you don't have an economy.
[25:15.160 --> 25:20.440]  So you basically have to go get government food stamps. You have to be on a government
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.900]  card. You have to be on government disability. And then once they have enough people working
[25:24.900 --> 25:29.920]  for corporations, they get government contracts and bailouts, or on welfare, or in the criminal
[25:29.920 --> 25:36.440]  justice system, or in the psychiatric system, it's game over. This is how they enslave people.
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.120]  And now because of manufacturing and robotics, they can have big giant factories manufacture
[25:41.120 --> 25:46.600]  baubles to basically buy off the population for the new status symbols and people will
[25:46.600 --> 25:48.200]  sell their souls.
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.240]  People will sell their souls for a fake idea. They'll go pay $8,000, $10,000 to attend a
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.440]  TED conference and then stay in a dormitory like a cult member to make hundreds of millions
[25:59.440 --> 26:05.600]  of dollars for TED, the conference, so they can then push globalism on people and imply
[26:05.600 --> 26:11.320]  that all the cutting edge stuff they talk about is part of the ideology when all they're
[26:11.320 --> 26:17.680]  doing is using all the interesting people they have at the TED conference to draw people
[26:17.680 --> 26:25.040]  in and then force feed the globalist, collectivist, neoliberal system into them.
[26:25.040 --> 26:27.400]  And you ask, what does it have to do with any of this? I was listening to talk radio
[26:27.400 --> 26:31.760]  this morning and they had caller after caller this new study the RNC did about how they've
[26:31.760 --> 26:36.120]  got to get with the times or they're over. And it was Democrats calling and celebrating
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.120]  going I'm a white man, but let me tell you the age of the white people's over.
[26:41.120 --> 26:46.400]  The Democrats are inclusive, we're winning and would start laughing and then the hosts
[26:46.400 --> 26:55.060]  were all, my gosh, what are we gonna do? Like buying into it. And the Bill of Rights Constitution
[26:55.060 --> 27:00.260]  private property not having foreign banks running you has nothing to do with white men.
[27:00.260 --> 27:05.280]  But they put it out like, the age of the white man's over. You hear that all over the news
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.640]  and it's like, I love Obama, I'm white, and I joined the winning team or I'm Hispanic.
[27:10.640 --> 27:14.720]  And meanwhile, he's doubling your insurance premiums, bankrupting everything for foreign
[27:14.720 --> 27:19.660]  mega banks, carpet bombing all over the world, drone attacks.
[27:19.660 --> 27:28.880]  But it's like this projection, I'm part of the winning team. And you'll talk to people
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.760]  that have Barack Obama bumper stickers. I do it, gas station stuff, you can walk over
[27:32.760 --> 27:37.720]  and I'll go, hey, so Obama won and they'll go, that's right. And I'll go, so tell me
[27:37.720 --> 27:40.000]  what you feel about it, I'm just feeling really good.
[27:40.000 --> 27:46.560]  Well, what's the Democratic Party do? Well, the age of the white man's over. That's what
[27:46.560 --> 27:51.280]  these callers were saying, these were white people cuz the hosts were asking them. And
[27:51.280 --> 28:02.320]  it was just bizarre, we're part of the winning liberal club. And it's like we're now in the,
[28:02.320 --> 28:04.560]  what would you call it, country club.
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.880]  It's like people have their elitist country clubs. And they go to those and they just
[28:09.880 --> 28:17.480]  sit around the country club in the lounge area by the restaurant. And they just sit
[28:17.480 --> 28:24.560]  there all day at a table, just with their chins up and their noses up. I finally arrived
[28:24.560 --> 28:31.280]  and they snobbishly talk about how much money each person has that walks into the country
[28:31.280 --> 28:32.280]  club.
[28:32.280 --> 28:39.940]  I know, I've been in plenty of them growing up, visiting friends and family. And that's
[28:39.940 --> 28:44.440]  the same thing, the media says, you're a part of Ted, you're a winner, you're a part of
[28:44.440 --> 28:49.160]  the Democratic Party. Why, you're white, but you've denounced it and have ushered in. And
[28:49.160 --> 28:52.920]  then you're like, yes, whites are evil, I'll do whatever Obama says.
[28:52.920 --> 28:58.400]  Which is massive tax increases on the poor, tax exemption for the ultra rich, eugenics
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.800]  based health care, totally open borders, draconian destruction of the Bill of Rights, warrantless
[29:03.800 --> 29:10.360]  wiretapping, torture, black sites, secret arrest, forced abortions worldwide, forced
[29:10.360 --> 29:18.000]  GMO, no labeling of aspartame, arresting people for marijuana, TSA checkpoints on the highways,
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.460]  just abject tyranny.
[29:19.460 --> 29:26.640]  But you know what, I'm feeling good, the media told me I'm winning. And it was just like
[29:26.640 --> 29:30.480]  Republicans did when Bush was in there like, I don't care what he does, I don't care if
[29:30.480 --> 29:35.460]  he tortures people, I don't care if he did. You know what, we're winners, we're Republicans
[29:35.460 --> 29:41.040]  and you stupid liberals have lost, aha, aha, it's like childlike. I'm gonna give the number
[29:41.040 --> 29:44.880]  out and take some calls when we come back on the economic issue and I'm gonna drill
[29:44.880 --> 29:49.440]  into it in depth and tell you what's coming next, stay with us.
[29:49.440 --> 30:00.200]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.200 --> 30:05.440]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers, a prognosis for the entire planetary
[30:05.440 --> 30:11.120]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[30:11.120 --> 30:15.240]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[32:59.040 --> 33:23.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.120 --> 33:29.000]  So I specifically want to hear from stockbrokers, investors, people that own gold. What's your
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.960]  view on what's happening with the economy? People always ask me, Alex, why do you want
[33:32.960 --> 33:37.440]  to own gold and silver? I don't know, I started buying silver when it was $4, $5 an ounce.
[33:37.440 --> 33:43.480]  It went up to almost 50, went down to 30 something, never sold any of it because it's my emergency
[33:43.480 --> 33:44.480]  backup.
[33:44.480 --> 33:48.640]  I don't have that much of it. I don't have that much savings period. I put almost all
[33:48.640 --> 33:54.040]  the money I make back into this Infowars operation to resist the globalists because there's no
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.280]  future if we don't beat them. My investment isn't defeating the new world order. That's
[33:59.280 --> 34:01.920]  what I'm really going after.
[34:01.920 --> 34:09.160]  But I do have gold and silver. I bought firearms. I bought a Barrett 50 caliber rifle many years
[34:09.160 --> 34:16.120]  ago that went from like $3,000 to $20,000 today. Last year, I said I better buy another
[34:16.120 --> 34:23.680]  one. It was $5,000, it's now $25,000. I've told people invest in guns, invest in gold
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.680]  and silver, invest in real estate in the right area.
[34:27.680 --> 34:36.480]  Invest in farmland that is profitable. That's what I've been telling people for 17 years
[34:36.480 --> 34:41.040]  on air. And it's not because I'm some genius. It's because I studied what the globalists
[34:41.040 --> 34:46.320]  are actually doing. While bad mouthing owning farmland, while bad mouthing owning gold and
[34:46.320 --> 34:51.720]  silver, while bad mouthing having storeable foods, while bad mouthing owning guns, that's
[34:51.720 --> 34:55.440]  what they own.
[34:55.440 --> 34:59.820]  That's what they're into. That's what they do. I talked to a major defense contractor
[34:59.820 --> 35:05.280]  who was leaving the US five years ago. I've told the story many times. And the person
[35:05.280 --> 35:08.380]  was telling me this and I'm talking to him and I'll go back and search engine them later
[35:08.380 --> 35:10.500]  and it's them.
[35:10.500 --> 35:14.680]  And they said, I think you're gonna be getting real big. You're gonna be getting real popular
[35:14.680 --> 35:23.840]  if you stay alive. And I said, why? And they said, you're dead on, dead on, dead on. Dead
[35:23.840 --> 35:30.520]  on, dead on. And this person was worth $3.5 billion the time I looked him up.
[35:30.520 --> 35:39.800]  And my point is, the power structure is sitting here telling you, don't do all these things.
[35:39.800 --> 35:43.720]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL are putting out reports saying there is no
[35:43.720 --> 35:48.640]  world government. There is no New World Order. There is no bank run coming. There is no global
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.360]  devaluation. There is no 2 billion bullets. There are no armored vehicles. There are no
[35:53.360 --> 35:57.880]  checkpoints even though they're all over the local news.
[35:57.880 --> 36:03.160]  And they're doing this because they cannot have a public debate about it until they finally
[36:03.160 --> 36:08.380]  have a trigger event to blame the financial collapse on. And I've said that's probably
[36:08.380 --> 36:14.040]  in my gut would be something like a low yield nuke going off in Chicago.
[36:14.040 --> 36:20.440]  And people ask, why do you say Chicago? Chicago, Dallas, Cleveland, because the CFR likes to
[36:20.440 --> 36:27.240]  brag and they've said in three different reports, Dallas, Cleveland, Chicago, and Denver. They've
[36:27.240 --> 36:30.920]  also said Denver. And they just keep saying that and then they over the weekend they had
[36:30.920 --> 36:36.680]  a radiation alert on the subway trains in Illinois and freaked out, had another one
[36:36.680 --> 36:41.040]  in another place and helicopters flying around.
[36:41.040 --> 36:45.160]  And I've seen it movies and film and they just always tell you what they're gonna do
[36:45.160 --> 36:49.200]  before they do it. And there's about 100 other points that go into that conservatively, but
[36:49.200 --> 36:56.840]  they don't care if I get up here and say they're gonna nuke Chicago. They'll just say, he didn't
[36:56.840 --> 36:58.340]  really say that.
[36:58.340 --> 37:06.400]  He said that after the fact on video and said that it was a, you know, said in 2013. But
[37:06.400 --> 37:11.440]  it was, he didn't really say that. And you'll be like, well, I heard him say it. No, look,
[37:11.440 --> 37:22.120]  this YouTube is from the time. That's a fake timestamp. He didn't predict 9-11. He didn't
[37:22.120 --> 37:34.040]  say they'll blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on bin Laden on July 25th, 2001.
[37:34.040 --> 37:44.040]  Full free number to join us because I want your take on all of this 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.680]  First time callers, I wanna get your financial, your take on what's happening.
[37:48.680 --> 37:55.280]  Now the reason I get into gold and silver, and I guess I should plug my resources here,
[37:55.280 --> 37:59.200]  is because they're the trusted name who I've been buying from and working with 16 years
[37:59.200 --> 38:05.080]  now is because people say, well, they could confiscate your gold and silver. Yeah, they
[38:05.080 --> 38:07.000]  could come try to take my kids too.
[38:07.000 --> 38:14.840]  I mean, I still had three children. I'd have more if I could talk my wife into it. But
[38:14.840 --> 38:21.640]  the issue here is that it's harder for them to come take gold and silver. It's harder
[38:21.640 --> 38:29.060]  for them than it is to just take it out of your bank account. But I always love the defeatist
[38:29.060 --> 38:35.720]  attitude. And it's because of the defeatist attitude that the globalist have announced
[38:35.720 --> 38:39.780]  first 10, now 12% of the bank accounts.
[38:39.780 --> 38:43.920]  And even though the Parliament of Cyprus won't vote to do it, they're moving ahead with the
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.180]  plan Reuters is reporting. And now they're saying, don't worry, if you don't have a lot
[38:49.180 --> 38:55.520]  of money in the bank, less than 10,000 euros, we'll only take 7% now. Isn't that nice of
[38:55.520 --> 39:00.360]  them? See, first, we're gonna take 10, take 12, only 7, that's reasonable and they're
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.920]  calling it a tax.
[39:02.920 --> 39:09.800]  Just like forcing you to buy Obamacare doubles the rate the first year, it's set to triple
[39:09.800 --> 39:15.760]  it by 2015. That's the insurance consortium of lobbyists to put that out. It's now doubling
[39:15.760 --> 39:20.720]  in 2013, as we told you three years ago would do, that's what their own Congressional Budget
[39:20.720 --> 39:22.240]  Office predicted.
[39:22.240 --> 39:25.280]  Because they can make you buy it now and you're like, but it's gonna kill businesses. It's
[39:25.280 --> 39:31.480]  gonna make people lay everybody off and make everybody go part time so they're exempt.
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.200]  That's part of the plan. And then when you can't pay your bills cuz you're part time,
[39:35.200 --> 39:38.240]  you're gonna go on the digital welfare card.
[39:38.240 --> 39:43.000]  And now they're gonna say you're off your welfare card if you don't take all the shots.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.480]  And then you're gonna wonder why your kid dies when they're 12, after they've had 300,
[39:47.480 --> 39:51.440]  400 shots. That's what it is now, they try to give you 20, 30 shots a year. The average
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.640]  shot has three different things in it. It's in the hundreds of shots now.
[39:55.640 --> 40:00.000]  The kids are walking dead, I can see death in their faces. I can hardly go to a restaurant
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  now. You'll see some beautiful woman with her husband and these children, and you can
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.480]  look into their faces and see the death on them. You can see the shadows. You can see
[40:10.480 --> 40:13.320]  it in their bone structure, you can see the coloration.
[40:13.320 --> 40:19.080]  You can see where their connective tissues leaning in on their bone structure. I can
[40:19.080 --> 40:22.960]  see the death in their little twinkly eyes, and I'm supposed to like that. Well, you know
[40:22.960 --> 40:28.480]  what, I don't like it. I don't like watching their little twinkly eyes twinkle that much
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.000]  brighter cuz they're being killed.
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.080]  The eyes twinkle the closer you get to death, did you know that? Even if you've been dumbed
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.360]  down and have a glaze over your eyes and you've been dying a long time. You ever been around
[40:44.360 --> 40:48.560]  somebody a day before they die? You ever been there right when they die? You ever looked
[40:48.560 --> 40:55.040]  into their eyes, the fire, the fire, the fire of intellect, the fire of the spirit, the
[40:55.040 --> 40:58.780]  fire of a body that had a mission and was meant to do things.
[40:58.780 --> 41:04.520]  The fire of the ancestral memory of what we are and all that we've been through together,
[41:04.520 --> 41:08.720]  allowing ourselves to be captured by a bunch of insane scientists playing games with us
[41:08.720 --> 41:17.460]  like we're animals. 800-25-99231, first time callers on financial issues. So they've got
[41:17.460 --> 41:24.480]  a bank holiday. It's a holiday, yeah. To quote Gerald Cilente, it's one of those holidays.
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.400]  New freedom initiative to force drug half the kids in America. It's a new freedom. The
[41:28.400 --> 41:32.120]  Patriot Act to secretly arrest you and break in your house without warrants. And if you
[41:32.120 --> 41:36.460]  catch them and you speak out ten years in prison, arresting members of the press that
[41:36.460 --> 41:37.780]  expose corruption.
[41:37.780 --> 41:45.620]  It's a holiday. Yeah, I wanna go on a holiday. Wanna dance a little bit, a little rockabilly
[41:45.620 --> 41:53.140]  dance there. It's a holiday, like Frank Sinatra would say. Sounds like a great holiday to
[41:53.140 --> 42:00.300]  me. You go on a holiday, and let's say you've shaved up 200, 300,000 euros for retirement.
[42:00.300 --> 42:06.980]  Everybody retirees, cops, fire department, all you people that serve the system, bureaucrats,
[42:06.980 --> 42:08.980]  all of you.
[42:08.980 --> 42:15.500]  You can't get any money out of the bank. Notice they waited till Friday when the automatic
[42:15.500 --> 42:19.340]  transfers went in. They've got regulations in Europe where they basically force you to
[42:19.340 --> 42:24.100]  do that. They're trying that here. It's the automatic cash transfer. Your check goes in
[42:24.100 --> 42:25.100]  and you go to get it.
[42:25.100 --> 42:28.740]  They're like, sorry, yeah, the bank's closed on Saturday and Sunday. They have some that
[42:28.740 --> 42:33.600]  are open on Sunday in Cyprus. Sorry, it's closed. Sorry, you can't get any money out.
[42:33.600 --> 42:40.180]  You can get 50 euros out of the ATM. It's run out of money. It's a holiday. Everybody
[42:40.180 --> 42:45.920]  wants to go on a holiday. Gee, I wish we get one of those holidays around here. And
[42:45.920 --> 42:48.900]  don't worry, you'll get your holiday.
[42:48.900 --> 42:53.780]  You'll get your holiday. And I love how they got paid trolls on infoawars.com in these
[42:53.780 --> 42:58.660]  articles saying this isn't happening. And we can track the IP addresses. They are bots,
[42:58.660 --> 43:02.940]  most of them. Some of them appear to be humans, but they go back to Defense Department computers
[43:02.940 --> 43:03.940]  and others.
[43:03.940 --> 43:09.580]  They don't even hide it now that 73% of Obama's Twitters are fake and Department of Defense
[43:09.580 --> 43:13.980]  run and Media Matters is Department of Defense, basically. All of this, it's just funny to
[43:13.980 --> 43:17.820]  them. And you know what? You're gonna get your bank account taken too. But you don't
[43:17.820 --> 43:18.820]  care.
[43:18.820 --> 43:25.260]  Your kid's gonna die of cancer too. You don't care. It's a holiday. There's no drones. Everybody
[43:25.260 --> 43:31.540]  knows Mad Dog Ben Richards is the brutal murderer at Bakersfield and committed murder there
[43:31.540 --> 43:35.580]  and the government stopped him. And now he's gonna be paying for it on the running man.
[43:35.580 --> 43:40.220]  I mean, you saw the TV, Mad Dog Ben Richards, he did it. And who loves you and who do you
[43:40.220 --> 43:49.340]  love? The running man, the number one television show in the whole wide world.
[43:49.340 --> 43:55.020]  So I would give Midas Resources a call and I would take advantage of only one order per
[43:55.020 --> 44:00.760]  person for two turn to the last century 100 year old silver dollars with an Obama deception
[44:00.760 --> 44:05.820]  and an animated film that's high quality. I mean, it's like Hollywood quality. American
[44:05.820 --> 44:12.700]  Dream, that's a $40 free gift and each film 20 bucks. And then a $20 book, dishonest money,
[44:12.700 --> 44:17.580]  a book and two films and free shipping, that's usually $10.
[44:17.580 --> 44:26.120]  So that's 60, 70. That's $70 free, $72 shipping included for two silver dollars at cost as
[44:26.120 --> 44:33.780]  a loss leader to get you introduced to it. 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, our great sponsor
[44:33.780 --> 44:38.860]  that helps us get the word out. And of course, the brokers will be happy to send you 10 reasons
[44:38.860 --> 44:41.160]  to own gold, the free booklet as well.
[44:41.160 --> 44:44.420]  And while you're there, ask them about some of the day's gold and silver specials from
[44:44.420 --> 44:48.180]  junk silver right on up to bullion, right on up to collectibles. And they've got the
[44:48.180 --> 44:52.140]  best deals on collectibles as well. Ask them about it all, Canadian maple leafs, British
[44:52.140 --> 45:02.380]  sovereigns, all of it. 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237. You know what, I'll go to your
[45:02.380 --> 45:05.740]  calls right now, and then I'm gonna drill into this economic news and write down what
[45:05.740 --> 45:06.740]  it means.
[45:06.740 --> 45:13.420]  But bottom line, it's this, if you grovel to the power structure, if you just accept
[45:13.420 --> 45:16.920]  anything they want, if you think that's what gets you ahead in life, people think it's
[45:16.920 --> 45:22.460]  a virtue to be stupid, a virtue to be ill-informed, a virtue to not care, a virtue to laugh at
[45:22.460 --> 45:28.580]  tyranny as you live on the fumes of liberty that our ancestors viciously fought and killed
[45:28.580 --> 45:29.580]  for.
[45:29.580 --> 45:35.460]  Our ancestors killed a lot of people. I mean, the biggest military the world had ever seen
[45:35.460 --> 45:40.900]  that had beaten the Dutch and the French and the Spanish and the Portuguese who had empires
[45:40.900 --> 45:46.940]  all over the world. And who had beaten the Russians and everybody else, our ancestors
[45:46.940 --> 45:50.900]  beat them and beat everybody else to have a little bit of liberty.
[45:50.900 --> 45:59.700]  And they were such vicious animals, philosopher kings, that they built a civilization where
[45:59.700 --> 46:03.700]  4% of the world's population had over half the wealth. And it actually went to a middle
[46:03.700 --> 46:09.920]  class which others could then enjoy from around the world, so everybody wanted to get here.
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.380]  And now, folks, we've been taught lay down, be cowardly, grovel. I mean, I go to places
[46:14.380 --> 46:18.460]  and I look at the average men. And I used to get threatened at a subconscious level
[46:18.460 --> 46:24.020]  by guys with tattoos and big arms and trying to act tough and acting, you know what, now
[46:24.020 --> 46:25.900]  I admire those guys.
[46:25.900 --> 46:30.940]  At least they're trying to be manly. At least they understand it's important to be an alpha
[46:30.940 --> 46:36.660]  male. Guys think, you think you're really tough, you're trying to act tough. And then
[46:36.660 --> 46:40.260]  I would sit there and think about, well, I got in a fight with them, this would happen.
[46:40.260 --> 46:43.620]  Because I'm primitive as well. Now I realize at least they're trying to be men, and they're
[46:43.620 --> 46:48.700]  bucking the whole system. So I salute you on your Harleys. I salute you. I salute you
[46:48.700 --> 46:49.700]  in your street fighting.
[46:49.700 --> 46:55.580]  I salute the UFC. I salute it. Because at least a lot of it's corrupt and bad, but it's
[46:55.580 --> 47:01.460]  better than what we've got. This nanny state of toddling men walking around with a spirit
[47:01.460 --> 47:05.980]  of weakness in them. I mean, I go and I look at people and they just wanna be overrun.
[47:05.980 --> 47:10.740]  They wanna be enslaved. They just, they love it. They love their wife bossing them around.
[47:10.740 --> 47:15.180]  They love walking behind their wife or girlfriend. They love groveling to the police. They love
[47:15.180 --> 47:19.160]  groveling to bureaucrats. And let me tell you, when you act like that, it's like going
[47:19.160 --> 47:24.460]  off the coast of San Diego for a month and dumping rotten fish heads and blood and rotten
[47:24.460 --> 47:25.980]  pig parts into the water.
[47:25.980 --> 47:32.900]  What do you think's gonna happen? A big giant great white shark's gonna show up. And it's
[47:32.900 --> 47:40.100]  gonna attack. It's like swimming in bloody water in the North Atlantic or in the South
[47:40.100 --> 47:45.240]  Pacific hammerheads. Tiger sharks are gonna come. You're begging for a Mako to come and
[47:45.240 --> 47:46.240]  bite your leg off.
[47:46.240 --> 47:51.360]  I mean, you are begging. Listen, I know you've been taught going along gets you places. That
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.980]  was in the early takeover phase. That will not get you anywhere now. All you mercenaries
[47:55.980 --> 48:01.660]  that sold out and bought into the idea of this new world order. All right, let's go
[48:01.660 --> 48:06.420]  to phone calls. I'm out of control. Frank in Canada, he wants to talk about retirement
[48:06.420 --> 48:07.420]  funds.
[48:07.420 --> 48:11.180]  Yeah, I haven't gotten to that yet. Yeah, they've changed rules worldwide, laws to start
[48:11.180 --> 48:15.020]  taking your retirement funds. Congress has been having hearings on that. Canada has been
[48:15.020 --> 48:19.100]  talking about it. But I mean, hey, what's wrong with foreign banks taking your retirement
[48:19.100 --> 48:24.420]  fund 10, 20% and then more later and giving it to themselves so they can have some of
[48:24.420 --> 48:28.540]  these bankers have yachts the size of World War II battleships, literally.
[48:28.540 --> 48:32.140]  I mean, what's wrong with that? I mean, that's liberal. You're not an extremist, are you?
[48:32.140 --> 48:35.620]  The Southern Poverty Law Center says if you criticize that, you're a terrorist. You're
[48:35.620 --> 48:39.300]  not a you're not a terror. You're not one of those evil white males, are you, Frank?
[48:39.300 --> 48:42.940]  Oh, no. Goodness forbid that I would be. But, you know, you hit the nail on the head today
[48:42.940 --> 48:47.260]  with what you're saying a bravo for it. I mean, this is a classic divide and conquer
[48:47.260 --> 48:51.860]  strategy that notice how they do this in smaller countries first, like Cyprus and Greece kind
[48:51.860 --> 48:53.700]  of field testing here in Canada.
[48:53.700 --> 48:58.700]  I mean, we have a very similar program to what's in the US with our 401ks and IRAs and
[48:58.700 --> 49:03.180]  so forth. There's already the discussion that, you know, small segment of people have been
[49:03.180 --> 49:08.500]  saving diligently, putting money away. But maybe just maybe we should be looking at smoothing
[49:08.500 --> 49:13.940]  out the risk, going to more of a public system. What does that mean? Well, all of a sudden
[49:13.940 --> 49:17.460]  you got a whole bunch of people that didn't contribute because, A, they didn't even have
[49:17.460 --> 49:22.660]  the jobs to do it or were taxed to hire for whatever reason. And B, all of a sudden the
[49:22.660 --> 49:26.700]  people that did save, if their money is taking for them, who's going to complain because
[49:26.700 --> 49:28.220]  they're smoothing it out?
[49:28.220 --> 49:30.580]  And that's how they begin. And people got to get this idea.
[49:30.580 --> 49:36.660]  Oh, no. This is a at the grassroots socialism leading into communism with a globalist offshore
[49:36.660 --> 49:43.740]  exempt transferring the lion's share 90 plus percent of it to themselves. It is unbelievable.
[49:43.740 --> 49:47.900]  And listen, they're going to take everything and they're going to have people running around
[49:47.900 --> 49:53.620]  and giggling, celebrating as things collapse. But the dumb down masses won't even know their
[49:53.620 --> 49:57.140]  standard of living is collapsing as it'll be done over years. I mean, this has been
[49:57.140 --> 50:02.980]  done over and over again. This is the purposeful destruction of the golden goose.
[50:02.980 --> 50:07.940]  Absolutely. And you're seeing this now with Cyprus, which is kind of a beta test. It just
[50:07.940 --> 50:12.100]  wants to throw it out there, see what people think in the rest of the Western world. And
[50:12.100 --> 50:15.740]  I'm telling you, it's going to be coming to North America. You can already see it. They're
[50:15.740 --> 50:19.500]  already foreshadowing their talks. They already have an Obamacare. What is a three point eight
[50:19.500 --> 50:24.460]  percent tax on investment funds after tax, after capital gains?
[50:24.460 --> 50:29.420]  They have a huge increase in payroll taxes on the poorest people. They've got all sorts
[50:29.420 --> 50:34.020]  of hidden taxes. I mean, they're doing it here. Absolutely. And then the economy stalls
[50:34.020 --> 50:38.700]  and then their answer is more stimulus, which only they get to use. Absolutely. Well said,
[50:38.700 --> 50:44.780]  Frank. Thank you. Gerald, Travis, Aaron, John, your calls are coming up straight ahead.
[50:44.780 --> 50:51.140]  I mean, you heard the media when that golfer last year or this year said, hey, I'm paying
[50:51.140 --> 50:55.420]  65 percent in taxes. That's too much. The media attacked him. He apologized. He said,

[53:00.120 --> 53:05.060]  Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment. Hi,
[53:05.060 --> 53:10.100]  I'm Pastor Jenny and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about
[53:10.100 --> 53:16.240]  RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed
[53:16.240 --> 53:20.900]  with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells,
[53:20.900 --> 53:25.200]  organs and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay
[53:25.200 --> 53:31.260]  or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula
[53:31.260 --> 53:36.180]  designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn more

[54:17.340 --> 54:23.620]  Alex Jones here back live going back to your calls. I'm going to go through all the headlines
[54:23.620 --> 54:26.820]  when we start the next hour and then continue with calls ahead of a special guest joining
[54:26.820 --> 54:36.940]  us. But it's really happening. They are now arbitrarily, even though Cyprus wouldn't vote
[54:36.940 --> 54:41.740]  to do it, just announcing they're going ahead to grab 10% of everybody's bank account and
[54:41.740 --> 54:46.300]  then they may do it more and they're talking about doing it now in Italy and in other countries.
[54:46.300 --> 54:51.980]  In fact, let me punch up drudgereport.com for TV viewers. You can see it on screen.
[54:51.980 --> 54:59.420]  Radio listeners just go there. New EU bailout plan, steal bank accounts. Island set to seize
[54:59.420 --> 55:04.100]  personal savings. Plan moves ahead as vote delayed. They just moved ahead. The banks
[55:04.100 --> 55:09.980]  are closed, can't get your money. Putin says it's unfair, dangerous. And now they're talking
[55:09.980 --> 55:24.180]  about further bank runs around Europe. Amazing, amazing that all of this is happening. There's
[55:24.180 --> 55:29.540]  the info wars.com link. Will Italy follow? They've got top German banking ministers calling
[55:29.540 --> 55:37.180]  for 15% from the Italians. And of course it's rocked the stock markets worldwide, the Euro,
[55:37.180 --> 55:40.980]  the US stock market, you name it, Dow has dropped.
[55:40.980 --> 55:46.680]  But the issue here is that this isn't just a tax as they're calling it. It's arbitrary.
[55:46.680 --> 55:51.300]  It's the unelected EU bureaucracy that's now appointing presidents and prime ministers
[55:51.300 --> 55:56.580]  in places like Italy and Greece. And this is the technocratic model where a foreign
[55:56.580 --> 56:01.380]  banking cartel appoints your presidents and they call it a global government. And then
[56:01.380 --> 56:06.580]  I go, hey, look at the Financial Times of London calling for $100 trillion tax every
[56:06.580 --> 56:10.980]  ten years paid to private banks to back up their derivatives.
[56:10.980 --> 56:14.640]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center comes out and says I'm insane, it doesn't exist,
[56:14.640 --> 56:19.940]  and I'm dangerous, and that white men are terrorists. Just to get us to all fight with
[56:19.940 --> 56:23.540]  each other. What does white men have to do with it? I guess it's old white men in Europe
[56:23.540 --> 56:28.340]  running the New World Order. It's bankers. I guess the Rothschilds are white. I guess
[56:28.340 --> 56:33.100]  the Queen of England's white. I guess that's how they distract us. It's just like, hey,
[56:33.100 --> 56:36.820]  don't take my bank account. Shut up, racist. Hey, don't take my guns. Shut up, racist.
[56:36.820 --> 56:43.700]  Hey, I don't want you to double my insurance prices. This is a really bad scam. Shut up,
[56:43.700 --> 56:49.260]  racist. And then it works on people. I listen to talk radio. There's these new GOP reports
[56:49.260 --> 56:54.060]  that I'm gonna cover later in the next hour where they come out and say, yeah, we did
[56:54.060 --> 56:58.700]  a new study and nobody likes the Republicans cuz they call for smaller government.
[56:58.700 --> 57:02.540]  The Republicans haven't gone for smaller government. It's why conservatives won't vote for them.
[57:02.540 --> 57:08.180]  But it's all just this hoax. Let's go to Travis. You're on the air from Oklahoma. Go ahead.
[57:08.180 --> 57:10.660]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[57:10.660 --> 57:12.380]  Good, you're listening on 102.3.
[57:12.380 --> 57:14.020]  In Oklahoma City?
[57:14.020 --> 57:16.180]  Yeah, FM, go ahead.
[57:16.180 --> 57:24.060]  Yes, sir. We all know that this stuff's coming down the pipeline. And we post stuff on Facebook
[57:24.060 --> 57:30.900]  and things like that and try to get the word out. But we need to sincerely set up a date
[57:30.900 --> 57:38.820]  or something and everybody go up to Washington and literally drag them people out of there.
[57:38.820 --> 57:44.980]  I'm not even kidding, man. Cuz sitting around and talking about it's not gonna do anything.
[57:44.980 --> 57:48.540]  Well, see, they know it's gonna get to that point. So then they're gonna stage events
[57:48.540 --> 57:53.580]  up front right at the point they know that we've won politically in the wake up to then
[57:53.580 --> 57:56.780]  say we're violent to try to crack down on us.
[57:56.780 --> 58:01.580]  And then have a civil war, which the IMF in its own document says is part of the IMF riot
[58:01.580 --> 58:06.540]  plan, which then implodes confidence even more. And so then they come in and consolidate
[58:06.540 --> 58:11.820]  things to a greater extent. See, they know your common sense approach. That's why we've
[58:11.820 --> 58:14.940]  gotta have this be an info war and navigate it.
[58:14.940 --> 58:21.880]  And then hold our fire until they openly start fights. But see, they know that. So they'll
[58:21.880 --> 58:27.420]  just stage things blowing up government facilities that have child daycare centers in them to
[58:27.420 --> 58:28.420]  show dead kids on TV.
[58:28.420 --> 58:31.900]  In fact, when they blow stuff up, it will be a daycare in a federal facility. That's
[58:31.900 --> 58:36.340]  one of their favorite things to do. So we've gotta be smarter than that, my friend, but
[58:36.340 --> 58:39.060]  I hear your frustration.
[58:39.060 --> 59:01.340]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:01.340 --> 59:31.180]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:31.340 --> 59:57.980]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:09.900]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:19.820]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:27.660]  The globalists want a worldwide $100 trillion for every 10-year tax of FDRs on carbon taxes
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.060]  and every human activity to shut down the economy and transfer all wealth into their
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:38.260]  social engineering systems, to remake society in a nightmare eugenics-based system.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:46.140]  The EU, as I predicted, as Max Keiser predicted, as Gerald Salente predicted, is a receivership
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.780]  arm designed to implode Europe and consolidate it. Paul Watson's written tons of articles
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:56.340]  on this. One of the more recent was bankers declare they've conquered Europe and the United
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.560]  States and it breaks down where they plan this.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:04.540]  And then I hear other people, socialists mainly, defending the EU because they like authoritarianism.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:10.380]  And they say the bankers wanna loot the euro. They built the euro to implode it into a greater
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:17.860]  euro. We need to get rid of the whole thing, go back to nation states, not new Soviet empires.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:24.580]  The euro is like the Soviet Union and is evil and must die. It politically must die. Let's
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:28.420]  go to your phone calls. I'm gonna break all this down in this hour. John in New York,
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.900]  thanks for holding your on the air. Welcome.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:35.260]  Hey, how you doing? It's my first time calling. Thanks for taking my call. Listen, you know,
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:39.500]  I listen to you a lot and I do my homework and, you know, Gerald Salente, you know, he
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.500]  said it, you know, get your three Gs, your guns, gold, and your getaway plan, because
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.580]  you know what? That's what it's coming down to. You know, this country is morally bankrupt,
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.660]  economically bankrupt, and this has been going on since the early 1900s, late 1800s.
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:56.980]  Oh, yeah. And the socialists now. I mean, I hear him and it's so bizarre. I think I'm
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:01.980]  in a Twilight Zone episode. They call into radio and laugh and they're mainly white.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:06.500]  It's this whole race based thing. It's like a race obsession. I'm really sick of it. And
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:13.300]  they go white people laws. Obama is winning and it's a total screw job. Obama works for
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.620]  the mega bank. Same people as Romney. They're hammering everybody. But, you know, one tenth
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:24.100]  of one one hundredth, you know, the real superclash America, Europe's being imploded, the whole
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.580]  world's being imploded.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:30.900]  And they call in giggling like a three year old going nanny nanny boo boo. Stick your
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.620]  head and you know, you know what? I mean, literally adults. I'm sure you've heard them.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:41.940]  I mean, they're like nanny nanny boo boo. We won. We won. Whitey is scared. And I'm
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:45.540]  like, what does it have to do with Whitey? And they go Whitey, Whitey. And you're like,
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.220]  you mentally ill person. Shut up. Mega banks are taking bank accounts. Everybody's. I won.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:56.300]  I won. I won. And they're like, I work for the government or I work for a company. So
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:01.060]  what? So what? And they think if they imagine they're part of it, it makes them winners.
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:05.980]  It'd be like going out the middle of the highway with 18 wheelers going 80 miles an hour. They've
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.900]  upped the speed limit to that here in Texas and going out on I-35 and just jumping in
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.180]  front of a car and going, I'm your friend. I'm your friend. And it just smashes you.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:18.500]  The car slides over your guts. Your brains are all over the place. I've seen somebody
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:23.660]  hit by a car going like 70 miles an hour. Just splatters you unrecognizable. But it
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:29.140]  doesn't matter. The last thing in their mind is I'm the car's friend. I'm a winner. Kinetic
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.540]  energy doesn't matter. Baby, love me car. Bell, love me. I mean, do you understand the
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.420]  mental illness I'm talking about here, sir? I'm sorry.
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:40.060]  Yeah, let's take it back to stuff. Man, Lady Liberty's been hit by that bus. And she splattered
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.100]  all over the highway with her guts hanging out. Let me tell you something about the men
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:48.020]  in this country. There are no men left in this country. Everybody talks about, you know,
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:52.060]  Max Keiser said it the best. You know, you got your second amendment. What are you fighting
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.660]  for? The tradition for it? What are you gonna let those things sit under your bed and collect
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.660]  them?
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.220]  Well, Max, Max, overall, I think's a good guy, but he also believes in global warming
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.900]  and a bunch of other stuff. And, you know, he's always like, America's gonna collapse.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.100]  America's gonna collapse. Well, what about the euro? I've been saying it's gonna collapse
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:09.700]  first. And, and, you know, so I know Max is listening. He said he listens religiously.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:17.620]  The point is, is that, is that, look, we've got to be fighting the info war viciously
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:22.780]  ahead of not wanting to have a physical confrontation. But every day we fight, if there is gonna
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.180]  be a physical confrontation, it's money in the political bank that we discredit the system.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.380]  It's a life and death situation. I mean, what do you think we should do?
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:36.180]  If you don't take it straight, it's gonna be a long unwinding. I mean, this has been
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.260]  going on since the early 1900s. They took over the education system. They took over
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:45.220]  our economics and the Federal Reserve. I mean, it's gonna take a long time to unwind it.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.460]  We have ways far down the line. You're right. You're right. I look at the average people.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:53.860]  They are begging to be slaves. I mean, they are just shuffling around weakly, going, ugh,
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:58.540]  ugh. They just worship government. They worship tyranny.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.900]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:08.020]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:13.540]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:18.540]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:25.740]  at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:32.980]  in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound. When

[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:44.700]  in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com

[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:10.020]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:19.100]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:37.460]  Well, the head of the big German central bank is calling for a 15% tax across the board
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:43.540]  on any country in the Euro that, quote, owes money to the private central banks. And again,
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:49.700]  they owe the money because the governments, since 2008, have publicly signed on from Japan
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:55.740]  to Germany, from Greece to the United States, from Canada to Australia. They've all signed
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.420]  on to too big to fail.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:05.580]  And 92% on average of the debt worldwide is not human's debt. Yeah, they tell you all
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:11.140]  day about the welfare debt and the smart card debt and the food stamp debt and the college
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:17.480]  debt and the government debt and the county debt. That's all real, but they get you into
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.660]  that debt to then sign you on to their larger debts.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:27.820]  And they get government to then invest the private pension funds, and in many countries
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:32.900]  they're taking over the private pension funds, and the public pension funds in these derivatives.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:39.660]  In fact, that happened, guys, type in US pension funds invested to prop up too big to fail.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:45.460]  Pension funds invested to prop up banks. And you'll see, no exaggeration, hundreds of articles
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:49.980]  in Europe, the United States, where in the last four or five years, really accelerating
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:56.100]  the last two, it's just minor footnotes in AP, McClatchy, LA Times.
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:03.100]  So your pension fund, private or public, was invested in too big to fail. In fact, there
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:11.620]  was a big scandal when I saw headlines where private pension ordered to invest to prop
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:17.980]  up too big to fail. And you'll see these articles where the heads of company CEOs are, well,
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:25.300]  I was ordered to invest the 25 billion of our people's money in this.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:30.020]  And because the shareholders are saying, and the workers are saying, why did you invest
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.780]  in this? Well, I was ordered to. I mean, it's so insane that I can't even articulate all
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:42.060]  the angles of this how bad it is. It's basically they have us being lowered into a wood chipper.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.420]  And you're like, well, describe what a wood chipper is like. Well, you know what? I've
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.980]  never been put through one, so I don't know.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:54.680]  It looks real bad. I've seen what it does to logs you put in it. I've seen what it does
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.620]  to third world countries, this type of shock therapy, IMF World Bank takeover. And it is
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:05.420]  designed not to even bail us out, but to go to the next phase of poverty. And so it was
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.300]  announced Friday when everybody's paychecks got deposited.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.700]  They waited till payday. Your bank account's frozen. You can only get 50 euros out of an
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:18.580]  ATM. That all ran out in hours. And now they have a bank holiday until Thursday, and no
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:22.860]  one can get their money out. And it's sending shockwaves all over. People say, how dumb
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:28.700]  of the EU Central Bank headed up by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan operatives on record.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:36.340]  How crazy they did this. It's killing confidence. It's killing the bond market. Why it's killing
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:42.500]  the euro. Why that's the plan is to panic everybody. And there's an article, just don't
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.500]  call it a bailout.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:49.160]  European governments devise unusual measures to prop up their ailing banks. There's a new
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:56.060]  article on that front. And there it is, pension funds. In Italy, for example, the government
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:00.140]  is encouraging banks to buy public properties that the banks then can use to borrow the
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.140]  money.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.440]  As part of the broader deficit reduction program in Portugal, the government essentially is
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.740]  borrowing money from the bank pension funds and could use some of the funds. Yeah, that's
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:15.020]  just one example. There are examples where US companies are, quote, ordered to invest
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:25.660]  the lion's share of their people's 401k money in failing bank stocks. Imagine, I order you
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:29.800]  to prop up my Bernie Madoff operation.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.780]  And so here are some of the headlines that I have on that front. Banking chief calls
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:39.060]  for 50% looting of Italian savings. Is the financial rape of Cyprus another IMF riot
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:45.900]  waiting to happen? Yeah, key article up at infowars.com, also up at drudgereport.com.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:53.140]  There it is, Japan using public funds to prop up Nikkei. Wall Street Journal, putting people's
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.140]  pensions in it.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:13:01.080]  Again, you can just pull up these articles every day. After banks are stealing money
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.860]  from accounts in Cyprus, they will start doing it everywhere. Michael Schneider, the economic
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:09.940]  collapse blog. Yeah, it's already begun. Cyprus government's great bank robbery of private
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.700]  accounts may shut off bank runs across Europe.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:18.600]  The rape of Cyprus by the European Union and the IMF, zero hedge. Cyprus to put forward
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.380]  new bailout plan. They say, well, we'll let you know on Thursday what it is. But even
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:31.980]  if Cyprus won't vote, we're going ahead with it. But it may just be 3 to 6.75 or 7.5. We
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:40.360]  may just take a smaller percentage out of your account, and that makes it okay.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.740]  And why not? The IRS and the European Union's version of that has been taking people's bank
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:52.860]  accounts in whole for decades. No judge, no jury, no proof, just we seized your account.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:59.880]  We seized your account. Why not? Why not, folks? I mean, all over the world, they tell
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:06.940]  you you can't film in public. In Europe, in Canada, in the United States, my crew has
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.940]  all had on video, cops walk over.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:14.420]  If they're filming in the middle of a city square, on the side of the street, 200 yards
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.500]  from the cops running a checkpoint, they march over and go, turn that camera off, I'll arrest
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:24.860]  you. And they have no law behind them, it's just pure arbitrary crime. And you know what,
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.940]  if you'll act like that, cops, they're gonna take everything you've got.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:32.820]  Due process protects us all. The Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and similar systems like
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:38.220]  it. And there it is, FDIC wants pension funds to prop up failed banks. See, I throw something
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.260]  out and the guys just start searching and finding it to back me up. That's Bloomberg
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:45.500]  News, and that's from 2010.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.860]  And by the way, they got the money. In fact, print that, I think that's the article where
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:57.260]  it quotes the corporate chief saying, I'm doing it under orders of the Treasury. And
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.420]  people say, well, how can they order them to do that? Because if you don't, there's
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.860]  a Justice Department investigation.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:07.780]  And the way they've got SEC rules written, you can't do anything without it being mail
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:15.020]  fraud. They can find something to put you in jail. Martha Stewart did nothing, went
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:20.420]  to jail. If you publicly steal trillions, you get to become Treasury Secretary. If you
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:26.420]  publicly give yourself 200 million of bailout money, like Paulson, you don't get in trouble.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:30.840]  If you commit hardcore giant crimes out in front of everyone, you're fine, if you're
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:31.840]  a globalist.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.700]  But look, Justice Department, I told you this two years ago, I told you they would start
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:41.320]  investigating and then indict News Corps. I'm telling you, they may arrest everybody
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:46.700]  over at News Corps. And then you'll have people that actually were involved in hacking clearly,
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.880]  where all his underlings just got arrested.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:56.700]  Here's Morgan, he won't get in any trouble. Notice they signed the EU deal and said that
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.460]  they were just going to start taking the money out of the bank account. And now they're spending
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:05.580]  it, we're considering it. That's how they spend this. Okay, let's go to your calls as
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:16.180]  promised. I just hope everybody realizes the off the chart magnitude of what's going on
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.420]  here because I'm gonna explain it to you again.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:23.940]  They want to bankrupt everything and then have only people working for government and
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.780]  mega corporations that are above the law. And then they're gonna replace us all with
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:32.860]  robots like Foxconn's doing at the Apple slave factories, Apple slave factories. But it's
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:37.580]  like, I talked to so-called liberals who are really weirdo, mentally ill, authoritarians
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.260]  who like to lick their lips and feel powerful.
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:43.260]  And I go, what about Al Gore in the slave camps? They go, shut up, old white man, you're
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:49.260]  gonna fail. I'm like, you're white, you're supporting total slavery in China. And they're
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.940]  just like, shut up, loser, I'm a winner. And they could have $10 for their name, they act
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:54.980]  like this.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:17:00.060]  It's imagining, and it's all this weird socialist race-based thing. They're part of the winning
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:04.220]  club, mental illness. And the Republicans have come out in a new study and said, we
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:10.380]  agree, we've gotta give up on everything, open borders, gay marriage, that'll make everyone
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:15.580]  love us. No, it won't, you're just joining the hoax. People are leaving you in mass because
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:16.580]  they know you're globalist.
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:21.660]  All right, let's go to your calls. Aaron in California, you're on the air, thanks for
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:22.660]  holding.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:28.860]  No, no, let me tell you what's happening in Cyprus right now. They're taking real money,
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:36.900]  billion, 6 billion in real euros, and they're replacing that with another loan. Okay, so
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:40.580]  that's very clear, they're still on the hook, so they got principle and interest going.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:47.220]  The solution to that is for all of the slaves to begin withdrawing the money all over the
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:52.700]  world from the banks and holding those notes, of course, and diversifying into precious
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.700]  metals.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.620]  Well, you're right, but only on average, there's less than 2% to 3% worldwide of actual physical
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.620]  cashola.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:04.300]  You gotta take it out of there, that's gonna precipitate the decline, the dominoes will
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:09.900]  start to fall then, that's what they admit to. So let's have that progressed, take the
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:14.820]  money out, then they begin to get more and more desperate, and we get to the end game.
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.900]  No, no, I agree, I mean, I've been telling my wife for months cuz I'm too busy, we gotta
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.180]  get a little bit of cash out, I don't have that much. But the point is, is that it is
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:29.380]  time to, those old timers, they're dumb, they bury it in the root cellar, put it in the
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.380]  wall.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:34.980]  They've been through having their money taken and devalued, I mean, my great grandfather
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.740]  who owned one of the, I think it was the first Chevy dealership in the Dallas, Fort Worth
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:43.740]  area, the point is, he didn't turn his gold in.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:48.940]  And my grandmother who's still alive, that was my grandfather's dad, but my grandmother
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:57.100]  remembers her grandfather who worked for Sun Oil, he didn't turn his gold in in 1933. And
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.620]  again, they couldn't come arrest everybody, they arrested a few people, put it in the
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:01.620]  newspaper to scare everybody.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:05.860]  A lot of people went and turned their gold in for dollars that were then devalued, and
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:12.380]  then gold was doubled in price a year later. I mean, look, folks, they will do anything
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.020]  if you follow their orders, go ahead.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:19.760]  Yeah, I think you should have an allocation about half in US Federal Reserve notes and
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.380]  half in precious metals, then you play it both ways. I think that's the safe bet out
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:28.300]  of the system. That's the most thing out of their system where they can get their hands
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:31.100]  on it electronically. So I think that's the solution.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:36.660]  No, I agree. And that's the problem with having a cashless society. The problem with having
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:41.140]  a cashless society is an angel isn't running it. Well, I guess an angel is the devil. Good
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:45.420]  guys aren't running it. These are globalists that are social engineers, who again, one
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:49.260]  example of how they make money, General Electric, it's a waiver to not shut down their coal
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:54.860]  power plants and has Obama shut down 200 plus a year, doubling and tripling the profits
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.180]  of General Electric. That's how they make money shutting you down.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:03.860]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:09.500]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:14.940]  a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are

[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:33.140]  gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:38.680]  at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:43.740]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:52.180]  silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.320]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.540]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.660]  to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:43.060]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:46.420]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[01:22:55.300 --> 01:23:01.380]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:07.380]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:11.520]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.080]  president could obtain its world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.620]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:27.300]  ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:32.500]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.740]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders

[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:55.220]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com. Protect your immune system.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:24:08.700]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:14.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are fire bombings going on. This is breaking right now in Cyprus.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:21.740]  They've got live feeds of it on Fox News. That is unfolding. And that's part of the
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:25.900]  IMF plan. They know people will then riot. If they have to, they'll get provocateurs
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:30.700]  to do it. And then that will drive down confidence even more so the globalists can come in and
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:35.500]  buy it up even faster. This is not my opinion. It's in the IMF World Bank plans that got
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:41.700]  leaked in 2002. It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny. It was covered by the BBC. I'm going
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:45.340]  to get Greg Palast back on about this very, very soon. And when they're done, they're
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:49.880]  going to do that here. And that's what the armored vehicles and the bullets and all of
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.880]  it are about.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.140]  You're like, well, I just won't riot then. Oh, don't worry. They're going to blow stuff
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:59.500]  up and say we did it. They're already saying white gun owners that believe in a new world
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:06.020]  order are going to bomb things. Whites are inherently terrorists. Christians are inherently
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:11.860]  terrorists. And you're like, why are they doing that? Well, here's a new poll out, a
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.400]  new big study.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:20.300]  Are you an older white Republican man? Study finds you are most likely to ditch news outlet.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:26.820]  And it goes over the fact that they've done a new Pew Research states of the media report.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:32.140]  And I've got that report right here. The state of the news media 2013. It shows mainstream
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:37.660]  media is dying overall, but that white men particularly just don't even trust it or believe
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.660]  it.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:42.260]  Well, no kidding, because they've been chosen to be the bad guys. They get on CNN, MSNBC
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:48.660]  every day. And I've been covering this a lot lately because it's crazy. It's working. And
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:52.940]  they just say, don't like turning your guns in, racist. Don't like socialism, racist.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:57.180]  Don't like open borders, racist. Don't like banks taking your money, racist. Don't want
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:04.140]  your pension funds rated racist. And they've connected race-based politics with women.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:06.860]  And they've got white women going, that's right, white men are evil. I mean, literally
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:12.960]  on the news. And it's okay to do that. Imagine if they had the women and everybody else saying
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.380]  black people were bad or something or Hispanics.
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.900]  But again, you're like, it doesn't make sense. Yes, it does. Because it's about you're the
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:25.540]  winning team. Your team won the Super Bowl. Team women, team minority, which is the majority
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:31.420]  defeated white guys. Yay, healthcare's doubling in price. And you're like, why am I happy?
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:39.700]  Doesn't matter, feels good. And it's this bandwagon collectivist weirdo stuff. And then
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:43.740]  they're gonna blow stuff up and say the evil white males did it and the whole homeland
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:48.940]  security is for the veterans and the white men.
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:51.780]  And then they have the Republicans. Look at this ridiculous headline. I'm gonna go to
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:27:00.180]  your calls. You guys can punch this up on screen. Bowties and Mohawks at the CPAC 2013
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:10.340]  show. No, I've got it on my computer screen right there. It's International Business Times.
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:15.300]  Bowties and Mohawks at the CPAC 2013 show.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.660]  Changing Republican Party. See, that's what change is all about. What color you are, what
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:27.780]  color your Mohawk is. Not about the content of your heart, your mind, what you stand for.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:34.560]  It's about, ooh, a Mohawk. So now the Republicans are parading people around with pink Mohawks
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:41.720]  to go, hey kids, we're trendy. We're with the times. Yeah, we agree. We want totally
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.540]  open borders and world government and socialism.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:50.180]  And you know what, let's teach five year olds how to have gay sex. Yes, yes, we're trendy.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:55.780]  Why just ask Senator Lindsey Graham, he knows all about it, about how to be trendy. Bowties
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:28:01.800]  and Mohawks at CPAC 2013 show changing Republican Party. Yeah, don't talk about how mega banks
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.800]  are robbing us.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.360]  Don't talk about crony capitalism and the elite taking over. Don't talk about the loss
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.940]  of basic freedom for everybody. Don't talk about Martin Luther King saying colorblind
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:19.520]  society. No, no, no, no, we have cool people, bowties and Mohawks. My God, kids, don't you
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.480]  want to vote Republican now?
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.700]  And this is the whole mind control job by the globalists that own the Republicans as
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:30.740]  well that want this whole agenda push through to make everything not about liberty and freedom
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:37.300]  and private property, but about your group. Group rights, not individual rights, group
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:41.020]  rights. And then who represents the group rights, the group leaders that are globalist
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.420]  controlled and the state that referees at all.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:50.900]  And so that's how they're fully converting over into this new system where we're all
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:57.700]  basically divided into our own groups. And they have the new poll out GOP study calls
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:06.340]  for changes to halt presidential losing streak. And the answer basically become the Democratic
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:14.740]  Party. Get with the times, I mean, abortion is so cool.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:19.700]  Doesn't matter that polls show in young people over 70% are anti-abortion. Women were more
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:23.740]  and more anti-abortion, but I've seen the big studies. It's actually working by saying,
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.600]  hey, women, you showed the white men, you get to kill your babies. A lot of women are
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.400]  like suddenly clipping back to the Democrats because it's the bandwagon effect of, I want
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.400]  to be a winner.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.340]  I'll drive around all satisfied in my car because I'm hooked on to Obama and he's pimping
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:42.760]  me out to the new world order. I mean, this is, you know, the vice president's pimping
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:47.660]  me out. It's just all so patronizing. Your call's coming up.

[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:31.220]  A fleet is being sent according to Sky News. That's Fox Europe. Cyprus bailout saving shift
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:36.180]  amid Russian offer. We're going to be getting into all that and really the biggest news
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:43.540]  overall is that the Feds Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, which is about the fourth most
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:50.500]  powerful branch out of 12, says too big to fail. Banks are crony capitalists and are consolidating
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:56.500]  the economy under them and will destroy our future. And he's been criticizing them more and
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:02.180]  more the last three years and I actually know someone who knows him. I'll just leave it at that.
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:12.500]  In fact, I shouldn't even say that. I've just learned with sources it's just best to not even
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:19.460]  get into any of it. The point is that the Federal Reserve in Dallas, the Federal Reserve in Kansas
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:26.180]  City, both their heads, which are representing shareholders of the inner cabal, are realizing
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:32.340]  that this is a really nasty plan. I wouldn't even say they're good guys overall. They just
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:37.220]  realized that this is bad for business and that the globalists are going to implode everything.
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:41.940]  So I'm gonna be getting to that report as well. Don't forget there's been massive attempts to
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:47.380]  censor infoawars.com over the years to shut us down, to block us, to demonize us. We're
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.580]  being listed as terror leaders by the Southern Poverty Law Center for simply being able to add
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:57.940]  two plus two equals four. And just being basic Americans who stand for liberty and sovereignty
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:02.260]  of this nation and who don't want the UN running our military, and who don't want to give $85
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:06.820]  billion a month to foreign banks. Do you think those foreign banks like it that I'm there
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:14.020]  exposing that? No, I mean, we're doing something dangerous here. So to support our local AM&FM
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:18.820]  affiliates, spread the word about them, spread the word about their sponsors, become local sponsors.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:24.100]  It's a big deal when we're on local stations. It's a big deal the broadcast is growing.
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:28.740]  Yes, it should be growing. Yes, we're just talking about things that are happening.
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:33.780]  But that's a crime when criminals run things. In a world of universal deceit,
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:40.740]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act to quote Eric Blair, aka George Arwell of 1984 fame.
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:45.940]  And so don't take it for granted, folks, that we're on your local AM&FM affiliates
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:49.780]  today because those stations could be bought out tomorrow. Don't take it for granted that
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:55.940]  prisonplanted.tv is up and running today. Support us so we can be strong going into the future.

[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:22.740]  All of your purchases make the broadcast possible. Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:30.020]  And support our sponsors like Midas Resources. Give them a call, ask them about their best deals
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:34.820]  on bullion, gold and silver. That's what I'd buy. But if you're going to get numismatic collectibles,
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:38.660]  they will actually sell you numismatics for close to what they are really worth.
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:42.260]  They got to put a tiny markup in there. There's a lot of baiting and switching in the industry.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:47.780]  Some of the biggest names have horrible F ratings. Midas has a A plus, highest level,
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:53.540]  better business bureau. Because they'll sell you numismatics with tiny markups.
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:59.940]  It's all available. Midas Resources 800-686-2237. And without Midas, we couldn't have done any of
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:04.740]  this. So not only are they great folks, I've worked with for 16 years. I went out and shopped
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:08.820]  for the best name, bought some gold, silver from a bunch of places myself. Found out they had the
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:13.060]  best deals, didn't try to bait and switch me. If Ted catches brokers, this happens every once in a
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:18.580]  while, trying to overcharge somebody or bait and switch, they're fired. I'll be quite honest with
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:22.740]  you, about a month or two ago, one of my friends bought some gold and had maybe a little bit too
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:27.300]  big of a markup for what they thought. The guy was fired the next day. My point is, is that
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:33.380]  in a business out there that runs from excellent to horrible, Midas is as good as it gets,
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:39.860]  and they support the broadcast. 800-686-2237, they're the place to get precious metals.
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:44.180]  And if you haven't moved some of your assets into gold and silver, I think you're nuts.
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:47.300]  I think you're crazy. They've been doing everything they can to short,
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:55.060]  sell it to naked short it, to try to suppress it. While the globalists buy it with both hands,
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:59.700]  Soros, the Chinese government, University of Texas, all these other big universities,
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:04.820]  insiders are just grabbing it greedily. And tungsten gold in the Federal Reserve,
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:08.820]  I heard that seven years ago now confirmed, won't give Germany their gold. They've asked
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:12.980]  for their gold. The US has said 10 years to get it back, we'll give it to you in increments.
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:16.980]  I mean, let me tell you something, we're sitting on a mountain of TNT,
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:20.740]  and everybody's playing with sparklers and smoking cigarettes,
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:26.420]  and dancing around with giant gasoline-fed torches. I mean, it's a matter of time till
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:32.340]  this blows sky high. And people say, well, that's fear mongering. I bought gold and silver
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:36.260]  cuz I was afraid of what you're starting to see happen, cuz I could see the writing on the wall.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:41.780]  Being concerned about something and getting prepared for it is not fear mongering. It's
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:48.580]  called getting up on your hind legs and fighting. Let me tell you, I've been mugged a couple of
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:51.860]  times growing up in Dallas cuz I'd go in the bad neighborhoods to buy beer and stuff.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:56.740]  My high school buddies, we drive into Dallas, the worst part of Dallas, South Dallas to buy beer.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:01.940]  And routinely, we'd go buy it from the bootlegger sometimes when the liquor store wouldn't sell it
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:06.180]  to us. And I was dumb enough, they'd say, okay, Alex, you go up and you get the beer.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:15.300]  You've got the fake tough guys and the crazy brave as they say. And it's a fear response when
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:18.660]  somebody walks around with a club or a knife and says, give me everything you got. And it's not
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:22.180]  that I'm even a tough guy. If somebody's menacing me, I automatically attack them.
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:26.100]  And then my heart rate goes up, adrenaline goes up, and I attack. It's not that I even
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:31.860]  have courage, it's that I attack. And that's normal, folks, that's a normal response.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:36.420]  And see, I attack saying, I attack the New World Order, I attack the Globalist,
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:42.020]  I attack the banker heads. I attack their system offensively discrediting them,
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:46.260]  cuz that's what they need to have is your support to continue.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:51.220]  We've got to discredit them so they collapse like the Soviet Union while I have a defense of
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:55.620]  getting ready and prepared. And if you don't get ready and prepared, you're out of your stinking
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:00.020]  mind. We told you they'd come for the guns, that's happening. This is all no brainers, folks.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:04.660]  These are criminals, okay? These are criminals, and it's that simple. Midas Resources,
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:11.620]  800-686-2237, 800-686-237. And if you want their very best deal, two silver dollars,
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:17.620]  at cost $72, shipping included, 72. That makes them $62, it's about $10 to ship them.
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:21.620]  So the real price is $62 for two silver coins, 10 bucks is added, that's at cost.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:27.220]  And then two free films, powerful films, and a book, The Obama Deception, American Dream,
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:31.140]  all of it, along with Dishonest Money. And if you want, when you call, they'll give you a free
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:39.940]  booklet, 10 Reasons to Own Gold, $72, 800-686-237. Okay, let's go to your calls. Leonard in Montana,
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:42.820]  thanks for holding, then Michael and others, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:49.940]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to call you to tell you thank you for having the courage to do this for
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:57.140]  so long. We know that you're gonna fall on the fence and all that. So anyway, I just wanted to
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:03.060]  tell you, tell people to buy ammo, ammo, ammo. And also, if you could, make a shirt that says,
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:07.860]  No King, but King Jesus. It's the most popular thing that I got people saying around here.
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:12.500]  Everyone says it now. That's a good idea. Well, that's what our four founders,
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:17.940]  forebears pointed out, was that we're not gonna worship and say you're above the law.
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:22.100]  Because if you read the writings of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:27.540]  and if you check it, you're like, Oh my gosh, this is exactly what we have. They would use
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:33.380]  regulators to shut down tobacco farmers or cotton farmers or corn farmers or hemp farmers.
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:38.740]  And then only the local lord or the son of the lord from England was allowed to even operate.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:45.460]  It's the same deal. And now they've gotten smart though. Back then they wouldn't put people on
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:51.940]  welfare. Only the rich were on welfare, corporate government welfare. They got smart though.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.660]  The robber barons learned to create big government and get little guys on the payroll.
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.500]  And you can buy them cheap. Doesn't matter if it actually shuts down their future,
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:04.900]  shuts down the overall prosperity, makes the country horrible. They won't recognize it if
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:10.020]  it takes five, ten years to do it. And so again, I say to people out there, I know countless people
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:15.460]  on welfare, on disability. And I mean, what are they gonna do? I mean, the government gives troops
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:22.820]  deadly vaccines to disable them. And then they take their gun rights because they're disabled.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:28.820]  I mean, it's a master plan. How do you counter something so masterful, Leonard?
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.460]  Well, listen, this isn't about, and everyone needs to understand this. This is not about
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:38.900]  getting wealthy. This is about surviving to the other side so that we can rebuild this. Because
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:46.260]  this system, this moral corruptness, this absolutely lazy society, it's over. It's done.
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:49.620]  It will not work. We're walking on the backs of people that no longer exist.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:53.380]  So we're going to have to steer this when it's all-
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:56.580]  You're right. You're right. And the power structure knows it's gonna implode. So they
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:01.060]  want armored redoubts and high security tyranny to protect them while they suck everything out
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.900]  of us. And they'll take 10% out of your pension fund. Then they'll take 10% out of your bank
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.900]  account. And the next year, they'll take 10, 10, 10. So you'll never rebel or they'll say,
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:13.380]  we're gonna take 15. Well, now it's only 10. We're gonna take 12. Well, now it's only 10.
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:17.780]  Well, we're gonna take 10. Now it's only 7. I mean, I told people yesterday, I said,
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:23.700]  now they'll come out and say, we're only gonna take 7. I even called it. And I'm not smart.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:30.660]  It's like I'm the New England Patriots. I videotaped their practice games. I mean,
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:35.780]  I know exactly what they're going to do because they follow an exact plan.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:39.620]  They change it up here and there, but it's still,
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:45.780]  and folks, that's so frustrating to know this. They're gonna take everything, everything.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:51.300]  And they know that people getting prepared, growing gardens, talking to their neighbors
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:54.420]  are the people that are gonna try to save society. They don't want that.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:57.220]  So they call us terrorists. I mean, I'm gonna say that again with a straight face.
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:03.060]  Folks, look this up. You know about it in the news. They're saying people that are trying to
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:08.420]  get prepared are terrorists and preppers are terrorists when you'd be insane with half of
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:14.020]  Europe rioting and the same system happening here to get prepared. But again, that's because they
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:21.860]  don't want us prepared. They want a total collapse, reorganization, red terror, not communist.
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:27.780]  The globalists use red terror to take over. And let me tell you, the average schlub who loves
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:32.100]  socialism, not the poor person on welfare cuz it's all they can do and they got type 2 diabetes
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:37.300]  cuz nobody told them Diet Coke would kill their pancreas. But the people that are into the liberal
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:43.700]  socialist ideology are horrible authoritarians with crazed looks in their eyes. They love it.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:48.980]  They know it's coming. They wanna come in our houses. They wanna force labor our butts.
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:54.500]  They're gonna make all our kids serve in FEMA Corps. That's now official. We are going into
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:45:00.180]  slavery. And every one of these despicable liberals are not liberals. They are our mortal
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:07.620]  dirtbag commissar enemies, just like Che Guevara, just like Joseph Stalin, just like Mao Zedong.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:14.580]  They are brown shirt thug enemies and you better start hating them because that's a natural
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:20.100]  response. They're not dumb liberals. They're hardcore takeover artists that took us over.
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:23.220]  Okay, God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call, Leonard.
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:30.260]  I mean, you just got to get in your mind that at the mid level and high level, they know
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:36.020]  what they're doing. They are not liberals. Thomas Jefferson was a liberal. He would spit on these
[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:44.260]  people. They are 180 degrees the opposite. Michael in Texas and then Alex Martin and others,
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:44.820]  you're on the air.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:47.460]  This is Alex.
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:48.100]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:54.660]  Hey, what's up, man? Hey, my name's Mike. I'm a Persian Gulf Iraqi veteran. I suffer
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:46:00.020]  really bad PTSD. And my second suicide attempt, I ended up in the Waco clinic.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:03.940]  Let me stop you. Did they put you on psychotropic drugs?
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:10.820]  I refuse them. I don't take that crap. But my concern is I'm calling more my fellow veterans
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:16.420]  out there is because I was out about three days and they normally, they have someone
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:19.940]  that calls you and checks up, you see how you are and how you're doing.
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:25.940]  And they call me, but it wasn't regular staff at the VA like they normally do call because
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:32.420]  I'm used to the one in the Detroit facility. This phone call I got, first he asked me if
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:37.540]  I was okay. I was like, yeah, yeah, I'm cool. And then he introduced himself as a federal
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:43.140]  auditor for the VA. And the main premise after I told me I was doing fine, his focus wasn't
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:49.220]  his main premise. His phone call was for one thing. He asked me if I had firearms or if
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:55.380]  I didn't, do I have access to firearms? And I told him, no, it's none of his business.
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:59.460]  I asked him one last time and his old lady rolled in the hay and he says, sir, I was
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.940]  like, well, one inappropriate question deserves another. You don't have a right to ask me
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:06.180]  that. I'm protective, I second remember.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:11.460]  Well, here's the deal. They're making felonies now, releasing a balloon accidentally or on
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:16.140]  purpose for your girlfriend. So we need to get rid of the 68 gun control act. You shouldn't
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:19.460]  take troops away, you shouldn't take guns away from anybody. If somebody's gonna get
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:21.780]  a gun, they're gonna get it. If you're gonna commit suicide, you're gonna do it.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:25.220]  But I'm gonna tell you right now, you're not gonna commit suicide. You're gonna live to
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:29.740]  fight tyranny. And you're still in a war, soldier, and you're fighting the New World
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:35.180]  Order and Jesus Christ is gonna heal you. And they put all sorts of vaccines in you
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:39.660]  to do this to you. And I want you to detox and I want you to know you're gonna beat them
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:40.800]  by living a long life.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:48.220]  You're gonna beat them by not listening to their bull, all right? Where do you stand
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:52.980]  on this? Cuz I don't want them to win. I don't want them to put out the spirit of giving
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:58.340]  up and to convince you to commit suicide. Why have you been suicidal?
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:02.220]  Just it might be disty and everything is really bad. And when I get drunk, it compounds it.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:05.980]  And I did a lot of bad things over there and I saw a lot of things happen to my buddies.
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:06.980]  You know, it just gets me down.
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:12.500]  Well, you know what? You gotta ask God. Listen, let's get to the base of it. You feel guilty,
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.420]  don't you?
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:19.300]  I felt more so when I was over there after a while. Hey, I'm kicking these people's doors.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.300]  Exactly.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.300]  If anybody was over here-
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:22.300]  You were taking their guns.
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:25.380]  You were taking their guns, training for America, which is now admitted. Let me say this. You
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:29.420]  didn't consciously know that when you signed up. You didn't. You believed you were defending
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:30.420]  America, didn't you?
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:35.020]  Well, I went over there for my folks and my brother and my friends. Yeah, I did.
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:39.700]  Okay, so let me just say this. Then even though you were deceived, you did not consciously
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:44.540]  engage in the evil and now you repent. And I'm telling you, if you just hit your knees
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:50.580]  every day and ask God to change your heart so that you're not destructive towards yourself,
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:55.580]  because it's normal when you've done evil, to hate yourself. But you can be a changed
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:58.820]  man and God can use you to spread the word of liberty.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:03.660]  And it won't happen overnight, but you can slowly get off alcohol. You can slowly, I'm
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:08.100]  telling you, God can do it. So I mean, have you hit your knees and asked God to forgive
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:09.100]  you?
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.180]  I'm not a religious person.
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:15.140]  Let me tell you something. Sir, let me tell you something. Even if you don't believe in
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:20.380]  it, studies have shown prayer helps because it accesses an area, the pineal gland, a lot
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:25.100]  of other things. When you make that spiritual connection, it releases key endorphins because
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.100]  it's real.
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:30.420]  But the point is, is that there's your problem and I'm not judging you, but wouldn't you
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:33.620]  do anything to get free of this?
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:35.500]  I think I'm doing pretty fine right now, man.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:39.000]  Well, that's good. That's good. That's good news. That's good news. I'm not pushing religion
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.900]  on you. I'm just saying you've got to forgive yourself and know that you were deceived.
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:49.260]  Okay, and then that can because you can consciously forgive yourself, but you need to really forgive
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.500]  yourself. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:55.900]  Yeah, I forgive him. I don't mean I'm still defender of this country. You know what I
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:50:00.380]  mean? We got me and my buddies putting the spell together. You know what I mean? We're
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:03.580]  gonna fight this new world order. You know what I mean? I don't believe it could be changed
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.580]  internally.
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:11.180]  There's only one way to change it. And that's to combat. It's already here. You know what
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.180]  I mean?
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:16.860]  Listen, God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call. Ladies and gentlemen, long before they
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:20.620]  staged 9-11, long before they launched all this, they had this plan with the troops.
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:25.020]  And they know what's gonna end up happening and it's gonna cause a civil war. And I know
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:29.860]  a lot of people are gearing up for military operations against the globalist. And the
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:32.500]  globalist are gonna start it where that's a foregone conclusion.
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.100]  And I just wish everybody would work real hard right now to spread the word instead
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:44.500]  of just getting your firearms ready to kill people that come to take your guns, who themselves
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:48.940]  are just biological robots of the globalist, who will be thrown in the ditch as well. We
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:53.400]  need to reach out to the police and military right now before the civil war starts. God
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:59.020]  help us. We'll be right back with more phone calls. Stay with us.

[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:22.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. And it's so simple. You turn on the news and it's
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:28.020]  all about race and all about division. And if you're a libertarian, you're a racist,
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:32.260]  that's because they're scared of the American people unifying together under the Bill of
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:38.260]  Rights and Constitution. The system is desperate to divide and conquer. And Europe-wide, and
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:41.140]  I've been telling you this for years, they are going to start just taking money right
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:45.860]  out of bank accounts on top of all the new VAT and EU taxes.
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:51.740]  I mean, on average, taxes are above 70% in the euro. And again, guess who's exempt from
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:57.620]  the EU bureaucrats? Do you realize what they're getting away with? Do you realize the magnitude
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:04.780]  that EU bureaucrats are exempt from the EU income tax and the EU VAT? I mean, even saying
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:10.620]  that I feel like a liar, it's so over the top that guys type in EU bureaucrats are exempt
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:13.620]  from taxes, and it'll show mainstream news.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:18.220]  I mean, I can't believe that, it's so over the top. And a lot of people are like, well,
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:24.100]  let them be exempt. I mean, that's what real tyranny is, is when they don't just do horrible
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:31.300]  things, they're exempt from it. I just got chills, because it's all coming true. I've
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.300]  been right about everything.
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:38.060]  You know how horrible that is? It's not good to be right about this. I know why you're
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:44.740]  in denial, I get it, I get it, this is horrible. Gerald Salente is coming up. Let's go to Alex
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:50.920]  in California. This is a non-financial news call, but I guess that's okay. People didn't
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:54.620]  hear me, I really wanna get into your take on, are you ready to have your bank account
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:55.620]  in 401k taken?
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:01.900]  They're announcing that's the next plan. Yeah, bureaucrats told, keep dodging taxes. They
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:06.700]  don't dodge them, the bureaucrats run it. Sorry, go ahead, Alex in California.
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:14.900]  Mr. Jones, very honored. Honored to talk to you. Yeah, jeez, I had a guy come in my coffee
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:20.660]  shop 2007, dropped off in game. And he said, you ought to watch this, and you know what?
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:23.540]  Ever since, man, keep off him.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.580]  So somebody gave you in game and it changed your political perspective forever?
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:33.580]  Of course, they knew that I was talking, I sounded exactly like you. All this stuff,
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:37.180]  I just couldn't put my finger on it. And then they're like, hey, and I was just worrying
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:42.860]  about nice to employ and I was just getting like touching the surface and I'm like, okay,
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:44.780]  yeah, everything makes sense.
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:48.380]  Yeah, and now they're gonna bring in world government and steal everything in front of
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:54.740]  us daring us to start a revolution while they've got all these secret police teams ready. And
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:01.660]  those secret police people are gonna be dead in, I mean, that's the worst position. Oh
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:05.780]  my God, and I think that's one of our only hopes is I've talked to the enforcers across
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:06.780]  the board.
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:11.740]  They're not stupid, especially in tactical units. They know once this stuff starts, it
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:16.840]  is gonna be a shooting gallery on both sides. And it didn't matter if they've got unmarked
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:22.060]  police cars, doesn't matter if they go plain clothes, it doesn't matter. Once this starts,
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:26.420]  once you kill some veteran's buddy, he's going to come after you.
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:30.700]  And it's gonna be some poor patrol cop. I mean, this is gonna be a bloodbath, man. And
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:36.740]  I'm telling you, folks, they're planning this and we've got to stop it. It's all over, I'm
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:39.740]  sorry, I'm ranting, go ahead, caller. Just make your point, I apologize, I'm just-
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:44.820]  No, there's too many points to make, the writing's on the wall. I grew up, I'm 32, I grew up,
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:50.780]  we didn't have, Fremont Police and Oakland East Bay, they have tanks. They can take over
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:51.780]  anything.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:56.040]  I know, I know, they've all been given huge tanks. It's more than 2,700, it's more than
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:02.060]  10,000. And then they have Politico articles saying, I'm insane, they don't exist. Again,
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:07.020]  they've gone full military on us. Listen, when they have tanks ramming your house, they'll
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:12.700]  be saying it isn't a tank. Do people understand that? They're using military tactics on us.
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:13.700]  Anything else?
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:19.980]  You gotta call her, he was saying before, there's no men left in the country and it's
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:25.220]  just so hard. Because it's so dangerous and you're towing the line all day long.
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:29.020]  Well, it's not just that there's no men, they've been putting chemicals in our food and water
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:33.700]  and people are in a trance. These people that are jellyfish are victims, they're under mind
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:35.700]  control. We'll be right back.

[02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:15.700]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:27.380]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:33.420]  Well, I got to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, everything is proceeding as I have foreseen
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:39.980]  it. And it wasn't hard, but I mean, still, it is freaky to know how right we've been
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:43.620]  and I am freaked out. And if you're not freaked out, you're not paying attention. I love that
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:48.480]  bumper sticker. Seen it for 20 years. If you're not freaked out, or if you're not upset, you're
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:49.480]  not paying attention.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:57.460]  And man, it is crazy. It is crazy. The time bomb that the government's gonna try to take
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:01.540]  the guns from the veterans knowing they're gonna start killing people back. And then
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:04.460]  they're gonna call all veterans terrorists, which is already happening. And it's gonna
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:10.060]  be a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it's gonna cause total destabilization countrywide.
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:16.180]  And the globalist want that as part of their IMF plan to implode the confidence. In the
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:21.220]  old government to then say America failed, capitalism failed and bring in even worse
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:28.860]  tyranny. I mean, whoa, this is bad news. This is super ultra bad news on so many fronts
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:31.060]  it makes my head spin.
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:36.740]  Let's go to your phone calls. Gerald Cilenti is coming up. Let's talk to Russell in Ohio.
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:39.740]  Russell, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:46.700]  Hey, sounds like you're calling me on electric shaver, bro. Can you talk right into the phone?
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:49.300]  Yeah, can you hear me better now?
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:50.300]  Are you on a hands free?
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:51.300]  No.
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:55.300]  All right, we'll talk right into your phone, bro. I just wanna be able to hear you.
[02:01:55.300 --> 02:02:01.020]  All right, sorry about that. Well, the reason I'm calling, I'm not calling about the financial
[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:08.460]  news. The real reason that I'm calling, I've been hearing it pretty much nonstop, especially
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:11.900]  in the major media.
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:19.660]  Just the references to Christians, Jews, Muslims, what people that say they are. But the big
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:25.780]  problem that I have is when you look at what they're doing, when you look at their tactics,
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:31.060]  it's obvious that they basically just have their minds taken over by Satan.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:38.880]  No, you're right, but your phone's just too bad, bro. I gotta let you go. Now, society's
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:43.600]  going to decadence. They lose touch with reality. They lose touch with real danger and then
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:47.580]  don't even care. As things start getting worse, they're gonna get more crazy.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:53.220]  They're gonna demand more tyranny. It's like if they have their hand in a garbage disposal
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:58.380]  and it's hurting, so they push their arm in harder. So we're entering a very decadent
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:04.260]  cycle, yes, sir. And then those of us that historically know it and are gearing up, they're
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:08.260]  looking at us like the food going, they're gonna be prepared, they're the terrorist.
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:13.300]  And they're basically gonna make us their slaves in forced labor camps. I mean, all
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:18.540]  these lazy people and bureaucrats aren't gonna stop. We're the food. Mark in Connecticut,
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:19.540]  you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:24.540]  Good day, Alex Jones, how are you? I'm pretty freaked out, it's all unfolding.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:30.580]  Well, I have to tell you, when I first heard you years ago, I didn't have much faith in
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:35.060]  you until I've seen what you said actually come true and now I'm a faithful follower.
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:38.980]  Well, I wish it wasn't coming true, brother. I wish I was a laughingstock, believe me.
[02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:42.980]  But I've studied history. History's a lot crazier than, but go ahead and make your point.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:48.420]  Okay, anyway, I'm a veteran myself. I'm in my late 40s now and I have family that is
[02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:55.380]  now in the military as well. And back in December, I found out that part of my family that is
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:00.380]  in the military is actually in the planning process of the attack on North Korea.
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:04.140]  But before that happened, we're gonna have to have a black flag operation before we can
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:07.100]  actually get everyone else on board to make it happen.
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:12.420]  So he told you in the military, they're saying they're gonna stage a false flag.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:16.420]  Not the false flag party, told me he's in the planning process of the invasion of North
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:17.420]  Korea.
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:20.700]  But did he say they're being told they're gonna do a provocation?
[02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:25.220]  No, they did not. But that's what I fear. That's what I'm afraid of that's gonna happen
[02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:31.060]  because I doubt that North Korea would actually fire on us knowing how stupid that would be.
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:34.700]  Don't underestimate third generational moron dictator. And again, I don't wanna have a
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:38.700]  war but I'd love to see those hardcore commies taken out. The problem is, again, it's part
[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.060]  of a larger staged event.
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:46.460]  You know, I tell you, it's so evil. But I won't lose any sleep if Kim Jong Un ends up
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:50.740]  being six feet under. Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:51.740]  In order.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:52.740]  You what, sir?
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:56.180]  The fighting process is taking.

[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:04.300]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:09.460]  But what do you mean biblical? What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor. Real wrath of
[02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:14.180]  God type stuff. Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.
[02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:19.180]  Forty years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes. The dead rising from the grave. Human sacrifice.
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:26.180]  Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria. I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:33.180]  hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. Live from
[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:43.420]  Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:50.220]  Well the private Federal Reserve's president of the Dallas branch, one of the most powerful
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:55.660]  branches of the private Federal Reserve, has come out and said too big to fail banks are
[02:08:55.660 --> 02:09:02.660]  crony capitalist and that it's going to destroy our economy basically forever. You've also
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:07.200]  got the head of the Kansas City Fed saying similar things because they understand that
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.120]  European banks own part of the Federal Reserve and that it's going to totally gut this country
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:13.420]  like a third world nation.
[02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:18.540]  And there will be no more wealth generation for the general population. We will convert
[02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:24.920]  to something like Mexico or something like Nigeria, which is the plan. And even globalist,
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:31.580]  a lot of them are not wanting to do that because it will really screw society up and they're
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:37.020]  not really agenda 21ers. They're kind of old line parasites and they want to be riding
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:38.020]  a big healthy horse.
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:42.500]  They don't want to butcher the horse and cut it into steaks like the globalists do. The
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:46.380]  globalists want to fully conquer this country. That is the globalists that are in charge,
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:53.380]  the kind of leftist globalists that are really authoritarians. Now joining us is Gerald Cilente
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:10:00.100]  and here's his economic martial law top trends for 2012.
[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:05.420]  And we'll do a document cam shot of that for the viewers right here in the general document
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:12.420]  cam shot area. And there it is for viewers out there, top 12 trends and he said this
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:20.240]  a year and a half ago. This came out before 2012 or almost two years ago and said there'll
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.540]  be bank runs, there'll be bank holidays.
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:29.060]  He did a little song on air, it's a holiday. He said it would start in the Mediterranean
[02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:35.600]  in Europe and now it has. And he said when they start taking 10% or so out of bank accounts,
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:40.300]  it's big trouble. And we're actually digging up and we should have it, we've actually found
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:41.740]  it but we're transferring it.
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:46.540]  We're actually digging up some of the times Gerald has said this. And now he's gonna tell
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:52.360]  us what comes next after this. And don't forget, after he predicted all of this, his own private
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:56.820]  gold account got bought, a company he'd been trading with for 30 years or so.
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:11:02.020]  It got bought by MF Global unbeknownst to him and they just took his money and took
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:07.180]  billions of other people's dollars. And now they're saying 40 billion of it still hasn't
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:12.220]  been paid back even though it's been in bankruptcy. So there's a couple billion totally stolen
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:16.520]  and they've given some of it back. But then 40 billion total to just general creditors
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:19.300]  of MF Global itself, but he wasn't part of that.
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:24.900]  He just had a bank account they grabbed. And now they're calling it a tax when foreign
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:29.820]  banks, Cyprus won't even vote right now because of the bank holiday and the shutdown and the
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:34.140]  fire bombings. So now the euro says, well, we have the power just to do it anyways. We
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:40.180]  put Mario Draghi over Italy, we put other people over Greece, we did that in Ireland.
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:45.020]  We're just gonna take over. So this is the imperial banking takeover, trends journal
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:53.680]  head, top trends forecaster Gerald Cilente joins us right now, trendsjournal.com. Gerald,
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:12:00.020]  break down what this means, what we're facing and now where you see this acceleration going.
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:05.980]  All right, first, very important, the trend tracking tip, I write about it all the time.
[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:12.280]  They always do things on the weekends so they freeze the people out, whether reporting on
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:19.480]  news that they're obligated to report on or pulling scams like this. So after the markets
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:27.480]  close, they always do the dirty deal, whether it's a downgrade of a country's credit worthiness,
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:32.260]  releasing information about a big lie that they were covering up and are obligated to
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:38.640]  tell it about. They always do it after the markets close, after it's too late. And this
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:45.180]  way it stabilizes the markets. It gives them time to rig it during the weekend so it doesn't
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:52.300]  go down as much as it should. So again, this came out on a weekend, froze everybody out,
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:57.320]  couldn't get their dough out, number one. Number two, what you said, the white shoe
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:03.540]  boy lingo, how about calling it a tax on deposits?
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:08.920]  Isn't that a nice word? How about stealing your damn money? So they call it white shoe
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:15.480]  boy language to make it seem softer. The other thing, another beautiful term, white shoe
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:23.920]  boy language, they're giving depositors a haircut. They're stealing their money. So
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:29.560]  now the other thing to watch out, because this is a big picture that's unfolding. Watch
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:35.200]  the prostitutes, listen to them. Anybody could do it. It's all going to be put up in a little
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:44.920]  while. Go to CNBC, the flunkies for the money junkies. All they did was spend about 15 minutes
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:53.720]  talking about how Cyprus was a haven for money laundering for the Russian criminals.
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:58.560]  So now the entire public deserves it because there's money laundering when the mega banks,
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:04.280]  the Federal Reserve, has been caught with over 400 billion in Wachovia and Wells Fargo
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:09.040]  banks and got in no trouble. That's Bloomberg AP, exactly. They're gonna criminalize all
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:13.880]  of us. Well, bank money's dirty. So we're taking, whether you're a fireman, a teacher,
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:22.100]  a cop, a psychologist, a farmer, an auto mechanic, all of you get 10% of your money taken cuz
[02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:24.560]  you're a gangster.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:31.400]  Exactly. But you see what they're doing though, Alex, the story's much bigger. This new prime
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:38.900]  minister they just put in in Japan, the head of Japan, the president of the party, Xi.
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:48.960]  His first stop, Xi's first stop, his A-Z-I, X-I and Xi, his first stop was to go see Putin.
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:55.140]  This is really an attack on Russia. You're talking about money laundering. Hey, everybody
[02:14:55.140 --> 02:15:03.080]  here, the Grand Cayman Islands, the big grand scheme. Did anybody ever hear of the HSBC
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:04.360]  money laundering scandal?
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:08.840]  Ever heard of Switzerland? Ever heard of Luxembourg? Ever heard of Monte Carlo?
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:16.120]  Exactly. So what did HSBC just pay? Almost $2 billion worth of fines in December for
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:22.320]  money laundering. So what they're doing is they're making this seem like a convoluted
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:23.320]  issue.
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:29.280]  The other important point, we're only talking about a $10 billion bailout here. This isn't
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:37.600]  a big one. It shows you the fragility of the entire system. The next important point you're
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:45.000]  hearing now from the American Banking Association from DC, don't worry about it Americans, your
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  money's insured. Yeah, just like it's insured over there in Cyprus. As a member of the Euro
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:56.960]  zone, the money's supposed to be insured for 100,000 euros, about 125,000 euros.
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:59.480]  But it's not insured from them stealing it.
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:06.220]  Exactly. But here's what I believe they're going to do. When the crisis starts spreading,
[02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:11.680]  what they're going to do, they're going to devalue the currencies. So they're gonna say,
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:17.120]  yeah, yeah, don't worry, your money is insured. But guess what? It's only worth a fraction
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:20.320]  of what it is. There's a precedent for this.
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.880]  And they'll do it during the holiday. Maybe that little holiday dance.
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.160]  That's right. We're going to send you the videos of me doing that. You should be receiving
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:39.040]  them momentarily. But here's the rub. When they did it in the United States in 1933,
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:48.480]  they called a bank holiday and they did it by devaluing the currency. Because in those
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:55.720]  days, gold was pegged to the dollar, or excuse me, the dollar was pegged to gold. The dollar
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:04.880]  was pegged to gold at about $20.65 an ounce or thereabouts. After they stole all the people's
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:12.600]  gold and made them give it back on the penalty of law, they then repaid the price of a dollar
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:22.720]  to gold to $35 an ounce, which means that you lost 70% of your purchasing power.
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:29.060]  So don't worry, your money's guaranteed. You're going to get it back. But guess what, Jack?
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:35.000]  It's going to be worth a fraction of what it was before. And that's why you're seeing
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:42.720]  now as we speak, gold prices are again moving back up. And then all of a sudden, they're
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:49.720]  again saying, hey, gold is a safe haven. No kidding.
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:54.340]  Amazing, and they've been using naked shorting to try to drive it down. While you can pull
[02:17:54.340 --> 02:18:00.240]  it up, George Soros institutions, the communist Chinese government have been snatching gold
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:03.040]  as fast as they can.
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:10.080]  Right, and now we're looking also, when you're looking at the fragility of all this, yes,
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:19.120]  you know, the GDP, the banking to GDP is eight times that in Cyprus. It's eight times a GDP,
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:24.360]  which is very large. And it is a banking hub and they were trying to establish themselves
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:28.440]  like a Caymans Island, like an alternative to Switzerland.
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:37.080]  But remember, their GDP is only 0.2% of the entire Eurozone. This is chump change.
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:40.680]  Well, here's my next point. Just like you said they had to steal a few billion of people's
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.060]  money to prop up all of MF Global to show the fragility and didn't get in trouble.
[02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:49.680]  But you said this will only encourage them now to start stealing more. This is a small
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:54.680]  bite test. They want to see if it panics things too much. They'll back off and only take maybe
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:57.000]  5%, 7% now they're talking about.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.600]  Do you agree that's what this is, is a trial balloon?
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:06.940]  I definitely agree with it. I definitely agree. You know, there are two things, two stories
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:13.860]  that should ring in everybody's mind that tell you what it's all about. One, not having
[02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:18.280]  to do with this, but it will have to do with it later as we get closer to war, is General
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:23.440]  Dwight D. Eisenhower warning the nation that the military industrial complex was taking
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:29.400]  it over. A five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and for all those Republicans
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:32.400]  out there, a two-term Republican president.
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:39.440]  The other one is the story of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, becoming violent and
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:45.360]  picking up a whip to drive the money changers out of the temple. This has been going on
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.720]  forever. These are money changers.
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:53.680]  It's fraudsters. They were making people give them 10 silver coins for one silver coin that
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:58.840]  the rabbis would only take to pay for the offerings and ripping everybody off. And by
[02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:06.240]  doing that, by making them pay to make an offering to God, by turning that into a blasphemy,
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:11.440]  they were able to take over that entire society and he physically attacked them.
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:18.280]  Exactly. So those two stories should stick in everyone's head. Look, James Madison, anybody
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:24.720]  could Google it up. He called them money changers. Now they call them, again, they changed the
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:27.280]  name. They put white shoe boy language on it.
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:30.080]  Andrew Jackson called them vipers.
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:38.060]  Yeah, exactly. So nothing has changed. So when you go back to the meeting in Brussels
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:45.120]  over the weekend, oh, by the way, the people in Cyprus, like the people in Greece, like
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:53.920]  the people in Spain, like the people in Portugal, like the people in Ireland, they all deserve
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:21:01.600]  what they get because guess what? Just like the people in the United States, they voted
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:06.480]  to put these lying slime balls into office.
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:13.360]  They just had an election in Cyprus a couple of weeks ago and this prime minister, the
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:20.760]  new president, he vowed that he would never do this. You listen to the finance chairman
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:27.040]  of the Cypriot government just a week ago saying that to steal the money, but of course
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:33.640]  they didn't use that language from the depositors or tax the depositors was a stupid idea.
[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:37.760]  And by the way, remember they've signed on to all the Euro debt. Most of this is propping
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:44.080]  up derivatives and we're giving 85 billion a month and what half of it to foreign banks
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:49.000]  as part of QE infinity. Gerald, we just skipped this network break to have more time. What
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:55.840]  do you expect to happen as they go into overdrive as currencies race to devalue each other and
[02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:59.120]  more and more of the inflation is upticking?
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:02.520]  Now what are you calling to happen next?
[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:08.280]  This Eurozone issue is falling apart. Here's the big one going on in Italy. They still
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:14.240]  have informed the government and being Italian, I'm really proud of the Italians for this
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:20.000]  one in pushing forward Beppe Grillo's five star movement. And that's another little story
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  by the way.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.160]  That's right. Beppe Grillo said last week, I have the London Telegraph here just to back
[02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:31.040]  you up. He said, quote, the Northern European countries are only holding onto us until the
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:35.960]  banks have recouped their investments in Italian sovereign bonds. Then they'll drop us like
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:36.960]  a hot potato.
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:43.680]  He went on to say that Mario Monti is nothing but a receivership arm for their planned bankruptcy.
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:44.680]  And he said-
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:45.680]  Exactly.
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:46.680]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:51.580]  And so, but it's important for everyone because of the people that listen to your station
[02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:56.280]  and subscribe to our trends journal and follow our information. There are people that want
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:01.280]  to do something to make a change. And it's very important. That's the model. We're gonna
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:05.200]  be writing a lot about it in the April trends journal.
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:12.580]  It was a movement, not a protest. Protests come and they go. Movements stay. And this
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:18.000]  movement, so you're asking me what's going to happen. What's going to happen is you're
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:25.500]  going to start seeing more movements taking place in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal. There's
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:32.840]  going to be revolutions. They're not able to hold this together. You mentioned the quantitative
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:39.480]  easing lines, the baloney. They only are keeping this together by dumping all of this
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:45.760]  money into the system. It's not working. It's only saving the too big to fails that as we
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:52.200]  now heard from our Attorney General, Eric Himmler Holder, that these two banks are too
[02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:54.580]  big to prosecute in essence.
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:24:00.820]  They cannot keep this together. It's going to unravel. When will it fall apart? I don't
[02:24:00.820 --> 02:24:08.340]  know because here's why I don't know. I know when it should happen, but it's like being
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:13.980]  a card counter. Going to Las Vegas, you're a great card counter, but you're losing every
[02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:19.860]  hand. And then you find out that they put another 30 cards in the deck.
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:22.440]  That's right. That's what they're doing. They keep changing
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:26.820]  the deck. That's right. We've reached into such an Alice in Wonderland that they said
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:32.160]  we left recession five years ago. And by every real estimate, by all the top private experts
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:36.580]  and using old numbers, old ways to break things down, we're in a depression.
[02:24:36.580 --> 02:24:41.220]  But they just use mind control to say that we're not. And then they replace beef with
[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:46.760]  horse meat. They put more air in the chip packages. They adulterate the fuel. They do
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:52.760]  everything they can to paper this over. But more and more, the paper is peeling away.
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:56.100]  But going back to the Justice Department, when they come out last year and this year
[02:24:56.100 --> 02:25:02.900]  and say too big to prosecute, banks are allowed to launder 400 plus billion now in drug money.
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:07.300]  The troops are ordered to grow the opium. Yeah, we're gonna have warrantless checkpoints.
[02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:12.660]  Yeah, we're gonna arrest you for filming police in public. All this police state, when they
[02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:17.820]  do that, it's more than too big to fail. It is a green light for corporate and government
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:20.540]  crime. It is above the law.
[02:25:20.540 --> 02:25:25.580]  They are trumpeting that we're above the law. And Gerald, let me tell you this. We're seeing
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:31.900]  armed troops show up everywhere now. A National Guard, you name it, at checkpoints, even in
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:37.140]  Austin. We're seeing TSA highway checkpoints expand, special forces operations. And I've
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:41.340]  talked to the troops, they've been told, even when you're off duty, wear your uniform, wear
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:46.860]  your battle belt, wear your weapons in public to get everybody ready.
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:51.340]  And they say, ready for what? Well, for collapse and gun confiscation. And I'm telling you,
[02:25:51.340 --> 02:25:56.480]  Gerald, if they try the gun confiscation, it is going to erupt into a civil war, which
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:01.660]  is what they want. I think they wanna start a civil war ahead of the collapse to blame
[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.820]  the collapse on the civil war.
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:08.820]  What do you say about that? The move to get our guns, the two billion bullets, the armored
[02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:12.260]  vehicles, while they deny they're doing it?
[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:18.300]  Well, again, they'll use something like they did with the tragedy at Sandy Hook. It doesn't
[02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:24.300]  even have to be a big one. And they'll use that as an excuse to clamp down on us. And
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:31.180]  as you keep reporting, I go to your site virtually every day, and you keep putting out the information
[02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:37.700]  when Homeland Security is doing the billions of rounds of ammunition they're buying, the
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:40.660]  armored personnel carriers, etc.
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:49.220]  They know what's coming down. They may be stupid, but they're very shrewd. And they're
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:55.560]  seeing it collapsing. And you really nailed it, Alex, when you said, are they using this
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:27:03.580]  as a trial balloon? Yes, they are. It's Cyprus. Nobody could find this damn place on the map
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:08.700]  if you didn't show 80% of the people or more where it is.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:16.540]  As I said, it's only 0.2% of the entire Eurozone's GDP. So they're the test case.
[02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:20.940]  That's right. What do you make of the Russian fleet about to arrive? I mean, this sounds
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:25.860]  like the beginning of World War I or World War II. It's all the same military drawing
[02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:32.460]  battle lines, all this craziness, all so the bankers can play big guy and take over.
[02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:39.660]  Again, I've been saying this over and over again. History is repeating itself. The crash
[02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:47.180]  of 1929, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war. And we're going back
[02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:52.560]  into it. Look at the words that just came out from the Communist Party meeting. They
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:28:00.100]  only go every 10 years. And so there's been a lot of news coming out. It's a remilitarization.
[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:07.100]  And the Chinese and Russians against NATO. The alliances are already forming.
[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:10.500]  And they're proxy North Korea now threatening to nuke everyone. I mean, they're kicking
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:12.180]  off a new war.
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:18.140]  Well, again, whether I don't know if North Korea is going to nuke everyone, but I do
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:21.060]  know that the United States, oh, here's-
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:24.740]  Sure, I'm in new battle lines, a new Cold War. Yeah, you're right. Go ahead.
[02:28:24.740 --> 02:28:30.140]  How about this for a waste of money? Did you hear over the weekend they're going to put
[02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:41.540]  more missile systems on the West Coast just in case North Korea is going to bomb California?
[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:48.420]  I mean, you want to talk about a waste of money? Here we are going down the toilet financially
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:54.740]  and they just found a couple of billion dollars more to put up missile systems that are at
[02:28:54.740 --> 02:29:03.100]  best only 50% accurate and against nothing. So what they're doing, Alex, is they're beating
[02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:09.940]  the war drums. So when you're asking about the Russian fleet moving in, the Russians,
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:20.060]  the Iranians, and China on one side, NATO, the United States, and the Arab Little League
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:23.900]  on the other side.
[02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:27.860]  It's incredible. Meanwhile, the globalists are above it all playing all the sides off
[02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:32.260]  and using uncertainty to consolidate power, using rioting to implode countries that's
[02:29:32.260 --> 02:29:36.760]  in all their own documents. Gerald Cilenti, I want to talk about solutions and more trends

[02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:12.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Look at this report from Fox News. DIMMS preserve
[02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:18.620]  US Mexico food stamp partnership to advertise in Mexico for illegals to come to the US and
[02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:24.380]  get food stamps, anything to bankrupt the country, anything to balkanize the nation.
[02:33:24.380 --> 02:33:29.480]  While USDA prepares for meat inspector furloughs, all they do is just radiate it now and they
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:35.060]  spray weird live vaccines on it, these viruses that eat the bacteria. I mean, it's just Franken
[02:33:35.060 --> 02:33:43.100]  foods and the article goes over all the bizarreness about the partnership with Mexican government
[02:33:43.100 --> 02:33:48.140]  to raise awareness about food stamps among immigrants from that country. The Californian
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:52.300]  government, I remember I learned this 15 years ago, I even saw the ads, I was sent the newspaper
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:58.540]  by listeners in San Diego where the government, the state put ads in the newspapers in San
[02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:04.260]  Diego but also in Mexican papers saying, come to America, have your baby for free. I mean,
[02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:06.220]  anything to bankrupt the country.
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:12.340]  Can I go to Mexico and have a baby for free? I mean, again, missiles that don't do anything
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:17.100]  on the West Coast, our own government helping give North Korea the nuclear reactors under
[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:21.340]  ABB, under Clinton and Rumsfeld was involved as the head of the company. Look at these
[02:34:21.340 --> 02:34:27.340]  articles on Drudge, new EU bailout plans, steal bank accounts, islands set to seize
[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:32.260]  personal savings, plan moves ahead as vote delayed.
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:35.420]  So they're like, you're not gonna vote for it? We're still gonna do it. Putin, unfair
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:40.620]  dangerous. Here come the bank runs. Germany, not our idea. Will Italy follow? And that's
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:44.660]  at infowars.com article that I wanted to ask Gerald Cilenti about. We're gonna bring Ted
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:49.120]  Anderson up for about three minutes to get his take as a 30 year gold and silver broker
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:53.420]  and owner of this network and also tell you about modest resources briefly.
[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:58.780]  Bank chief calls for 15% looting of Italian savings. Is the financial rape of Cyprus another
[02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:06.620]  IMF riot waiting to happen? And then it's got the releases here where the German bank
[02:35:06.620 --> 02:35:13.340]  chief with their central bank has come out and said that we need to have 15% of the Italians
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:19.100]  money to not even back up their debts, but to put it into EU general debts as the EU
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:20.380]  bureaucrats are exempt.

[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:37.380]  with the Italians if they're already on the edge of revolt over all the new VAT taxes
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:39.020]  and stuff?
[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:42.980]  And the head of the IMF says they should work six, seven days a week and pay more money.
[02:35:42.980 --> 02:35:49.260]  What's gonna happen now when they try to come and say, Italians are criminals. Every man,
[02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:52.740]  woman and child, we're gonna take their money. What do you think that's gonna do?
[02:35:52.740 --> 02:36:00.000]  Again, we've been writing about this, Alex. It's class warfare. That's all this is. You
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.020]  have a bunch of money junkies at the top sucking everything out of the system. Whether it's
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:10.380]  in Egypt, whether it's no Arab Spring, whether it's Tunisia, any of these countries, it's
[02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:16.180]  a couple of people and their buddies on the top, just like the United States where the
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:22.900]  1% gets all the gains and the rest of us go down. You saw the personal income data that
[02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:25.940]  came out a couple of weeks ago.
[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:32.720]  What did it decline, 3.6%? So what's happening is the people have had it. And you know my
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:38.740]  saying, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it. And they're
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:45.000]  losing it. They've had enough. They've had enough of this criminality. And the only thing
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.520]  the politicians are, are the wise guys for the crime bosses.
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:57.460]  And the crime bosses are the Goldman Sachs gang, and the Merrill Lynch mob, and the JP
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:03.900]  Morgan Chase criminals. I mean, you read the paper what happened with this so-called London
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:09.580]  whale thing, and how they cooked all the books with JP Morgan Chase. Any of us, if we did
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:11.220]  it, they'd have us locked up.
[02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:16.660]  You don't see any heads roll, and the people losing their homes. I have friends in Greece.
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:23.400]  I have friends in Spain and in Italy. I have people in Portugal. They keep telling me with
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:25.700]  a suffering that people are going through.
[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:29.980]  It's hellish, and that's not in our news. Tell folks what Europe's like. It's in their
[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:34.860]  news, but people don't know, babies being left, bankruptcy, whole thousands of people
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:41.820]  begging for food out of dumpsters. If a truck dumps a few fruits on the ground, there's
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:47.660]  riots. This is happening all over Southern Europe, the Mediterranean. It's starting into
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:48.660]  Western Europe.
[02:37:48.660 --> 02:37:53.100]  Do people have any idea how big a powder keg this is? And then the government of Europe
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:59.140]  is arming itself and aiming its weapons outward, just incredible tyranny. And how they exempt
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:38:03.620]  themselves. I keep going back to that, how the EU bureaucrats exempt themselves from
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:05.900]  the EU wide VAT and income tax.
[02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:10.580]  I mean, they should all be arrested right there. Look at Libor, all of it rigged against
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:15.100]  the people. They should all go to jail, but they don't. So why shouldn't they steal more?
[02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:19.780]  Because they wanna make everybody poor as a tool of control. And thank God we've got
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:24.540]  guns, Gerald, because just the fact the guns are there, they're afraid to really rape us
[02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:26.640]  as hard as they are the Europeans.
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:33.940]  The biggest mistake that this administration made in my estimation is this whole push for
[02:38:33.940 --> 02:38:39.900]  gun control. Because what they did was they rallied a group of people that may have not
[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:47.300]  been rallied before. So now more people have come under the umbrella. The umbrella of losing
[02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:54.080]  your individual rights. This isn't about guns, it's about rights. And they keep being taken
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:59.740]  away from us. It was a huge mistake they made, because they brought in millions and millions
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:04.880]  of people that probably wouldn't have given a damn about other issues.
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:10.460]  But now it's hitting them. It's hitting their own psychology before it was out of their
[02:39:10.460 --> 02:39:16.700]  minds. If they, so what, there's warrantless wiretapping. Yeah, it sounds terrible, but
[02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:22.900]  what do I care? So what about the National Defense Authorization Act? It doesn't affect
[02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:29.540]  me. But now it's a direct effect and it brought a lot more people into the fold. And going
[02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:38.160]  back to what's going on in Europe, again, look who's running the central bank in Europe.
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:47.460]  Mario Draghi. Who is Mario Draghi? He was a former vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs
[02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:56.620]  European division. Who's the guy that's taking over now at the Bank of England? Mark Carney.
[02:39:56.620 --> 02:40:03.420]  Who was he with? Goldman Sachs. Who was the guy that started this whole too big to fail
[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:10.760]  scam going? Henry Paulson, former treasury secretary under George Bush. Where was he
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:17.620]  before he came here? The chairman of Goldman Sachs. Who was the guy that deregulated Glass
[02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:24.740]  Steagall, got it into motion under Clinton? Could have been Robert Rubin, could it? No,
[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:28.360]  he was with Goldman Sachs too and the chairman.
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:38.340]  Can anybody put this together? It's a banking takeover worldwide. That's all this is. And
[02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:44.460]  what they're going to do, I believe in, here's the message I wanna tell everybody. If you
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:50.620]  think you have your money in the bank and it's yours, you better grow up. And I've told
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:56.800]  everyone the stories of what's happened to me several times, trying to withdraw sizable
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:57.800]  deposits.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:02.860]  Every time you're on, you say they will take your money out of the bank. They will just
[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:07.600]  grab it. They will take percentages. Now they're saying they're gonna take 401ks. Now they're
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:12.040]  ordering companies who invest in too big to fail bonds. I mean, it's on. They are going
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:16.740]  to steal everything in increments and my wife's going to get a few thousand dollars.
[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:19.660]  And they freak out and ask her if she's a criminal. And she's like, we've been at this
[02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:24.780]  bank for five years. I mean, again, they're the crooks.
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:29.940]  And another thing that we did on the trends in the news, we sent you that video. On February
[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:39.220]  27th, we said, watch out, stay very closely tuned to what's going on in March. March or
[02:41:39.220 --> 02:41:46.220]  April, we said something is going to come down. I went back to our 1999 trend forecast
[02:41:46.220 --> 02:41:51.940]  of the dot com bubble burst. It's right there on the trends journal on our site, trendsjournal.com.
[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:59.420]  And I said the dot com bubble would burst by the second quarter of 2000. It blew apart
[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:04.980]  in March. March is one of those months like October.
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:10.300]  You could go throughout history. You always see it repeating itself. This Cyprus issue,
[02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:18.140]  although it's a small country, it's a huge event. In days, if not weeks, it'll be forgotten
[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:24.460]  by most people. And then they're gonna wake up to it. Most won't wake up to it. The next
[02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:32.660]  thing is going to hit is going to be a major hit from either Spain, Portugal, or Italy.
[02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:40.460]  And my money's on Italy, because in Italy, they cannot form a government. Beppe Grillo
[02:42:40.460 --> 02:42:47.800]  will have no part of the corrupt system that's in place. When will the people wise up? Nothing
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:52.540]  is going to change in this country with the systems that are in place now.
[02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:56.820]  So the bottom line is pull your money out of the bank. That's what you're saying personally.
[02:42:56.820 --> 02:43:03.340]  That's what everybody in my view needs to do. Because ladies and gentlemen, the system
[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:08.060]  will steal your money and is arming against us like common criminals. I wanna bring Ted
[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:09.060]  Anderson up.
[02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:14.180]  Wait, I wanna say that. I'm not telling people what to do. Cuz if anything, I'm only speaking
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:15.180]  for myself.
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:20.220]  No, no, I said I personally. I personally, but we have listeners calling in saying what
[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:23.900]  will it do if everybody worldwide tried to pull in their money out of the bank ahead
[02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:25.580]  of them doing this incrementally?
[02:43:25.580 --> 02:43:31.580]  I believe it'll straighten the system out.
[02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:37.060]  But I mean, there's only 2, 3% actual cash on average for Europe and the US for actual
[02:43:37.060 --> 02:43:40.740]  money out there. Do you think that would send a shot across their bow?
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:45.260]  Yeah, yeah, straight. It'll bring down these too big to fail so we can get business going
[02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:53.100]  again. So local banks can start building again. So what do they have? Over 80% of the action,
[02:43:53.100 --> 02:43:54.100]  seven banks?
[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:55.100]  Sure.
[02:43:55.100 --> 02:43:56.660]  Who made this stuff up? It's a monopoly.
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:44:01.580]  We do have that video clip. It says February 27th, but was this a year ago or two years
[02:44:01.580 --> 02:44:02.580]  ago?
[02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:06.700]  No, no, it was this past February, a couple of weeks ago. I said watch out what's going
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:08.220]  to happen in March.
[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:11.700]  Okay, but I remember you years ago talking-
[02:44:11.700 --> 02:44:17.620]  That's the bank, no, that comes later on. That's the watching out in March. Later on
[02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:21.340]  after that clip are the other ones about the holidays.
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:25.900]  Okay, so is it all one clip guys or is it multiple clips? Cuz my issue is we just got
[02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:30.900]  this and I wanna play it. Okay, so we were sent one clip. Gerald, are you saying in the
[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:33.900]  one clip is a group of clips of you predicting it?
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:40.620]  Yes, go past the February 27th one and go to the bank holiday ones.
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:45.060]  Okay, well, while we're finding that in the clip, I wanna bring Ted Anderson up. Because
[02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:50.820]  again, I'm the same way as Gerald. I'm not gonna tell you what I think you should do.
[02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:58.660]  But I personally have bought firearms, a rural property, and gold and silver and it is all
[02:44:58.660 --> 02:45:02.900]  done very, very well. But I don't have it to do well. I do it because I can't trust
[02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:04.580]  this criminal system.
[02:45:04.580 --> 02:45:08.800]  And I wanna bring Ted Anderson up to get his brief take on all this because he's predicted
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:12.820]  this for many years as well. I mean, this is what governments do. Ted, how close do
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:18.140]  you think we're getting towards a more accelerated meltdown? They had to know this was gonna
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:19.740]  cause a panic.
[02:45:19.740 --> 02:45:22.740]  Do you agree with Gerald and I that they did this as a trial balloon?
[02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:28.380]  Well, Alex, when you see a place like Cyprus falling apart and causing problems, I mean,
[02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:34.140]  we're talking about a little blip on the map. This is not a big economic superpower. And
[02:45:34.140 --> 02:45:40.180]  yet, it drives the value of gold right over $1,600 an ounce. We've seen a $50 increase
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:46.100]  there. Silver is up too. I mean, obviously, we have a lot of problems in the economy.
[02:45:46.100 --> 02:45:50.500]  The Fed and the central banks of the world are trying to prop up this whole thing by
[02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:57.220]  keeping the interest rates low. Meanwhile, taking care of, like you guys have been talking
[02:45:57.220 --> 02:46:01.900]  about, they're just taking care of their own, that's all. They're destroying the economy
[02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:08.500]  for everybody else. But they're bailing out the too big to fail, just like Gerald is saying.
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:15.100]  We're right on the edge. We're under the cusp of a huge problem. And it's so mind boggling
[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:19.820]  that things are holding together, but it's like stuck together with tax and staples.
[02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:20.820]  I mean, this is-
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:24.240]  Absolutely. Well, you've got that free report, 10 Reasons to Own Gold for People to Make
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:29.420]  Their Own Decision, Their Own Research. But I personally am making the decision. I don't
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:32.860]  even have that much money in the bank anyways. I've invested it all, getting the word out
[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:36.860]  here at mfullwars.com. But I mean, it's time to just realize that you can't even have operating
[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:41.860]  capital hardly in the bank for our news operation because they could steal that and then we're
[02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:42.860]  just shut down.
[02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:48.140]  I mean, it's really crazy. And it's gonna hurt business that banks and government are
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:52.320]  so untrustworthy. And that's part of what collapses society. I hope people will give
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:56.800]  Minus Resources a call and will check out the great gold and silver deals you've got
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:00.700]  because I believe now is the time to get involved and I personally am gonna double down.
[02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:05.320]  I mean, look at this article I've got from Bloomberg last year, Soros Buying Gold as
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:14.060]  Record Prices Seen on Stimulus. Give Minus a call at 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237. And
[02:47:14.060 --> 02:47:18.300]  again, Ted's a big sponsor of the show and also the owner of the Radio Network and just
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:20.980]  the best gold and silver broker out there in my humble view.
[02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:25.140]  But going back to Gerald, Gerald, is there anything you personally wanna add on this
[02:47:25.140 --> 02:47:30.060]  banking issue with how you tried to get money out before not even that much and act like
[02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:36.020]  you're some type of criminal and how this hurts the economy that banks can't be trusted
[02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:37.020]  now?
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:40.860]  Well, again, you mentioned about how they're rigging everything. You mentioned about the
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:46.740]  LIBOR. And we're talking about what, about $600 trillion worth of rigging? And then you
[02:47:46.740 --> 02:47:51.460]  wanna see a rig that's right in front of everybody's eyes? How about the bond market? You don't
[02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:57.500]  have to make it up. You see the money that they're dumping into the system every year,
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:48:04.120]  every month, 85 billion plus that we don't know about beyond the 85 billion that we know.
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:10.920]  So what I'm saying is for people to use their own common sense, look what's going on. Do
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:17.540]  you think that Europeans right now aren't pulling their money out of their bank accounts?
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:24.020]  Don't you think that they're freaking out because they see what's going on? This deal,
[02:48:24.020 --> 02:48:29.500]  when I've been reading everything coming out on it, when the people from Cyprus, the president
[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:36.740]  and the finance minister, went to Brussels, the deal was already done. The Germans told
[02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:43.500]  them what they were going to do, and they were going to take the money from the depositors.
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:49.140]  And where's the money going? The money is going, it's not, they talk about the banks
[02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:54.800]  in Cyprus and they talk about the banks in Italy and in Spain. No, no. These are the
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:02.100]  big German banks, the Finnish banks, the Dutch banks, the Belgian banks that loaned all these
[02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:08.780]  banks in the smaller countries the money to loan out. They didn't get that money on their
[02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:14.060]  own. So what they're doing is they're really taking this money from the bottom so they
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:17.280]  could pay off the big guys at the top.
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:24.380]  So all I'm saying is if anybody thinks that they're not going to screw you, well, good
[02:49:24.380 --> 02:49:30.660]  for you. And you personally, I know Ted's more than half into gold and investments and
[02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:36.420]  savings. You personally are a firm believer in gold and silver. All my investments are
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:42.940]  in gold and silver. And the only other investments I have are the historic buildings that I buy
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:47.840]  in colonial Kingston, because this is where the first American Revolution had a lot of
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:53.860]  its roots and I want to do the second one. Other than that, that's it. Gold and silver
[02:49:53.860 --> 02:50:00.180]  and a good friend of mine, I think has the best strategy. Every month he buys what he
[02:50:00.180 --> 02:50:08.100]  can afford in gold and silver. So you think about it. You just saw gold go down to 15.
[02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:14.340]  I forgot what the low was in this recent downturn. And now it's back over 1600. So when you keep
[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:20.140]  buying every month, then you start seeing this thing really averaging out. Oh, and by
[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:27.140]  the way, for all of those people that watch CNBC and believe the hype and how wonderful
[02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:33.540]  the markets are doing, check it out. When the markets were where they are now back in
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:43.780]  2007, I think gold was about seven hundred and sixty something dollars around there.
[02:50:43.780 --> 02:50:49.620]  What's it now? Sixteen hundred. Oh, and what's the market now? Oh, it got back to where it
[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:54.980]  was in 2007. And it's with devalued dollars, so it's inflationary. We'll be right back
[02:50:54.980 --> 02:50:59.940]  with his prediction. If you're listening, you know, your basic freedoms are being threatened
[02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:04.420]  every day. If you're listening, you know, the economy is not getting better. You know,

[02:52:00.300 --> 02:52:06.020]  item in a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun. But the
[02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:11.780]  correct answer will shock you. I just created a free video at Crisis one two three dot com
[02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:17.220]  that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. Ninety seven
[02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:21.600]  percent of Americans don't have this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:26.640]  a thought. And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis
[02:52:26.640 --> 02:52:31.320]  hits and a starving mob is right outside your door. But I have to tell you, it could literally
[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:35.780]  make the difference between life and death for you and your family. Watch my video at

[02:52:55.660 --> 02:53:00.700]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step outside the box.
[02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:06.020]  I want you to know some very important information. In nineteen eighty five, President Ronald Reagan
[02:53:06.020 --> 02:53:10.140]  requested that carnivore be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[02:53:10.140 --> 02:53:15.620]  president could obtain this world class healer. Now, twenty seven years later, carnivore capsules
[02:53:15.620 --> 02:53:20.260]  are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved

[02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:24.420]  well, this is devil out in the open, not devil in disguise. The New World Order trends journal
[02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:25.420]  dot com.
[02:54:25.420 --> 02:54:28.220]  He's gonna do 30 minutes of overdrive with us. Ted's gonna pop in a little bit in the
[02:54:28.220 --> 02:54:31.860]  next segment. We're gonna take a few calls. People don't want to talk to Gerald at eight
[02:54:31.860 --> 02:54:37.380]  hundred to five at nine nine two three one. Now we've got predictions here in this compilation
[02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:43.160]  he sent us from last year in June. But here's the first one. I think February twenty seventh
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:48.660]  of this year, just a month or so ago, predicting what we're now seeing unfold.
[02:54:48.660 --> 02:54:53.940]  So now TV viewers can see the dates for radio listeners. I'll mention the date during the
[02:54:53.940 --> 02:54:58.260]  clips. This will take us to the end of the hour. Then we'll come back with Gerald's response.
[02:54:58.260 --> 02:54:59.700]  Let's go to the first clip.
[02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:08.300]  He puts case for benefits of easing Fed chairman in combative mood as he defends continuing
[02:55:08.300 --> 02:55:15.180]  asset purchases. Ben Bernanke's mission for his trip to Congress yesterday was to explain
[02:55:15.180 --> 02:55:22.680]  why the benefits of the U.S. Federal Reserve's third eighty five billion dollar a month round
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:30.260]  of quantitative easing will outweigh its costs and risks. So let's make this one hundred
[02:55:30.260 --> 02:55:36.260]  percent clear. The only reason these markets are improving is because of all this cheap
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:44.620]  money being flooded into it. March is an important month. If you go back to October of nineteen
[02:55:44.620 --> 02:55:54.300]  ninety nine, I wrote in the Trends Journal that the dot com bubble would burst before
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:59.740]  the end of the second quarter of 2000. It's right there for everyone to look at. And it
[02:55:59.740 --> 02:56:06.100]  did it burst in March. There's a lot of pessimism in the markets now. March and April are going
[02:56:06.100 --> 02:56:12.180]  to be critical months to see where the future is taking us in the financial markets. I urge
[02:56:12.180 --> 02:56:20.540]  you to stay tuned very closely. Again, when you look at these facts and the numbers, the
[02:56:20.540 --> 02:56:26.300]  only thing that's holding it together are low interest rates and not only here, also
[02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:35.740]  around the world, as I keep mentioning. All right, here is a year earlier back in June.
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:43.860]  Gold investment demand in China advanced 10 percent because of buyers seeking a haven
[02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:50.020]  from Europe's debt crisis and the prospects of weakening currencies, according to the
[02:56:50.020 --> 02:56:58.860]  large country's largest bullion bank. Exactly what I've been saying. Oh, bank runs, da da
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:08.580]  holiday. They call the bank holiday in Italy. That's right. People are freaking out. To
[02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:12.340]  me, anybody who has a lot of dough in the bank and gets it taken from them when they
[02:57:12.340 --> 02:57:17.740]  call a holiday. Remember, you heard it coming. You saw it coming. You know, it was going
[02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:27.660]  to come. Here he is back in 2012 as well. In the Trends Journal, we're putting it on
[02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:33.780]  screen for radio listeners. And that was, well, that was about that. That was before
[02:57:33.780 --> 02:57:38.580]  2012. They made the prediction in 2012 that that would start unfolding. And then he's
[02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:45.380]  got blow ups of it. The conditions continue to deteriorate that you would see panic type
[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:49.780]  activities and bank holidays. And we've also predicted on the show that they would grab
[02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:50.780]  money.
[02:57:50.780 --> 02:57:55.340]  Now, this is out of the from my broadcast December 27, 2011. They were talking about
[02:57:55.340 --> 02:58:04.380]  declaring a bank holiday. That's right. This is June 2009. Biden's words are. As soon as
[02:58:04.380 --> 02:58:11.100]  we got sworn in, the first thing at the top of our list, we had the transition team there
[02:58:11.100 --> 02:58:18.860]  in 30 economists was whether or not to call a bank holiday. This is no holiday, folks.
[02:58:18.860 --> 02:58:22.500]  Hold on, hit pause. Let's back it up to the beginning of that. We're gonna start the next
[02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:26.820]  hour of overdrive with Gerald Cilenti. And I know I'm laughing as this is so painful.
[02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:31.100]  That's from two years ago. I'm saying get ready for the bank holidays. We'll be right
[02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:35.940]  back with Gerald Cilenti, Ted Anderson and your phone calls. Fourth hour coming up in

[02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:50.780]  Stay with us. A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even
[02:58:50.780 --> 02:58:54.740]  if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to
[02:58:54.740 --> 02:58:59.620]  a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[02:58:59.620 --> 02:59:05.040]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:10.500]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer
[02:59:10.500 --> 02:59:15.860]  and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and
[02:59:15.860 --> 02:59:21.020]  discovered Young Jevety. The Young Jevety products are designed to give you the real nutrition

[03:00:07.220 --> 03:00:15.220]  Alex Jones. I really like how Gerald does the news and I routinely go over to the site
[03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:19.180]  and watch his daily news briefs and weekly news briefs. Sitting behind his great bar
[03:00:19.180 --> 03:00:24.220]  there at his old family grocery store that he converted into an office. And as my crew's
[03:00:24.220 --> 03:00:27.220]  been up there, it'd be great to be in that neighborhood and friends with Gerald drop
[03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:31.220]  by have a beer with him. Ted Anderson's with us. Ted, you just heard some of those predictions.
[03:00:31.220 --> 03:00:34.060]  We're going to come back in the next segment and play the one we haven't gotten to and
[03:00:34.060 --> 03:00:39.620]  go to some calls with Gerald Cilente. But this is really a no brainer. What's your comments
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:44.420]  on where we see this going? I mean, don't the globalists know that MF Global and stuff
[03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:48.620]  like this is only going to destroy confidence in them? I mean, you've even got the Federal
[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:52.820]  Reserve head of Dallas coming out and saying this is crony capitalism and it's going to
[03:00:52.820 --> 03:00:58.380]  destroy us. Well, it sure is going to destroy us. And Gerald is right on target. I mean,
[03:00:58.380 --> 03:01:02.040]  he's been right on for how many years now? I mean, Alex, I mean, it's been years and
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:07.740]  years and years of predictions. You cannot continue to print money and bail out your
[03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:15.320]  friends and make a great deal for them and screw the people without having consequences.
[03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:18.740]  And we're seeing those consequences. Yeah, they could have set up the Cyprus thing. I
[03:01:18.740 --> 03:01:24.500]  mean, how could one little island like this throw an economic earthquake into the entire
[03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:29.380]  world's economy? I mean, it just doesn't make sense. If people are smart, they will be getting
[03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:33.580]  out of the paper and getting into gold and silver. I mean, just like Gerald said, I mean,
[03:01:33.580 --> 03:01:37.140]  I own some buildings, too, because I have to operate. I've been to Gerald's place. It's
[03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:43.100]  a beautiful place. And I need to tell you, if you're sitting in the bank, if you have
[03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:47.100]  your money in paper, I think you're making a big mistake. You just really are.
[03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:50.620]  I agree. Chad, briefly, what are some of the best gold specials? People can always call
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:53.780]  and ask about the radio special every day and you'll have the lowest prices. I know
[03:01:53.780 --> 03:01:57.220]  you even have gold you bought before it went back up. Most dealers are going to charge
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:02:01.460]  more now that it's gone up. You're freezing your prices. How long can you do that until
[03:02:01.460 --> 03:02:05.220]  you run out of your supplies? Well, I mean, Alex, I mean, I have to roll with the market,
[03:02:05.220 --> 03:02:09.300]  too. But right now I do have some really good prices because the market just ran up another
[03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:13.980]  12 bucks. I mean, it's up over $50, really, if you look at it from the bottom.
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:21.780]  Franks right now are at 350.93. We have the Walking Liberty halves. They're at 16.17 rounds.
[03:02:21.780 --> 03:02:29.860]  Just clean silver rounds are at 32.12. Canadian maple leaves right now are at 1751. There's
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:34.500]  a lot of different things. British sovereigns at $440. The thing about it is that you need
[03:02:34.500 --> 03:02:39.020]  to get into gold and silver as you can afford it, just like Gerald was explaining. If you
[03:02:39.020 --> 03:02:43.540]  can buy some, buy some. Put it away. One of the things you can do, which really covers
[03:02:43.540 --> 03:02:48.220]  the banking issue more than anything I can think of other than Gerald's Trends Journal,
[03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:53.780]  is that dishonest money, American Dream and Obama deception video. I mean, for $72, and
[03:02:53.780 --> 03:02:58.680]  we do take credit cards, you can get two pieces of silver, and these are the silver dollars
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:04.300]  that were meant as constitutional money two decades ago, or two centuries ago, the turn
[03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:10.820]  of the last century, for $72. And the reason why I like that so much is it's more about
[03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:14.780]  the education. They get to see what's going on with your Obama deception, which covers
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:19.620]  the banking system, by the way. It's not really about Obama. It's about who's pulling the
[03:03:19.620 --> 03:03:20.620]  puppet strings.
[03:03:20.620 --> 03:03:23.580]  And all our predictions that came true. Then you've got the dishonest money, breaking down
[03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:28.260]  the banking system, the Federal Reserve. Then you've got the American Dream cartoon. I really
[03:03:28.260 --> 03:03:32.300]  wouldn't show it to kids. It's a little racy. But it's really great exposing the New World
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:36.420]  Order, the Rothschilds, how it all works. The two silver dollars it costs, shipping
[03:03:36.420 --> 03:03:41.900]  included, and over $60 in free stuff. As a loss leader, I'd introduce you to Midas Resources
[03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:47.380]  800-686-2237, 800-686-237.
[03:03:47.380 --> 03:03:48.380]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:49.380]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:03:49.380 --> 03:03:54.180]  You bet. We're gonna come back with Gerald Cilente and get his take on the videos we
[03:03:54.180 --> 03:03:58.420]  just aired in the last hour and audio of him predicting the holiday and finish up that
[03:03:58.420 --> 03:04:03.260]  clip and then see how he thinks we can defeat these people and how far he thinks in his
[03:04:03.260 --> 03:04:04.980]  gut this will go.
[03:04:04.980 --> 03:04:09.940]  And as he said, this Alice in Wonderland world, who knows where it's all going? Because they
[03:04:09.940 --> 03:04:16.940]  could totally do anything. I mean, who knows? Also go and support Gerald and support yourself
[03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:23.220]  and subscribe to the journal at trendsjournal.com to get the hard copy. And also sign up for
[03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:28.100]  the free alerts that they have there on the site, trendsjournal.com.
[03:04:28.100 --> 03:04:32.660]  Because just because you know this information doesn't mean your friends, family, and neighbors
[03:04:32.660 --> 03:04:37.980]  do. You need to be warning your friends and family about all this stuff so they're protected.
[03:04:37.980 --> 03:04:43.540]  Our number one goal is to defeat the globalists. And we do that by being aware of their operations
[03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:47.420]  and their plan. We're all in this together.
[03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:53.340]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[03:04:53.340 --> 03:04:56.340]  a war on for your mind.
[03:04:56.340 --> 03:05:10.780]  All right, Gerald Cilente is with us some more for the hour, and we're going to be taking
[03:05:10.780 --> 03:05:14.020]  some of your phone calls that have guests for Gerald. But I want to bring something
[03:05:14.020 --> 03:05:19.620]  up to Gerald here and then play that clip that we didn't finish of him in 2011 on the
[03:05:19.620 --> 03:05:26.700]  broadcast, a YouTube copy, a clip of the TV streams where he was saying get ready for
[03:05:26.700 --> 03:05:27.700]  the bank holiday.
[03:05:27.700 --> 03:05:34.700]  And he said the New York Times called him a pessimist porn dealer. I get called a fear
[03:05:34.700 --> 03:05:39.740]  porn person. And it's not fear porn. If I'm driving down the street and I see my neighbor's
[03:05:39.740 --> 03:05:43.740]  house on fire, I'm going to pull up and see if they're aware of it or I'm going to call
[03:05:43.740 --> 03:05:44.740]  the fire department.
[03:05:44.740 --> 03:05:51.100]  I mean, admitting something's going on is a good thing, so we can stop it. And of course,
[03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:56.460]  I get attacked, Gerald gets attacked. Other guests that we have on who actually tell the
[03:05:56.460 --> 03:06:00.700]  truth, we get attacked and it's important to defend us. I mean, Gerald doesn't care.
[03:06:00.700 --> 03:06:06.820]  But I mean, Gerald, you've been torn up pretty bad. People say, Gerald said seven years ago,
[03:06:06.820 --> 03:06:10.660]  we have a collapse. It never happened. I mean, what do you call 2008? What do you call what's
[03:06:10.660 --> 03:06:16.180]  happening now? I mean, we could have total collapse, they'd say you were wrong.
[03:06:16.180 --> 03:06:19.980]  This lying, this stonewalling, do you want to respond to all the people that have been
[03:06:19.980 --> 03:06:22.420]  proven wrong and the fact that you've been right?
[03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:26.980]  Well, yeah, my record speaks for itself. I'll put it up against anybody's. Do I get the
[03:06:26.980 --> 03:06:32.160]  timing right all the time? No, you can't. And I always make it clear, no one could predict
[03:06:32.160 --> 03:06:37.300]  the future. There are too many wildcards. Do I know that the Federal Reserve is going
[03:06:37.300 --> 03:06:42.700]  to dump in $17 trillion into the system to bail it out?
[03:06:42.700 --> 03:06:51.580]  Do I know that they're going to kill capitalism with four words called too big to fail? And
[03:06:51.580 --> 03:06:58.020]  by the way, here's another one that I don't want to hear anymore. Yes, Mussolini did say
[03:06:58.020 --> 03:07:04.780]  it's a fact, Jack. The merger of state and corporate powers is called fascism. So did
[03:07:04.780 --> 03:07:12.060]  I know that we would lose all our rights and we would let the Federal Reserve and the banking
[03:07:12.060 --> 03:07:15.820]  system con us with this continuing scam?
[03:07:15.820 --> 03:07:21.100]  I want to read something. I'm glad you mentioned that. This isn't edited yet, but it's coming
[03:07:21.100 --> 03:07:28.140]  from the Spring Trends Journal, which will be out in about three or four weeks. As with
[03:07:28.140 --> 03:07:33.740]  all Ponzi schemes, the system is designed to collapse and the victims will be those
[03:07:33.740 --> 03:07:39.700]  who believe their governments were holding currencies that were being systematically
[03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:41.260]  debased.
[03:07:41.260 --> 03:07:47.140]  That's all this is. It's one big pump and dump Ponzi scheme.
[03:07:47.140 --> 03:07:51.380]  Let me put it to you this way. Let me put it to you this way then. And correct me if
[03:07:51.380 --> 03:07:55.140]  I'm wrong, but I've studied history because it's so interesting. I probably read 200,
[03:07:55.140 --> 03:08:00.220]  300 history books to be conservative and countless journals on the subject. Has there ever been
[03:08:00.220 --> 03:08:06.900]  a time that they've debased a currency that it hasn't finally hyperinflated or super hyperinflated?
[03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:14.220]  Because I don't know of any time the path we're on hasn't led straight to economic hell.
[03:08:14.220 --> 03:08:20.900]  It's going to every this is what this is what is so unbelievable. A theme of this trends
[03:08:20.900 --> 03:08:27.000]  journal coming out is I don't want to hear it. People don't want to hear it. They want
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:28.640]  to believe their lie.
[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:33.740]  They want to believe in their but am I wrong? Hasn't this always led to collapse? Yes, it
[03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:41.100]  has to. You can't keep printing worthless money. You cannot keep. Look, the only reason
[03:08:41.100 --> 03:08:45.980]  this whole bond scam is going on is because what the Federal Reserve is doing is in front
[03:08:45.980 --> 03:08:46.980]  of us.
[03:08:46.980 --> 03:08:51.560]  Look what's going on in China now. What they're doing now is they're afraid of inflation just
[03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:56.520]  went up 3.2%. It's much higher than that. They've been dumping money into the system
[03:08:56.520 --> 03:09:00.260]  in a different way. They've been building their infrastructure, but the result is the
[03:09:00.260 --> 03:09:06.580]  same. It has to look. I don't tell again people what to do. My, you know, we're taught to
[03:09:06.580 --> 03:09:09.820]  be by my dear father, mayor, so rest in peace.
[03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:20.980]  Think for yourself. I buy gold. I buy silver. I buy it for my golden years. I am not a speculator.
[03:09:20.980 --> 03:09:27.780]  Why would I want to hold on to paper money that they just keep printing and printing?
[03:09:27.780 --> 03:09:36.300]  Oh, and going back to the other bigger game, China, Russia, Iran, they're all getting together
[03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:42.960]  to try to kill the petro dollar because once they start trading, stop trading oil with
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:49.420]  petro dollars, boy, you're gonna see the dollar crash like you've never seen it crash before.
[03:09:49.420 --> 03:09:55.580]  And notice the EU and others are moving towards that SDR down the road. They are designing
[03:09:55.580 --> 03:09:59.660]  the destruction of society. So what do we do? Do we just beat the drum for their arrest?
[03:09:59.660 --> 03:10:03.540]  I mean, they've proven they're above the law. The Justice Department has said they're above
[03:10:03.540 --> 03:10:08.120]  the law. Justice Department's busy staging fast and furious to get our guns. I mean,
[03:10:08.120 --> 03:10:10.900]  we really do just have a criminal takeover here.
[03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:17.320]  It is. It's a banking takeover. So again, you know, to meet gold and silver, why would
[03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:22.140]  any, again, why would you want to hold this paper crap? They're debasing it in front of
[03:10:22.140 --> 03:10:27.340]  our, we got a six, you know, you're gonna play those clips. When I Met was on your show,
[03:10:27.340 --> 03:10:33.940]  the deficit was $15 trillion. It went up a trillion and a half since then. They're never
[03:10:33.940 --> 03:10:35.840]  gonna solve this problem.
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:41.520]  This whole sequester stuff, what are they talking about, $80 something billion? That's
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:48.060]  one month with the Fed is dumping into the system. They can't save it. It's impossible.
[03:10:48.060 --> 03:10:55.540]  I truly believe, Alex, they're going to debase the currency. And again, if you're living
[03:10:55.540 --> 03:11:04.140]  in Europe, who would want to hold a euro when you see what's going on in front of your eyes?
[03:11:04.140 --> 03:11:09.800]  And the same thing in China. So you're going to see this thing to me, will it collapse
[03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:16.820]  next week, next month, next year? I can't put a date on it, but only speaking for myself,
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:25.260]  why would I believe that by printing more money, by keeping interest rates near zero,
[03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:32.020]  when interest rates go back up, the bond market's going to collapse. And all those people that
[03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:37.660]  are saying when interest rates go up, it's going to be a sign because of a strong economy
[03:11:37.660 --> 03:11:40.140]  grow up.
[03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:49.260]  We got to import our shirts, our shoes. We're importing, we put our oil, we import our cars,
[03:11:49.260 --> 03:11:53.940]  you name it. No, it's not gonna recuperate because of a strong economy.
[03:11:53.940 --> 03:11:58.340]  It's been a plan, a long term agenda, and they're gonna clamp down with a police state.
[03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:03.420]  But we've been there warning people, so this isn't happening in a vacuum. So they're saying
[03:12:03.420 --> 03:12:08.500]  anybody that criticizes the Federal Reserve is the new terrorist, which shows the foreign
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:12.620]  occupiers, the globalist occupiers, are saying those of us that are warning you are the bad
[03:12:12.620 --> 03:12:13.620]  guys.
[03:12:13.620 --> 03:12:17.700]  No, they're the bad guys. I wanna finish that clip and then go to calls from you two years
[03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:23.500]  ago on the show talking about the holiday. Here it is.
[03:12:23.500 --> 03:12:25.880]  They were talking about declaring a bank holiday.
[03:12:25.880 --> 03:12:36.020]  That's right. This is June 2009. Biden's words are, as soon as we got sworn in, the first
[03:12:36.020 --> 03:12:42.500]  thing at the top of our list, we had to transition the team there in 30 economists, was whether
[03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:45.260]  or not to call a bank holiday.
[03:12:45.260 --> 03:12:50.660]  This is no holiday, folks. You can't get your money. You think it's bad trying to get it
[03:12:50.660 --> 03:12:54.940]  now? You can't get any of it. And when you do get it, they'll do like they did the last
[03:12:54.940 --> 03:13:01.580]  time they call a bank holiday. They'll devalue the currency. So that's what we're warning.
[03:13:01.580 --> 03:13:08.220]  They've already said they were going to do it. Now remember, Alex, that happened before
[03:13:08.220 --> 03:13:16.780]  there was a European crisis. That happened before the United States was $15 trillion
[03:13:16.780 --> 03:13:17.780]  in debt.
[03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:26.820]  That happened before the Federal Reserve, when you add it all up, pumped in $26 trillion
[03:13:26.820 --> 03:13:29.900]  into the Ponzi scheme to keep it afloat.
[03:13:29.900 --> 03:13:36.180]  And here's the Winter Trends Journal 2010. I'll show it for TV viewers, but top trends,
[03:13:36.180 --> 03:13:43.500]  breaking point 2010. And he talks about bank holidays, draconian measures, and taking part
[03:13:43.500 --> 03:13:46.460]  of your bank accounts, just taking money right out.
[03:13:46.460 --> 03:13:50.700]  And they call it a tax. They call Obamacare, doubling your costs. We're going to skip this
[03:13:50.700 --> 03:13:57.300]  network break. This is our final long segment with Gerald Cilente, trendsresearch.com, trendsjournal.com,
[03:13:57.300 --> 03:14:01.180]  History Before It Happens. And he's on with us right now. Again, I'm Alex Jones, your
[03:14:01.180 --> 03:14:02.180]  host.
[03:14:02.180 --> 03:14:06.060]  We're going to take some phone calls here right now for your questions in the 10 or
[03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:11.220]  12 minutes we have left with Gerald. Let's talk to James in Missouri. You're on the air.
[03:14:11.220 --> 03:14:12.220]  Thanks for holding.
[03:14:12.220 --> 03:14:17.100]  Yeah, no problem. Thanks for having me. You know, I'm just getting kind of to the point
[03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:23.780]  now where I can't justify spending my energy, my life force towards anything except we're
[03:14:23.780 --> 03:14:29.860]  trying to express what is going on to other people.
[03:14:29.860 --> 03:14:33.140]  And I just don't know. How much more are we going to put up with? I mean, we have-
[03:14:33.140 --> 03:14:37.620]  The general public is in a trance. We got to figure out how to get them out of their
[03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:39.620]  trance. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:14:39.620 --> 03:14:45.060]  It's fine. But I mean, how much longer are we going to put up with this? I mean, we got-
[03:14:45.060 --> 03:14:50.860]  Gerald's been talking about just the blatant, overt manipulation going on in our financial
[03:14:50.860 --> 03:14:57.700]  institutions. We were talking about earlier about the manipulation of the food, the manipulation
[03:14:57.700 --> 03:15:00.060]  of the water, the manipulation of everything.
[03:15:00.060 --> 03:15:05.320]  No, no, we're in a scientific dictatorship. That's why these guys are on such power trips,
[03:15:05.320 --> 03:15:10.460]  because they just manipulate us like we're dumb animals. Gerald?
[03:15:10.460 --> 03:15:17.420]  When was it going to change? Again, the model to me that exists is this five star movement.
[03:15:17.420 --> 03:15:23.700]  It's not a protest, it's a movement. We have to get a movement going where we have conditions.
[03:15:23.700 --> 03:15:29.100]  For example, some of the conditions, and I'm speaking about this a lot now, all of these
[03:15:29.100 --> 03:15:35.580]  politicians start talking about our founding fathers when it's convenient for them. No
[03:15:35.580 --> 03:15:44.180]  more foreign entanglements, founding fathers, no more central banks. We have to put together
[03:15:44.180 --> 03:15:52.420]  a movement. And I believe that between now and the next election is the time to do it.
[03:15:52.420 --> 03:16:01.100]  And when I studied the five star movement in Italy, they only began that in 2008, 2009.
[03:16:01.100 --> 03:16:07.180]  And look what happened. That party got more votes than any other single party in Italy.
[03:16:07.180 --> 03:16:15.100]  There are enough of us, but we have to unite behind a movement, not a political party.
[03:16:15.100 --> 03:16:22.460]  And that's the big difference. We need to change the system. You cannot fix the Gambinos,
[03:16:22.460 --> 03:16:27.240]  the Bananos, the Democrats, or the Republicans.
[03:16:27.240 --> 03:16:30.460]  And they know that we're gonna try to get free of them, so they're arming to the teeth
[03:16:30.460 --> 03:16:34.360]  against us. And police and military better be discussing this right now, and citizens
[03:16:34.360 --> 03:16:40.540]  better be very aggressive about what's happening. We have to make this the big cultural issue
[03:16:40.540 --> 03:16:43.820]  in our society right now.
[03:16:43.820 --> 03:16:44.820]  We have to-
[03:16:44.820 --> 03:16:49.900]  Yes, and just stay with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Just stay
[03:16:49.900 --> 03:16:56.500]  on these issues. It came out today, big news, Hillary Clinton's flawed same sex marriage.
[03:16:56.500 --> 03:17:03.640]  What do I care what she's for? Was she coming out of the closet and gonna get rid of Bill?
[03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:08.820]  What the hell do I care about? I don't care about those issues. Those aren't the same.
[03:17:08.820 --> 03:17:13.100]  Exactly, the group's trying to say, focus on it that it's bad or distracting. And the
[03:17:13.100 --> 03:17:17.460]  people obsessing on it or saying it's great or distracting, they shove all this stuff.
[03:17:17.460 --> 03:17:23.020]  Well, is he gay or is she a lesbian or what's gonna go on with this? While they implode
[03:17:23.020 --> 03:17:26.700]  everything around us, they have us all fighting with each other.
[03:17:26.700 --> 03:17:33.380]  Exactly, so going back to the question, we need to have a movement that's based upon
[03:17:33.380 --> 03:17:39.900]  what this country was founded on. And every one of them said, do not become involved in
[03:17:39.900 --> 03:17:45.940]  foreign entanglements. Every one of them except the few of the criminals in there didn't want
[03:17:45.940 --> 03:17:53.100]  a central bank. Every one of them wanted to have our freedom of expression, the right
[03:17:53.100 --> 03:17:56.900]  to bear arms, every one of them.
[03:17:56.900 --> 03:18:03.280]  It's a very simple process. It has to go back to the people. And do you know what the big
[03:18:03.280 --> 03:18:11.820]  one with Beppe Grillo is? The one I've been talking about for two years now, direct democracy.
[03:18:11.820 --> 03:18:18.140]  He wants the people in Italy to vote whether or not they wanna stay in the Euro. Let the
[03:18:18.140 --> 03:18:24.660]  people vote. We do not have a representative form of government. We have Feinstein's and
[03:18:24.660 --> 03:18:32.020]  Pelosi's. We have McConnell's and we have boners. We have a bunch of guys and women
[03:18:32.020 --> 03:18:37.860]  that only represent the most powerful and the most amount of money that they give to
[03:18:37.860 --> 03:18:38.860]  them.
[03:18:38.860 --> 03:18:48.460]  Look at Obama with this new lobbying group that he put together. If you raise $500,000
[03:18:48.460 --> 03:18:56.380]  or if you donate $500,000, you get to meet with El Presidente every four months.
[03:18:56.380 --> 03:19:03.620]  I mean, it's just open globalism, open mafia takeover. Thank you, James. Let's talk to
[03:19:03.620 --> 03:19:06.420]  Matthew in Maryland. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:19:06.420 --> 03:19:13.260]  Yeah, I just wanted to get a comment about the new pope being supposedly, after listening
[03:19:13.260 --> 03:19:19.500]  to the type of analysis over the weekend, he's very anti globalist. I just wanted to
[03:19:19.500 --> 03:19:24.380]  know how you guys felt how that's gonna impact the economic outlook.
[03:19:24.380 --> 03:19:29.260]  That's not the way I read it. I read it. He's a member of the club from a lot of the information
[03:19:29.260 --> 03:19:35.900]  that I've been reading. And there's a lot of spin going on. And one of the things was
[03:19:35.900 --> 03:19:44.420]  when they had that terrible time in Argentina with all those missing people, 30,000 of them.
[03:19:44.420 --> 03:19:46.860]  He was helping out?
[03:19:46.860 --> 03:19:54.300]  Let's just say he was silent on it. And there's this other thing too. I'm Catholic. The Jesuits
[03:19:54.300 --> 03:19:59.620]  were never going to be pope. That was one of the things that Jesuits, by the way, it
[03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:05.020]  was only founded 1500 years after Christ. So I don't think there's much of a connection
[03:20:05.020 --> 03:20:11.080]  in terms of the spirituality from the originator. But having said that, their doctrine was never
[03:20:11.080 --> 03:20:17.660]  to be a pope or go into the hierarchy. So there's something here that doesn't set right
[03:20:17.660 --> 03:20:18.660]  with me.
[03:20:18.660 --> 03:20:24.700]  As a matter of fact, the chief Jesuit spokesman just before the coronation of the pope, the
[03:20:24.700 --> 03:20:29.660]  election of the pope, said it would never happen that he would be chosen. That's how
[03:20:29.660 --> 03:20:30.660]  out of the-
[03:20:30.660 --> 03:20:34.260]  Yeah, notice on every level, ancient taboos are being broken.
[03:20:34.260 --> 03:20:37.980]  Yeah. So I don't see anything coming out of that.
[03:20:37.980 --> 03:20:41.620]  All right, there you go, Matthew. Anything else?
[03:20:41.620 --> 03:20:46.900]  No, that's it. But I guess it's curious that he's going out into the crowds now though
[03:20:46.900 --> 03:20:48.860]  too. He's very fearless.
[03:20:48.860 --> 03:20:53.380]  You know what? That's what they're supposed to do. It's like they made a big deal about
[03:20:53.380 --> 03:20:58.500]  Mother Teresa. They're all supposed to be Mother Teresa's. This is what they're supposed
[03:20:58.500 --> 03:21:03.620]  to do. And they get one or two to do it and they make a big deal about it. They're all
[03:21:03.620 --> 03:21:07.660]  supposed to be with the poor. They're all supposed to be working with the people all
[03:21:07.660 --> 03:21:08.860]  the time.
[03:21:08.860 --> 03:21:11.260]  So no, this to me is a publicity stunt.
[03:21:11.260 --> 03:21:15.280]  All right, thank you, Matthew. Let's talk to Bill in Florida. Bill, you're on the air
[03:21:15.280 --> 03:21:17.260]  with Gerald Simonti. Go ahead.
[03:21:17.260 --> 03:21:20.420]  Hello, gentlemen. God bless the both of you. You're awesome.
[03:21:20.420 --> 03:21:21.420]  Thank you.
[03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:29.780]  I'm a big ex-Marine and I've just been investing my money in physical gold and silver. Been
[03:21:29.780 --> 03:21:36.300]  doing it for almost a year now. And now I sold a property ready to sell more. And I'm
[03:21:36.300 --> 03:21:41.300]  thinking of a storage vault somewhere. I was looking at gold money. Does Gerald have an
[03:21:41.300 --> 03:21:48.180]  opinion on that or where to store, you know, a big amount for an investment without it
[03:21:48.180 --> 03:21:51.300]  with it being safe, which in this day and age.
[03:21:51.300 --> 03:21:56.580]  Well, they go after they go after the deposit boxes now. I mean, it's really crazy.
[03:21:56.580 --> 03:22:01.060]  I agree with Alex. That's the one place I would not put it in. I would say use your
[03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:05.540]  imagination. You're a Marine. You've been out there. You know what life looks like and
[03:22:05.540 --> 03:22:12.420]  pack some heat. And, you know, just use your own use your own head. And but again, you
[03:22:12.420 --> 03:22:19.420]  know, when they when they confiscated gold back in the 1930s, your safety deposit box
[03:22:19.420 --> 03:22:21.100]  wasn't so safe.
[03:22:21.100 --> 03:22:25.740]  And right now, of course, they could they know all your information, everything about
[03:22:25.740 --> 03:22:30.420]  you. And if they close down the banks, they close down your deposit box. I would just
[03:22:30.420 --> 03:22:32.260]  say, you know, use your head.
[03:22:32.260 --> 03:22:37.260]  Yeah. What did the old timers do? What what what what did Long John Silver's do?
[03:22:37.260 --> 03:22:41.700]  Yeah. You know, yeah. You know, you have some property buried somewhere. You know, don't
[03:22:41.700 --> 03:22:42.700]  tell anybody.
[03:22:42.700 --> 03:22:49.420]  Buried with Billy Bones. Thank you for the call, Bill. Let's talk to Hoot in South Carolina.
[03:22:49.420 --> 03:22:50.420]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:22:50.420 --> 03:22:51.420]  How are you doing?
[03:22:51.420 --> 03:22:52.420]  Pretty good, sir. Go ahead.
[03:22:52.420 --> 03:23:00.020]  I got a little insider tip. I was actually at a prominent restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia,
[03:23:00.020 --> 03:23:03.820]  and had a few drinks with some gentlemen. They were from Europe. And he gave me his
[03:23:03.820 --> 03:23:09.100]  business card. He works for T-MAX Asset Management, AG based out of Zurich, Switzerland. And he
[03:23:09.100 --> 03:23:13.140]  was the managing director of the investment bank in there. And he said, showed me a photo
[03:23:13.140 --> 03:23:18.500]  that he had of the new proposed currency in the Federal Reserve and said, this is what
[03:23:18.500 --> 03:23:23.660]  it's going to look like. It will be backed by gold. And, you know, at first I was like,
[03:23:23.660 --> 03:23:27.700]  well, why would they do that? They've done such a great job of not having it backed by
[03:23:27.700 --> 03:23:33.700]  gold and of destroying that since the 1970s. So why would they all of a sudden convert
[03:23:33.700 --> 03:23:39.700]  to having the currency backed by gold again? And if so, then when do they plan on doing
[03:23:39.700 --> 03:23:42.340]  this? What would that play out as?
[03:23:42.340 --> 03:23:48.500]  That's a great question. I think it was 2010, the head of the World Bank back then, Zoellick,
[03:23:48.500 --> 03:23:53.980]  he came out with this concept about having gold as one of the parts of the banking of
[03:23:53.980 --> 03:23:55.300]  a new reserve currency.
[03:23:55.300 --> 03:23:57.460]  Yeah, 10 to 30 percent.
[03:23:57.460 --> 03:24:02.380]  And I think that that's a reality. I think that's something that could happen.
[03:24:02.380 --> 03:24:06.140]  Because the next time everything implodes, no one's going to trust fiat anymore.
[03:24:06.140 --> 03:24:11.220]  That's right. So if they have some gold behind it now, think about it. If they have to put
[03:24:11.220 --> 03:24:17.180]  gold as part of the backing of a new reserve currency, you think gold prices are going
[03:24:17.180 --> 03:24:18.180]  to be high?
[03:24:18.180 --> 03:24:19.180]  Absolutely.
[03:24:19.180 --> 03:24:24.620]  Because they got a lot of dough out there and they got a lot of backing to do. So you
[03:24:24.620 --> 03:24:27.740]  could see gold prices go up to like $11,000 an ounce.
[03:24:27.740 --> 03:24:32.700]  Well, if you look at 12, 13 year graphs, gold just keeps going up. People look at one year
[03:24:32.700 --> 03:24:36.980]  graphs or six months graphs, look at a 12 month graph. That's why I'm in gold and silver.
[03:24:36.980 --> 03:24:40.960]  In closing, Gerald, have you noticed the media is trying to create race division and trying
[03:24:40.960 --> 03:24:44.380]  to act like libertarianism is a white thing?
[03:24:44.380 --> 03:24:47.980]  And Southern Property Law Center reports about people that think the New World Order is taking
[03:24:47.980 --> 03:24:53.140]  over are mega banks, they're white Christians. And it makes no sense to people that are researched,
[03:24:53.140 --> 03:24:57.100]  that it's meant to create division. What do you make of that?
[03:24:57.100 --> 03:25:02.660]  Well, look at this last election. You can see the division it created and you were talking
[03:25:02.660 --> 03:25:08.420]  about the food stamps for Mexicans. I mean, who do they vote for? They go democratic.
[03:25:08.420 --> 03:25:14.620]  So yeah, they use divisiveness all the time, whether it's between the people in the states
[03:25:14.620 --> 03:25:21.380]  or among the different nations. So fear and hysteria, hate and deception, that's what
[03:25:21.380 --> 03:25:24.500]  they do. And of course they're doing it.
[03:25:24.500 --> 03:25:30.260]  It's elementary, shut down the economy, transfer everybody onto food stamps, and then things
[03:25:30.260 --> 03:25:33.820]  go more bankrupt, take more money from the middle class, and pretty soon there's no middle
[03:25:33.820 --> 03:25:36.100]  class. I mean, it's so horrible.
[03:25:36.100 --> 03:25:41.660]  Well, one of the reasons why you're not seeing this Great Depression that we're in, when
[03:25:41.660 --> 03:25:47.140]  you look at John Williams' shadow stats, and they're like they came out with new employment
[03:25:47.140 --> 03:25:54.140]  numbers last month, 236,000 jobs or something like that created. But hardly anybody mentioned
[03:25:54.140 --> 03:25:59.380]  139 that dropped, 1,000 that dropped out. The only reason you don't see the bread lines
[03:25:59.380 --> 03:26:01.260]  is because of the food stamps.
[03:26:01.260 --> 03:26:02.980]  Digital food lines, yeah.
[03:26:02.980 --> 03:26:07.380]  Exactly. So if you didn't have those food stamps going on, then you would really see
[03:26:07.380 --> 03:26:09.180]  the horrors that are being created.
[03:26:09.180 --> 03:26:13.460]  You have 50 million homeless people in bread lines.
[03:26:13.460 --> 03:26:17.140]  47 million on food stamps, isn't it? Or almost 50 million.
[03:26:17.140 --> 03:26:19.900]  It's almost 50 million now, yeah, and that's not even counting some state programs.
[03:26:19.900 --> 03:26:25.980]  So could you imagine 50 million people online for food outside like they used to do during
[03:26:25.980 --> 03:26:29.620]  the Great Depression? There would be riots in the streets.
[03:26:29.620 --> 03:26:34.660]  You're right, trendsjournal.com. I'm Alex Jones with mfallwars.com. Amazing, Gerald.
[03:26:34.660 --> 03:26:36.860]  Thank you for all the time today.
[03:26:36.860 --> 03:26:44.380]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
