[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.440 --> 00:19.980]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.980 --> 00:42.420]  Texas Alex Jones my friends it is Wednesday the 19th day of September
[00:42.420 --> 00:47.460]  2012 I'm your host Alex Jones and we're gonna be here Lord willing for the next
[00:47.460 --> 00:55.140]  three hours wow all Hades is breaking loose all over the world Chinese
[00:55.140 --> 01:00.820]  generals are saying prepare for war with Japan from Indonesia to China US embassy
[01:00.820 --> 01:08.940]  staff and facilities are being attacked it's amazing what's going on and we have
[01:08.940 --> 01:14.140]  the campaign in full swing I hear conservative talk show host even locally
[01:14.140 --> 01:21.460]  and callers criticizing Romney for coming out and saying in a private
[01:21.460 --> 01:25.180]  fundraiser meeting should have been public he should own it completely
[01:25.180 --> 01:30.980]  saying 47% are dependent on the government this is dangerous and they're
[01:30.980 --> 01:34.300]  not going to vote for me again I'm not even saying Romney's a good guy
[01:34.300 --> 01:38.780]  obviously he's a globalist but the fact that he has to say that rhetoric to the
[01:38.780 --> 01:42.580]  people that actually have businesses in this country because a lot of these
[01:42.580 --> 01:45.780]  politicians get their big money not even for multinationals those are the
[01:45.780 --> 01:50.100]  biggest single donors but a lot of times the entrepreneurs the people given 10
[01:50.100 --> 01:55.260]  20 30 40 thousand the local corporations and businesses that actually
[01:55.260 --> 01:59.260]  employ hundreds of people thousands of people I mean if you're beneath a
[01:59.260 --> 02:02.900]  billion dollar company you're not included in the globalist overall power
[02:02.900 --> 02:06.380]  structure generally they see you as something to be gobbled up so here's
[02:06.380 --> 02:11.660]  this consummate globalist going around getting their money so he can fight with
[02:11.660 --> 02:15.580]  Obama over who gets the levers of power and there's a real fight going on the
[02:15.580 --> 02:19.500]  power structure right now over who gets to run the big empire with the nuclear
[02:19.500 --> 02:23.900]  weapons and the overseas bases and all the intelligence agencies and the NSA
[02:23.900 --> 02:29.300]  spy systems and the over horizon future predictive software systems they've got
[02:29.300 --> 02:33.580]  the crystal balls they got crystal balls now ladies and gentlemen they're not
[02:33.580 --> 02:36.380]  really crystal balls they're wired into all of our activities so they can
[02:36.380 --> 02:41.980]  predict mass movements and individual movements that's one of the big things
[02:41.980 --> 02:47.660]  that the globalists are focused on is becoming godlike with life extension
[02:47.660 --> 02:53.260]  future prediction powers so much and they're getting close to it Mike Adams

[03:55.500 --> 04:00.900]  reporting on this I don't know 15 years ago and we're called conspiracy theorist
[04:00.900 --> 04:05.140]  and now it's been confirmed all over the world but it's the back of the
[04:05.140 --> 04:09.540]  newspaper you're not just getting fake gold bars at a lot of these shops and

[04:20.140 --> 04:23.940]  groups gold on deposit that's why Hugo Chavez this year asked for his gold
[04:23.940 --> 04:28.300]  back from the Bank of England and from the US Federal Reserve which isn't the
[04:28.300 --> 04:31.180]  US Federal Reserve it's the foreign banking cartel that calls itself US
[04:31.180 --> 04:35.340]  part of its camouflage I mean a body snatchers not a human it just it tells

[08:20.140 --> 08:24.460]  planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning
[08:24.460 --> 08:29.980]  of time it has refinements technological advances and a more sophisticated
[08:29.980 --> 08:34.900]  approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every one of the
[08:34.900 --> 08:41.180]  super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth

[09:12.940 --> 09:20.500]  more important as world powers line up for what could be a new world war as a
[09:20.500 --> 09:26.660]  engineered global financial meltdown takes place run by a handful of mega
[09:26.660 --> 09:32.780]  banks that are so arrogant and hubris filled that people like John Corzine
[09:32.780 --> 09:38.180]  made 40 to 1 bets with other people's money got caught lying to Congress stole
[09:38.180 --> 09:43.220]  the money and didn't get in trouble the White House ship 20 plus thousand
[09:43.220 --> 09:48.620]  firearms and hang grenades into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment got caught
[09:48.620 --> 09:54.660]  in their own memos and didn't get in trouble the government is openly
[09:54.660 --> 09:59.580]  killing and grabbing and kidnapping and torturing us citizens and federal
[09:59.580 --> 10:05.180]  courts are saying that's a okay the NSA publicly now admits they spy on
[10:05.180 --> 10:12.020]  everything in live time and our Google and the government says that's a okay
[10:12.020 --> 10:17.960]  more reports are coming out about GMOs causing massive tumor increases in all
[10:17.960 --> 10:21.340]  mammals we're gonna be breaking that down with Mike Adams coming up in about an
[10:21.340 --> 10:25.740]  hour and a half with a quick report but we're told that's no big deal Diane's
[10:25.740 --> 10:30.900]  kind of cool it's extreme to be awake it's extreme to be informed it's extreme
[10:30.900 --> 10:36.380]  if you have that spark of energy that built civilization well then call me
[10:36.380 --> 10:42.500]  extreme as the day is long anybody that says they're bored anybody that says
[10:42.500 --> 10:46.100]  life is meaningless I don't know what planet you're living on we live in a
[10:46.100 --> 10:53.900]  world a galaxy a universe of wonderment of unbelievable off the chart
[10:53.900 --> 10:59.580]  incredibleness and in that spectrum there's the ugliest most wicked things
[10:59.580 --> 11:05.060]  you can imagine there's mediocre and there are heights of beauty and honor
[11:05.060 --> 11:09.380]  and goodness and strength and let me tell you that's the camp I want to be in I
[11:09.380 --> 11:15.260]  don't think I'm perfect I don't have you know a high view of myself but I sure
[11:15.260 --> 11:20.900]  know what I love I sure know good from evil I sure know what side I want to be
[11:20.900 --> 11:27.700]  on and I know what side I long to be a part of forever there are things worse
[11:27.700 --> 11:32.380]  than death that I'm here to tell you it's sort of an evil and that's why the
[11:32.380 --> 11:36.100]  system doesn't want you to be able to even understand good from evil it wants
[11:36.100 --> 11:43.460]  to tell you there isn't good and evil before I get going here today we do have
[11:43.460 --> 11:47.860]  Ted Anderson popping in about this Fox News report of fake gold bars being sold
[11:47.860 --> 11:52.860]  Ted's been warning of this for over over 14-15 years that I know of so he's
[11:52.860 --> 11:55.540]  really an expert on I've got him pulling some of the old articles to give you the
[11:55.540 --> 12:02.700]  full magnitude on how big this is then we've got Lynn LaRouche okay we don't
[12:02.700 --> 12:06.220]  have LaRouche coming on I was gonna get Jeff Steinberg on because they sent us
[12:06.220 --> 12:09.940]  a press release basically concurring with what Steve Pachinic said and also at
[12:09.940 --> 12:13.260]  Webster Tarpoli said so I wanted to get there wanted to get their take so that
[12:13.260 --> 12:18.340]  might happen and then we've got Mike Adams popping in as I said and Gerald
[12:18.340 --> 12:27.060]  Salente coming on the transmission in the third hour today and because we can
[12:27.060 --> 12:30.940]  only budget him in for an hour today we'll have more with Gerald tomorrow
[12:30.940 --> 12:35.340]  because people are begging for more Gerald Salente I know I really enjoy
[12:35.340 --> 12:39.780]  hearing him on the radio and his points and so he'll be back with us tomorrow as
[12:39.780 --> 12:44.180]  well a double dose of Gerald Salente because I wanted to get him for two hours
[12:44.180 --> 12:47.540]  but then we don't have time to do that today so we're gonna have him today for
[12:47.540 --> 12:51.700]  an hour tomorrow for an hour so that's what's coming up okay let me tell you
[12:51.700 --> 12:55.020]  what's up at info wars.com you're watching at prisonplanet.tv we'll put
[12:55.020 --> 13:00.020]  the front page of info wars.com on screen leading Muslim scholar calls for
[13:00.020 --> 13:04.540]  United Nations to criminalize speech I have a stack of articles not out of
[13:04.540 --> 13:12.540]  Western propaganda but out of Indonesia out of Saudi Arabia out of you name it
[13:12.540 --> 13:17.020]  calling for the UN to restrict speech now again I don't want to toot my horn
[13:17.020 --> 13:22.740]  here but you know I said earlier this week and last week I said out of all of
[13:22.740 --> 13:29.940]  this they are going to push and promote through the UN this global governance
[13:29.940 --> 13:35.620]  ecumenical system where you're not allowed to criticize any religion Canada
[13:35.620 --> 13:40.580]  already arrest preachers that criticize homosexuality whether you support that
[13:40.580 --> 13:45.740]  or not you should support their free speech over in Europe they've arrested
[13:45.740 --> 13:51.260]  BBC reporters like Robin Page look it up you think I'm joking when I saw the BBC
[13:51.260 --> 13:55.140]  article about it 10 years ago we got him on I thought it was satire he used the
[13:55.140 --> 13:59.780]  word homosexual and they say that's hurtful so he was arrested they want
[13:59.780 --> 14:05.060]  to bring this here and they will outlaw the teaching of the Bible it will be
[14:05.060 --> 14:08.260]  done selectively you notice it's Christianity that's fair game it's
[14:08.260 --> 14:11.820]  crosses that are pulled down not all the other religions there's a reason for
[14:11.820 --> 14:16.380]  that ladies and gentlemen the globalists know real Christianity is not
[14:16.380 --> 14:20.940]  compatible with their world government I see preachers all over television
[14:20.940 --> 14:25.060]  listeners send me the clips I see them on YouTube to be technical programs from
[14:25.060 --> 14:28.700]  television on YouTube big national preachers you've all seen it I've gone
[14:28.700 --> 14:33.020]  local churches and heard it where they say the Christians were bad to not do
[14:33.020 --> 14:36.220]  what the Roman Emperor said and we're wrong to be thrown to the lions do what
[14:36.220 --> 14:40.540]  government says really almost all the prophets were killed almost all the
[14:40.540 --> 14:50.980]  disciples were killed for not following they were told to to basically what
[14:50.980 --> 14:55.900]  happens sometimes is the crew puts articles up on screen and I've always
[14:55.900 --> 15:00.060]  been totally focused when it comes to talk radio but then once we've added
[15:00.060 --> 15:03.860]  video element to this last five years and now the last few years they've gotten
[15:03.860 --> 15:08.180]  so good at throwing things up on screen as I talk about it so they threw the
[15:08.180 --> 15:14.460]  Robin page arrested article up on screen and then I looked at it and then
[15:14.460 --> 15:17.260]  lost my train of thought and I'm not knocking the guys for doing that I've
[15:17.260 --> 15:22.580]  just got to learn to not look at the monitor instead and focus on the news
[15:22.580 --> 15:26.220]  I'm actually covering and when I do TV I don't look at myself in the monitor but
[15:26.220 --> 15:30.940]  they've hung the monitor right over the camera so I saw something flash up so I
[15:30.940 --> 15:35.220]  automatically look from the camera up to that and see them backing up what I said
[15:35.220 --> 15:39.860]  about Robin page being arrested if you're doubting these type of hate
[15:39.860 --> 15:44.660]  speech laws which really just attack the First Amendment but getting back to
[15:44.660 --> 15:54.300]  that this is a big big big deal and this is part of this whole ecumenical
[15:54.300 --> 16:01.700]  Rockefeller Foundation World Council of Churches National Council of Churches
[16:01.700 --> 16:08.020]  move over the last 100 years to merge all of the major world religions into a
[16:08.020 --> 16:12.500]  one-world government and I'd say if folks the Rockefellers are involved in
[16:12.500 --> 16:15.380]  everything we're going to premiere tonight on the nightly news and then
[16:15.380 --> 16:19.940]  air it tomorrow on the radio two big reports we've just combined by Melissa
[16:19.940 --> 16:23.380]  Melton and Aaron Dykes they actually stayed up all night to finish these I
[16:23.380 --> 16:26.300]  didn't really give them a deadline but they said they'd be ready by Wednesday
[16:26.300 --> 16:29.780]  night so that now they have to meet that deadline they're so dedicated that
[16:29.780 --> 16:36.620]  they're still here working on it and it we found 40 plus Rockefeller created and
[16:36.620 --> 16:41.220]  UN foundations running the local governments here in Texas running them
[16:41.220 --> 16:47.620]  the Campo board bringing in the toll roads all of it this is happening
[16:47.620 --> 16:53.620]  nationwide worldwide the agenda 21 program is unbelievable the centra of
[16:53.620 --> 16:58.300]  Spain is behind the funding of it in Texas Indiana and other states and
[16:58.300 --> 17:01.700]  they're taking over the existing roads which you're not supposed to be able to
[17:01.700 --> 17:05.820]  do for toll roads restriping I'm calling them a new road and slapping giant
[17:05.820 --> 17:09.100]  tolls on them I mean a foreign military couldn't do this they're seizing our
[17:09.100 --> 17:13.060]  infrastructure the city of Austin is moving to shut down its last power
[17:13.060 --> 17:17.300]  plant the prices have already doubled since they shut down two smaller ones
[17:17.300 --> 17:22.100]  the last power plant owned by the city it's huge it's modern it's clean is to
[17:22.100 --> 17:27.580]  be shut down basically shoulder shut down and then they're refusing to buy
[17:27.580 --> 17:32.220]  power from it even if it stays open and it's built by Austin for Austin I mean
[17:32.220 --> 17:36.260]  it's a total criminal takeover and the magnitude of it it's the equivalent of
[17:36.260 --> 17:40.340]  soldiers marching down the streets blowing up buildings that's the same
[17:40.340 --> 17:44.900]  economic effect it's going to have but it's done through soft kill bureaucracy
[17:44.900 --> 17:49.900]  and we've got all the proof of it and there's just so much evidence it's just
[17:49.900 --> 17:54.340]  off the charts the Rockefellers are behind the takeover of the churches
[17:54.340 --> 17:57.940]  they're behind the takeover of education they're behind the takeover of
[17:57.940 --> 18:01.940]  medicine in the last hundred years publicly it's all available they're
[18:01.940 --> 18:05.500]  they're behind the takeover of infrastructure they're taking over all
[18:05.500 --> 18:13.380]  the towns and two different toll road companies bought over 200 last time I
[18:13.380 --> 18:17.100]  checked there's been news articles about this newspapers effect guys type in
[18:17.100 --> 18:20.700]  toll road company buying up Texas newspapers and they're all on the roads
[18:20.700 --> 18:24.980]  where they're buying up the infrastructure they're buying up the
[18:24.980 --> 18:28.380]  newspapers and they're and they're literally running mayors that they
[18:28.380 --> 18:33.140]  finance and they're just taking over I mean it's a total takeover but it's not
[18:33.140 --> 18:39.260]  foreign armies and helmets and uniforms it's a slick corporate takeover and it
[18:39.260 --> 18:43.540]  absolutely makes my head spin so so we've got huge attacks on the First
[18:43.540 --> 18:47.580]  Amendment happening we've got a tax on anybody that says we shouldn't continue
[18:47.580 --> 18:51.180]  to redistribute wealth in fact we have that Obama clip guys make sure we have
[18:51.180 --> 18:54.820]  his redistribution clip with the top of drudge yesterday it's on the right-hand
[18:54.820 --> 18:58.900]  side of drudge I know I sent it to you this morning but I'm sure we have it
[18:58.900 --> 19:03.580]  we're gonna attempt to get into that report saying yeah he wants to
[19:03.580 --> 19:08.140]  redistribute and the media is like well that's good but but Romney saying we
[19:08.140 --> 19:11.620]  should care about entrepreneurs that's bad that's this upside-down world we've
[19:11.620 --> 19:15.420]  entered speaking of drudge down the right-hand side as our article from
[19:15.420 --> 19:21.980]  last night DHS purchases 200 million more rounds of ammunition additional
[19:21.980 --> 19:29.060]  purchases include bullets designated for snipers this is on top of the 1.4
[19:29.060 --> 19:33.420]  billion bought since last November but if you count just the last six months
[19:33.420 --> 19:43.580]  that's a 1.2 billion rounds so it's 1.6 billion rounds total but 1.2 billion of
[19:43.580 --> 19:47.340]  that has just been bought in the last six months of this year and we're gonna be
[19:47.340 --> 19:51.540]  breaking down that incredible report a dollar index headed for rapid collapse
[19:51.540 --> 19:55.180]  over the next three to four weeks that's CNBC saying that I don't know that's
[19:55.180 --> 19:59.940]  the case we've got just all sorts of insanity we're gonna be covering here
[19:59.940 --> 20:06.220]  today that's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark

[23:05.140 --> 23:09.900]  you to know some very important information in 1985 president Ronald
[23:09.900 --> 23:13.740]  Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time
[23:13.740 --> 23:18.260]  when only the president could obtain this world-class healer now 27 years

[24:15.660 --> 24:18.340]  beautiful song
[24:18.340 --> 24:30.340]  oh I've got so much more to think about dead lines
[24:35.340 --> 24:42.900]  that song tells it all seems like five minutes ago that my first born came
[24:42.900 --> 24:50.980]  into the world my son he's gonna be 10 years old in a couple days and I'm no
[24:50.980 --> 24:57.740]  longer you know really young guy I'm I'm now 38 years old probably physically
[24:57.740 --> 25:04.300]  more like 50 strange how time just passes so quickly and when you mature
[25:04.300 --> 25:08.660]  which most people are designed to do at a younger age you realize that it didn't
[25:08.660 --> 25:12.620]  all about you it's about it's about your progeny it's about their progeny
[25:12.620 --> 25:16.260]  and it's about the people that your progeny are going to live with in the
[25:16.260 --> 25:21.980]  future and you study civilization you study history and you discover that
[25:21.980 --> 25:27.540]  free market systems that that that don't feed off the middle class and that
[25:27.540 --> 25:34.180]  honor entrepreneurs and inventors are the best societies and then you look at
[25:34.180 --> 25:38.700]  the authoritarian societies that feed off of the merchants and off of the
[25:38.700 --> 25:45.580]  craftsmen off of the cobblers and you see systems that are nightmarish and no
[25:45.580 --> 25:51.260]  one can deny that in this new video that surfaced of Obama speaking to Loyola
[25:51.260 --> 25:55.980]  University he talks about well I believe in redistribution but you know the good
[25:55.980 --> 26:01.340]  kind to make government better to lift people up hey Obama the Republicans
[26:01.340 --> 26:06.420]  won't go after you with the truth the real wealth redistribution is from the
[26:06.420 --> 26:10.020]  middle class to the ultra rich in corporate welfare and bailouts that's
[26:10.020 --> 26:13.260]  something Romney won't say because he's bought and paid for by the same people
[26:13.260 --> 26:18.540]  for every dollar going to domesticate people so they'll vote for big
[26:18.540 --> 26:23.300]  government there's two dollars going to corporate welfare in one form or another
[26:23.300 --> 26:27.660]  so I'm sick of your crony capitalism and I'm tired of it we have that clip
[26:27.660 --> 26:32.660]  here is part of what Obama was saying and so this is kind of in the campaign
[26:32.660 --> 26:37.700]  the the fight going back and forth now where Romney you know is caught saying
[26:37.700 --> 26:42.700]  oh 47% are dependent so they won't support me oh how horrible to say we
[26:42.700 --> 26:46.300]  shouldn't be dependent you're bashing people that are dependent but government
[26:46.300 --> 26:51.180]  loves them versus now Obama saying yeah I want to redistribute here it is how do
[26:51.180 --> 26:58.220]  we structure government systems that pull resources and hence facilitate some
[26:58.220 --> 27:03.260]  redistribution because I actually believe in redistribution at least at a
[27:03.260 --> 27:09.740]  certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot now there you go
[27:09.740 --> 27:13.820]  so another you didn't build it report and here's the deal if you were really
[27:13.820 --> 27:19.420]  going to take people's money and build roads locally and and the public voted
[27:19.420 --> 27:23.700]  for that and agreed to that you could argue that it's constitutional but then
[27:23.700 --> 27:27.100]  let's just take roads because I'm an expert on this because I've been to a
[27:27.100 --> 27:30.900]  bunch of the meetings I've studied it for more than a decade they were going to
[27:30.900 --> 27:34.700]  take every existing major road in Texas same wherever you live in the country
[27:34.700 --> 27:39.900]  but Texas has the most roads of anybody 8,200 something miles of it I mean I
[27:39.900 --> 27:43.660]  have the official text documents we've shown them on air made films about it
[27:43.660 --> 27:50.100]  my film in-game covers it shows the documents and they were going to put
[27:50.100 --> 27:54.620]  toll roads on all of them and make you take a tracker chip in your car to tax
[27:54.620 --> 27:58.580]  you and it was basically going to double and then they lied and said well it's not
[27:58.580 --> 28:02.420]  enough gas tax even though the gas tax up then they lied and say well we have to
[28:02.420 --> 28:06.180]  you know have foreign companies fund this because we're broke and then I went
[28:06.180 --> 28:08.780]  look to the numbers take just where I live Austin Texas it's the same all over
[28:08.780 --> 28:13.900]  the country Illinois Indiana our other big rape areas by these people
[28:13.900 --> 28:20.700]  California New Jersey the list goes on and on just incredible they had with
[28:20.700 --> 28:23.820]  taxpayer money this is all official lawsuits have been filed over it
[28:23.820 --> 28:31.260]  recently they had four major roads 290 183 71 and what one other all to be toll
[28:31.260 --> 28:34.780]  roads those were already all paid for and now everybody's building up the
[28:34.780 --> 28:39.140]  suburbs and they took all the money that was meant over a decade ago paid for
[28:39.140 --> 28:45.220]  over a decade ago to build those and expand or make a double-decker and they
[28:45.220 --> 28:50.460]  took all the money and paid to build IH 35 the toll road outside Austin that no
[28:50.460 --> 28:53.740]  one uses because it's way out of the way they admit it's about 10% of what
[28:53.740 --> 28:56.620]  they estimated but the deal with toll road company has is they're guaranteed
[28:56.620 --> 29:01.700]  taxpayer money regardless and it turns out the state paid for it and built it
[29:01.700 --> 29:06.620]  with my money and your money and then a foreign company that came in and
[29:06.620 --> 29:12.700]  literally bought off the legislature and bought off the cities they came in but
[29:12.700 --> 29:16.140]  then a new legislature came in because it was such a furor I mean meetings
[29:16.140 --> 29:20.260]  every day with thousands at it all over the state total rebellion because they
[29:20.260 --> 29:24.900]  were going to shut exits on the on the roads to the towns and stuff too and it
[29:24.900 --> 29:28.900]  turns out our guys went investigated I mean we knew this but now we have total
[29:28.900 --> 29:36.100]  proof it's all agenda 21 written by the UN and these companies Campo all of it
[29:36.100 --> 29:44.340]  Centra it's all a UN takeover I live in a town run by the UN they have thousands
[29:44.340 --> 29:50.900]  of operatives they run everything folks we're already in the New World Order we're

[33:40.260 --> 33:43.860]  Mike Adams with big breaking news joining us at the bottom of the next hour
[33:43.860 --> 33:48.420]  and then the one the only Gerald Salente Ted Anderson's coming on because he's an
[33:48.420 --> 33:52.780]  expert in the gold business and I've got all these different Fox News pieces and
[33:52.780 --> 33:58.780]  others about gold bars found with tungsten in them and the first person I
[33:58.780 --> 34:02.820]  heard talk about this I don't know 14 15 years ago was Ted Anderson and it turns
[34:02.820 --> 34:06.940]  out a lot of the lot of the gold in the big vaults that governments hold and the
[34:06.940 --> 34:11.820]  private fellow reserve holds it's governments put it there on deposit and
[34:11.820 --> 34:15.340]  then it's going out the back door and that they've been using tungsten to
[34:15.340 --> 34:19.860]  leverage the market and keep gold down Max Kaiser has talked about this so many
[34:19.860 --> 34:23.500]  others but more and more of these tungsten bars are popping up because
[34:23.500 --> 34:27.900]  this is supposedly Swiss gold here so we're gonna be getting Ted's expert
[34:27.900 --> 34:34.660]  take on that in a moment coming up before we get Mike Adams on when I start
[34:34.660 --> 34:38.660]  the next hour I'm gonna read in full and talk about this because this is really
[34:38.660 --> 34:44.860]  the Rosetta stone or the key to all the other news in my view it's it's one of
[34:44.860 --> 34:49.300]  those articles it's basically like an enzyme it activates everything else and
[34:49.300 --> 34:55.900]  it shows you a clear window into the larger picture DHS purchases 200 million
[34:55.900 --> 35:00.740]  more rounds of ammo that's the guys to repost it up at info wars.com it's
[35:00.740 --> 35:05.300]  since scrolled off the main page but the easiest place to find it is drudge
[35:05.300 --> 35:08.740]  report.com it's now scrolled two-thirds the way down the right-hand side of
[35:08.740 --> 35:13.140]  drudge report.com DHS purchases 200 million more rounds of ammo oh there
[35:13.140 --> 35:16.740]  it is it's back up at the top of info wars so it's on the top of info wars I
[35:16.740 --> 35:20.820]  want to thank the drudge report for recognizing this is as important I did
[35:20.820 --> 35:24.540]  happen to tune in and scan through Texas talk radio and heard a show covering
[35:24.540 --> 35:29.420]  it so that's a good sample to show it's getting out there DHS purchases 200
[35:29.420 --> 35:36.060]  million more rounds of ammunition red linked I'm begging all listeners get
[35:36.060 --> 35:40.820]  this article either off drudge report.com or info wars.com and get it out
[35:40.820 --> 35:47.940]  to everyone you know retweet it everything go to my Twitter and find it
[35:47.940 --> 35:53.060]  from yesterday evening and retweet it we need to get this out because why did
[35:53.060 --> 35:58.580]  they have in one day 500 plus newspapers two weeks ago come out and say that
[35:58.580 --> 36:05.180]  there's nothing to this bullet story. 500 plus associated press Washington
[36:05.180 --> 36:12.260]  Post Miami Herald LA Times you name it it was in there my local paper saying Alex
[36:12.260 --> 36:15.500]  Jones the conspiracy theorist says the government's buying bullets for civil
[36:15.500 --> 36:23.180]  unrest all it is 174,000 rounds what's the big deal then they had the heads of
[36:23.180 --> 36:28.820]  law enforcement colleges going we need 174,000 this is quite moderate you talk
[36:28.820 --> 36:36.300]  about manipulation 1.4 billion since last November this year so far it was a
[36:36.300 --> 36:41.420]  billion 200 million last year a billion so far this year now they just purchased
[36:41.420 --> 36:45.780]  last week this is official links to the federal government's own websites 200
[36:45.780 --> 36:52.540]  million more of match grade sniper ammo the most expensive stuff you can get a
[36:52.540 --> 37:00.020]  large portion of it was I mean they are no expenses being spared okay and I've
[37:00.020 --> 37:03.180]  literally got a gunsmith working here he's been looking over all the numbers
[37:03.180 --> 37:07.100]  as we gear up for the gun show and all the rest of it the whole whole second
[37:07.100 --> 37:13.700]  amendment division I'm going to launch but the point is that this is very very
[37:13.700 --> 37:19.780]  serious obviously and the way they countered us and now 200 million more
[37:19.780 --> 37:26.340]  folks we're talking 1.6 billion since last November that's 1 billion 200
[37:26.340 --> 37:33.700]  million no 400 million just this year the numbers are just staggering 1.6
[37:33.700 --> 37:42.180]  billion 1.4 billion this year my head is spinning right now DHS purchases 200
[37:42.180 --> 37:46.140]  million more rounds of ammunition additional purchases include bullets
[37:46.140 --> 37:53.220]  designed for snipers 308 we have got to get this out to everybody because the
[37:53.220 --> 37:57.620]  article has got where the army admits they're prepared for civil unrest
[37:57.620 --> 38:02.500]  reeducation centers all of it I mean it's all proven and this is the evidence
[38:02.500 --> 38:10.060]  of a massive covert militarized paramilitary arms buildup against we the
[38:10.060 --> 38:19.580]  people this is what's going on and it's such a big deal that they would respond
[38:19.580 --> 38:23.580]  to us in the last month two weeks ago was the biggest fit where there were
[38:23.580 --> 38:27.900]  literally over 500 articles in one day in mainstream news I mean I couldn't even
[38:27.900 --> 38:33.260]  keep track of them I would just see a headline duplicate it and put it the
[38:33.260 --> 38:36.940]  search engine it would say you know 500 of just of one article from the
[38:36.940 --> 38:41.900]  Associated Press published in other newspapers and and TV stations I mean
[38:41.900 --> 38:47.580]  it it's it's it's incalculable probably to go out and find out everywhere this
[38:47.580 --> 38:56.300]  win and we had listeners call in and say on air oh yeah I came into work and we
[38:56.300 --> 38:59.820]  had been talking about the 1.4 billion bullets and then you know the guys I
[38:59.820 --> 39:04.580]  work with here at the National Guard said it's okay it's only 174,000 that
[39:04.580 --> 39:11.460]  guy Alex is wrong people were are buying it they're buying it just like we had an
[39:11.460 --> 39:15.100]  article about drones being used all over the country with links the media picked
[39:15.100 --> 39:19.340]  one of our links that was manned aircraft spying on farmers and discredited
[39:19.340 --> 39:23.260]  the whole thing saying oh there's no drones watching you even though there
[39:23.260 --> 39:26.780]  were all the links where they were admitting it even though Homeland
[39:26.780 --> 39:30.540]  Security in the article said we're gonna use them for public safety and are
[39:30.540 --> 39:38.580]  using them to quote spy on you so this is the type of stuff that's going on
[39:38.580 --> 39:44.380]  here they are really worried about info wars calm and drudge report calm
[39:44.380 --> 39:50.380]  helping get our articles out and talk radio as well because if we can have a
[39:50.380 --> 39:54.220]  discussion and make this a national story and make a debate about it be a
[39:54.220 --> 40:00.300]  national story of why are you buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammo again that is
[40:00.300 --> 40:09.180]  now close to 12 times any previous record purchase to give me an idea in fact
[40:09.180 --> 40:12.980]  Watson's working on a story on this that's more ammo than the Department of
[40:12.980 --> 40:17.860]  Defense has bought in the last year in fact the article will break down how
[40:17.860 --> 40:24.060]  much more it's quite a bit more I mean this is a full-on arms build up against
[40:24.060 --> 40:28.620]  us and it's it's hundreds of armored vehicles purchased every few months
[40:28.620 --> 40:32.460]  thousands of tanks you've seen that the news being deployed in different areas
[40:32.460 --> 40:36.540]  of the country the old Bradleys and others are being cashed all over
[40:36.540 --> 40:43.500]  hundreds of mobile armored checkpoints and interrogation wagons so they can
[40:43.500 --> 40:47.340]  pull you out of your car and drag you off I mean this is scary they're giving
[40:47.340 --> 40:52.180]  state police face scanning units to put people into the face scan database at
[40:52.180 --> 40:56.420]  highway checkpoints that's in the news the Department of Defense is rolling out
[40:56.420 --> 41:00.540]  with brigade homeland none of this is just Alex Jones going to an urban
[41:00.540 --> 41:05.740]  warfare drill 15 years ago and shooting video of Marines training to take your
[41:05.740 --> 41:09.300]  guns and admitting it was for America then back then people weren't ready to
[41:09.300 --> 41:14.180]  see the truth and so they just said oh those must be fake Marines you hired
[41:14.180 --> 41:20.940]  that the the Coronado amphibious attack ship coming into San Francisco that
[41:20.940 --> 41:25.500]  must be fake and the helicopters yeah and my friend Richard link letter the
[41:25.500 --> 41:30.340]  director he saw the film and he was talking about how he'd shown it to
[41:30.340 --> 41:33.260]  people they were saying oh this can't be real and he was laughing saying this
[41:33.260 --> 41:37.980]  would cost 40 50 million dollars and still you couldn't fake it of course it
[41:37.980 --> 41:44.300]  was real it was in the newspapers that the invasion drill was happening but
[41:44.300 --> 41:48.420]  back then people still even though my film had CNN clips admitting they were
[41:48.420 --> 41:54.740]  having the takeover and showed newspaper covers along with my video people
[41:54.740 --> 41:58.900]  still said it's not real because it was Marines training to come in your house
[41:58.900 --> 42:05.540]  take your guns and put you in a FEMA camp now we better have a discussion
[42:05.540 --> 42:09.500]  about this because I've been telling you it's not about al-Qaeda they work for
[42:09.500 --> 42:13.420]  the globalist that's now confirmed in triplicate totally admitted they hope
[42:13.420 --> 42:16.980]  you don't look into it it's hiding in plain view you all you got to do is have
[42:16.980 --> 42:21.300]  an IQ above room temperature to understand this people are mentally
[42:21.300 --> 42:25.700]  lazy nowadays and they do not want to look into this information well you
[42:25.700 --> 42:29.820]  better look into it instead of just sitting there saying I'm trying to scare
[42:29.820 --> 42:34.620]  people are making this stuff up I'm sick of that fake meme they put out that I'm
[42:34.620 --> 42:38.100]  trying to scare people you know what I think you're like me that you want to
[42:38.100 --> 42:42.660]  know about this going on when I tell you about the UN and foundations openly
[42:42.660 --> 42:45.780]  running the toll road companies and openly taking over our local
[42:45.780 --> 42:48.900]  governments all over the country when I tell you about military training to take
[42:48.900 --> 42:53.740]  your guns I think that your men and women who've got a spinal cord and got a
[42:53.740 --> 42:59.820]  heart and got guts but it didn't even guts when you realize what enslavements
[42:59.820 --> 43:04.500]  like it is not guts that makes you stand up against this but frankly it's the
[43:04.500 --> 43:07.980]  opposite ladies and gentlemen the only reason we have freedom is because our
[43:07.980 --> 43:12.860]  ancestors demanded it and fought for it I do not want to be a slave I'm afraid of
[43:12.860 --> 43:18.420]  being a slave I'm afraid of letting this scum take over and people need to
[43:18.420 --> 43:24.740]  choose the side right now the time for playing games is over
[43:26.500 --> 43:31.340]  we're in desperate straits we've been infiltrated they know the average
[43:31.340 --> 43:34.220]  American wants liberty so they've been everything they can to shut down your
[43:34.220 --> 43:39.420]  jobs ship them overseas and everything you can to harass local businesses and
[43:39.420 --> 43:43.740]  shut them down they've even paid billions of dollars to ship our factories
[43:43.740 --> 43:48.780]  like General Motors Cadillac and vault to China hundreds of them have been paid
[43:48.780 --> 43:54.340]  to leave we're under attack the bankers that run this country are enemies and
[43:54.340 --> 44:00.220]  they've put with unlimited taxpayer money their operatives everywhere I like
[44:00.220 --> 44:04.020]  in the analogy to the guy in the body snatcher movie the old 1950s version
[44:04.020 --> 44:07.420]  where he runs out of the small town it runs to the highway and he thinks he's
[44:07.420 --> 44:10.380]  safe he's warning people and he climbs in the back of the truck and there's more
[44:10.380 --> 44:15.700]  pods and we we've been going to these gentlemen one meetings and it's it's
[44:15.700 --> 44:19.820]  all it's like a horror movie they're all giggling they've got talking points
[44:19.820 --> 44:26.100]  they know they are after the interviews they'll go look I'm CIA and and I'm a
[44:26.100 --> 44:30.300]  socialist and we're taking over the same stuff you I mean it's horrible
[44:30.300 --> 44:37.580]  they're everywhere okay they know they know I used to think that most of their
[44:37.580 --> 44:40.940]  people didn't know they know folks they're on power trips that's why they're
[44:40.940 --> 44:44.380]  so authoritative that's why they walk with such purpose these are foreign
[44:44.380 --> 44:49.940]  soldiers plainclothes soldiers are all around us do you understand this we've
[44:49.940 --> 44:55.140]  been totally infiltrated at every level they teach the police the founding
[44:55.140 --> 44:59.420]  fathers are bad we've been occupied now they're getting ready to shut the
[44:59.420 --> 45:04.940]  media off they're getting ready to start arresting us and I feel sorry for those
[45:04.940 --> 45:09.100]  of you that are going to collaborate with these people
[45:09.620 --> 45:13.700]  people wonder why I get so animated because this is real ladies and gentlemen
[45:13.700 --> 45:17.940]  this is real they were at this UT professor's office when the cameras got
[45:17.940 --> 45:22.060]  turned off he said I'm a socialist and you see this he pulls out the CIA plaque
[45:22.060 --> 45:26.140]  they were able to turn the cameras on and get some quick video I mean it's just
[45:26.140 --> 45:29.780]  like oh man like we're supposed to cower down in fear because you're you know
[45:29.780 --> 45:37.300]  you're flashing CIA stuff we know we know we know we know globalists will call me
[45:37.300 --> 45:41.900]  up and you know give me these death threats and I'm like you don't think I
[45:41.900 --> 45:49.620]  don't already know I mean I'm committed we have been totally infiltrated and
[45:49.620 --> 45:52.740]  taken over look at how the government legalizes all the illegal aliens it
[45:52.740 --> 45:58.020]  makes them above the law look at how the government publicly does everything
[45:58.020 --> 46:02.220]  they can destroy this country look at how the system throws the book at you the
[46:02.220 --> 46:07.060]  citizen because you're the enemy they won't hire cops now with over a hundred
[46:07.060 --> 46:11.580]  IQ because they know the smart ones always get out and wake up they're
[46:11.580 --> 46:21.580]  trained that we're the enemy the enemy the enemy the takeover is almost complete
[46:21.580 --> 46:26.740]  ladies and gentlemen hard I want to go to this newscast and shift here's I'm
[46:26.740 --> 46:29.580]  gonna get into the conflagration the Middle East the attacks on free speech
[46:29.580 --> 46:34.180]  by the UN and their Muslim cohorts that are working with them all of this is
[46:34.180 --> 46:41.740]  coming up so much more today jam-packed Gerald Salente Mike Adams I'm gonna play
[46:41.740 --> 46:45.020]  this clip and then get Ted's expertise on it Ted Anderson 30 plus years in
[46:45.020 --> 46:49.860]  old silver business because I've I've seen this that the the central banks the
[46:49.860 --> 46:53.620]  private fellow reserve and others have been implicated and now these tongues and
[46:53.620 --> 46:59.780]  bars are showing up from countries facilities everywhere ten ounce hundred
[46:59.780 --> 47:04.380]  ounce bars you name it tungsten because it weighs almost the same as gold it
[47:04.380 --> 47:08.700]  will fool a scale and these have been professionally done and these are all
[47:08.700 --> 47:14.060]  over the place and this is how they're able to leverage the market that's why
[47:14.060 --> 47:16.700]  you've seen different governments demanding like Venezuela their gold
[47:16.700 --> 47:20.900]  back from the US and England but Chinese have been grabbing their gold
[47:20.900 --> 47:24.460]  reserves out because they're taking the gold out the back and bringing tungsten
[47:24.460 --> 47:28.820]  in this is being done on an industrial scale and now now it's even hitting
[47:28.820 --> 47:32.980]  jewelry shops all over the place here's this Fox News report the street in Fifth
[47:32.980 --> 47:37.220]  Avenue the important trust between merchants has been violated this ten
[47:37.220 --> 47:41.380]  ounce gold bar costing nearly eighteen thousand dollars turns out to be a
[47:41.380 --> 47:45.620]  counterfeit worth just about three thousand six hundred dollars it's filled
[47:45.620 --> 47:50.020]  with tungsten which weighs nearly the same as gold but cost just over a dollar
[47:50.020 --> 47:54.420]  an ounce even him photo bought the bar from a merchant who sold them real gold
[47:54.420 --> 47:58.980]  before but he heard counterfeit gold bars were going around so he drilled into
[47:58.980 --> 48:03.100]  several of his gold bars worth about a hundred thousand dollars and saw a great
[48:03.100 --> 48:08.660]  tungsten not gold I really get sick you know it's a big amount of money and there
[48:08.660 --> 48:13.340]  and I could not believe that that somebody very professional the clever
[48:13.340 --> 48:17.700]  it's perfect what makes it such a devious crime is apparently a real gold bars
[48:17.700 --> 48:22.700]  purchased including one with a serial number and papers is then hollowed out
[48:22.700 --> 48:27.420]  most of the gold is sold and tungsten is put inside because it weighs almost
[48:27.420 --> 48:32.540]  exactly the same as gold and then the gold bar is rebuilt so you can stop right
[48:32.540 --> 48:37.060]  there we've been talking about this for at least 1415 years we're not
[48:37.060 --> 48:42.380]  conspiracy theorist Ted what's the real mo I asked you this morning to dig up
[48:42.380 --> 48:45.580]  some more of the articles that I've seen over the years give us the bottom line
[48:45.580 --> 48:51.740]  on this and how widespread this is is a precious metals numismatic expert well
[48:51.740 --> 48:55.740]  of course the big story a couple years ago was Fort Knox and the tungsten bars
[48:55.740 --> 49:01.060]  that were in the 400 ounce bars in obviously this is a problem in the
[49:01.060 --> 49:05.340]  industry I mean one of the main reasons why you probably want to avoid places
[49:05.340 --> 49:09.900]  like eBay when you're buying gold bars there are going to be scammers out there
[49:09.900 --> 49:13.660]  they're going to try to get you on this you can get ultrasonic equipment and
[49:13.660 --> 49:18.460]  you can look at the gold bar from from the outside looking in and tell what kind
[49:18.460 --> 49:22.500]  of metals in there it's expensive if you want to go that direction otherwise you
[49:22.500 --> 49:26.660]  can just do with a dealer that's going to back everything they sell it is going
[49:26.660 --> 49:29.620]  to be a problem there's going to be more people trying to steal from each other
[49:29.620 --> 49:35.820]  it's just sort of an effect of the economy and the United States you know
[49:35.820 --> 49:40.340]  is one of the biggest offenders when it comes to this with the story that broke
[49:40.340 --> 49:46.860]  here just a couple years ago out of Fort Knox but you know again Alex what you
[49:46.860 --> 49:52.900]  probably I think personally the best way to to to handle this problem is to
[49:52.900 --> 49:56.660]  stay away from the bigger bars stick with smaller bars and of course in this
[49:56.660 --> 50:02.140]  case you do have the the registration numbers the you know all the serial
[50:02.140 --> 50:05.900]  numbers are on the bar it's just that somebody took the bar apart and put
[50:05.900 --> 50:11.460]  tungsten in there put the bar back together again deal with a reputable
[50:11.460 --> 50:14.620]  dealer that's that's the main thing if you're going to be doing it and and
[50:14.620 --> 50:17.540]  smaller bars it's going to be more difficult to do this with the one ounce
[50:17.540 --> 50:22.820]  bar is going to be much harder to counterfeit in this way than a than a
[50:22.820 --> 50:28.180]  10 ounce or a 400 ounce bar is going to be so yes indeed it's a problem one of
[50:28.180 --> 50:31.940]  the one of the ways to avoid it is to stick with the old currency coins the
[50:31.940 --> 50:38.180]  old 20s and 10s are going to be much you know more they're more authentic you if
[50:38.180 --> 50:42.940]  you if you have a real $20 gold piece there's no question as to what it is
[50:42.940 --> 50:46.100]  I want to finish up on this on the other side briefly because I want to talk
[50:46.100 --> 50:49.900]  about some of the other cases yes central bank holding facilities like Fort Knox
[50:49.900 --> 50:53.740]  it's come out they've got fake gold in there how that's used to manipulate the
[50:53.740 --> 50:56.700]  markets because you're talking more retail how to protect yourself and
[50:56.700 --> 51:01.220]  that's important too but I mean how is this used at the higher level the larger
[51:01.220 --> 51:04.940]  level the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of
[51:04.940 --> 51:09.660]  2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[51:09.660 --> 51:13.940]  in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[51:13.940 --> 51:18.420]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[51:18.420 --> 51:22.100]  and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[51:22.100 --> 51:26.180]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[51:26.180 --> 51:30.740]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[51:30.740 --> 51:34.380]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I

[54:24.380 --> 54:29.220]  we're gonna be covering DHS buys again 1.6 billion bullets total that's our
[54:29.220 --> 54:33.700]  video report texas woman sues walmart for ripping up her $100 bills yeah they're
[54:33.700 --> 54:40.820]  now arresting people for $2 bills too they just think money is illegal I was
[54:40.820 --> 54:44.540]  driving through a starbucks hardly ever go there but we were going
[54:44.540 --> 54:47.700]  there the day I was about a bunch of croissants and drinks and stuff for the
[54:47.700 --> 54:53.020]  kids we were going we're going swimming and I shouldn't tell the story how to
[54:53.020 --> 54:57.220]  get back to Ted and I gave the woman a 50 and I don't usually even have a 50 but
[54:57.220 --> 55:00.980]  that's all I have was a 50 she's like I'm sorry this is just too big and I said
[55:00.980 --> 55:04.780]  well that's what I got not giving you a credit card I was nice about it she gets
[55:04.780 --> 55:08.460]  out this pin is like drawing on to make sure it's not fake I mean just
[55:08.460 --> 55:12.540]  everything is illegal now so in their little pea brains I have except real
[55:12.540 --> 55:17.340]  fraud let's go back to Ted Anderson Ted how does this affect things though these
[55:17.340 --> 55:20.460]  reports of these different private central banks getting caught having
[55:20.460 --> 55:24.180]  different countries and corporations reserves and it really being tungsten
[55:24.180 --> 55:28.420]  and it's been moved out the back door when that happened at the Fort Knox that
[55:28.420 --> 55:31.620]  was not even a big story and it should have been the biggest story ever because
[55:31.620 --> 55:35.580]  Max Kaiser and others that I really trust they say that that they're
[55:35.580 --> 55:39.540]  manipulating that to keep the prices of gold down and the gold reserves are
[55:39.540 --> 55:42.900]  actually a lot lower than what we're told what you're intel well yeah I mean
[55:42.900 --> 55:46.940]  now that's what that's what I hear too and and I and I heard Max reporting on
[55:46.940 --> 55:52.700]  that obviously if you increase the volume of gold that's in the marketplace I
[55:52.700 --> 55:59.740]  mean banks lease their gold supplies out so you can trade futures contracts
[55:59.740 --> 56:04.700]  there's been so much manipulation I mean Gata has a ton of information on how
[56:04.700 --> 56:08.060]  the banks have been trying to suppress the price of gold obviously it's a
[56:08.060 --> 56:15.140]  losing proposition for him now been more more predominant in the 2000 era and
[56:15.140 --> 56:23.060]  the 1900 or 1990s but they do they lease the lease rate for gold is set by how
[56:23.060 --> 56:26.020]  much gold is available in the marketplace to be leased for futures
[56:26.020 --> 56:29.940]  contracts for selling when somebody goes into the futures market and they
[56:29.940 --> 56:33.780]  actually sell gold into the marketplace they're actually selling gold into the
[56:33.780 --> 56:37.380]  marketplace they have to lease it from somebody because they don't own it and
[56:37.380 --> 56:41.220]  they sell it short it that's why they call a selling short because you got all
[56:41.220 --> 56:45.540]  these big balls public and private full of gold that's being leased and
[56:45.540 --> 56:49.420]  manipulated but a lot of it's not really there it's tungsten yeah right
[56:49.420 --> 56:52.540]  exactly so then you increase the supply and that's how it manipulates the price
[56:52.540 --> 56:58.700]  down now obviously it's a form of naked shorting really yes it is it is it's a
[56:58.700 --> 57:02.780]  way that it's a way to increase supply it's like more like fractional reserve
[57:02.780 --> 57:06.500]  banking you're saying that you have ten thousand ounces of gold and reality you
[57:06.500 --> 57:09.740]  have 1,000 ounces well that's like Goldfinger wanted to do the opposite he
[57:09.740 --> 57:12.780]  wanted to radiate the gold so you couldn't use it to make his supplies
[57:12.780 --> 57:16.900]  quadruple instead they sit there and have fake gold to drive down the prices
[57:16.900 --> 57:22.580]  amazing and folks if you want a trusted gold name 15 years in the business 30
[57:22.580 --> 57:27.100]  plus total Ted Anderson's got it on hand and he's got incredible deals they're
[57:27.100 --> 57:31.060]  asked for the radio specials when you call and their stuff's all guaranteed
[57:31.060 --> 57:35.260]  but I recommend everybody drill you know check it for yourself or go have an
[57:35.260 --> 57:38.780]  ultrasound that's the that's the interesting thing about it Alex if you
[57:38.780 --> 57:42.100]  take a gold bar and you drill a hole through it yeah you're gonna damage that
[57:42.100 --> 57:44.940]  gold bar you're not gonna be able to sell it for the premium that it is but
[57:44.940 --> 57:49.580]  you're still gonna get 95% of spot when you go to melt it down it's not like
[57:49.580 --> 57:53.180]  you're gonna be losing a tremendous amount so you if you're concerned about a
[57:53.180 --> 57:56.380]  bar that you have just grab a drill drill a hole in it and by the way if there's
[57:56.380 --> 58:00.700]  all this fraud and in gold going on that's real imagine what's happening in
[58:00.700 --> 58:09.060]  paper give minus resources a call 800-686-2237-800-686-237 but they've got

[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.340]  happening in the economy and of course the big story DHS purchased the 200
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:49.580]  million more rounds of ammunition I want to open the phones up and don't worry
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.380]  won't have to hold because I don't have a lot of time I'll go right to you for
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:56.860]  police officers out there or active-duty military I know you've all been given
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.820]  riot training or you know folks that have and but I want your take on this
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:05.580]  what do you think of 1.6 million rounds of ammo since last November one
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:11.700]  billion four hundred million just this year over a billion of that in just
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:16.100]  the last six months what is your take on that I mean I mean along with all the
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.500]  other martial law preparations just for police and military eight hundred two
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:25.260]  five nine nine two three one I mean how could this be anything but a buildup for
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.820]  total war of the American people under continuity of government you know
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:34.420]  knowledge is powerful if you put it into action the execution of knowledge is
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.500]  what's really important and I'm here trying to get this story out I mean we
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.980]  had a foreign army massing on our border you know let's say five million
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:48.500]  Chinese troops massing on the Mexican border hypothetically and everybody's
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.820]  ignoring it and they're shipping in hundreds of millions of rounds of ammo
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.900]  and weapons I'd be hey we got a problem well the globalist are here using our
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:02.300]  money to buy tanks wheeled vehicles 1.6 million rounds of ammo admitting their
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.300]  training the military for civil unrest I mean that's why I say the Iran thing
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.660]  could go hot now that's why I'm saying the meltdown could happen now because
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:15.820]  they're moving now they're getting an all lined up right now and then you get
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.300]  the training manuals it's not about fighting al Qaeda which you know the
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.380]  globalist manufactured and run today it's all about those of us that are true
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.260]  Americans and understand the takeover they're really planning an authoritarian
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:31.900]  takeover this is a big deal this is a big deal and and keeping your head down is
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.140]  not gonna protect you on average historically that's gonna hurt a lot
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.820]  more people we've got to stand up and say hey we're in the right you people
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:44.500]  are crooks what are you doing in your national security system stop it stop it
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.220]  you're run by foreign banks here they are bragging on the news the foreign
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.380]  banks bragging the newspapers and financial publications and on TV that
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.820]  they've caught captured us and I'm like is anybody awake are you people in a coma
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:04.620]  what I mean it's all it's all parading around in front of us I we got hours and
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:08.060]  hours this flows different towns around Austin and at Austin where you go and
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.540]  it's like these operatives play dumb then you go find out they're all you in
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:15.340]  Rockefeller funded and they are taking everything over just under agenda 21 I
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.380]  mean they've got the mayors they've got the bureaucrats they've got the HUD
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.740]  money they've got it all they're just they plan on shutting everything down

[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:20.580]  no possibility of recalling the wing will be only one course of action over
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:27.700]  total commitment man drink you recall what Clemens once said about war and now
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:32.260]  I didn't think I do say no he said war was too important to be left to the
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:40.700]  generals when he said that 50 years ago you might have been right but today war
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:45.860]  is too important to be left to politicians they have neither the time the
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:52.500]  training nor the inclination for strategic thought resistance to
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:59.340]  tyrants is obedience to God it's alex jones
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:03.340]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen that's a clip from dr. strange love
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:07.580]  Stanley Kubrick and now we don't have the generals of the politicians running
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:12.980]  things we have bankers running things announcing a private global government in
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:17.580]  every financial publication out there as a public notice and telling us we're
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:23.900]  slaves I could play clips from CNN CNBC you name it announcing under
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.420]  international law that they've conquered us announcing that Europe is getting
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.860]  rid of whatever sovereignty it had left in their countries to the mega bankers
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:36.540]  that engineered the fraud and now in Europe in Australia in New Zealand in
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.980]  Canada in the United States every Western government is arming to the teeth
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.380]  against its population for a worldwide financial collapse that they've
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.740]  engineered but will pose as the saviors during and none of that is
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:54.620]  debatable now that is the course we're about to hit the iceberg I hope we can
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.020]  change course they may not even be able to turn the boat around if they try and
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:02.260]  quite frankly those running the boat have got its slam pedal to the metal they
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:08.700]  have got the throttle all the way down hammer down going straight at it and
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:14.820]  that is the issue Romney Obama rearranging deck chairs okay you could
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:18.100]  argue it's better to get Obama and let things get worse quicker or you can
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.980]  argue well maybe Romney will be good yeah maybe maybe a hope and a prayer I
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:26.100]  don't know at least Romney gives lip service to free market and stuff but
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:30.420]  maybe it's best to just have somebody pushing communism communism for us though
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.900]  not for the offshore banker so coming up DHS purchases 200 million more rounds
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:40.380]  of ammunition this story has gone viral it's up at info wars comm and drugs
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:44.260]  report calm on the right-hand side additional purchases include bullets
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:49.700]  designed for snipers that's now more than five bullets almost six bullets per
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:56.380]  man woman and child in the country that's 16 that's 1.6 billion plus bullets
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:02.020]  and they are just buying up everything in sight that is roughly double the
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:07.180]  ammunition the US military bought last year we're doing a report on that it
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.420]  looks like it's gonna be double this year so I mean it's getting ready for war
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:15.820]  and they're run by foreign banks the all the little yuppies their trendies
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:19.580]  their socialist that's their army bankers use socialist as their
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:25.620]  collectivist robbers because they want loot they're like Roman centurions they
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.900]  just are non-threatening in the sandals and you know their little sissy walk
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.780]  they do that's all a cover these are craven demons and the conservatives are
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.060]  just totally neutralized off in La La Land having no idea what's going on and
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:44.740]  their operatives are everywhere the I mean it's incredible I mean you can go
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.100]  to any town where I live around Austin and go into any meeting and they're
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:53.460]  there running everything and all UN Rockefeller funded I mean it is it is on
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:58.580]  we are in trouble unlimited taxpayer money to fund every control freak you
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:02.980]  can imagine who are just looting things 24-7 because that's the globalist plan
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:09.040]  destroy this country I want to talk to police and military right now brief
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.420]  briefly in this segment the next what do you make of 1.6 billion bullets what
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.820]  do you make of all the tanks and armored vehicles and preparation for civil
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:24.660]  unrest that are admitted what do you make of all this 825 at 992 31 for
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:34.100]  military active duty for your take on this and for police 825 at 992 31 then
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:38.780]  coming up the story just went up at info wars.com shocking evidence that
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:43.300]  GMOs are causing incredible tumors in lab animals that's been out for a while
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.460]  but there's new studies out it's huge Mike Adams will be popping in Gerald
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:51.700]  Solente joining us in the next hour I'm going to get into the French magazine
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.820]  publishing things of Muhammad and so now the UN and others are calling the
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.260]  restrict free speech we're beginning into all that I predicted that would come
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:03.380]  next a global move to restrict speech is all part of the plan out of the
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.220]  class of civilizations the new world order will emerge Albert Pike said that
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:12.560]  back in the 1870s 1878 he said we'll have a clash between Muslims the
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.900]  Mohammedans as he called them and the Christians and then out of that the
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:23.980]  Illuminati religion will basically emerge 800 2599231 Kevin in Colorado who
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:30.620]  was a police officer what is your take on this sir hey Alex actually just
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:35.820]  attended a lecture on the police state here at University of Colorado and it
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:40.940]  was ridiculous I'll tell you the level of globalism here is just amazing I
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:45.900]  thought Washington DC was bad but I'm actually here I'm I've infiltrated the
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.740]  council on foreign relations they've invited me to become a member I'm
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:54.140]  attending the meetings for the Denver Council on Foreign Relations they have
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.420]  sub-satellites not the mothership but you've been invited into the local
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:01.620]  takeover arm yeah Alex and it says on their website it says friends of the
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:06.300]  council on foreign relations and this other thing called the Pacific Institute
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:09.860]  on international policy have you ever heard of yeah that was founded by the
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:15.020]  Rockefellers every spanking one of them was it's all them at literally 95% of
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:20.500]  everything we run into is them at I mean it's all public and that they Denver is
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:25.700]  the real capital of the US they're gonna have the capital of the Americas in in
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:31.300]  Atlanta Georgia and then DC is just a district of criminal activity but yeah
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.980]  no they teach the police the now just follow me tell folks what they're
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:39.420]  teaching you there well I attended this lecture this is the interesting thing
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:44.540]  that was actually in Obama rally I saw Obama speak about a week ago but the
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:50.060]  interesting thing was two days before Obama came there was an event titled it
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:56.020]  do you know why I'm pulling you over and it was about police civilian
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:02.260]  interaction so I had to attend that and it was exactly what I expected the whole
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:06.580]  thing was glorifying the police state they talked about Alex have you ever
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:11.260]  heard this term community oriented policing yeah and you think that means
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:16.260]  back to the cop on the beat you knew and your friend no it's interfacing you
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:21.140]  as a social network to basically spy on everybody and get police in non-
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:26.380]  traditional police duties yeah exactly Alex the way you tried to explain it was
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.940]  he talked about police being on the street interacting with civilians and
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:35.180]  then this is the thing there was a major police state I think you were talking
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:39.180]  recently about how they're having all these drills and I think at the Obama
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.220]  rally there was a major police state drill they lined up these cops on like a
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:51.220]  two-mile stretch of road just hundreds of police every like 15 or 20 feet Alex
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:56.500]  there were animal control officers working the street as police office yeah
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.660]  no what they're doing is is they're blurring the lines just like any
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:04.540]  martial state any military state you just get used to the uniforms everywhere
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:08.060]  and used to being told what to do so you don't notice it when your neighbor
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:12.420]  disappears or helicopters run a drill oh this time they attacked well that's
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:16.620]  just what they do it's part of domestication it's all a psych warfare
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:20.300]  profile that stuff's all been declassified in manuals from the 60s
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:25.380]  you can watch videos of it on YouTube from the 60s the they were classified
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:29.940]  until the 90s and how they would take over third-world countries and and you
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.980]  know to fight the communist threat but they would fight it with the exact
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:37.060]  tactics of the communist so see you become the communist by fighting the
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.740]  communist and that's why the bankers created the communist the entire time
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:46.460]  it's very diabolical you should do a YouTube video sir and you know don't
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:49.860]  show your face or whatever and then expose it you are the leader you are
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:53.580]  the resistance thank you so much we've got Mike and Tennessee whose Air Force
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:58.180]  we've got Jeff in Texas whose army Milton his brother of a cop told him
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:03.220]  some stuff let's go to Mike and Tennessee Air Force listing on 1600 a.m. Mike good
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:08.180]  to have you with us Alex you need to look at what they're buying and that tells
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:12.620]  you what their plans are when you see they're setting up for sniper situations
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:17.060]  you need to come up with solutions for the general public to know how to respond
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:21.820]  what not to do and how to react because in a in an environment like you live in
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:26.500]  a rural community and they set up a spot in a sniper and they've got just a
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:31.100]  matter of time before you walk out of your house if that be their plan then
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.420]  people need to be aware of that they need to prepare and understand how to
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.780]  evade those situations yes sir and to be clear the rural council is run by
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.300]  Homeland Security under his Department of Defense and my military sources
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:47.540]  wouldn't tell me what was classified but they said we're training to do what we
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:52.500]  do to shut down communities scorched earth cordon the whole rural areas and
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.940]  they're just going to kill farmers when they come out of their house they're
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.380]  going to use mercenaries and others to take the land they're going to be
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:02.980]  killing farmers who aren't even resisting them I don't think people
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.580]  understand this is a Ukrainian Soviet takeover model from everything I've
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:11.820]  researched that's the best example I could call it they plan to do to us what
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:16.140]  they did to the Ukrainians folks we cannot let this happen well in West
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:19.220]  Tennessee they for the last two years they've had Russian soldiers
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:24.180]  peritoping practice missions in Fairfax County Tennessee front page article of
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:30.900]  commercial appeal in June of 2010 and a whole back page article about it where
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.140]  they're training for deportment to Afghanistan well when I look on Google
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:38.540]  earth Afghanistan is mountainous rugged desert and Philly that county is flat
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:43.680]  as a pancake and there's wheat fields cotton fields again they always lie to
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.340]  you in the local paper but then you can go look at the actual mission which I
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:52.340]  did look at the mission funding that is under counterterrorism under NLE 11
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:59.420]  that happened in 11 right correct yeah I know that was under NLE 11 and that was
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:04.860]  counterterrorism to fight and then the manuals attached to it that are public
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:08.180]  is they were training to fight Red Blooded Americans that was a red dawn
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.500]  training drill in your area and what they'll do is they'll go to one house
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.620]  they'll take them out they'll sit there and relax and watch TV and eat and then
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.660]  they'll get refreshed they'll go to the next door neighbors and stay there eat
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:23.460]  get refreshed sleep next morning start all over again and they'll just work the
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:26.940]  way through the country they'll go from east to west now that's the plan and
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:30.660]  that's why if they do start it I've never been for violence I'm doing
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:34.260]  everything I can to make this defensive one stuff like that starts
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:38.220]  tactically you're forced to go to them you don't wait for them to come to you
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:42.020]  you've got to meet them at the curb but you've got to get people to understand
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:46.940]  techniques and tactics that are not out there that are not known well I'm a
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:51.900]  reporter not a general but I tell you what I just said I did people knew how
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:56.860]  much trouble we were in I mean folks I know this sounds crazy but it's all
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:01.980]  real we'll be right back we got infiltrated we got took over Aaron
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.620]  full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:10.020]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.540]  to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:17.060]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:20.620]  and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:23.580]  of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.660]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:30.580]  across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:34.940]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:38.300]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.660]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods

[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:15.780]  mind the globalists have their operatives all over this country not just
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:19.660]  acclimating us with Russians here just last month in Denver for anti-terror
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:24.820]  drills they have prepared a lot of the police to go along with this but a lot
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:29.220]  of police have finally woken up because the brainwashing's gotten so evident
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:33.780]  we're about to go back to your phone calls all I know is that as a republic as
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:38.980]  a society we are in dire straits our troops are all over the world being
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:43.100]  overrun in Afghanistan you name it our so-called government is putting al-Qaeda
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:50.180]  in all of the Middle East and then meanwhile these paramilitary forces are
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:54.180]  being built up of mercenaries and others that will do whatever they're told
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:00.460]  against the American people and have been trained we're the enemy think of how
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:04.180]  crazy things have gotten and understand that during a financial collapse the
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:10.260]  public will beg for mercenaries whoever to come into restore order not knowing
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:14.140]  that when communications are cut off then the mercenaries can do whatever they
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:18.380]  want and they do want to starve out this country that is on the drawing board we
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:22.700]  have to get the word out and back this program off before the media goes dark
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:27.740]  before they shut us down let's go ahead and talk to mark in Mississippi who's a
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:32.780]  police officer mark what's your take on the 1.6 billion bullets purchased now in
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:37.980]  the last year by homeland security well first of all Alex I'd like to preface
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:42.420]  this by saying that most Americans would probably be completely shocked by the
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:46.620]  integration of their state local police with federal law enforcement and the
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:54.580]  federal government having said that and I'm not going to say a lot but there
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:59.100]  being preparations made for two scenarios and those two scenarios are
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:06.460]  they're prepared for possible financial collapse which could entail martial
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:11.500]  law and the other scenario is going to be that they're prepared for massive
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:16.420]  inflation which would cause the price of these different types of ammunition to
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.980]  skyrocket and if the federal government has those on hand then they can avoid
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:25.700]  that so that that's the two scenarios that are being prepared for and that's
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:31.260]  really all I can say wow sir that is the best the best answer I've gotten that
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:36.540]  says sure this is all for martial law but also they're buying ten times what
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:41.180]  that even need for martial law because they're worried about the arms race of
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:46.820]  citizens buying so much of it already they understand that that they now want
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:51.340]  to stockpile this valuable commodity so that is a good angle so that's what
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:56.420]  you're being told that's the two scenarios that are being prepared for
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:01.700]  well let me just say this to you you know the town or city you live in the
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:06.260]  people calling the shots on top aren't Obama and Romney they're foreign banks
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:09.980]  have you seen them in the news bragging that that the world government's being
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:16.140]  established right now yes I have okay well I'm gonna ask the pull I'm gonna
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.340]  ask you as a police officer then I mean is there any line in the sand that you
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:23.700]  and other officers won't cross I mean is there I mean our country's already
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:28.900]  pretty much been hijacked now they want to complete the takeover I mean what
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:32.020]  should we be asking you to do because I know cops will say well it's up to you
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:35.060]  the citizens to get control of the government but now we try to even go
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.940]  protest and the and the police are told to try to scare us off so we're kind of
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:43.140]  getting to that point where the system wants to cause a civil war which won't
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:48.140]  be good for anybody but the offshore banks what do you recommend we do I think
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:53.060]  most of the officers that I work with respect the Constitution and they
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:57.140]  respect America's constitutional rights now I can't speak for other police
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.260]  departments around the country so but yeah that's really the limit of my
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:04.700]  comments I just wanted to give you those scenarios to let you know and you can
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:07.940]  research that and you can find that if you look out there on the internet dig
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:11.140]  deep enough no I've no actually I know you're right but let me just add this
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:15.220]  last point to you I mean are the other police you're talking to are you guys
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:23.500]  having discussions about what's going on here there are a few but but but but
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:28.220]  police are just like any other average American they are they are just normal
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:34.020]  people and some are awake and some are not yeah that's code for super stupid
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:38.460]  and super lazy I mean if you're saying the average American I'm sorry there's
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.820]  a lot of hard work in America and she's like there's a lot of hard-working cops
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:44.260]  there's a lot of just people that they're not even dumb they don't want to
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:50.100]  know and this is incredible history unfolding right now and it's about to
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:57.220]  get absolutely cattywampus use a term you might know there in Louisiana and I
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:01.460]  don't want this to happen I mean do you have any ideas of how to stop this I
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:06.740]  mean I think we expose it and that made back off the perpetrators doing what
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.100]  you're doing Alex that's the best way to do it yeah I hear you I appreciate your
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:15.540]  call I mean folks this is real I just hope the listeners understand 1.6
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:20.380]  billion rounds of ammo TSA on the streets all these preparations the
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:24.460]  reeducation centers you know when I got that army document three months ago four
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:29.820]  months ago I wished it wasn't real and then the army came out and said no
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:35.220]  that's real you shouldn't have that and then the army put it out I'm gonna say
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:41.900]  that again reeducation camps calling them reeducation camps are in public army
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:47.460]  documents and it's not even news reeducation camps I'm not going to any

[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:44.940]  other studies that show similar things this is a big study there's photos it
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:51.180]  just went up at info wars.com we're gonna be going to Mike Adams here in just a
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:55.540]  few minutes right now we're talking to police officers and military let's move
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:59.660]  quick before we go to Mike Adams I want to get to David who's in the Army in
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:03.820]  Kentucky Ron in New York as a police officer Jeff is in the Army Milton who
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:08.420]  is an Indiana brother of a cop will get to him Tim in Kentucky Army let's get
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:12.700]  Ron in New York as a police officers take again on the government buying
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:17.660]  another 200 million rounds of ammo homeland security a bunch of it match
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:24.380]  grade 308 sniper ammunition type of stuff I shoot out of my Reaper or my
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:31.220]  Remington 700 let's go ahead and go to him give us your take Ron on exactly
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:36.980]  what's going on I this is my theory on what's happened look how cleverly and I
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:40.180]  want to put forth this theory I don't think it would be has been put forth
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:45.980]  earlier look how cleverly they cover this up about two weeks back give a take
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:50.660]  there was a story about the 174,000 rounds purchased by the Social Security
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:56.700]  Administration when you did the math there it broke down to a plausible
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:02.220]  deniability because the amount of rounds that what distributed to Social
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:07.180]  Security officers or within the reasonable sure amount hold on a base
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:11.460]  hold on let me let me let me break it down an amount of rounds were within a
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:16.300]  reasonable framework for target practice now that's the switch and bait
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:22.380]  story see that's the red herring that was offered for the public well they're
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:29.260]  doing that simultaneously and more quietly they're out buying obscene and
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:34.780]  unjustifiable amounts of ammunition through other agencies you see that was
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:41.060]  done as a red herring or a switch and bait to allay the public's fear and
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:45.020]  everybody's like oh that sounds reasonable then so they just focus on
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:49.420]  that one little spot and they don't look at all the other agencies buying
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:53.820]  obscene amounts of ammo that could never be justified so look how cleverly they
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.540]  pull off they pull off the straight I agree why do you so I mean what do you
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:02.020]  think it's for oh it's for target practice all right but it's not it's not
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:05.900]  paper targets I think they're ultimately interested in let's just say it's moving
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.740]  targets and they all happen to be of American nationality I think eventually
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:12.420]  it is going to come down to that that's what I think that they intend on doing
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:17.540]  this has been building up a long time I've been calling you or I've called you
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:21.700]  since the early part of this century and I spoke to you when I initially called
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:25.700]  you that's 10 or more years ago and I told you in New York City was basically
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:31.380]  one of the test models it's practically a federalized city they when they
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:37.300]  started integrating federal let's just say a federalizing law enforcement in
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:41.540]  this city it was a test ground for it the utilization of funds equipment and
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:45.580]  things like that I noticed that we started to see greater power
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:50.060]  militarization being built up in police force it was no longer just a nice
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:54.460]  neighborhood cop that everybody is accustomed to and knew up to that point
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:59.180]  but it's being turned into a power military organization I had mentioned
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.900]  that at that time you would also mention the military the United States military
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:10.300]  at that time 10 years ago or so I called you and told you of right on public
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:15.020]  access TV it was the most shocking thing I'd seen at that time a video in which
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:19.780]  the United States military was quite proudly and comfortably lauding the fact
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:24.140]  that they had members of the Council on Foreign Relations Daniel Pipes in
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:31.300]  particular in the in the Pentagon speaking to junior officers and when
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:35.700]  they interviewed these junior officers it was made clear that if they wanted to
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:39.540]  move up ranks or go anywhere in the military they would have to go along
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:43.380]  with that internationalist program this is within the United States no no sir
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:48.220]  you're absolutely right listen they have federalized the police already and but
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:53.060]  the feds aren't feds they're globalist banker operatives the federal government
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:57.660]  was taken over by collaborators and foreign operatives they're globalist and
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:01.540]  while we're busy worried about Russians and Chinese or the jihadis that the
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:05.660]  globalist were on they are taking over and now they're taking over the little
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:11.180]  towns outside Austin and when you turn the camera off they go yeah I'm CIA we're
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:17.460]  taking over I mean these are soldiers we've got soldiers at UT and and and and
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:23.340]  over the cities plainclothes State Department CIA foreign banking
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:28.220]  operatives they know what's incredible is how many are actual collaborators what's
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:32.340]  incredible is how big this is what's incredible is the Army manuals now admit
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:36.100]  reeducation camps I just showed the Army manual earlier on screen of your
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:40.180]  prison planet TV viewer we have it linked in our DHS purchases turn a
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:44.700]  million more rounds of ammunition this is a radical takeover unlike the world's
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:49.700]  ever seen it's not a foreign army pouring over it's a slow stealth takeover
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.700]  where they make profits as they take over new industries but it's all towards
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:58.420]  the total takeover and now I think we're getting very very close Ron I've got to
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.700]  go to our next guest we'll go back to your calls other police and military
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:05.940]  that are holding I promise we'll get to you ahead of Gerald Salente but anything
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:10.060]  else Ron you can say because I was you know I mean I went to New York decades
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:13.900]  ago and the police weren't mean I've since been back there quite a bit they
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:19.820]  they literally act more thuggy than street gangs scum I see and so it's not
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:23.900]  just that they've also corrupted everything and now they're saying the
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.260]  mayor will tell you what to eat what to drink what to do if you sit on the
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:31.620]  sidewalk will arrest you I mean they have hundreds of thousands of stopping
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:38.180]  frisk I mean New York is a hellish city now what happened is is gradually over
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:44.060]  that same period of time they began to recruit people with a certain they know
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:47.500]  the psychological profile of who they're looking for and they said that starts in
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:51.900]  recruitment process and they wanted people that would be more valuable or
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.420]  more amenable to doing these sort of things they specifically went after the
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:01.900]  personality types who would be capable of doing these things and as a result of
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:07.220]  that they basically by and large do have a force now that would not reflect on
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:11.540]  human conscience about doing some of the most unthinkable things or things that
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:16.300]  would not have been done by and large by that force in another time where another
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:21.340]  type of morality was dominant they needed to make sure that they bled out
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:26.860]  those that subscribe to the old morality and brought in those who were either on
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:31.420]  power trips who were only concerned about careers who were only concerned
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:36.780]  about maybe what they could grab and try and populate that organization with
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:41.820]  those types this is something that they have gradually done over a generation
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:45.380]  maybe to write the globalist knew they couldn't take this country down overnight
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:50.740]  and they've done it by infiltration just as the great historian wrote in
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:57.300]  Rome Cicero guys will you print me the quote of Cicero on the trader Cicero on
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.980]  the trader and I'll cover it when we're done with Mike Adams thank you so much

[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:07.980]  lot of good information I guess he retired about 10 years ago so when he
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:10.900]  could start calling into the show and we have other police and military waiting
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:15.260]  to talk to us look we've just the Constitution Bill of Rights and we
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:19.420]  followed it all this would be illegal and it's still illegal but the system just
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:24.380]  does whatever it wants we're in dire straits these globalist hate America they
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:29.020]  want to round up 50 million of us and kill half of those that's Obama's own

[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:05.500]  premature death and up to 50% of males suffered premature death a severe organ
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:10.140]  damage in those who ate this for a lifetime we're talking liver damage kidney
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:15.580]  damage damage throughout the entire body system all of biology damaged by
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:20.420]  this we're talking a massive increase in large tumors tumors so large Alex that
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:23.540]  if I don't know if your producers can show some of the pictures on screen they
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:28.420]  are horrifying it shows tumors so large that some of these rats had to drag the
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:33.020]  tumors across the floor as they were tried to crawl there they're so large
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:37.420]  and by the way everybody I know has young family dying brain tumors breast
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:42.980]  cancer I mean they're murdering us in a hardcore kill-off absolutely and remember
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.500]  the USDA and the FDA they don't require long-term studies most of the studies
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:50.220]  that have been done out there we have just been 90 days this is the first
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:55.020]  study and this is why this is breaking news just hours off the press it's the
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:59.900]  first study to study a lifetime of GM consumption and in the lifespan of a rat
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:04.020]  which of course is relatively short compared to humans but but what it means
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:09.180]  is that those parents who are feeding their children GMOs today they are
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:15.340]  cursing those children to a lifetime of massive tumors massive suffering massive
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:19.700]  premature they get to slice them all up at the facility and have runs for the
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:23.260]  cure and everything while the very system murdering them sucks even more
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:28.260]  money and that very system remember the people who think they're part of that
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:31.740]  system their children are going to die of these tumor they love it though they
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:35.580]  love people they love that that's a sacrament to them it's insane though I
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.260]  mean think about the regulators they think they're getting away the average
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:41.460]  yuppie loves to doll in their kid around town while they're dying of cancer to
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:44.460]  get attention so that they'll probably try to give them cancer this is very
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:49.180]  exciting for them go ahead yeah well I mean all the environmentalists and
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:53.060]  transhumanists who say there's too many of us again double up for your kids you
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:57.180]  know death is good go ahead hey it's no coincidence why the globalists are
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:01.700]  supporting the two things that are killing us all off Alex that's vaccines
[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:06.260]  and GMOs and and now this study it's published in the food and chemical
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:11.740]  toxicology journal this study by French researchers very prestigious it well
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:15.940]  it is and and it's the first study look at the lifetime of what happens the point
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:21.540]  is I think that GMOs are the next phalidomide phalidomide remember that
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:27.700]  drug that they gave to pregnant women it's gonna be a lot worse than the phalidomide but yeah yeah you're right yeah but anyway
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:32.580]  that's the basics of the story I know your time is tight today no no I just
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:38.340]  get so angry go back to phalidomide guys show the phalidomide children
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:42.220]  with their little arms and legs being tiny show people but that only hurt
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:46.700]  millions this is attacking billions absolutely remember phalidomide was
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.900]  was declared totally safe by the FDA the doctors prescribed that they said oh
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:53.980]  it's completely safe there are no side effects go ahead and take the drug and
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:58.220]  then the children were born with no arms and and no legs and all these horrifying
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:02.060]  birth defects and the company that made phalidomide the drug company didn't
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:07.380]  apologize for 50 years and even when they did apologize they said it took us
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:12.780]  50 years because we were in a state of shock really a state of shock for 50
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:18.260]  years well how much shock are we gonna be in when billions of us start having
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:23.060]  these tumors from eating GMOs right now that's gonna be probably the greatest
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:27.260]  scientific disaster in the history of human civilization it's all done in the
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:31.540]  name of science but it's junk science is corporate science you know it's the
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:34.980]  science of death it's the scientific dictatorship that you often refer to and
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.940]  these scientists are getting paid to push this stuff onto people and it's
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:44.420]  it's it's poisoning the people there's no question about it we're gonna put some
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:48.580]  of the flaminamide I'm always having trouble pronouncing that all
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:54.260]  idomide children up on screen for prison planet TV viewers but anybody can
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:59.340]  Google the images and look at it for yourself well and here's some of the
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:03.020]  rats here's some of the images of the rats with their massive tumors or you
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:07.060]  probably have better shots there but I mean the tumors are so large on these
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:10.900]  rats that they can barely move around they can barely breathe the some of them
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:14.260]  you know that's why they die early they die from the tumor taken over we're
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:20.100]  looking at a massive just a generation of human beings who are going to be I
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:23.740]  think they're gonna end up in the same situation as these rats now it's a
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:27.740]  boon to the breast cancer industry the breast cancer industry loves GMOs
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:32.260]  because they get to diagnose more women treat more women chemotherapy more
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:36.420]  women irradiate more women that's money for them that's their problem or women
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:41.460]  bury more women bury more mothers bury more daughters it's just wonderful well
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:45.540]  that's that's the story Alex we're being soft killed the proof is now in the
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:50.060]  journals that anybody who eats GMOs at this point is committing suicide
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:55.500]  basically so people look for organic corn especially if you eat corn make sure
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:49:00.180]  it is organic I'll be covering this in more detail on Monday when I'm a guest
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:03.380]  hosting the show we're gonna go into protecting yourself from radiation
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:07.300]  protecting yourself from GMOs and also Alex I have some breaking news about
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:11.980]  protecting yourself from MSG that's something that no one has really been
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:15.860]  able to talk about yet we'll have that on your show breaking on info wars on
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:21.700]  Monday well Mike thank you so much for breaking this down but I want to come
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:24.340]  back it's been five more minutes while we've got you because this is so
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:28.900]  important continue with what this study shows I've seen earlier studies you can
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:35.260]  just type in you know studies show organ failure sterilization or infertility
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:40.220]  from GMOs and we've seen other studies I guess this one's important because it
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:44.020]  went for so long yes because it's the first study to really look at the
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:49.940]  lifetime effects of GM consumption now they fed the rats genetically modified
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:56.140]  corn from Monsanto and a trace level of the roundup pesticide levels that are
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:00.860]  legally allowable in the US water supply so that's what the rats were fed and
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:06.820]  that's what they drank and with that the different pictures here show rats with
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:11.980]  just the GMO showing tumors rats with the the GMO plus the roundup these
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:16.220]  tumors here in the middle and then here on this side is just the roundup in the
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:22.740]  water so no matter which way you slice it cancer tumors were large in in these
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:26.980]  rats and they were much larger compared to the control group so we know this is
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:31.820]  good science the scientists have posted a video on YouTube about this I don't have
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:36.980]  a tile for that but another story here's another one from a few years ago
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:41.740]  Monsanto's GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals we'll we'll throw
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:45.700]  that up on screen real quick for people just type in GMO linked to organ failure
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:49.500]  you'll get literally thousands of articles and Mikey privately told me
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:53.300]  about some stuff the establishment's getting ready to try to strike back
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:58.540]  against those of us trying to expose their operation that is going so well
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:04.100]  pediatric cancer is up over 10,000% the worst drought in 50 years continues and
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:08.660]  the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:12.940]  Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:17.100]  fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:20.540]  livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:24.860]  food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:29.300]  today's prices by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct now as the
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:33.060]  price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:36.420]  is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply for me
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:39.460]  foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about their
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:43.700]  delicious long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat at any time to save
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:47.460]  money today and because it stores for 25 years you're locking in today's prices

[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:05.860]  hi there my name is Frank Bates what I'm about to tell you in the next 60
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:09.620]  seconds could get me in a lot of trouble I just created a free video
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:15.020]  presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:19.140]  government agencies for what they really are incompetent line crooks that are
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:23.100]  counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:27.860]  some have called this a conspiracy others have called it a cover-up and you
[01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:33.860]  will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes my video at 123coverup.com
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:38.260]  exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:42.260]  can beat them to watch the controversial video the thousands of other
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:46.780]  smart patriots have already seen in the last three months go to 123coverup.com
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.300]  and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:57.220]  go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:10.900]  again that's 123coverup.com
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:15.620]  there was another big mainline scientific study out last week where
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:19.740]  scientists identified this new big wheat that that's being rolled out this GMO
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:26.940]  that it has the same genes in it that basically program organ operations in
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:30.300]  that they're predicting it's going to cause organ failure none of this is by
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:34.780]  accident people need to understand Monsanto with this dioxin agent orange
[01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:38.980]  all of it that was really a chemical weapon they were really mixing a
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:42.820]  neurotoxin with the agent orange it was really a chemical weapon against the
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:46.980]  vietcong but also soft killing our own troops that's all been declassified I've
[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:52.260]  had generals on to break that down so you need to understand we're dead already
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:56.580]  they've only got eight major GMO crops we've been eating for about 15 years
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:01.100]  it's already devastating us they're now coming out with over a hundred GMO
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:04.420]  crops everything's going to be basically GMO you eat so you won't be able to
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:07.700]  escape it and they're making sure you don't label things that you're making
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.660]  sure that that doesn't happen and there's brain aluminum on us and and
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:17.180]  fluoride in the water a acid form of it so it's much worse you need some calcium
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:21.940]  fluoride different animal they try to confuse that Mike Adams I mean actually
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:25.620]  John Bown out there got angry during the break he has a young sweet daughter who
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:29.900]  I've met and close to the age of one of my young daughters and he said well
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:32.900]  that's it I mean you know we're all gonna have giant tumors in 10 years we'll
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:36.500]  probably won't have to wait I mean I mean I know so many young people dying
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:40.220]  all around me it's just death death death it's so much fun and and we have
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:44.780]  these murdering eugenicists and and the GMO companies are on record at their
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:50.420]  cafeteria is not serving GMO and it's all funny to them it's all funny and I
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:54.020]  mean where does it end I mean I guess this is just it they're soft killing us
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:58.100]  the Nazis ran you into pits and shot you in the back of the head these guys
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:02.340]  just shoot you with the food and if you get a little too uppity they got 1.6
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:07.300]  billion bullets to actually do it but I I believe Alex there is a way to have a
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:12.660]  nutritional shield against the toxic tumor building effects of GMOs and this
[01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:17.300]  is why it's it's so important that you and infowars continue to teach people
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:22.340]  about micronutrients the trace minerals that are so important I believe even
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:24.940]  though this hasn't yet been born out in the studies but I believe it will
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:29.180]  before long that if you eat superfoods and if you eat the trace minerals and
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:32.420]  if you get your nutrition in a supplemental form because most of the
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.700]  foods are depleted then you can actually prevent a very large portion of
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:41.980]  of the of your normal cancer tumor risk that might have been enhanced with
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:46.100]  antioxidants and stuff I mean it's admitted if you have a young but I
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:50.300]  think that most of the people who are going to die from GMO tumors let's say
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:55.700]  are people who have poor nutrition who who are nutritionally depleted every
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:00.060]  single day the low in vitamin D the low in magnesium the low in selenium
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:04.580]  especially our selenium is crucial for preventing cancer the low in zinc and so
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:08.060]  on all of these things you can get those things in a supplement form from high
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:12.660]  quality supplements or superfoods or certain wildcrafted foods organic foods
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:16.820]  have higher nutrition and so on but if you eat the standard processed diet you're
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:22.100]  dead the you're sure if you're eating the standard McDonald's you know stuff
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:26.460]  fried literally in silicone this stuff will get you you'll die when you're 50
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:31.500]  instead of you know we would live to 100 but we die at 90 because we fought
[01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.060]  back against the soft kill literally there are actually studies out there
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:39.100]  that show that you're dealing with the superfoods but expanding on this Mike
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:43.740]  how do the elites think they're gonna get away with this when the the White
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:47.900]  House science are has written in four different books that they're jacking the
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:52.860]  food and water I mean the the elites know that they have monopolized the
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:57.620]  debate over science and they just flap the word science behind everything
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:01.780]  that's killing you and then they claim it's scientific and you can't argue with
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:06.420]  them now I'm not against all science by the way Al Gore's pay him money global
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:11.020]  warming is happening it's scientific no one disagrees right well well vaccines
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:13.900]  they claim are always scientific even though they're really experimental the
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.700]  fluoride in the water they claim that's scientific even though it's toxic
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:21.020]  pesticide insecticide chemicals and then the GMOs they claim that's scientific
[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:24.900]  maybe somebody beats your brains out with a baseball bat the cops show up
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:29.060]  you're like you killed this guy but it's scientific I mean I mean hey sniper
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:34.420]  bullet ballistics are also scientific Alex yeah and the Communist killing
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:38.140]  millions of Ukrainians with scientific do five more minutes ahead of Gerald

[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:27.500]  alex jones the only reason the global transhumanist eugenicist masters of
[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:33.100]  death may win is because their evil is so massive and so over the top people
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:36.580]  average people can't deal with it Mike Adams is our guest for five more
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:40.100]  minutes than the one the only Gerald Salante joining us Mike Adams has this
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:45.180]  huge breaking news at natural news dot com it's also mirrored redlings at the
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:49.900]  top at info wars dot com new GMO study rats fed lifetime of GMO corn grew
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:55.340]  tumors 70% of females died early now the issue here is that I wanted to say
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:01:00.940]  finally is the UN openly their codex alimentarius is trying to ban vitamins
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:04.860]  and minerals up with a counter in South Korea you can't get an aspirin without
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:09.820]  a prescription or vitamin A or vitamin E they're doing everything they can
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:13.180]  they're eugenicists they say there's too many of us all this that we've seen the
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:17.260]  last century injecting little kids with syphilis this year big pharma coming
[02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:22.900]  out caught giving people MMR and the shots all of that was just a test I want
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:26.420]  to see if you agree with this now as they set up their world government police
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:31.420]  state straight jacket that's meant to just organize now as you know cancer
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:35.260]  start going up you think 10,000 percent's good and kids how about 50,000
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:40.140]  percent hey you know one in 25,000 kids have autism how about one in 58 I mean
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:44.140]  they're really just testing turning up the background noise seeing how much
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:47.260]  they can get away with right now that's why people like you Mike and the
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:51.180]  scientists that did this study are on the very cutting edge the listeners of the
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:56.180]  show are of saving humanity because this soft kill operation this war is
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:02:02.100]  raging around us Mike well and this is why it's so crucial that it for those
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:05.340]  listening if you want to save this republic if you want to beat the
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:09.580]  globalist you got to first stop the cancer tumors you got to first take care
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:14.540]  of your health I like to use the phrase nutrition for patriots you know a lot of
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:17.860]  the organics and this kind of thing started on in the progressive movement
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:21.820]  but really it's the patriots who should be eating all organic who should be
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:24.580]  eating the superfoods who should be taking the nutritional supplements
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:27.460]  because if you can't take care of your health you're not going to be able to
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:31.580]  take care of your republic it's a weapon system it's a military weapon system of
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:35.820]  the globalist you've got it stop letting him shoot you absolutely that that
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:41.620]  is it and this is so crucial you look it's also cognitive function if you
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:45.620]  don't have good nutrition your mind doesn't work right I mean it even studies
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:49.580]  just came out in the last couple of days about BPA altering hormones and
[02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:55.540]  and altering cognitive function all about his own all absolutely so you got to
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:59.780]  protect your brain you got to protect your fertility if you don't protect your
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:05.800]  DNA Alex you your lineage has no future and that's what the globalist want
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.540]  they don't really care if they kill you although they seem to be accelerating
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:14.740]  that but what they really want to do is kill off your entire line of offspring
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:19.340]  that's their goal that's that's where Bill Gates comes in and and his you know
[02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:23.940]  his money is funding these infertility technologies they zap your scrotum with
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:28.260]  ultrasound and you can't have babies for six months or 12 and they've got rice
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:32.340]  coming out the desert they've got it all and they've got mosquitoes that
[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:37.020]  deliver it and they admit you're absolutely right they want to destroy
[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:40.860]  our seed the globalists understand that's what that's what the real power is
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:46.020]  and they are openly saying they want to destroy our human essence to quote
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:49.740]  general ripper in Dr. Strangelove they make a joke out of it but they're
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:53.420]  telling you right there we are just I mean already the sperm counts down almost
[02:03:53.420 --> 02:04:00.580]  90% 87% the DNA is already damaged I mean these people have committed a sin of
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:05.260]  of a magnitude that's hard to imagine well and and look at what else attacks
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:10.300]  your DNA the TSA is naked body scanners the ionizing radiation the cell phones
[02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:16.180]  everything all of the radiation damages DNA and then the food damages DNA and
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:20.900]  then the pharmaceuticals damage DNA the DNA damage from pharmaceuticals is is
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.020]  just like the elite really are aliens from another planet come to destroy
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:28.300]  humanity I mean the elite we've got might as well be little demonic green
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:32.260]  men from Pluto hey remember the movie Prometheus what did they do they built a
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:35.500]  bio weapon they were gonna send that to earth to wipe out life in order to
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:40.420]  create new life that was their excuse hey I'm not saying that's real but it's
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:43.980]  a metaphor for what's real oh no that's why that film's total illuminati inside
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:47.140]  secrets and you notice the brother of the guy the guy involved making it just
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:51.580]  jumped off a bridge all right Mike Adams thank you so much for spending time

[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:14.260]  uh and now they're publishing all these you know
[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:20.020]  anti-mahamad things and the media is giving it attention to stir everyone
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:24.900]  up to stir everyone up ahead of a clash of
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:29.460]  civilizations we also have cnbc reporting dollar index headed for
[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:32.740]  rapid collapse over the next three to four weeks i'm not saying that's going
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:36.820]  to happen but more tungsten bars not just at the one of
[02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:40.900]  the federal reserves depots at fort nox but others are now being found to be
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:44.980]  fake with tungsten inside uh so just incredible
[02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:49.060]  situations on that front we're going to be going over the financial news
[02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:52.340]  in the shower but also talking about solutions
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:59.140]  and the awakening that is uh happening in this
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:04.020]  society now first off uh i want to just say that we're

[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:34.660]  crazy chinese general says prepare for combat
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:37.780]  top chinese general in unusual move tells troops to be ready
[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:41.940]  for combat with japan you notice this is all over the world
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:45.620]  everything's heating up you've got embassies being attacked worldwide you've
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:51.140]  got unrest in europe itself you've got news that george is preparing to attack
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:54.740]  south olsadia and abkhazia russian-controlled
[02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:58.180]  demilitarized zones the whole world's going haywire and
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:03.060]  general salente of trench journal dot com best-selling author researcher needs
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:06.340]  no introduction here he's been saying get ready for this and that's why i'm so
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:09.220]  concerned we've heard rumors of iran strikes before
[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:12.820]  now 25 well now it's 30 five more navies got involved
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:15.940]  our mind sweeping straight up for moose is a show of force
[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:21.460]  i guess ahead of an attack uh you've got uh all this other craziness going on
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:25.940]  economically alcada going crazy funded by nato overthrowing countries
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:31.300]  the whole world's going wild right now why is that happening and what do you see
[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:36.660]  coming next gerald salente hi alex you know you you really summed up
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:41.380]  everything uh quite concisely particularly talking
[02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:47.380]  about what homeland security is doing this should be headline news
[02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:52.180]  what are they doing i mean are that many alcaters out there that are going to be
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:58.260]  trying to slip through uh airport security that they have to gun them down
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:02.260]  the entire global system as you just wrapped it up
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:08.660]  is in freefall and as you pointed out what's going on in france
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:15.060]  with the with this this two-bit magazine printing this
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:18.980]  information these these cartoons about mohammed
[02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:26.420]  it's it is it is as if they are doing it to continue
[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:34.900]  to inflame an already inflamed situation so that they can then say
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:40.100]  this is a state of emergency the nations at war
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:44.740]  the president of the united states has declared a national emergency
[02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:49.300]  the banks are closed wall street is closed down
[02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:53.620]  there it is as if they are doing this purposely
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:59.060]  because having this this go on now after what just happened in libya
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:04.020]  you could only question what their motives are because these are not
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:07.940]  sane people making this statement and don't give me the line
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:12.180]  about little girls and boys freedom of speech
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:15.300]  hey did you see that freedom of speech over there
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:21.140]  on occupy wall street oh did you see that freedom of speech over there
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:25.700]  at the democratic and republican conventions so this isn't about freedom
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:30.740]  of speech this to me is intended to continue to
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:35.060]  inflame the hatred going on throughout the middle east
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:39.460]  and as it blows up and explodes homeland security
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:44.020]  is armed and locked and ready to blow your brains out
[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:48.580]  if you start protesting martial law
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:53.780]  well gerald you just said it and you point out that
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:57.380]  well let's look at what happened to the dnc they were arresting peaceful
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:01.060]  protesters to set the precedent who had driven there
[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:05.620]  with no criminal records and with from in jail and the department defense
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:10.820]  who's now in charge totally illegal went to the acle reported on this not just
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:14.020]  me went to the judge and said keep these people in jail
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:18.100]  they were planning to protest and that's terrorism they called it low-level
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:21.780]  terrorism so the military is now arresting people
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:25.940]  and saying keep them in jail because protesting is illegal we say it's
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:30.100]  terrorism when it's not illegal same thing at the rnc
[02:15:30.100 --> 02:15:33.540]  everywhere we're seeing free speech shut down and then
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:36.660]  yeah there's free speech to be able to do this about mohammed
[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:40.180]  but the media is hyping it and giving it attention
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:44.980]  i've got stories on the biggest website in the world drudgereport.com
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:48.820]  that can't even get it to break in the news instead the media comes out and
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:52.180]  says alex says and drudge say there's 174 000
[02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:55.300]  bullets what's the big deal when it's now 1.6 billion
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:58.340]  so they did respond but only to cover it up
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:02.580]  so exactly they are hyping this and now it turns out in egypt
[02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:07.620]  groups are funding radical young kids to go out and do this it's even it
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:11.860]  it's financed so they can point at the Arabs and say let's invade
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:16.660]  it's it's just incredible gerald yeah it is here this is somehow that's the
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:20.500]  Israeli newspaper france to close embassies in 20
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:24.980]  countries in wake of prophet mohammed cartoons
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:28.020]  french government said wednesday that had planned to
[02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:33.380]  shutting down premises including embassies and schools in 20 countries
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:38.260]  on friday after a magazine ridiculed the prophet mohammed
[02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:44.820]  by portraying him in naked cartoons right police would deploy to protect the
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:50.180]  paris officers as a satirical weekly charlie
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:56.900]  hebdo i mean come on who the hell is charlie hebdo
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:17:03.780]  what makes this such a great freedom of speech movement this is a lot of bs
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:07.460]  well notice south park won't make fun of of of mohammed any of this
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:10.980]  well now they're going to use the u n as a way globally to shut down our free
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:14.420]  speech using this they're actually calling for a global
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:17.940]  ban on people's speech i mean this is incredible gerald
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:22.580]  it is and again let's keep playing it back and seeing what happened
[02:17:22.580 --> 02:17:28.260]  in the last week or so because tracking trends is an understanding
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:33.300]  of where we are how we got here and where we're going
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:40.420]  so let's look at how we got here look what the news is this week
[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:45.140]  the united states declared that they're no longer going to train those afghan
[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:49.620]  soldiers that are blowing the brains out of american soldiers who are training
[02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:51.940]  them this is after they came out with this
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:55.860]  whole big bunch of malarkey that they were going to have guardian angel
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:18:00.020]  soldiers watching over them the whole system is failing
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:04.260]  look what happened last week over in in libya and i have to tell you this is
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:07.700]  really upsetting to me for a number of reasons
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:11.860]  number one they're calling the people that did it extremist militants i don't
[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:17.300]  know who killed the ambassador who or who waged the attack on the us embassy
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:21.860]  in ben gazi but by any stretch of anyone's imagination
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:26.100]  could people that did it been loyalists of qaddafi
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:30.340]  that don't want the government that's ruling there now
[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:34.420]  and that are attacking americans are having overthrown their government
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:41.380]  suppose let us suppose that the brick nations decided you know brazil
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:47.060]  russia india china decided they were going to launch an invasion
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:52.500]  against the united states of america for the tyrants that are ruling this
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:56.340]  country over here you know the tyrants that have taken
[02:18:56.340 --> 02:19:00.820]  away the people's constitutional rights the tyrants that have taken the
[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:05.460]  people's money to enrich the rich the tyrants that
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:12.740]  lied their people to war and had their men and women killed for fake reasons
[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:17.780]  for a situation that was totally manufactured and people said it was as
[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:20.900]  it was happening suppose that happened and the brick
[02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:24.500]  nations invaded united states and there were people here
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:29.540]  that didn't like that would they be militants would they be extremists
[02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:34.340]  trying to throw out the occupiers or the new governments that they imposed
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:39.140]  the united states is a country that's running out of control
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:48.020]  and i'm also offended deeply by this show of the president and the secretary of
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:55.620]  state showing up to honor the ambassador of libya
[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:59.940]  death when they never show up when our soldiers are killed exactly stay there
[02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:05.620]  hold your right back

[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:19.620]  crossroads moments we're approaching one of those moments
[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:25.140]  when more happens in a year than happened in the previous 50 to 100
[02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:28.900]  and the banks that run our country are willing to use it to do anything to
[02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:31.860]  take over while oppressing us domestically they're just
[02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:34.580]  throwing the whole bill of rights and constitution out the window
[02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:38.900]  engaging in every crime you can imagine federal judges said you can secretly
[02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:42.180]  disappear americans forever so at that point
[02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:45.700]  we have a government saying we're lawless we're evil
[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:51.700]  um you got corezine who was able to steal 1.6 billion dollars got caught
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:56.020]  lying the former head of goldman sacks and didn't get in trouble
[02:24:56.020 --> 02:25:00.980]  he was told some of Gerald Salente's money that was in his own private account
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:04.980]  um they're now announcing banks can deal narcotics they're announcing the us
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:08.660]  troops grow the opium because we have a zombie population
[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:12.420]  living in a trance the criminal elite have gotten away with things that are
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:15.460]  just staggering people ask why we're still alive
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:18.900]  a lot of experts think the controllers don't even care they think the public
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:21.860]  so zombie well they're giving you gmo they
[02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:26.100]  know it's killing the rats i mean we're living in the matrix
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:29.780]  gerald i'm ranting here um you got cut off as
[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:34.580]  by the break making the eloquent point about you know like bush band coffin
[02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:37.940]  photos now they don't even talk about the dead troops that's all forgotten
[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:41.540]  the troops getting blown up every day in afghanistan that's forgotten al qaeda
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:45.140]  publicly working for nato that's forgotten i mean we've really reached
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:48.420]  something that if i read an absurdist science fiction novel
[02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:51.540]  20 years ago kurt vonnegut wrote stuff like what's happening
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:56.420]  but but it's beyond kurt vonnegut dark satire i mean it's reached total insanity
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:59.540]  level yeah and it's beyond orwell
[02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:04.100]  or i mean orwell could have never invented this i mean big brother he
[02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:08.500]  was never this big and as i was mentioning about libya
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:12.180]  you know how terrible it was that this ambassador got killed
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:16.020]  but our troops they don't even call dead americans anymore
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:19.220]  as you pointed out you're not allowed to show photos
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:22.420]  of of the coffins of american troops on the bush
[02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:27.860]  i don't know if that's been changed since but the the other offensive fact of
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:31.460]  the matter is is that they don't even call them dead americans
[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:34.420]  anymore you know who they are they're nato troops
[02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:38.180]  they're nato troops that's right pick up the toilet paper
[02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:41.220]  record the new york times pick up any one of them
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:44.580]  they're dead nato troops they're not us troops
[02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:48.100]  and you know what they're right they're not us troops
[02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:53.780]  they are nato troops they are it's a takeover the world banking system is
[02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:57.380]  taken over the united states it's happened in the in the
[02:26:57.380 --> 02:27:01.860]  over there in europe you know the deal mario dragy
[02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:06.740]  the former vice chairman of the goldman sacks gang now the head of the
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:10.580]  european central bank has announced that they're going to buy up all that
[02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:14.660]  worthless sovereign debt of italy and spain and portugal
[02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:18.980]  and the other bankrupt countries they also announced that they're taking out
[02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:22.100]  all the power from the sovereign banks as i've mentioned before
[02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:26.420]  and concentrating it in brussels same thing over here
[02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:30.340]  and again it's failure on top of failure
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:33.940]  and i'm keep i keep trying to figure out why this keeps happening
[02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:38.180]  and why no one does anything about it and this is the latest analysis that i
[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:41.780]  could come up with you know how i keep saying that
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:45.220]  the same people in high school and college that you hated
[02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:48.980]  are now our class president that were class presidents
[02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:52.740]  and head of the student council have followed their career path
[02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:57.940]  and are now telling us what to do well when you look back and by the way it's
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:02.020]  the same thing with these generals they were the boy scouts then they were the
[02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:05.140]  eagle scouts and then you know then they went to
[02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:09.540]  rotc and then they went to west pointer in apless
[02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:15.140]  they never grew up most of them were born on easy street
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:19.940]  they had their path paved for them they never had like a kid
[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:24.900]  when you're a kid in high school you know you do crazy things and you never
[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:30.580]  think about the consequences these people are still in high school
[02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:34.260]  they haven't grown up they've only gotten older
[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:37.220]  and they don't look at their consequences
[02:28:37.220 --> 02:28:40.740]  because if anybody looked at the consequences
[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:47.540]  of what these high school and and rotc jerks have brought us to
[02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:51.460]  they would never tolerate it that's all this is
[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:57.700]  it's high school usa and people don't want to call it what it is
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:02.500]  bravo to that absolute veritas and and you know gerald
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:05.620]  the reason i say you're so right is studying these people and other past
[02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:08.260]  elites drinking their own kool-aid smoking their own
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:10.820]  dope we've now reached the point we're going to break

[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:19.140]  technicals and and your solutions but every bad thing they do
[02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:23.060]  they control the media so they've learned they can just spin it
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:26.900]  as if it's not their fault and they're going to save us and so
[02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:32.420]  the sky's the limit but we're dealing in a world with nuclear and bio weapons
[02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:36.020]  and you really study these guys they are a bunch of crazy people
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:39.220]  uh who are who are in control but but deep down
[02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:42.980]  are mentally ill and so they probably will destroy everything if they're not

[02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:56.500]  or infowarsnews.com you know being a history buff because i just happened
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:00.100]  to stumble into it as a really nine ten years old
[02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:04.340]  i liked history shows on pbs i liked reading the history books that were
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:07.780]  laying around the house the history books that had photos
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:10.900]  on them one of the reasons i wanted to become a good reader was because it all
[02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:14.660]  looked so interesting all those time life world war two world war one
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:18.660]  time life the westerns you know the west uh i just
[02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:22.420]  voraciously ate it up and one big theme in history is
[02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:25.620]  every different generation faces a different crisis
[02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:28.900]  and we're getting ready to face a really big one even bigger than the world
[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:32.980]  war two generation and people always look back
[02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:36.420]  and say how did they not know what hitler would do or how did they not know
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:40.660]  what linen and Stalin would do well people tend to get comfortable they
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:43.540]  don't want to be leaders they don't want to get involved
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:46.740]  and they just want to think everything's going to work out okay
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:51.140]  and a lot of times prosperity also makes people very very lackadaisical
[02:34:51.140 --> 02:34:56.500]  they wear it like it's a protective cloak when really it brings the wolves
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:35:00.900]  and now through a historical lens but also what's happening currently
[02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:05.140]  if the general public could consciously know what i know or what gerald knows
[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:08.180]  which isn't anything special it's just history
[02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:11.540]  in a current context you would be absolutely
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:15.460]  freaking out you know it's like my children sometimes
[02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:19.140]  they'll be scared to go down the hallway and get themselves a glass of water
[02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:22.180]  sometimes they come in at like midnight hey dad uh uh
[02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:24.740]  i want a glass of water but i don't want to go in the kitchen they're like get
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:27.300]  up and get it for me you know the five the six-year-old
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:30.500]  doing that and i'm like wow but they're not scared
[02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:35.460]  at a shopping mall or in a parking lot where they could be run over
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:37.940]  they're not scared when we're driving down the highway
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:42.260]  70 miles an hour on a one lane with cars six inches from us
[02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:46.100]  that that if we had a head on collision it'd be 140 mile an hour collision
[02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:50.980]  the 70 plus set me dead everybody's dead they're just singing laughing
[02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:54.980]  they have no idea and that's the analogy the general public's in the car
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:58.420]  they have no idea we're not going about 400 miles an hour
[02:35:58.420 --> 02:36:02.180]  there's cars all around us in the lane we're in and there's cars
[02:36:02.180 --> 02:36:05.620]  in the other lane the nuclear weapons are placed the
[02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:08.580]  the countries are lining up the currencies are melting down the
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:13.140]  government's arm into the teeth against us the government's far and run
[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:17.540]  and the general public is scared of the dark they're scared of made-up al-qaeda
[02:36:17.540 --> 02:36:21.140]  that's globalist run they're scared of things that don't really exist
[02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:23.940]  that you know they think tsa sticking their hands down their pants will keep
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:27.460]  them safe meanwhile we're all in grave danger i'm
[02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:31.780]  i'm ranting here gerald but what do you take from my analogy can you expand on
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:34.980]  it i know you've got a lot on your plate that you're looking at right now what
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:38.260]  else would you like to break down for the audience
[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:41.780]  as you wanted to break you were talking about the the media the
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:46.180]  prostitutes and i was talking about how this is high school usa
[02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:50.740]  the media the same kids that you know in high school in college that
[02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:54.660]  you know ran the school newspaper and they sucked up to the principal now
[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:58.340]  they suck up to the president the congressmen the senators
[02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:02.500]  and whoever else read the story in the toilet paper of record a couple of
[02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:08.100]  months ago about how every phrase every statement
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:13.780]  every quote made by either the obama administration
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:19.780]  or the romney challenger has to be cleared first before the prostitutes
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:24.900]  print it i'm not making that up it's theirs you could go total
[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:28.020]  total lap dogs i mean our president ever been
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:30.980]  perfect but in the old days they were there aggressive
[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:34.180]  it would be a huge story if anything was pre-approved
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:38.260]  now it's all pre-approved and that supposedly is the new normal
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:43.460]  exactly you know why because it's fascism the mergers state and corporate
[02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:47.300]  powers it's a takeover i said this years ago
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:52.740]  people call obama fascist excuse me a communist the marxist no
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:56.820]  let's get this straight all our dough went into the banks
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:38:00.740]  they're doing it again with qe3 and and the analogy
[02:38:00.740 --> 02:38:04.180]  again when staying on the high school thing in high school you know these
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:07.860]  people had their own little clique they still have it they just
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:12.180]  moved it up and there were the people that didn't bother with them didn't like
[02:38:12.180 --> 02:38:15.940]  them it didn't hang out with them and now they're telling you what to do
[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:18.660]  and the people are now doing what they're telling them
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:23.300]  to do they're telling that they these these these high school
[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:27.540]  class presidents they're telling you what's best for you
[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:31.860]  and the people believe them these high school class presidents
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:35.220]  people now bow to them they they're they're they're they're
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:40.740]  political gods so where is it all going the same thing you take it into the
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:43.860]  economy look at the guy who's running who's playing
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:49.060]  the role of the uh the economics minister of the united states
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:52.820]  fed ben Bernanke the head of federal as i call public
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:56.100]  enemy number one osama ben Bernanke the head of the
[02:38:56.100 --> 02:38:59.940]  the federal reserve they're coming out with qe3
[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:04.980]  i'm going to read you a quote alex this is from the trends journal
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:12.900]  this is the one from uh let me see here the summer of 2011
[02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:16.900]  feds massive stimulus had little that impact
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:21.780]  alan greenspan the federal reserves massive stimulus program had little
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:27.780]  impact on the u.s economy besides weakening the dollar
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:31.940]  and somewhat helping us exports fed reserve
[02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:39.060]  governor alan greenspan told c nbc this isn't a left-wing
[02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:45.220]  you know group this isn't a radical this is greenspan who helped destroy the
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:49.700]  economy by lowering interest rates to 46 year lows
[02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:54.340]  following 9 11 to bail out the losers on wall street
[02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:58.580]  that made bed bets following the dot-com crash
[02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:03.460]  and a blunt critique of his successor federal chairman ben Bernanke
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:06.980]  greenspan said the two trillion in quantitative easing
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:11.940]  over the past two years had done little to loosen credit and boost the economy
[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:15.700]  of course it's not two trillion as we found out later
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:21.220]  it was more like 23 trillion of fed money that was pumped in around the world
[02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:27.060]  not making that number up it's a fact quote
[02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:33.460]  go on uh greenspan said quote he would be surprised
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:38.660]  if there was a qe3 well of course he would be surprised
[02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:43.940]  greenspan would be surprised if he could put one foot in front of another
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:49.540]  and walk and chew gum at the same time oh man of course he's wrong again
[02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:54.820]  it would quote continue erosion of the dollar
[02:40:54.820 --> 02:40:59.140]  exactly well that's like guiding us into poverty
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:02.100]  well that's like geithner saying a year and a half ago in china
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:06.180]  we will not devalue the dollar and we will not lose our triple a rating
[02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:10.980]  it's now down to a minus gerald and going lower
[02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:13.940]  because they're not going to get off this physical cliff
[02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:18.500]  because there are a bunch of losers they're the same jerks in high school
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:22.340]  in college that you couldn't stand telling you what to do
[02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:25.300]  they couldn't even hold they couldn't even hold bag dad
[02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:28.900]  how do they think their 1.6 billion bullets
[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:32.660]  are going to be pumped into our skulls and and they haven't got their robots
[02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:36.020]  going yet who's going to serve them and produce for them
[02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:41.620]  if they pump all those bullets into us alex they're wrong on everything
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:44.660]  there's nothing that they've been right on they were wrong about
[02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:50.260]  afghanistan they were wrong about iraq they're wrong about the economy
[02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:54.820]  they're wrong on education they're wrong on healthcare
[02:41:54.820 --> 02:42:00.740]  they're the again i cannot emphasize this enough they're the same people you
[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:06.340]  hated in high school in college that are now telling us what's best for us
[02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:10.260]  and they're the elites they're the fifth generations
[02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:13.940]  of old elites that were at least smart enough to take over and had some smarts
[02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:17.620]  but were still criminal these are now foppish sycophantic
[02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:22.020]  yes man dancing around on the titanic that they drove into the iceberg so they
[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:25.220]  could loot it not understanding they don't have lifeboats
[02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:28.740]  and there's going to clutch their nuclear weapons and their troops in black
[02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:32.260]  masks they think will scare everyone into worshiping them and
[02:42:32.260 --> 02:42:37.620]  maybe that will happen it may but again this is from the summer
[02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:44.100]  2011 greenspan saying there won't be a qe3
[02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:48.980]  of course he was wrong and he said if there was it won't work
[02:42:48.980 --> 02:42:53.540]  this is on cnbc i know everybody knows it's not going to work
[02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:56.980]  you know it's working for it's working for the
[02:42:56.980 --> 02:43:00.820]  too big to fails it's working for the hedge funds
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:04.180]  that have taken over the go wait a minute i always said they were going to do
[02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:07.380]  it and and so did you and so did porter standsbury and
[02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:11.060]  many others they were just lying saying don't worry
[02:43:11.060 --> 02:43:14.820]  it won't be qe3 it'll be qe unlimited it's like
[02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:17.620]  you know we're not just going to chop one of your fingers off we're going to
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:20.340]  chop your arms your legs off and slit your throat
[02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:23.860]  so we promise not to cut your finger off we're just going to put you in a wood
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:27.940]  chipper and here's the and here's the fallout
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:33.460]  this is what you're seeing coming out in the news on bloomberg today
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:38.100]  gold may gain in new york after reaching six months high on speculation now
[02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:42.100]  this is important central banks move to bolster
[02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:45.620]  growth will spur demand for the medal as a protection
[02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:50.740]  of wealth the bank of japan said it will add
[02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:57.300]  10 trillion yen to the yen funded that buys assets including government debt
[02:43:57.300 --> 02:44:00.420]  the federal reserve announced on september 13th
[02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:04.820]  a third round of quantitative easing european central bank
[02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:08.340]  president mario dragy the goldman sacks flak
[02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:12.100]  gave details this month to plan to buy worthless debt
[02:44:12.100 --> 02:44:18.820]  from member states and china has approved massive infrastructure spending
[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:23.780]  plans you get it the whole thing is collapsing
[02:44:23.780 --> 02:44:27.220]  they're dumping more and more dough into this
[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:30.980]  to try to keep it afloat they're not going to be
[02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:35.620]  able to so let's go back and replay the timeline
[02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:40.180]  i've repeated this over and over again and you can see it happening now
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:43.700]  the crash of 1929 the great depression currency wars
[02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:48.980]  trade wars world war the panic of our way to great recessions last depression
[02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:53.140]  oh great recession by the way a new study came out today
[02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:58.340]  yeah that's right the american people have seen their wealth decline
[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:02.260]  oh a couple hundred oh and from it's down from 39
[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:07.140]  percent the loss of wealth of 31 percent loss since the great recession began
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:11.060]  8.6 percent in median household income lost
[02:45:11.060 --> 02:45:15.460]  since the great recession that's with coke numbers and yeah it's much worse than
[02:45:15.460 --> 02:45:18.100]  that but then we take on now we're gonna keep
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:22.740]  playing it so we have the great recession now we're having the currency wars
[02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:27.060]  have you heard mittens romney and obama bashing china now now they're all
[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:30.900]  talking tough on china gotta gotta bring down the
[02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:34.980]  and as you mentioned geithner we gotta bring down the level that you want it's
[02:45:34.980 --> 02:45:39.940]  making it unprofitable for american corporations to export their product
[02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:44.740]  and now the trade wars did you see obama in ohio
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:48.500]  sleeves rolled up man the cat is never working
[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:53.540]  he's always out on the campaign trail or of course playing basketball shooting
[02:45:53.540 --> 02:45:57.060]  pool or maybe playing golf or walking the dog
[02:45:57.060 --> 02:46:03.220]  anyway he said we gotta stop them chinese they're doing unfair trade
[02:46:03.220 --> 02:46:07.780]  the trade wars the heating up and now the hot war is heating up
[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:11.540]  because you saw what the united states and nato are doing
[02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:15.780]  to keep building positions in the south pacific so now what's happening
[02:46:15.780 --> 02:46:23.140]  oh now china and japan are going at it what a surprise would have never known
[02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:27.700]  particularly since hitlery and panetta are all going over there
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:31.540]  and bolstering our own they've told the japanese to take those islands as a
[02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:35.780]  provocation as us forces match it looks like they're gearing up for a
[02:46:35.780 --> 02:46:39.700]  possible world war three you got it and that's what i've been
[02:46:39.700 --> 02:46:43.700]  saying the first great war of the 21st century has begun
[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:47.220]  what are they waiting for and then if you criticize our
[02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:51.220]  then if we criticize our great leaders when the war is going and maybe nukes are
[02:46:51.220 --> 02:46:53.700]  going off they'll just send the army over to arrest
[02:46:53.700 --> 02:46:57.620]  salante and jones and guess what the army manual is public they're
[02:46:57.620 --> 02:47:01.620]  planning just that and you'll and and we don't have any
[02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:05.860]  jury we don't even have any charges no trial
[02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:11.700]  no ridahevious corpus no lawyer no nothing and you know why
[02:47:11.700 --> 02:47:16.260]  because the psychopaths are in charge that's right
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:21.860]  and everyone is listening to them it is a disgrace what has happened to this
[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:25.860]  country it is a disgrace that people don't stand up
[02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:29.540]  and take action and start denouncing these people
[02:47:29.540 --> 02:47:35.300]  for robbing us of our constitutional rights i get a kick out of these guys
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:38.900]  hello he's talking about our founding fathers
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:44.180]  and i don't want a great country this is as they keep raping us of every last
[02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:47.700]  bit of rights that we have they're bankrupting us
[02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:52.340]  they're robbing everybody's savings by keeping these interest rates
[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:56.660]  at at historic lows and now announcing that they're going to go
[02:47:56.660 --> 02:48:02.180]  through wait to be on to 2015 there's no savings
[02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:06.420]  anymore in this country and they're forcing you to play their game
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:09.460]  in the stock market to equity money let me go to another level they have
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:12.500]  something called the comprehensive annual financial report that the mafia
[02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:15.060]  set up in chicago in the 30s and 40s the
[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:18.420]  chicago 1313 model was adopted by the 50s
[02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:22.340]  by the pentagon now all governments water districts school districts
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:25.940]  they have the budget they tell you about then they have this whole other
[02:48:25.940 --> 02:48:28.580]  budget that's usually about 70 plus percent of the money
[02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:31.860]  that they invest in derivatives and things most that's now been stolen by
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:36.180]  the banks but toll roads we pay for these
[02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:38.900]  roads i've looked at the documents just where i live
[02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:42.340]  they never build them then they give the money to a private company
[02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:46.420]  to build a new toll road and now they're just striping existing roads like
[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:50.260]  mopac here in austin to turn it into a toll road even though that's illegal
[02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:53.860]  and we've learned that it's offshore banks running the toll roads that are
[02:48:53.860 --> 02:48:56.980]  now running the elections and have taken over almost all the
[02:48:56.980 --> 02:48:59.940]  towns in texas where i live it's the same nationwide
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:03.540]  and when you go it's like a military operation now
[02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:07.220]  where they've all got handbooks to manipulate people that's all public
[02:49:07.220 --> 02:49:11.460]  guys when you turn your camera off flash cia badges and get in our face

[02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:15.060]  where you think all this is going and any solutions to what we face
[02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:19.060]  well on the solutions then you know why aren't people doing more
[02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:23.220]  i mentioned you know this about being high school and and and the same people
[02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:27.380]  you couldn't stand and the people they they haven't grown up either in a lot
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:31.620]  of ways they still they're still programmed to follow orders whether
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:34.100]  they get it from their parents and their little kids
[02:55:34.100 --> 02:55:36.740]  then they're told what to do when they go to school
[02:55:36.740 --> 02:55:40.260]  and then they go into the corporate field and they're told what to do
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:44.900]  and then they have this you know the the whole magic show of the red carpets and
[02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:48.260]  the you know the the the roped off president and the
[02:55:48.260 --> 02:55:52.100]  authorities so they're still obeying authority
[02:55:52.100 --> 02:55:54.980]  and they haven't broken i mean i hear people my age
[02:55:54.980 --> 02:55:58.260]  still you know bitching and moaning about their parents you know
[02:55:58.260 --> 02:56:01.620]  they didn't have the perfect parents they haven't grown up yet
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:05.940]  and the people better start doing it because until they do nothing is going
[02:56:05.940 --> 02:56:09.300]  to change it's up to the people to bring this change
[02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:14.500]  and where is it all going economically again how could anybody believe
[02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:19.380]  wrong again ben Bernanke i read you the quote from green span saying it wouldn't
[02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:23.540]  work i want to show you how wrong he is he was
[02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:27.460]  is and continue to will be will be because again
[02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:31.780]  it's just another guy that's been born on easy street
[02:56:31.780 --> 02:56:35.940]  and he went to princeton and now he's still on easy street
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:41.540]  they never respond they're they're never on the bread line or the front lines
[02:56:41.540 --> 02:56:46.740]  all they do is tell you what to do and here's from professor ben
[02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:50.100]  the guy that never worked a day in his life
[02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:54.340]  and has been telling people what to do for most of his life
[02:56:54.340 --> 02:57:02.260]  from the trends journal autumn 2010 ben Bernanke on cnbc
[02:57:02.260 --> 02:57:08.340]  July 29th 2005 tell me what is the worst case scenario
[02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:12.980]  if we in fact see real estate prices actually come down
[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:17.700]  substantially across the country here goes wrong again ben
[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:21.860]  you jerk you didn't know then you don't know now's answer
[02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:29.300]  well i guess i don't buy your premise it's pretty unlikely possibility
[02:57:29.300 --> 02:57:32.260]  we have never had a decline in house prices
[02:57:32.260 --> 02:57:37.940]  on a nationwide basis any guy says something like that
[02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:43.780]  and is still running the show you'd say who's keeping this more on in prices
[02:57:43.780 --> 02:57:46.100]  have gone down many times nationwide over history
[02:57:46.100 --> 02:57:50.980]  he's completely full of baloney i know let me keep going on here because it
[02:57:50.980 --> 02:57:57.380]  gets better this is on february 28th 2007
[02:57:57.380 --> 02:58:00.820]  things are really starting to go downhill quote
[02:58:00.820 --> 02:58:05.540]  there's not much indication at this point that subprime mortgage issues
[02:58:05.540 --> 02:58:08.660]  have spread into the broader mortgage market
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:12.900]  which still seems to be healthy yes still seems to be healthy
[02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:16.820]  to a jerk that doesn't know anything doesn't know his history
[02:58:16.820 --> 02:58:21.460]  but still there and doing more damage and these are the people
[02:58:21.460 --> 02:58:27.780]  that the prostitutes bow to that they suck up to because the prostitutes are
[02:58:27.780 --> 02:58:31.620]  the same people that read the school newspapers general don't put bookends
[02:58:31.620 --> 02:58:34.500]  on this i know you got to go but one minute break come back for one more

[03:00:32.740 --> 03:00:36.340]  gerald i mean it's gotta give somewhere you think there's people in the power
[03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:40.660]  structure who aren't completely insane and really want stability i mean don't
[03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:43.780]  they know how it goes for people and they try to take over the whole world
[03:00:43.780 --> 03:00:47.140]  every time i mean these delusions of grandeur
[03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:50.420]  are gonna have a soul growing glowing in the dark basically
[03:00:50.420 --> 03:00:54.660]  any ways to stop these people i mean i do see people either getting deeper into
[03:00:54.660 --> 03:00:59.300]  being dumbed down or i see an accelerated awakening happening
[03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:03.060]  so the wheat from the chaff is being divided here
[03:01:03.060 --> 03:01:06.820]  there is an accelerated awakening we get we see it every day we get
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:10.340]  emails come flooding in all the time thanking us for waking them up and
[03:01:10.340 --> 03:01:14.340]  and for me being on your show and for what you are doing as well a lot of
[03:01:14.340 --> 03:01:17.940]  people are waking up and that's the words that they use they're waking up
[03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:21.540]  yeah i believe it can change unless you think the guys in high school and
[03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:25.060]  college were better than you are and unless
[03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:28.260]  they think i want to make this really clear
[03:01:28.260 --> 03:01:32.180]  their mother is not better than mine i want to make that clear
[03:01:32.180 --> 03:01:36.340]  and anybody out there that thinks that their mother is better than yours
[03:01:36.340 --> 03:01:40.180]  then that's what you are facing but if you have the self respect
[03:01:40.180 --> 03:01:44.740]  to where you came from and who you are we could change this on a dime
[03:01:44.740 --> 03:01:48.180]  it doesn't have to go like this no you're right we've got to find our self
[03:01:48.180 --> 03:01:52.020]  respect and quit putting up with people that don't respect us
[03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:56.740]  you got it respect yourself demand respect from others
[03:01:56.740 --> 03:02:03.460]  and show it to everyone who deserves it regardless of class or structure
[03:02:03.460 --> 03:02:07.140]  or where they come from position and to have dignity
[03:02:07.140 --> 03:02:10.900]  and to have courage not to cower the power
[03:02:10.900 --> 03:02:15.060]  those are the things in passion and integrity to live by your word
[03:02:15.060 --> 03:02:19.140]  and do what your heart feels what your mind knows
[03:02:19.140 --> 03:02:22.180]  then it'll change are there people in power
[03:02:22.180 --> 03:02:25.700]  that are going to make the difference let me quote
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:33.540]  eisenhower he said that anyone that seeks the position
[03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:43.940]  is either an egomaniac or crazy how long has romney been seeking the position
[03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:49.140]  look at obama the cat's never on the job man
[03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:54.260]  he's out there playing eight he was on letterman isn't that wonderful
[03:02:54.260 --> 03:02:59.940]  can you imagine eisenhower sitting down with a little jerk like letterman
[03:02:59.940 --> 03:03:05.380]  a leto or stuart a cold bear what a disgrace
[03:03:05.380 --> 03:03:12.740]  what a disgrace no there's no one up there that has the dignity
[03:03:12.740 --> 03:03:18.900]  the courage the respect or integrity to lead this country
[03:03:18.900 --> 03:03:24.420]  not when they behave like a bunch of carfoners
[03:03:24.420 --> 03:03:28.580]  gerald salante transjournal dot com i'm alex jones themfo wars dot com take us
[03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:31.060]  out we got a minute and a half gerald you take us out
[03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:35.460]  all right gold you know i've said it all along
[03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:41.220]  when gold broke over 1670 an ounce i said if it stays over there the next
[03:03:41.220 --> 03:03:46.500]  number to look at is 1770 an ounce it's been saying above that
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:51.460]  my forecast is that if gold stays above 1770 an ounce
[03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:56.820]  it's off to the races and i'm you know when you saw soros jump back in and
[03:03:56.820 --> 03:04:00.340]  others into the gold market and you see this cheap money they're
[03:04:00.340 --> 03:04:05.220]  dumping in gold and silver to me not telling anybody what to do
[03:04:05.220 --> 03:04:10.340]  that's my forecast the big other one and this is the one that we all have to
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:14.420]  stop from happening is that i am very concerned
[03:04:14.420 --> 03:04:19.700]  that they had lines on election day just leading up to it or not going to be
[03:04:19.700 --> 03:04:24.820]  about jobs in the economy but about war because if they take us to war
[03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:29.620]  all the morons will pull out those yellow ribbons and stick flags on their car
[03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:33.620]  and and and cheer as they take us to another war
[03:04:33.620 --> 03:04:37.860]  because i believe there's going to be either a real or a false flag attack
[03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:41.380]  the way things are going well said there's gerald solente
[03:04:41.380 --> 03:04:45.380]  taking a sound they'll be back with us again tomorrow to kick off the show
