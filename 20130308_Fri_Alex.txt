[00:00.000 --> 00:11.100]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.100 --> 00:18.640]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin
[00:18.640 --> 00:31.040]  texas alex jones and happy friday alex jones show kathleen albrecht filling in
[00:31.040 --> 00:36.460]  for alex my last day here with you guys but it would a delight to be part of the
[00:36.460 --> 00:41.520]  alex jones freedom empire making its way across the globe here i've been
[00:41.520 --> 00:44.920]  hearing from people in new zealand i've been hearing from people across europe
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.240]  i've been hearing from people in south america amazing how this freedom message
[00:49.240 --> 00:52.640]  we we we here in the u.s. think that we're kind of the epicenter of freedom
[00:52.640 --> 00:55.920]  and i think a lot of ways we are especially if you're in place like
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.920]  north korea probably looking out at the shining beacon of the u.s.
[00:59.920 --> 01:03.560]  but people are waking up to this message all over the globe in in large
[01:03.560 --> 01:06.400]  measure because of programs like this one
[01:06.400 --> 01:10.680]  in large measure because of uh... the internet which is enabling us to get
[01:10.680 --> 01:11.800]  this message out
[01:11.800 --> 01:15.080]  and you know i really think we have a brief window of time to do it too
[01:15.080 --> 01:19.040]  because you know that the globalists have their plan the government
[01:19.040 --> 01:22.840]  would very much like to shut all of this down you know no no more that
[01:22.840 --> 01:23.960]  conversing
[01:23.960 --> 01:27.680]  you know i have this book uh... on my floor to ceiling bookshelf of twenty
[01:27.680 --> 01:28.960]  century history
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.240]  and it is all about the laws that were enacted in the soviet union it's a
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.360]  really boring book you know just page after page of of legal
[01:37.360 --> 01:41.840]  uh... it's translated in english but it was it was a russian law book or a soviet
[01:41.840 --> 01:43.600]  law book in the cold war
[01:43.600 --> 01:45.600]  and in there do you know
[01:45.600 --> 01:49.600]  that the soviet actually required back in the day when they had many a graph
[01:49.600 --> 01:52.480]  machines and they were first coming out with photocopiers
[01:52.480 --> 01:57.040]  that you had to get a permit in order to make copies
[01:57.040 --> 01:58.880]  of just a piece of paper
[01:58.880 --> 02:03.360]  i'm looking at that going okay well that is uh... that's a serious top down
[02:03.360 --> 02:04.400]  control there
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.920]  because they didn't want in the same way that the british back in the days of the
[02:08.920 --> 02:12.200]  founding fathers of the u.s. they didn't want more than a couple of people
[02:12.200 --> 02:13.740]  gathering at a time
[02:13.740 --> 02:17.160]  that's why that that particular right is right there in the u.s. constitution in
[02:17.160 --> 02:18.200]  the bill of rights
[02:18.200 --> 02:20.040]  they want people getting together
[02:20.040 --> 02:22.680]  they don't want people disseminating information
[02:22.680 --> 02:26.120]  the because if they can control the information of course in the soviet
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.000]  union
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.480]  they control the newspapers they control the radio they control the
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.440]  television they were into your state control media and that was all there was
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.000]  and they didn't want people even making mimea graft copies anybody older old
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.400]  enough to remember in the sixties and seventies those drum roller machines with
[02:42.400 --> 02:44.720]  the purple ink that would be all fuzzy
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.680]  your teacher would would give you a handout and still be wet
[02:47.680 --> 02:50.480]  i could be like damp from the roller thing
[02:50.480 --> 02:53.080]  and they had a particular smell about them well
[02:53.080 --> 02:57.240]  you know in those days mature even for teachers to hand out worksheets to their
[02:57.240 --> 03:00.880]  students they had to get literally a permit from the government
[03:00.880 --> 03:04.320]  and i as i look at what's going on today i think my gosh
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.640]  it would be fun just to teleport stalling just ever so briefly into the
[03:08.640 --> 03:12.840]  modern era and just watches like smoke come out of his years and
[03:12.840 --> 03:15.640]  watching absolutely flip out because we've got
[03:15.640 --> 03:19.760]  yet the power beyond photo copies my goodness we've we've got the power to
[03:19.760 --> 03:24.000]  reach literally hundreds of millions of people and i'm so glad we're doing it
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.800]  all right well my name is kathryn albright if you're not familiar with my
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.320]  work i'm the rfid lady i've been working on the issue of uh... consumer
[03:31.320 --> 03:33.200]  privacy shopper privacy
[03:33.200 --> 03:38.320]  and so fighting against the encroachment of radio frequency i d devices
[03:38.320 --> 03:39.960]  whether it's in products
[03:39.960 --> 03:43.240]  or as we're gonna be talking about this hour in furniture
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.320]  haven't forbid
[03:44.320 --> 03:49.600]  or the worst case of all on human beings or even in human beings
[03:49.600 --> 03:52.240]  and we talked about that a little bit this hour as well
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.800]  the rfid microchip is merging with the cell phone is merging with the global
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.000]  brain is merging with the internet it's all coming together
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.240]  and it's not a mistake as i've said before on the show in my own program
[04:06.240 --> 04:08.560]  it's a web it is called a web
[04:08.560 --> 04:12.440]  because there's a spider sitting at the center of it it is called a net because
[04:12.440 --> 04:14.320]  there's somebody holding that
[04:14.320 --> 04:17.880]  and you may think that you're in charge of a lot of this technology and a lot
[04:17.880 --> 04:19.360]  a lot of ways we are
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.120]  but when it comes right down to it this net to this web
[04:23.120 --> 04:25.640]  is not only going to be a place through which we can communicate with one
[04:25.640 --> 04:29.520]  another but it's going to be a place through which this global thing
[04:29.520 --> 04:31.240]  is going to have its eyes and ears
[04:31.240 --> 04:34.840]  on all of us all right we'll be talking about that this hour also opening up
[04:34.840 --> 04:35.440]  for your
[04:35.440 --> 04:37.600]  phone calls a little bit later this hour
[04:37.600 --> 04:41.440]  microchip markets rfid technology that transmits
[04:41.440 --> 04:43.400]  via the human body
[04:43.400 --> 04:44.960]  yeah that and
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.360]  got a new wall street journal article out about how companies are tracking their employees
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.080]  all that and more when we come back
[04:51.080 --> 04:53.280]  kathryn albrecht filling in for alex jones

[06:08.320 --> 06:12.840]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[06:12.840 --> 06:16.080]  here in the united states and across the industrialized world are almost
[06:16.080 --> 06:21.200]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that

[08:22.400 --> 08:29.280]  we all know the tongue toys of cat and girls and pretty boys make up that face
[08:29.280 --> 08:42.800]  i'm in the rest
[08:44.160 --> 08:51.120]  this time in our town this team is a planarist
[08:51.120 --> 08:55.440]  it is our town it's our country it's our planet in case you haven't noticed that
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.760]  lately all you puns come out there yeah the globalist want to think it's their
[08:59.760 --> 09:05.840]  town but they are a tiny meansy minuscule little fraction of the mass of
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.160]  humanity that lives on this planet and it really is time for us to remind them
[09:10.160 --> 09:13.840]  of that especially because we've got a constitution that makes it very clear
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.720]  that these folks are our servants so i'm always pleased when i see that at least
[09:18.720 --> 09:21.120]  on the local level the local and the state level
[09:21.120 --> 09:24.560]  that the people who are getting elected kind of still get that you know it
[09:24.560 --> 09:28.720]  hasn't gone totally to their heads in the way that it has on the federal level
[09:28.720 --> 09:32.640]  and on my own radio program this is of course the alex jones show and i'm
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.880]  catherine alberg filling in for alex i do my own radio show for two hours
[09:36.880 --> 09:40.880]  monday through friday and on fridays i always kind of try to dispel
[09:40.880 --> 09:44.640]  a little bit of the darkness that we've been looking at all week long
[09:44.640 --> 09:48.000]  and i do a little thing called good news friday
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.640]  well i want to give you just a couple of the good news stories is a little
[09:50.640 --> 09:53.680]  preview of what i'm going to be talking about on my show and i want to share
[09:53.680 --> 09:57.920]  some of the positive stories that are coming out it's always good news
[09:57.920 --> 10:00.640]  when when we have something positive going on
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.440]  well let me tell you the state of ohio is considering a ban against traffic
[10:05.440 --> 10:09.120]  cameras would not be a good thing you know the idea that that the state has
[10:09.120 --> 10:12.240]  its eyes on all of our cars is really disturbing
[10:12.240 --> 10:15.600]  we know that not only can the traffic cameras now zoom in and see your face
[10:15.600 --> 10:20.320]  or determine whether you're you know grimacing or or scowling or smiling as
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.800]  you sit there at the red light they're also able now to do automatic
[10:24.800 --> 10:27.760]  license plate recognition in a lot of municipalities
[10:27.760 --> 10:32.080]  and this is a big income source for these communities
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.800]  well there's a court in ohio that has said no you can't be doing this let me
[10:36.800 --> 10:39.520]  just read you the article here this is out of
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.400]  w ohio tv they say the days of red light and speed cameras at ohio
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.960]  intersections could be numbered a hamilton county court judge ruled
[10:48.960 --> 10:52.080]  thursday that would be yesterday that a traffic camera ordinance a little
[10:52.080 --> 10:53.440]  small village near cincy
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.640]  cincinati cannot be enforced yeah now this is interesting listen to the stats
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.040]  on this you guys will die right only uh... two thousand one hundred and
[11:03.040 --> 11:06.800]  eighty eight people live in elmwood place ohio
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.320]  right is a little small town two thousand people approximately
[11:10.320 --> 11:15.520]  but cameras have caught more than twenty thousand driver speeding through town
[11:15.520 --> 11:19.360]  in just the last well less than a year they just installed these things in
[11:19.360 --> 11:21.840]  september of last year so just a couple of months
[11:21.840 --> 11:24.800]  twenty thousand drivers getting tickets you had to be kidding me
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.960]  well what are they making off of this one point five million dollars in
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.600]  september of last year october november december that's like what three months
[11:33.600 --> 11:37.360]  wait no three months of uh... two thousand twelve five months worth
[11:37.360 --> 11:40.880]  one point five million bucks you know what these guys are doing it
[11:40.880 --> 11:44.960]  yeah in the decision uh... the judge said well not enough signage
[11:44.960 --> 11:48.240]  warning the motorists they're not calibrating them it's a for-profit
[11:48.240 --> 11:50.160]  company whole bunch of problems with this
[11:50.160 --> 11:54.400]  but i am delighted to see that not only is the court strike in this town but
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.640]  there's even bipartisan legislation introduced in the state of ohio
[11:58.640 --> 12:01.760]  to knock out those traffic cameras we've been seeing
[12:01.760 --> 12:04.560]  legislation like this introduced in other states
[12:04.560 --> 12:08.160]  and i would say this is an encouraging move wherever you're located
[12:08.160 --> 12:11.840]  you may want to consider lobbying for those cameras to be shut down you know
[12:11.840 --> 12:13.440]  they do a lot more than just
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.400]  monitor people who are violating the law
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.240]  yeah they can also use them for really any purpose they want to and we ought to
[12:20.240 --> 12:23.440]  probably put the brakes on that so i would encourage you
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.000]  to uh... get involved in that movement against the eyes of the state being on
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.760]  every street corner all right the other a bit of good news this week
[12:31.760 --> 12:36.160]  i know it's it's kind of uh... i suppose it's good news
[12:36.160 --> 12:41.200]  tsa allowing knives and golf clubs back on us planes i say i suppose it's good
[12:41.200 --> 12:45.280]  news because it's about time isn't it you know like next they're going to tell us
[12:45.280 --> 12:48.720]  we're going to be allowed to you know have a conversation on the plane
[12:48.720 --> 12:51.840]  it's pretty bad when they take away your rights and then they give them back to
[12:51.840 --> 12:54.720]  you piecemeal and we say oh thank you government sir
[12:54.720 --> 12:57.600]  thank you thank you that we're allowed to do something that you know people have
[12:57.600 --> 13:00.480]  been doing for years and years before you took those rights away
[13:00.480 --> 13:04.400]  but the u s t s a has said that it will allow people to carry small pocket
[13:04.400 --> 13:08.960]  knives on the passenger planes for the first time since the september 11th
[13:08.960 --> 13:12.400]  terrorist attacks along with golf clubs hockey sticks
[13:12.400 --> 13:18.160]  and plastic wiffle ball style bats can you believe that it's been illegal
[13:18.160 --> 13:21.760]  for over ten years now to carry a wiffle ball bat
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.000]  onto an airplane and just just try beating somebody over that with that
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.040]  you know they've got the holes in them they they don't do much all right
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.320]  uh... the agency will permit knives with retractable blades shorter than 2.3
[13:34.320 --> 13:38.400]  inches so we're talking just the barest tiny pocket knives here
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.200]  and narrower than one half inch the new rules are going to take effect
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.200]  at the end of april now they're also going to allow sticks
[13:47.200 --> 13:50.320]  used to play lacrosse billiards and hockey
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.800]  ski poles and as many as two golf clubs yeah you know because if you have three
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.680]  or four you could you could get in big trouble with that
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.760]  all right the flight attendants having a hissy fit about this
[14:01.760 --> 14:05.680]  i'm not sure why they get so upset about pocket knives how many pocket knife
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.280]  attacks did we really have before they ban the pocket knives
[14:09.280 --> 14:14.080]  really realistically uh... most men i know especially in certain parts the
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.040]  country in the south actually carried a pocket knife is just part of the stuff
[14:17.040 --> 14:20.640]  in their pockets along with their keys and their change in their wallets
[14:20.640 --> 14:24.480]  and you didn't see a rash of of you know
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.000]  tiny knife attacks on the airplane so that's i suppose that's good news or
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.760]  let us do that again i've got another law out of texas
[14:31.760 --> 14:35.520]  speaking of local lawmakers who are my heroes gotta say
[14:35.520 --> 14:38.320]  texas is now proposing one of the nation's
[14:38.320 --> 14:43.280]  most sweeping mobile privacy laws if signed into law this is such a no
[14:43.280 --> 14:47.440]  brainer but if signed into lock what cops would actually have to get a warrant
[14:47.440 --> 14:52.240]  before they could use your phone to track you and get your location data
[14:52.240 --> 14:55.440]  yeah pair of new mobile privacy bills recently introduced in the state of
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.920]  texas are among the quote most sweeping ever seen
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.960]  yeah they actually offer better protection on the texas state level
[15:02.960 --> 15:06.800]  than a couple of uh... similar bills introduced in congress this week
[15:06.800 --> 15:10.400]  if passed they would establish a probable cause
[15:10.400 --> 15:12.960]  requirement yeah you'd have to get a warrant
[15:12.960 --> 15:17.440]  you'd have to show probable cause in order to obtain location information
[15:17.440 --> 15:23.680]  from gps devices and also tap and trace and cell phone tower location data
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.080]  this data if the bill passes would only be disclosed to law enforcement quote
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.680]  if there's probable cause to believe the records disclosing location
[15:31.680 --> 15:35.200]  information will provide evidence in a criminal
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.880]  investigation it's about flipping time don't you think
[15:38.880 --> 15:43.040]  all right so i gotta tell you i am always
[15:43.040 --> 15:47.280]  delighted when we see on the state and local level
[15:47.280 --> 15:51.920]  these these kinds of bills getting introduced i have already years ago i
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.360]  gave up on on the federal government although i gotta say i was pretty
[15:55.360 --> 15:57.920]  pleased with rand paul and his filibuster here
[15:57.920 --> 16:01.600]  over the last couple of days so i think there is still some stuff that can be
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.200]  done on the federal level but if you're really looking to make change
[16:05.200 --> 16:08.400]  i believe that that change is going to be happening on the local and the state
[16:08.400 --> 16:12.400]  level joining me later this uh... the third hour of today's program john
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.280]  woods uh... or excuse me tom woods and i
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.280]  are going to be talking about nullification and state rights as well
[16:19.280 --> 16:22.880]  so stay tuned for that will will definitely be getting into where the
[16:22.880 --> 16:27.920]  power structure is and where we as individuals can actually get in there
[16:27.920 --> 16:31.440]  and make some changes right well that's uh... i got a couple more bits
[16:31.440 --> 16:34.240]  of good news but i think that's uh... that's probably enough to tide us over
[16:34.240 --> 16:37.520]  for the moment i now want to turn our attention to something that's maybe a
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.160]  little bit more disturbing and see you guys if you've been following my work
[16:42.160 --> 16:46.400]  at all and i know alex has talked about this extensively on the show as well
[16:46.400 --> 16:52.720]  we are fighting against the tagging of students in san antonio texas with rfid
[16:52.720 --> 16:57.600]  tracking beacons around their necks and one of the reasons that we've said hey
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.520]  listen this tracking pilot program at two schools down there forty two hundred
[17:01.520 --> 17:04.320]  kids being forced to wear a lanyard
[17:04.320 --> 17:07.360]  with a battery-powered id tag around their necks
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.600]  that sends out a signal that's monitored every 25 seconds and recorded in a
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.280]  giant database so they know where all the kids are all the time all day long
[17:15.280 --> 17:19.280]  but it's going to set a bed a bad precedent for the future right those
[17:19.280 --> 17:21.840]  kids are going to grow up and what is school all about
[17:21.840 --> 17:26.560]  well school is about conditioning kids it's really not about education and i
[17:26.560 --> 17:29.040]  can't help myself i gotta share this other story with you
[17:29.040 --> 17:34.880]  um the other breaking news today most new new york city high school grads
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.920]  cannot read basic skills like reading writing math need to be relearned
[17:39.920 --> 17:44.320]  nearly 80 percent of new york city high school graduates
[17:44.320 --> 17:47.440]  have to relearn basic skills like reading
[17:47.440 --> 17:51.280]  before they can enter the city university's community college
[17:51.280 --> 17:55.920]  system right so this story just out today so let's clarify this because my
[17:55.920 --> 17:59.120]  background is in education i have a doctorate from harvard university in
[17:59.120 --> 18:02.400]  education this is what i do it's what i've done my whole life
[18:02.400 --> 18:07.200]  and i can say that as far as education goes the government schools
[18:07.200 --> 18:10.240]  obviously if 80 percent of kids graduating from them can't read or
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.200]  write you would say that they're a failure right
[18:13.200 --> 18:16.720]  well if you talk to john taylor gato who i knew has been a guest on this program
[18:16.720 --> 18:19.440]  in the past who's written the underground history
[18:19.440 --> 18:24.240]  of american education he former new york teacher of the years so he knows what
[18:24.240 --> 18:28.080]  he's talking about he'll come right out and tell you the schools are failing
[18:28.080 --> 18:31.280]  the schools are succeeding brilliantly they're doing exactly what they were
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.920]  set out to do which is to condition kids to accept keeping their
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.720]  mouth shut keeping their heads low obeying authority and staying in line
[18:40.720 --> 18:44.720]  that's what the schools are about and they succeed in that brilliantly
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.680]  so when you take a look now let's turn our attention away from new york where
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.440]  80 percent of kids can't read and now let's look back at texas
[18:51.440 --> 18:54.800]  where you've got 4200 kids as part of a trial this year
[18:54.800 --> 18:57.920]  with these remotely readable tracking devices around their necks what do you
[18:57.920 --> 19:01.040]  think they're learning what do you think they're teaching these kids
[19:01.040 --> 19:04.480]  well they're teaching them to accept this notion that it's appropriate for the
[19:04.480 --> 19:07.600]  people in charge of you well first of all that there are people in charge of
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.320]  you in larger numbers that can segregate slice and dice you into a little age
[19:12.320 --> 19:15.920]  segregated unit that can then put this thing around
[19:15.920 --> 19:18.800]  your neck and punish you if you fail to wear it
[19:18.800 --> 19:22.720]  like andrea hernandez who was expelled for refusing to wear her
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.080]  little tracking device around her neck so you know that's a pretty powerful
[19:26.080 --> 19:29.280]  message we will expel you we will punish you we will make your life
[19:29.280 --> 19:33.120]  miserable unless you don't well already the thing that i've been
[19:33.120 --> 19:35.360]  predicting that this is going to hit the workplace
[19:35.360 --> 19:38.080]  it's happening new story out in the wall street journal
[19:38.080 --> 19:42.560]  titled tracking sensors invade the workplace there's a new company out
[19:42.560 --> 19:46.000]  there putting trackers not only around employees necks
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.920]  but even on the furniture that they sit in to determine how often they get up or
[19:49.920 --> 19:52.800]  take breaks all right more on that story when we come back

[24:52.320 --> 24:55.440]  about any of the topics we're talking about this hour
[24:55.440 --> 24:59.600]  i want to get into this whole concept of tracking
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.960]  people becoming a normal part of life and if they can get it into the schools
[25:04.960 --> 25:06.960]  they always want to start with the kids
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.200]  you know as i said last week when i was a guest in studio with alex it's it's
[25:11.200 --> 25:14.160]  really about conditioning the kids you know hitler said
[25:14.160 --> 25:18.640]  i don't care about you adults who oppose me because i've already got your kids
[25:18.640 --> 25:22.080]  see that's where they want to go and we look at the schools they've got our
[25:22.080 --> 25:26.320]  kids in schools they're clearly doing a horrific job of educating them
[25:26.320 --> 25:29.840]  but that's not what the schools are about at least not according to john
[25:29.840 --> 25:33.840]  taylor gato he says the schools are about conditioning
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.520]  compliant adult units to function in the economy and to take the boring factory
[25:39.520 --> 25:45.280]  jobs and to sit at a boring desk and and you know work for until they're 65
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.200]  and then take the government issued retirement and just be good worker
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.560]  drones that's what the schools are about and they do a great job of that
[25:52.560 --> 25:55.440]  think about it all day long what are your kids told you know i was thinking
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.320]  about this um recently i was at church
[25:58.320 --> 26:02.400]  and most of the kids at my church are homeschooled but one of the kids whose
[26:02.400 --> 26:06.080]  school did a government school and he was doing something i can't get like
[26:06.080 --> 26:08.880]  taking water out of the water fountain and spraying it around the room or
[26:08.880 --> 26:11.680]  something and i walked over to him and i said excuse me
[26:11.680 --> 26:15.040]  uh... where are we can continue telling what building we're in like is it
[26:15.040 --> 26:18.480]  appropriate to be spewing the water what what where are we and he just looked
[26:18.480 --> 26:20.320]  to me like a deer in the headlights
[26:20.320 --> 26:23.120]  you know i wanted to say well we're at church i was going to say well church
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.240]  is probably not a good place to be you know doing what you're doing
[26:26.240 --> 26:29.840]  but he just looked at me and i i realized i've tried several times to just
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.440]  even say hello or good morning or just have a little chat with this kid and
[26:33.440 --> 26:36.240]  and he never says anything he's almost mute
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.640]  and yet you know he can sit there and plays video games a little thumb on the
[26:40.640 --> 26:45.200]  machine and i got to thinking why is it that kids nowadays kids who are
[26:45.200 --> 26:48.960]  government school don't look you in the eye and they can't carry on a conversation
[26:48.960 --> 26:49.920]  with you
[26:49.920 --> 26:53.360]  whereas school kids do in fact that's always the the difference you can tell
[26:53.360 --> 26:55.760]  the homeschool kids because they look you in the eye
[26:55.760 --> 26:59.600]  they can they can speak they've got ideas they interact they go back and forth
[26:59.600 --> 27:02.720]  but the government school kids they they just kind of shrink away and stare at
[27:02.720 --> 27:06.000]  you with these wide-eyed stairs or else they just look at the floor
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.920]  and i realized what's the reason what is the message that they got from from
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.680]  the time they get to to class in the morning until the time they leave
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.160]  don't talk be quiet keep your voice down don't talk be quiet
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.560]  all day long they're told not to talk so is it any surprise that we're creating
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.880]  an entire generation an entire country full of people who do not know how to
[27:26.880 --> 27:30.880]  even speak much less speak up against wrongdoing
[27:30.880 --> 27:35.440]  but literally even speak at all you know i've heard about people going on dates
[27:35.440 --> 27:38.320]  and they're they're literally like texting each other
[27:38.320 --> 27:42.320]  across the table from their little handheld devices rather than having
[27:42.320 --> 27:46.320]  actual conversations so i i think this ties in with this article out of the
[27:46.320 --> 27:50.400]  wall street journal the censor tracking article they're talking about
[27:50.400 --> 27:55.600]  furniture being outfitted with rfid receptor devices
[27:55.600 --> 27:59.680]  and also having these rfid devices around

[28:31.600 --> 28:34.400]  all right uh... speaking of sensors you know maybe that's what they're gonna do
[28:34.400 --> 28:37.760]  with the airports now just just the outfit everybody with a sensor did you
[28:37.760 --> 28:42.800]  hear the proposal a couple years ago to actually put cameras onto the seat backs
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.560]  so they could sit there and watch you on the airplane
[28:46.560 --> 28:50.800]  yeah well the only reason that didn't fly is a lot excuse the pun
[28:50.800 --> 28:53.840]  that didn't fly because the frequent flyers said heck no you know we're
[28:53.840 --> 28:57.840]  paying hundreds of bucks for these tickets and so that's the one place
[28:57.840 --> 29:00.880]  where we actually recognize that it's us you're going to be looking at rather
[29:00.880 --> 29:06.160]  than the terrorist well bank of america a couple years ago wanted to study
[29:06.160 --> 29:08.720]  how people were interacting with one another
[29:08.720 --> 29:12.720]  so they asked ninety workers to wear these badges the same kind of thing
[29:12.720 --> 29:15.920]  they're using at the school down in san antonio
[29:15.920 --> 29:19.840]  to wear these badges with tiny sensors to record their movements
[29:19.840 --> 29:23.920]  and get this they could even record their conversations in their tone of
[29:23.920 --> 29:27.520]  voice in the conversations my question for you why the heck would
[29:27.520 --> 29:31.680]  ninety people agree to do that if your employer asked you voluntarily to wear
[29:31.680 --> 29:34.640]  a thing around your neck that would record your conversations

[33:47.680 --> 33:50.800]  and before we do that i i just wanted to make a couple of notes about
[33:50.800 --> 33:53.520]  health we're going to be talking about health a little bit in the second hour
[33:53.520 --> 33:57.440]  of today's program particularly complementary and
[33:57.440 --> 34:00.240]  alternative ways that you can deal with cancer
[34:00.240 --> 34:03.760]  one of the things that's been kind of at the forefront of of my life the last
[34:03.760 --> 34:07.680]  couple years as i've discussed on alex jones's show and i think alex was one
[34:07.680 --> 34:12.000]  of the first to break the story i actually had stage 3c breast cancer
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.760]  really nasty locally advanced breast cancer
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.240]  and i am so excited because i just began on wednesday
[34:20.240 --> 34:23.280]  the clinical trial of a new drug called
[34:23.280 --> 34:27.840]  it's a mouthful tetra thio malib date this is a drug that's not funded by any
[34:27.840 --> 34:31.200]  pharmaceutical company it is cheap enough you could salt the roads with it
[34:31.200 --> 34:35.680]  there's not big bucks behind it but there is uh... the folks at cornell
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.120]  university dr linda vedant is the researcher on this
[34:39.120 --> 34:42.880]  and i'm going to tell you there's a big story coming out next week
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.800]  in the new york times about this she just published her results
[34:46.800 --> 34:51.840]  in the annals of oncology i am patient number sixty
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.000]  on this phase two clinical trial of this drug to prevent recurrence of breast
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.640]  cancer and i'm going to tell you i think this
[34:58.640 --> 35:02.480]  woman is cured breast cancer because the way this disease kills you as it
[35:02.480 --> 35:06.000]  comes back you know you treat it it's gone and you're in remission
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.920]  and then three five ten twenty years go by and then if it does come back
[35:09.920 --> 35:14.480]  and metastasizes then that's all she wrote well the women that she's been
[35:14.480 --> 35:17.520]  treating stage four cancer patients
[35:17.520 --> 35:20.080]  who normally have less than a two-year lifespan
[35:20.080 --> 35:24.560]  are now six years out with no evidence of disease whatsoever it's
[35:24.560 --> 35:28.480]  extraordinary it's amazing stuff i've blogged about it on my blog if you go
[35:28.480 --> 35:32.800]  to kathryn albright dot com or i know that's hard to spell you can just try k
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.800]  m a show dot com click on the blog you can see all the
[35:36.800 --> 35:41.600]  links right there there are still spaces i just spoke to her on wednesday she
[35:41.600 --> 35:44.400]  gave me permission to talk about it on the show before the new york
[35:44.400 --> 35:48.320]  times article comes out next week there are still spaces for a dozen more
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.520]  women on there the key though is the women have to be
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.600]  stage three or stage four at high risk of breast cancer
[35:55.600 --> 35:58.640]  recurrence they have to have no evidence of disease in other words no
[35:58.640 --> 36:02.400]  active tumors and and i believe she's taking stage
[36:02.400 --> 36:05.840]  two triple negative breast cancer patients so you heard it first here you
[36:05.840 --> 36:09.280]  can be hearing it in the new york times next week
[36:09.280 --> 36:12.640]  and when that hits i gotta say i'm so excited
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.200]  i am patient number sixty on that trial no side effects as far as we can tell
[36:17.200 --> 36:20.400]  other than preventing the cancer from coming back
[36:20.400 --> 36:24.000]  sounds mighty good to me all right so i do want to get back to the phone lines
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.080]  here also want to remind you that info wars shop is where you can go to get
[36:28.080 --> 36:32.320]  all your info wars gear and also please make a point of
[36:32.320 --> 36:35.760]  supporting the sponsors here on this radio program and finally speaking of
[36:35.760 --> 36:39.360]  health alex is in great health i i in no way
[36:39.360 --> 36:43.920]  believe that he has taken this week i to do anything other than wrestle
[36:43.920 --> 36:47.440]  cactuses with his bare hands i think was the the email that came in
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.600]  earlier this week so alex is in absolutely fabulous
[36:51.600 --> 36:54.160]  health i got just i got to visit with him last week
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.760]  and we just want to keep in that way so i am glad that he is able to get just a
[36:57.760 --> 37:01.520]  little bit of a break i know it can be a lot of work
[37:01.520 --> 37:05.920]  running the huge info wars empire so when he comes back i know he's going to be
[37:05.920 --> 37:09.600]  tan rested and ready to take on the new world order
[37:09.600 --> 37:12.960]  and so i know you guys are helping him do that so keep it up
[37:12.960 --> 37:18.240]  all right phone lines are open 1-800-259-9231 let's go to noel listening
[37:18.240 --> 37:24.560]  in illinois hello hello um big fan of your work captain um i uh i was
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.440]  watching the cyber security hearing yesterday uh the senate hearing and
[37:29.440 --> 37:33.280]  just got me thinking again knowing uh that we
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.320]  could be roaming on uh the last days of freedom on the internet
[37:38.320 --> 37:42.560]  i'm a big fan of starpage dot com i use it a lot during my investigative
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.760]  reporting work to look up some documents away from google
[37:45.760 --> 37:52.560]  uh any suggestions on on say uh email servers or
[37:52.560 --> 37:58.000]  if you can register a website away from a company like though daddy who
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.240]  was pro uh so but syspa or any any suggestions or recommendations for
[38:04.240 --> 38:07.840]  those who are trying to do their best to prevent
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.160]  uh you know malicious attacks online knowing that websites are tracking
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.040]  your any better ways that we could prevent ourselves online
[38:15.040 --> 38:18.320]  you know it's tough stuff i i've actually done a couple interviews with
[38:18.320 --> 38:21.440]  with the folks behind tour the onion router which is a
[38:21.440 --> 38:25.760]  a probably you know for the really hardcore folks who really want to
[38:25.760 --> 38:28.880]  restrict their their you know kind of create a buffer between
[38:28.880 --> 38:32.640]  themselves and the actual internet you can also use proxy servers
[38:32.640 --> 38:36.960]  uh start page has a proxy server built in a lot of people don't realize that
[38:36.960 --> 38:40.400]  that when you when you search with start page the private search engine that
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.000]  searches google for you but then strips out all the details and erases all
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.680]  records of your visit that i helped to create so full disclosure there
[38:47.680 --> 38:51.360]  uh when you use start page among your start page search results if you look
[38:51.360 --> 38:54.960]  at the underneath the results you'll actually see it says view by x quick
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.120]  proxy and if if you just want to visit a website privately
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.080]  and i i frequently do this if i'm visiting like the national institutes
[39:02.080 --> 39:04.480]  of health looking up cancer research for example
[39:04.480 --> 39:07.360]  because i don't particularly want to send them my personal information or
[39:07.360 --> 39:10.640]  pick up one of their tracking cookies what i'll do is i'll do the search on
[39:10.640 --> 39:14.880]  start page i'll get the results and then i'll click view by x quick proxy
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.960]  of you know let's say nih dot what is it dot dot gov
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.400]  and when that information comes back it's been filtered through star page so
[39:22.400 --> 39:25.760]  star page goes out loads the the third party website you want to see
[39:25.760 --> 39:29.280]  under the star page servers serves it to you and then deletes all records that
[39:29.280 --> 39:30.320]  you've been there
[39:30.320 --> 39:34.560]  uh... the end router is is similar i've heard good things in fact my husband
[39:34.560 --> 39:40.000]  has recently installed go story on my computer tubes trip out a lot of the
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.920]  third party tracking cookies and and other observation
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.240]  and you know one of the key places is your isp you know that that's one of the
[39:48.240 --> 39:51.920]  weak links because your isp is aware of all the websites that you're visiting
[39:51.920 --> 39:57.200]  unless their https encrypted so start page was actually the first search
[39:57.200 --> 40:01.040]  engine to incorporate https or ssl encryption
[40:01.040 --> 40:05.520]  just by default but it means that your isp can't observe what you're doing
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.040]  and one of the things i want to encourage start page to develop as soon as we
[40:09.040 --> 40:12.560]  we get our private email out there the alternative to gmail
[40:12.560 --> 40:16.640]  is i want to encourage start page to develop a dns lookup service because
[40:16.640 --> 40:20.560]  the dns is another place where every website that you're visiting it's got
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.880]  to be resolved they've got to resolve the the dns address the ip address and
[40:24.880 --> 40:27.120]  that's all being recorded as well
[40:27.120 --> 40:30.400]  so it's a huge question uh... we could probably do three hours just on that
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.640]  alone all but um... i i would say just keep keeping on what start page is
[40:34.640 --> 40:38.800]  doing because we're working on a lot of those privacy products
[40:38.800 --> 40:41.520]  well thank you so much what was that program you just mentioned about the
[40:41.520 --> 40:44.080]  cookies is i've been aware about cookies as well
[40:44.080 --> 40:50.960]  just a ghost early grocery yeah ghost g h o s t e r y grocery
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.200]  and i i haven't sat down i i i've been in a whirlwind lately so i've not sat
[40:55.200 --> 40:59.360]  down to do the full top to bottom review but my husband has and he he thought it
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.200]  was good enough to put it on our office computers and our home computers so
[41:03.200 --> 41:06.960]  that's uh... and it's been it's been kind of cool because i get i get less
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.520]  garbage so check that one out too and i'll i'll keep folks
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.560]  posted on that my website by the way uh... k m a show dot com these are the
[41:16.560 --> 41:18.880]  kinds of things i talk about on my radio show
[41:18.880 --> 41:21.760]  so you know if you're if you're interested in that kind of information
[41:21.760 --> 41:25.120]  as it crosses my desk that's that's usually where i get it out
[41:25.120 --> 41:28.000]  to folks so thanks for the call no they appreciate your interest
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.760]  let's go to zack listening in tennessee good afternoon zack or good morning
[41:31.760 --> 41:33.760]  wherever you are hello
[41:33.760 --> 41:36.880]  uh... yes ma'am uh... first of all i want to start out and say that you do a
[41:36.880 --> 41:39.840]  great job with your analysis the way that you're kind of calm like the
[41:39.840 --> 41:43.840]  hagman's i think a lot of people uh... like alexa style like i do
[41:43.840 --> 41:46.880]  because they're either football players or military but
[41:46.880 --> 41:49.600]  for a lot of the women and people who aren't awake yet i think your style is
[41:49.600 --> 41:52.800]  really good and uh... i was going to ask you
[41:52.800 --> 41:56.960]  yes ma'am um did you hear uh... mike adams a couple weeks ago on alex show
[41:56.960 --> 42:00.400]  and she was talking about you know it will be amazing if we can even
[42:00.400 --> 42:04.240]  survive the next fifty years and then i heard uh... you talking
[42:04.240 --> 42:07.840]  to alex about ray Kurzweil i didn't know if you saw the uh...
[42:07.840 --> 42:11.920]  the sunday february twenty-fourth edition of coast to coast a m
[42:11.920 --> 42:15.440]  but uh... he was on there and they were talking about
[42:15.440 --> 42:18.720]  you know having these ships that were the size of blood cells
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.560]  by the time uh... twenty thirteen or two no twenty thirty i'm sorry
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.160]  rolls around and so i mean that's only seventeen years off
[42:26.160 --> 42:29.760]  so that's not really what mike adams said about surviving the next fifty
[42:29.760 --> 42:32.400]  years and i didn't know what you mean
[42:32.400 --> 42:35.760]  yeah it depends on what you mean by surviving because i think everybody
[42:35.760 --> 42:38.640]  feels like we're we're really starting to move very quickly
[42:38.640 --> 42:42.400]  in a particular direction and ray Kurzweil is interesting because his book
[42:42.400 --> 42:46.400]  the singularity is it starts off even if you don't read the whole book if you
[42:46.400 --> 42:50.240]  can just read the first chapter it starts off talking about what an
[42:50.240 --> 42:54.000]  exponential growth curve looks like and for those for people aren't
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.480]  mathematically inclined it essentially means
[42:56.480 --> 42:59.760]  that for us to double the amount of technology we had back in
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.080]  i don't know five thousand bc took like a thousand years or three thousand
[43:04.080 --> 43:07.200]  whatever and then to double it it begins doubling in
[43:07.200 --> 43:09.680]  shorter and shorter increments of time
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.680]  so all of the technology i'm i'm making these numbers up but like between
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.280]  eighteen hundred nineteen hundred you had a doubling and now you're having this
[43:17.280 --> 43:20.880]  doubling literally within a matter of weeks or even days where we are
[43:20.880 --> 43:24.000]  absolutely at this exponential fast pace
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  and his his uh... whole theory here about the singularity
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.560]  is that it is going to begin increasing at a rate that we humanly can keep track
[43:32.560 --> 43:36.400]  of and that we will actually have to incorporate the computer
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.720]  network inside of our own brains or chips in our brains to even keep track
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.320]  of the pace of technological change and that at some point you talk about
[43:44.320 --> 43:47.040]  survival at some point we will dump what he
[43:47.040 --> 43:51.840]  refers to you know paraphrase here but basically these meat packages that we
[43:51.840 --> 43:56.240]  walk around in called bodies and we will upload ourselves into
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.200]  this gigantic a virtual matrix that that's this computer network
[44:01.200 --> 44:04.480]  and once we're in that it won't matter if the earth becomes too polluted to live
[44:04.480 --> 44:06.880]  on because we will all just be bits and bytes in
[44:06.880 --> 44:09.920]  in some vast giant computerized brain
[44:09.920 --> 44:12.880]  now what i think is so interesting about that is that it pretty much does
[44:12.880 --> 44:16.560]  correspond to what the bible talks about as well in the book of revelation
[44:16.560 --> 44:20.480]  that there's going to be a time when everything is going to become numerical
[44:20.480 --> 44:23.520]  we're gonna have these numbers in our right hands or our forehands
[44:23.520 --> 44:27.520]  and when we take that or when we bow down to that when we become a part of
[44:27.520 --> 44:31.920]  that when we worship that that that's pretty much all she wrote
[44:31.920 --> 44:36.320]  at least in terms of you know your ability to to to ever come in contact
[44:36.320 --> 44:39.760]  with god to say the least and i think the two are one in the
[44:39.760 --> 44:43.520]  same i really do i believe that this this whole notion of
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.920]  uploading yourself for safekeeping or immortality into the computer system
[44:47.920 --> 44:52.080]  is going to be a form of handing your soul literally removing your soul from
[44:52.080 --> 44:55.840]  your body and handing it over to this thing we're building
[44:55.840 --> 44:59.440]  and the thing we're building i think as i mentioned on alex's show last week i
[44:59.440 --> 45:02.000]  think what we're building is the body of the beast i think we're actually
[45:02.000 --> 45:05.680]  building the thing that this dark spirit is going to inhabit
[45:05.680 --> 45:09.440]  so yeah the future i i don't know you know people say is it coming tomorrow
[45:09.440 --> 45:12.960]  wins wins it all gonna end and i say we really don't know
[45:12.960 --> 45:16.240]  you know we we we don't it could be thousands of years it could be
[45:16.240 --> 45:20.400]  you know a handful of years but i will say this we are the first generation to
[45:20.400 --> 45:24.160]  ever live on planet earth it has the ability to implement the mark of the
[45:24.160 --> 45:27.760]  beast and that's happened since i became an activist in 1999
[45:27.760 --> 45:31.280]  i've watched it happen just in the last 12 13 years
[45:31.280 --> 45:34.960]  that we have that ability so it's it's happening really quickly i'm with you
[45:34.960 --> 45:38.880]  there the way he was trying to sell it is that your brain can only
[45:38.880 --> 45:43.040]  take in like you said like 300 million items of information and after that you
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.960]  have to archive and dismiss it so he was basically saying that by you know
[45:46.960 --> 45:50.640]  taking these blood size or blood cell size chips that
[45:50.640 --> 45:53.760]  you know like you said it's just like if you rewatch the matrix how they
[45:53.760 --> 45:57.120]  upload into the matrix and get all these programs and software but
[45:57.120 --> 46:01.680]  if you look at it and at that point are you even human anymore
[46:01.680 --> 46:05.120]  you know he reikers well and there's another guy named peter cochran
[46:05.120 --> 46:09.440]  c-o-c-h-r-a-n-e he wrote up he has a blog he's with British telecom he's kind
[46:09.440 --> 46:14.160]  of the reikers well of of england and he actually wrote this really creepy
[46:14.160 --> 46:17.600]  blog entry that talks about how when his dad died
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.200]  that he would have given anything and you know anytime you say i'd give
[46:21.200 --> 46:25.840]  anything they'll cue the dark music right he said he would give anything to
[46:25.840 --> 46:29.600]  remain in contact with that consciousness that was his father
[46:29.600 --> 46:32.400]  and you know once you start talking about trying to revive the dead or
[46:32.400 --> 46:35.280]  staying contact with the dead then you open yourself up to all kinds of
[46:35.280 --> 46:40.000]  disturbing things and what he in in this article talks about
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.960]  is how we will all become one single unified consciousness across
[46:44.960 --> 46:49.760]  not just the globe but the universe and then we will travel out into the
[46:49.760 --> 46:52.960]  universe looking for host bodies to inhabit
[46:52.960 --> 46:56.400]  now this is not a religious guy this is a technologist
[46:56.400 --> 47:00.560]  so this whole idea that your brain can't contain it all or your body can't even
[47:00.560 --> 47:04.160]  contain your own brain that you're going to have to get out there and become
[47:04.160 --> 47:09.040]  sort of at one with this global entity or this universal entity this universal
[47:09.040 --> 47:11.280]  consciousness and it all ties in with the age of
[47:11.280 --> 47:14.000]  aquarius people in the new age people we're going to have some kind of
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.240]  enlightenment there's going to be some event
[47:16.240 --> 47:20.000]  and we're all going to come together and that sounds really beautiful when you
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.960]  think about you know ending war and world peace and such but it starts
[47:22.960 --> 47:26.400]  sounding really scary when you start talking when you actually look at what
[47:26.400 --> 47:28.480]  the technologists are saying they want to do
[47:28.480 --> 47:32.320]  and just for people who aren't aware ray Kurzweil is now the director of
[47:32.320 --> 47:35.840]  engineering for google so these crazy ideas that i'm talking
[47:35.840 --> 47:38.320]  about even this uh... peter cochran guy
[47:38.320 --> 47:42.800]  you know he he is the technologist for british telecom or was for many years
[47:42.800 --> 47:47.760]  these are not bizarre out there philosophers you know it's it's not
[47:47.760 --> 47:51.920]  david ike making these statements and i i don't mean to imply he's bizarre
[47:51.920 --> 47:54.240]  otherwise make your own opinions on that but
[47:54.240 --> 47:57.120]  you know he's more of a thinker of what's the future gonna look like these
[47:57.120 --> 48:00.240]  other guys are technologists with their hands actually on
[48:00.240 --> 48:03.600]  the power to implement it through google and elsewhere
[48:03.600 --> 48:07.280]  so zach you know you take a look at google glass this idea of a pair of
[48:07.280 --> 48:11.200]  glasses that you're just gonna wear that will filter all of your experiences
[48:11.200 --> 48:14.720]  up into the cloud as you experience them we're already there
[48:14.720 --> 48:17.040]  you know it's it's it's happening as we go
[48:17.040 --> 48:20.240]  hey listen i appreciate the call thanks for getting me off into
[48:20.240 --> 48:23.520]  some of that futuristic stuff because it's really relevant
[48:23.520 --> 48:27.040]  and and we all feel it all right let's go to david listening in
[48:27.040 --> 48:32.480]  arizona hi david oh hi kathryn thank you for having me on
[48:32.480 --> 48:36.720]  uh... are you still there yeah thanks for the call go ahead okay okay good
[48:36.720 --> 48:40.560]  uh... well i'm gonna hit you with a shocker and i'm gonna uh... tell you
[48:40.560 --> 48:43.600]  uh... the solution the shocker is
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.680]  i believe the mark of the beast is already implemented
[48:47.680 --> 48:51.040]  and uh... for example i'm gonna ask you a question here
[48:51.040 --> 48:54.000]  do you know the four ways that we can be marked
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.920]  in order that we will have to be able to buy and sell
[48:57.920 --> 49:00.720]  well there's one i'm gonna i'm gonna jump in here
[49:00.720 --> 49:04.320]  before you get into that and tell you that there is one key component of the
[49:04.320 --> 49:06.880]  mark of the beast which is a worship component
[49:06.880 --> 49:09.760]  that when you read and let me tell everybody where it is the last book of
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.600]  the bible revelation you can remember the unlucky number 13
[49:13.600 --> 49:17.200]  so it's in chapter 13 it's the last three verses in chapter 13
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.280]  so go to the end of the bible and then go to the end of chapter 13
[49:21.280 --> 49:24.960]  and it talks about a time when all people great and small rich and poor free
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.280]  and bond or imprisoned or enslaved will be caused to have a number on their
[49:29.280 --> 49:32.640]  right hand or their forehead without which they cannot buy and sell
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.560]  and then in order to receive that they will have to worship the beast or his
[49:36.560 --> 49:40.080]  image so dave i know lots of people call contact me and they say well it's
[49:40.080 --> 49:42.960]  sunday worship that's a seven day adventures lots of people say well it's
[49:42.960 --> 49:46.480]  you know being catholic or whatever there's a million different explanations
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.040]  but i i would have to ask you whatever it is that you're taking a number to do
[49:51.040 --> 49:55.360]  it's not involving worship at least not yet i don't know anybody bowing the knee
[49:55.360 --> 49:59.200]  and making a prayer before receiving these numbers would you agree
[49:59.200 --> 50:03.840]  kick it off okay let me finish this now okay if you go to deuteronomy the lord
[50:03.840 --> 50:07.200]  asked his people to put his commandments
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.480]  in their frontlets which is between the eyes it's in the
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.800]  pineal gland and he also said bear them as a sign upon my hand
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.000]  what that means is we know the ten commandments
[50:18.000 --> 50:25.040]  right and we do the ten commandments so that people can see us
[50:25.040 --> 50:28.560]  following the ten commandments when when we when we do something
[50:28.560 --> 50:31.840]  that oh that we obey god well i'm trying to take this in and we're about to
[50:31.840 --> 50:34.640]  come up on a break here in just a second so i want to give you a chance
[50:34.640 --> 50:38.560]  how does this time with the mark i would love okay the mark of the beast is we
[50:38.560 --> 50:41.360]  also have to have the name or the number okay
[50:41.360 --> 50:45.040]  do you say that you are a u.s citizen on your taxes
[50:45.040 --> 50:48.640]  no worship there dave that's that's where well i tell you what drive me an

[55:21.840 --> 55:26.640]  restrictions on making me use some kind of bio biometric or
[55:26.640 --> 55:31.280]  fingerprint or iris scan to access my own internet that is the direction they
[55:31.280 --> 55:35.120]  want to go of course that's exactly what they're going to do they always
[55:35.120 --> 55:38.800]  step in and say well for efficiency or for security one of the other that
[55:38.800 --> 55:42.880]  they're the two big watchwords we need to fill in the blank
[55:42.880 --> 55:45.840]  and they're going to push it and they're going to push it hard in fact there's a
[55:45.840 --> 55:50.400]  new proposal over in europe to get rid of pornography on the internet
[55:50.400 --> 55:52.960]  you know hey that might that might be a good thing i don't know there's a
[55:52.960 --> 55:58.160]  proposal out of Berkeley wanting to put taxes on email to fund the postal
[55:58.160 --> 56:00.720]  service all right well let's look at both of those on the face you may say
[56:00.720 --> 56:04.640]  well arguments and pro arguments con first amendment they don't have that
[56:04.640 --> 56:08.000]  over in europe by the way but you can look at that but then you got to realize
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.160]  what's the real agenda underneath that and the real agenda under it is they
[56:12.160 --> 56:15.760]  want to control watch monitor and ultimately take away your right
[56:15.760 --> 56:19.200]  to hear radio programs like this and to go online and get the kind of
[56:19.200 --> 56:23.520]  information that you can get it info wars comm so say no to it fight back
[56:23.520 --> 56:24.400]  against it
[56:24.400 --> 56:27.040]  all right let's see if we can fit in one or two more phone calls here in the
[56:27.040 --> 56:29.360]  last couple of minutes of this hour of the show
[56:29.360 --> 56:33.840]  let's go to terry listening in washington hi terry
[56:33.840 --> 56:39.920]  terry how you doing good go right ahead hey you've got to admit that uh...
[56:39.920 --> 56:47.600]  after september 11th world is the world as we know it is changed
[56:47.600 --> 56:53.440]  i would say absolutely and i thought you know a bunch of us including alex
[56:53.440 --> 56:56.640]  we were predicting this long before september 11th happened
[56:56.640 --> 57:00.320]  that there was a plan afoot to have some major event occur
[57:00.320 --> 57:03.920]  that would enable them to take away our freedom so it's unfolding just the way
[57:03.920 --> 57:06.400]  we thought it would we just didn't know what the event was going to be
[57:06.400 --> 57:11.040]  so yeah i'm i'm totally with you september 11th changed a lot
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.480]  go ahead and the tsa just made the biggest stupid mistake they ever made
[57:16.480 --> 57:20.400]  how so to to allow knives on the plane
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.640]  knives is what took the planes down do you really believe that
[57:24.640 --> 57:27.920]  because i gotta tell you when i go on the plane and i just i just want to say
[57:27.920 --> 57:31.120]  this terry i carry a purse with me my purse has
[57:31.120 --> 57:35.200]  uh... like underwire in fact my bra has underwire in it or at least did before
[57:35.200 --> 57:38.960]  i got breast cancer you know i could sharpen that into a knife
[57:38.960 --> 57:41.280]  i mean if you want to take a knife on the plane
[57:41.280 --> 57:44.480]  uh... there's a thousand one ways that you could take a sharpened metal object
[57:44.480 --> 57:47.520]  onto the plane the fact that we're not seeing planes falling out of the sky
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.400]  left and right is to my mind evidence of exactly what bruce schnyer security
[57:52.400 --> 57:57.200]  expert talks about in his new book there really isn't a threat out there
[57:57.200 --> 58:00.640]  because if there was i mean my gosh you could poison the water supplies you
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.080]  could be taking people down left and right there's a thousand one ways
[58:04.080 --> 58:07.120]  that terrors could absolutely be destroying this country and the fact
[58:07.120 --> 58:11.040]  that it's not happening to my mind is absolutely evidence that it's
[58:11.040 --> 58:15.120]  it's not real it isn't but i could take my barrette and gouge your eye out i
[58:15.120 --> 58:19.120]  could take a pencil out of my purse and and and jab it into your your
[58:19.120 --> 58:21.600]  jugular vein all right we're coming up in a break
[58:21.600 --> 58:25.760]  so sorry uh... this program always comes to a very quick end at that first

[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.200]  new mexico hey chris
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.640]  hello kathryn hi there what's on your mind yes
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.040]  yeah i just wanted to uh... hopefully attempt to dispel a persistent myth
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.360]  in reference to the uh... two billion rounds of ammunition purchased by dhs
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.680]  all it is of course concerning that they purchased that quantity
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.560]  i wanted to uh... just basically explain that
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.040]  from since before september 11 dhs as well as what was previously i n s
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.880]  mother agencies do indeed use hollow point rounds
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.360]  for target practice uh... essentially is this where they're shooting at the
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.640]  the kids in the grandmas in the target practice
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.280]  yeah i think that's the poor recent thing but
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.240]  that was a little creepy yeah yeah let me ask you this um let me ask you this
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.360]  chris and i don't know if you work for dhs or where you have this information
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.160]  but what what is it that dhs needs to be shooting at
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.560]  i ask you what the if they're out there doing target practice with hollow point
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.680]  bullets first of all those those suckers are not things you would ever want to
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.360]  aim at a human being unless you were really up against a pretty
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.320]  hardcore enemy what are they looking at billions uh... this is enough
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.320]  ammunition to kill every single one of us in america multiple times over
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.600]  you can't even shoot that much ammo at a target
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.600]  so who's the enemy that they're gonna need to shoot with this stuff
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.520]  correct yeah like i said it is it is most definitely a concern of the quantity
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.560]  that they're purchasing but uh... in most law enforcement circles
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.440]  is law enforcement officers will will explain hollow point rounds are designed
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.680]  to not go through the target and hit a second innocent bystander
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.440]  they're designed to break up and flower out into the target
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.880]  um that is why they don't allow agents to use the full metal jacket target
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.400]  rounds because they're afraid that upon leaving the range
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.160]  uh and i'm sure it had happened before before they changed its policy
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.320]  uh like i said it's been over thirteen years now that going home on your way
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.200]  home or maybe later on in the future get into an incident and you forget to
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.360]  have switched out your rounds for the hollow point
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.120]  you get into in a situation you end up firing those full metal jackets
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.520]  and they go through the person you're shooting and you know kill the person
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.800]  behind them my gosh though you know you take a look at what happened in
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.320]  tenement square because that's the last time i'm aware of hollow point bullets
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.280]  being being used against civilians and the the the chinese military
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.920]  actually shot their own you know perfectly peaceful protesters
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.120]  in the back with hollow point bullets you can actually do a start page search on
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.800]  it and see photographs of what what a human body looks like when it's been
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.640]  blasted with a hollow point bullet so i'm i'm not a big fan of people walking
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.240]  around with those things in the chamber i i just um you know the whole the whole
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.080]  concept of that is is a little bit mortifying and i won't even say a
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.200]  little bit we've got now the c i h chief we've got the attorney general
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.360]  really struggling to even make the point that that our own military
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.040]  is not allowed to just kill us in cold blood without any kind of due process
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.880]  in our own country so thank you for for the insight there but i gotta tell you
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.720]  it's um i i just find the whole thing super creepy
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.720]  all right um let's see we got i i want to apologize to ryan dan
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.000]  and scarpi looks like we're probably not going to get to all of these phone
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.800]  calls just because we're coming up on a break here
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.040]  this is the very short segment as we go into the second hour of the program

[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.600]  hey it is friday folks heading into a weekend can't wait
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.560]  yeah it's been a long week lots of stuff going on this week
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.160]  lots of stuff going on i don't know just kind of it's swirling all around you
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.720]  isn't it you blink and and 50 stories go right on past you
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.960]  yeah the big news um well we've got so much big news but
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.240]  i got my hat is off this week to rand paul
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.760]  i you know a good old-fashioned filibuster what do you get up there and
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.760]  talk 13 hours about drones it's about time
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.360]  do you even think that that hearing would have had do you think any of the
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.840]  mainstream media would have even covered the issue
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.520]  of drones being able to kill people in a on american soil american citizens
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.720]  without due process if it hadn't been for him standing up and doing that
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.840]  you know i know a lot of folks myself included have given rand paul a really
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.040]  hard time because he's not ron paul but i will say you know hats off well done
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.320]  so on my show i do good news friday every friday that's one of the things i'm
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.400]  going to be talking about this afternoon on my show
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.560]  by the way my website if you want to check out my radio show is kma
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.440]  show dot com all right well let me give you just a little bit of background
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:39.920]  about this hour's guest joining me this hour john selene he is an expert on
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.840]  mushrooms and they're used for medicinal purposes
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.360]  and i've taken a lot of flak over the last couple years since i was diagnosed
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.960]  with breast cancer for doing the conventional treatment and also for
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.960]  doing complementary treatment let me give you
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.960]  uh... let me explain what i mean when i was diagnosed with
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.200]  with breast cancer i found a lump in my breast the size of a chicken's egg
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.320]  literally like you know you open up the the the dozen eggs
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.680]  that's how big this lump was don't ask me how i didn't find it before
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.560]  i could kick myself a thousand times over that i didn't but i'd never had a
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.320]  mammogram was an old enough to qualify for the average screening
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.720]  and by the time i found it it was a big moment of holy cow
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.520]  now i've always been miss alternative miss natural i do not eat hydrogenated
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.880]  anything i avoid soy and everything gmo
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.440]  i am uh... about as uh... clean of an eater and is clean of a liver
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.280]  uh... live i probably have a clean liver too but i live well
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.560]  and really try to avoid uh... all things processed and all things nasty
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.320]  nevertheless i develop breast cancer now i've got some family history my my
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.120]  aunt unfortunately passed away from it my mother's aunt and possibly my mother's
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.320]  grandmother also passed away from breast cancer so i was probably in the
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.520]  crosshairs without even realizing it but when i developed breast cancer
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.800]  the question i had to ask myself is okay now what
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.760]  and it's the question everybody one in three of us by the way is going to get
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.800]  cancer so if you're fortunate enough not to have
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.320]  experienced this um... i i absolutely pray that you never do
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.280]  but i'm betting that you either know somebody or will know somebody who's
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.320]  going to go down this road because one in three of us is getting it one in eight
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.720]  women is getting breast cancer nowadays
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.760]  so as i had to make the decision what i'm going to do
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.560]  the the basically i had competing things from both sides
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.720]  i live and work in this alternative media world myself
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.720]  and i'd always heard well don't cut burn and poison the cancer you've got to
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.360]  instead do all these natural things to build yourself up
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.040]  long story short i took a month and i lived about as clean as a human being
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.320]  can live i lived on raw natural organic juices
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:47.280]  celery juice and carrot juice we bought a juicer
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.040]  i did hypnosis i did prayer i meditated i did
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.600]  a relaxation i did massages i did every possible thing a human being can
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.200]  possibly do i took every supplement that's known to reduce cancer
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.280]  and then i paid 700 bucks to go back in and have this huge tumor
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.280]  reevaluated to see if it had shrunk well not only had it not shrunk it may have
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.480]  even grown a little bit and it was at that point i said you know what i can't
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.480]  mess around with this because if it hasn't already metastasized it's right
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.080]  on the edge of doing so because it's huge i got to get it out
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.920]  so at long story short i did two years a very aggressive
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.080]  conventional therapy but now here's where i get all the grief
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.640]  well you shouldn't have done that you should have alkalized your body or you
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.680]  should have done you know fill in the blank alternative natural treatment in
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.880]  mexico or tijuana clinic this and that my aunt did that and she died
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.560]  she did all natural you know kombucha and um garlic and she had she had this
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.400]  guru and she did what the guru said and it didn't work
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.480]  and in many cases it doesn't work well i didn't want to be a statistic
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.240]  and when i looked at my stats my chances of surviving this cancer without
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.440]  conventional treatment were less than one percent
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.280]  it was 0.8 percent that i would still be alive and kicking in 10 years
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.360]  all right those statistics got my attention and if there's one thing i
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.200]  know how to do it's a research i just to write the book spy chips are
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.200]  expose on rfid my co-author liz and i we went through 30
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.560]  thousand documents to write that book spy chips by the way if you haven't read
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.360]  it get a copy out of your library and and sit down with it
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.280]  because it's stuff you need to know but if i could read 30 000 documents to
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.880]  write a book on rfid you better believe i could sit down and read
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.360]  way more than that in order to save my own life so i did
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.760]  and what i came up with is a new way or a different way
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.960]  of navigating this whole cancer experience
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.400]  which is taking the best of both worlds so at the same time i'm getting flat
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.320]  from all my listeners catherine how could you possibly do chemo top up up up
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.880]  at the same time i was getting that my oncologist was giving me grief because i
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.800]  was complimentary i was adding in all of the resveratrol and the curcumin
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:02.000]  and the hawthorn for heart function and acetylcholine for neuropathy and you name
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.840]  it so i take between 30 and 40 pills a day
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:09.440]  of complimentary herbs and other supplements
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.720]  in order to make sure that i never see this beast again
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.760]  now both sides are at war the conventional oncologist wants nothing to do
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.680]  with all of my herbal supplements and all the alternative people want nothing to
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.240]  do with all the information that i've gleaned about
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.920]  radiation and chemotherapy and i believe that we need to have a better
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.520]  merging of those two
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.840]  all right well joining me this hour is john saline of mushroom science
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.200]  he is uh... when my husband was trying to figure out why my white blood cell
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.600]  counts were dropping so low after chemo
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.560]  my wonderful husband went online and did some research and he discovered that
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.320]  over in japan they have taken a purified form of
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.960]  coriolis mushroom they have purified it and extracted it into
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.320]  something that they literally hang in the chemo center
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.640]  in an ivy bag and administer to patients to keep their white blood cell count
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.280]  from dropping and that is how i wound up discovering the whole
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.680]  thing about mushrooms and discovering john saline
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.120]  and with no further ado let me go ahead and welcome john saline to the program
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.320]  hello john
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.520]  hi captain how you doing
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.000]  hey it is great to have you here with me so i know that was kind of a lengthy
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.840]  introduction here but i gotta tell you ever since i found the coriolis when i
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.280]  was going through this uh... more treatment than my oncologist has ever
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.200]  given to anyone she told me
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.240]  as i was going through that one of the key problems that you have when you do
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.640]  the conventional therapy it's hard on the body
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.760]  and one of the ways it's hard is the white blood cell count
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.920]  so talk to us about what they've discovered over in japan with the psk
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.840]  well kapan the medical system it's really different than ours
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.040]  um they have a long tradition of verbal medicine and
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.320]  korean and korean korea they have allowed their
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:16:00.320]  herbal medicine to co-evolve with the advent of allopathic or modern medicine
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:05.680]  surgery and pharmaceuticals you know that kind of approach and uh
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.680]  well it was back in the uh... sixties um
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.160]  when uh a chemist for korea uh incorporated
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:20.400]  pharmaceutical company his neighbor was basically sent home to die
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.240]  he had stomach cancer and they said well we done what we could do go
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.120]  get your ferris and ordering um so this guy's neighbor was running all over the
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.040]  neighborhood picking a certain mushroom and making tea out of it
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.960]  and drinking it low and behold he got better
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.200]  so the chemist you know it took a while but
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.920]  convinced his boss the people above him like hey we need to take a look at this
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.840]  and uh and well they started researching it and
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.080]  researching other mushrooms as well what they refer to as as medicinal
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.560]  uh or tonic uh whether that delivered tonic benefit
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.920]  as defined in uh chinese and japanese herbals
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:10.960]  and uh they found that these mushrooms have polysaccharides and they're so
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.440]  long the needs polysaccharides contain beta-glucan
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.200]  and they can um because your white blood cells
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.760]  aren't basically your cellular immune system right so the white blood cells
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.120]  are are the the the immune cells that come out and attack
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.680]  the foreign invaders correct and in the case of cancer
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.760]  our first line of defense right against against um pathogens
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.480]  um viruses and and bacteria but also against cancer cells as well
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.680]  well but it is i mean you know it's always important to have a healthy
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:48.000]  immune system absolutely never more so than when you're
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.680]  dealing with a serious issue like you were uh
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:57.280]  and the uh we have immune cells they don't really know why i mean they
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.760]  know how it works that's not exactly why it works uh
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.440]  we have immune cells that are hardwired to respond
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:10.880]  to these uh the beta-glucan uh and this is what i find so
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:14.480]  so interesting that that what the reason the mushrooms work and it took me
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.440]  well to to really understand all of this with your help
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:23.680]  is that the when when you eat the hot water extract of of these mushrooms the
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.200]  polysaccharides which are little little molecules and the beta-glucan's inside
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.440]  of there they have a particular shape if if i have
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.320]  this understood correctly we have physical triggers they're what they're
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.640]  called as a a pathogen-associated molecular pattern now that sounds kind
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.800]  of spooky but uh you know your non-specific immune
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.320]  response has to very quickly uh it casts a wide net and has to very
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:53.200]  quickly look at something does that belong here yes or no is it a
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.560]  threat yes or no and then respond accordingly so just to summarize this
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.040]  when when you take in one of these beta-glucan's one of the polysaccharides
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.320]  are the little natural sugars that occur in these in these mushrooms
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.200]  the body says holy cow this is this is a pathogen it looks like a pathogen
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.120]  because of the shape of it so the immune cells then get stimulated they start
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.360]  pouring out of the body out of the bone marrow
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.040]  and try to attack these these little mushroom cells but when they get there
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.640]  they take a look and go wait a minute this isn't a a pathogen this is just a
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.160]  piece of food and now that we're here now that we're
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.000]  now that we've got created this huge army what else can we attack
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.840]  and so it's the whole key is that the cytotoxic
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:42.320]  that the response created is effective against all pathogen
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.440]  well that's that's the thing i personally experienced i want to i want to
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.440]  let listeners know um exactly how this benefits cancer patients going
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.000]  through chemotherapy when we come back this is the alex joneshow i'm your
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.320]  host katherine albrecht visiting with john selene talking
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:02.480]  mushrooms more in a moment social unrest food shortages
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:08.240]  political turmoil emps earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes fires riots
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.080]  flooding it's not a matter of it but when what if it happened right now

[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.120]  in a crisis some people think the answer is gold

[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.680]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.280]  97 percent of americans don't have this one critical item
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.360]  in fact i haven't even given it a thought and the sad truth is that you may

[01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:10.000]  before they forced me to shut it down again that's crisis123.com
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:05.840]  we're back
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.320]  with you till the end of the day it is good news friday and we're talking this
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.800]  hour about an inexpensive alternative to those three
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.720]  thousand dollar new last-a-shots or new pageant shots if you know what i'm
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.280]  talking about anybody out there i certainly went through this when they
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.920]  give you chemotherapy let me just give you the background
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.520]  as to why this is so important when they give you chemo the chemo
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.520]  works by destroying fast dividing cells and
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.480]  cancer cells the reason they are cancer cells is because they're
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:40.240]  multiplying and dividing rapidly out of control
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.760]  so what the chemo does is it goes in and it makes that that
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:49.120]  cell division process not work so any cells that are in the process of dividing
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.640]  as the chemo goes through the body the couple of hours that it's active
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.920]  those cells will die that's why women lose their hair
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.560]  it's one of the reasons why you have the nausea and some the side effects of
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.680]  chemotherapy which they've gotten really good at mitigating by the way
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.040]  but that's how chemotherapy destroys cancerous tumors because they are fast
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.920]  replicating that's how you get a tumor it's something that's grow grow grow
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.120]  grow grow grow until it's big enough to be some huge
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.680]  lump that then takes out your bodily function
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.280]  so in this process unfortunately one of the
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.800]  sets of cells that is continually dividing are your white blood cells
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.920]  inside of your bone marrow and as they're dividing to create your immune
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.600]  system then the chemo goes in and blasts them out
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.120]  and so one of the side effects of chemotherapy is a drop in your white
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.800]  blood cell count it's called neutropenia and so every time that i would have a
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.800]  chemotherapy treatment which i believe absolutely saved my life
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.400]  every time i would have that life-saving treatment the downside would be my
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.360]  immune function would drop through the floor
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.040]  i wound up with colds and flus and infections
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:57.840]  and strap infections bursting out of my skin it was a nightmare because every
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.680]  pathogen that came down the pike i was susceptible to it because i didn't have
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.440]  the white blood cells so what they do at the chemo center
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.760]  is they send you in for a three thousand dollar shot called either new last
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.120]  or new pigeon this three thousand dollar shot you have to go in
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.480]  you know 72 hours or but it was a 40 48 72 hours after your chemo treatment
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.520]  they give you this three thousand dollars shot
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.640]  and by the way not all women's insurance will even cover this
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.400]  um when they give you the shot it's super painful going in and then you have to
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.560]  take pain pills because it forces the bloods the the bone
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.000]  marrow to produce the white blood cells it's extremely painful
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.920]  it's like the worst cramps you can ever imagine in your arm especially in your
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.960]  legs that's where you've got the long bone marrow so that is the standard way
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.120]  that we do it here in the u.s it's costing a fortune take every patient
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.040]  who's receiving chemotherapy multiplied out by four or eight treatments
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.160]  and then multiply that out by all of the people who have cancer and you can only
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.400]  imagine the amount of money being spent on this
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.400]  well in japan as we were discussing with john selen of mushroom science
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.800]  in japan they don't do that they give people right in the chemo center in the
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.200]  iv bag something called psk that's p is in peter s is in
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.520]  sam k is in kathryn psk which is nothing more
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.520]  than a purified extract of coriolis mushroom it's got the
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.480]  polysaccharides that we're talking about it's got the shape
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.760]  that triggers the immune system naturally on its own
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.120]  to stimulate those cells to begin pouring out of the bone marrow
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.520]  and then go after what it needs to go after so long story short in my case i
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.960]  did the new last shot for the first couple of times and in several cases it
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.640]  wasn't even working it wasn't bringing my blood cell count up to where it needed
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.440]  to be
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.960]  my husband went online he discovered that there's only one company
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.560]  on the planet essentially that makes the right form of this the hot water
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.200]  extract that company is called mushroom science
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.240]  he discovered that the coriolis mushroom i'll spell it for you
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:29:00.880]  c o r i o l u s the coriolis mushroom is the over the
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.560]  counter you can just buy it yourself version of psk
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.000]  so he bought it you went to mushroom science i think it's like by five get
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.760]  one free i think and i bought a case of it
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.120]  i started taking it and sure enough the next time i went in for my white
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:18.880]  blood cell count test which they always do right before your next chemo
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.840]  it was normal not only not low but normal and not at the low end of normal
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.200]  either right in the center of normal and i never again have that new
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.440]  tropina problem so that's what enabled me to get through chemo and to not have
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.680]  to end the life-saving treatment because i was able to support my immune
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.120]  system through the process so you put all that together
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.680]  it's extraordinary mushroom science and by the way i blogged about this and

[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.880]  location he's out on the coast so i'm not sure if he's uh fishing or maybe
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:55.200]  maybe bringing in some shrimp some snapper i know he's uh he's having a
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:58.720]  great time though he's he wanted us to let y'all know that that he's having a
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.080]  wonderful time and he has been checking in periodically through
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.520]  video you know i keep saying alex take a break
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.960]  take a break but you know he won't all right well it is going to be good when
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.920]  he's back in the in the driver's seat next week um
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.720]  piloting the information war that's going on right now info wars dot com is
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.400]  the website want to remind you that at info wars shop you can get
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.320]  gear that shirts hats and more you can also save
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:27.840]  uh ten percent off on a number of products including
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.200]  i believe the pro pierre water filters there's some kind of a coupon on there
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:33.840]  for pro pierre check it out because clean water is
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.080]  one of the key things that you can do for your health
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:40.800]  also if it's direct clearly we need to be able to continue to feed our families
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.040]  in the event of some kind of femur emergency or outage and if it's direct
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:49.120]  is the place to go for that young javity also a whole host of
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.480]  health and wellness products available there
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:58.800]  and we're talking this hour about p s k or the over the counter version of this
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:02.960]  this is quarrel this mushroom super amazing stuff you know i'm a
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.760]  kind of weird on my sleeve bible believing christian
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.080]  and i have to say god has provided just about every possible thing we could
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.440]  need on this planet is just a question of figuring out what it all is and the
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.240]  mushrooms you know they're out there and they're
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.640]  available and they have this incredible effect on the human body and it's
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.280]  positive they stimulate that immune system
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.640]  which enables you to get through chemotherapy or even if you're not going
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.880]  through chemo if you're falling prey to every infection that comes down the
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.360]  pike you know if during flu season you find
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.720]  you that you're continually run down that you're the only person in the
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:39.520]  office or in the classroom who winds up getting sick
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.960]  you can boost your immune system with coriolis it really does work
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.560]  and i'm living proof see most people you can have to take it on faith but i have
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.840]  the actual blood test results of when i was
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:54.240]  taking it and when i wasn't taking it and it essentially saved me because it
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.320]  enabled me to get through all of my chemotherapy treatments without having
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.480]  this awful drop in white blood cell count
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.200]  alright i want to get back to john selen here in a moment also want to let you
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.120]  know that if you are a cancer patient or if you know a cancer patient who's
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:10.720]  going through this process everybody always contacts me how do i get it how
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.720]  do i get it i have linked it on my website on my blog actually at kma show
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.560]  or just my name kathryn albright or you can go straight to mushroom science
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.640]  dot com and if you use the coupon code kathryn
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:28.080]  which is uh... i believe it's built into my site at kma show dot com if you
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.440]  click the link of the mushroom science coriolis box
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.760]  but you can also just type it in k-a-t-h-e-r-i-n-e
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:39.920]  if you use the coupon code with a purchase only if you make a purchase
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.640]  you will actually i think john you're sending people a book
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.440]  do you have a mushroom book that you're sending out by dr mark spangler
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.000]  it's uh... the health benefits of medicinal mushrooms
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.080]  so let's and and i want to get into that let me open up the phone lines and then
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.200]  i want to get into some of the other health benefits because for me it's
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.040]  been really coriolis in my talkie and i take the my talkie every day
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.320]  uh... because of a lot of the research out there showing that it's it's just a
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.480]  good thing for cancer survivors to be on anyway so you're you're kind of my
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.840]  expert i've been uh... kind of sitting at your feet here for the last couple of
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.440]  years learning about this
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:15.280]  uh... phone lines one eight hundred two five nine nine two
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.440]  three one and john give us a sense so when you talk about this book
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.720]  uh... that people get free with a purchase what what what is the
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.680]  information in the book that people need to know what are some of the high
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.440]  points of the medicinal impact of mushrooms probably the
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.920]  one of the most important points that uh... dr stangler makes it up
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.760]  how to choose a properly
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.520]  manufactured uh... mushroom supplement
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:47.600]  unfortunately in the u.s. a vast majority of the uh...
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.120]  mushroom supplements on the market are not extracted
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.160]  and they're just not good at work so uh... he teaches you what to look for on
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.080]  the label which is uh... really quite simple but
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:05.200]  very essential uh... he you know what he gives you examples of
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.960]  literal examples of what you want to see on the supplement back
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.680]  that's the one part of the model every company must by law tell the truth
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.880]  uh... and you know the key the key here is hot water extract is that correct
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.400]  that's the key that makes your product different uh... yeah or just the word
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.400]  extracted and you want to see the percentage of polysaccharide
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.240]  uh... we've known how to test for polysaccharides for half a century now
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:34.080]  you know how to measure them quantify them test for them
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.240]  uh... at our company we have our own lab where we have all the
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:41.760]  analytical chemistry tools to do that and uh...
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.920]  there's no good reason to leave that information off the label i mean you
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:50.480]  have to know it to control your manufacturing process so
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.480]  every company should know the percentage of polysaccharide in their
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.400]  product if they're not telling you the percentage
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.360]  it's not an extract and it's not something you want to use
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.040]  well and i let me get into that because uh... one of the one of the questions
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.800]  people ask is well hang on a second can i just buy this and and eat it and the
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.080]  answer is you know you're probably not going to find coriolis
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:17.120]  um... you know out there in your local whole foods extra wood i mean i suppose
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.640]  if you put it the crackpot for a couple of weeks you might get it down to a
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.640]  point where you could do it but
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:27.040]  you know we're we're using twenty to twenty five kilos of dried mushrooms
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.440]  to concentrate down to one kilo of a dehydrated extract
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.840]  so i mean our extraction facility is basically a
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.640]  giant teapot but at the end of the line we converted to a powder
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.200]  uh... too expensive to sell the liquid uh... there is one good liquid
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.400]  mushroom supplement on the market which we sell on our website
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.920]  uh... my topical that's the one i take yeah that's that is the one that i take
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.800]  well let me let me explain this because i'm actually a member of the
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.240]  mycological society of of boston so i'm
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.000]  a longtime mushroom or my husband and i have studied mushrooms for years and i
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.360]  never didn't realize that they'd be you know one of the things saving my life
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.480]  but they're the thing people need to understand about mushrooms is that the
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.080]  fruit of the mushroom the thing that you actually eat or or make a tea out of
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.000]  or that you see growing above the ground
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.360]  is just a visible fruit almost like the apples on a tree
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:23.840]  that underneath there the real mushroom organism is the mycelium it's the
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.920]  thready it it's like these these long thin threads and that's really the
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.680]  organism that lives year-round and and lives under the ground
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.200]  and pops up periodically these fruits so you can pick all the mushrooms you
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.520]  want and not kill the mushroom plant quote-unquote or the mushroom mycelium
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.760]  um... you can't without killing the fungus but the problem with some of the
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.120]  other products out there and i know on coast to coast recently there was a
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.560]  guy on talking about coriolis and you and i were both cringing
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.760]  because a lot of these coriolis supplements i know that mushroom
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:56.480]  science is the only one that's the hot water extract but some of these other
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.640]  supplements don't even give you the mushroom they give you the mycelial mass
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:04.880]  which does not contain the polysaccharides so how can they get away with
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.560]  claiming that the mycelium does contain the polysaccharide
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.080]  but those products when they grow the mycelium on rice
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.480]  number one it's still sixty to sixty five percent rice
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.880]  so only a third of the product roughly is mycelium but if it's not extracted
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.320]  the cell walls are made of kite same thing as the lobster shell
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:28.400]  you know how tough those are uh... our body can't break it down
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:34.080]  you know and universally every traditional herbal practice that has
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.720]  used mushrooms medicinally uh... when they want the medicine they throw it in
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:43.440]  the teapot every study ever published including
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.800]  all the data on psk uh... also hot water extracted for that very
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.800]  reason now it's not that often that you get absolute consensus
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.680]  between thousands of years of herbal practice
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:00.080]  and every scientific study ever done on a particular subject
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.160]  but here you have it right so and this is the research that my
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.120]  husband did uh... he he's also the wonderful genius who found the tetrothioma
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.000]  live date trial the cornell trial that i just began
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.120]  uh... that's doing copper depletion to prevent a recurrence so both of these
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.240]  things i have to say i i owe to my husband because he went out there
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.200]  and did the hardcore research especially the mushrooms because i was a little
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.280]  bit too worn down because of the white blood cell count all the infections i
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.280]  was getting i was in no position even research so he went out there and said
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.320]  cordialis mushroom but the problem is where do we where do we get the right
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.200]  kind that actually matches the psk out of japan
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.520]  we can order psk my chemo center wasn't going to put it in an iv bag
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.960]  and then when he found you and found mushroom science it was like thank
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.200]  goodness that there is a supplier that's actually making that version available
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.960]  for the public to purchase so it's awesome stuff it's called cordialis
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.520]  mushroom and you've got uh... a couple of different kinds on the website i have
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.720]  a link if people want to go directly to the one i take
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.720]  i still take it every day i will continue to take it every day of my life
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:06.400]  and if you want to know the one i'm taking it already includes the coupon code
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.720]  as well it's at k m a show dot com and then just click on the blue link on the
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.160]  right that says blog you'll see a picture of the cordialis box itself and when
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.160]  you click it it'll take you directly to uh... the mushroom science website where
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.560]  you can get a free book if you place an order
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.760]  all right let's go to the phone lines we've got tom holding in west virginia
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:27.760]  hi tom you're on with john saline and kathryn albrecht go right ahead
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.200]  hi john and kathryn uh... i was wondering uh... john if you've heard of
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.960]  corbison from the from the fifties and sixties
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:38.720]  no i have not okay well that's the same principle that was
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.560]  uh... research you know in the fifties
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.160]  uh... it's based on the actual mice these bogus
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:50.800]  which is a fungal fungus uh... and uh... it was found to
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:55.520]  actually be a very strong uh...
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.960]  attacker of cancer all all forms of cancer but the fda banded in 1964 after a
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.720]  thirteen-year controversy uh... that was
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:10.720]  you know was pretty big in the country uh... the discoverer was a uh...
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:16.160]  mycologist who studied at the uh... the louis pastor institute
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:22.240]  and uh... he discovered it basically uh... he he had the idea that
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:25.840]  uh... you know horses sometimes get
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:29.840]  this this tumor on their throat and um...
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:36.480]  so he uh... he he he realized that sometimes
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:41.920]  the horse will will survive but most of the time they'll die
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.920]  you know from the tumor it's a very very fast-growing tumor
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:49.840]  and it's called lumpy jaw and so he he uh...
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:55.120]  what we discover name is uh... stevan gerovic
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:58.640]  uh... he discovered this uh... cravis in 1951
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.680]  which was a uh... basically he
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.080]  he uh... well let me let me hand this question back to john
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:11.760]  john in terms of the mushrooms we know i i know that the mushroom science you've
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:14.480]  got a whole variety of different mushrooms that have been shown
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.080]  in all kinds of clinical testing to be good for a whole variety of of different
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.480]  conditions as far as the fda goes what does the fda have to say
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.760]  about mushroom supplements i think tom raises an interesting term
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.240]  classified as dietary supplements and um...
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.360]  they wanted to regulate dietary supplements as drugs
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:39.120]  uh... there are uh... very uh... a lot of very unhappy people
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:45.600]  on all sides of all political spectrums so senator oren hatch from utah and
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.320]  senator harkin from iowa uh... got together at past
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.720]  the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.720]  which said uh... fda has to regulate them as food
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.400]  and then come up with a set of rules for
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.160]  uh... good manufacturing practices particularly are they still working on
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:10.800]  that are they come up with this the fda was so angry that they couldn't
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.960]  regulate the stuff about the drugs they ignored
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.920]  the law for years and then finally uh... in 2008
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:25.440]  which was 14 years later uh... they started they started coming out with
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.720]  with the rules and then uh... 2008 it was for the really big company
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:37.520]  200 and over uh... 2009 companies between 220
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.280]  employees to 200 employees and then 2010
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.000]  companies of 20 employees or less those rules apply it
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.440]  and then mainly and you know it it is not a bad thing
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.680]  to have standard operating procedures and to keep the kind of paperwork
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.440]  uh... a little while the fda regardless of what you think about
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.080]  uh... you know the reason they came into being was a lot of
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.920]  issues with the safety of food you know it's interesting i was just i was just
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:09.440]  on uh... the memorial slone catering website which has just a great resource
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.040]  of all the alternative treatments and natural treatments and and supplements
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.160]  and everything else
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:17.680]  and uh... i i strongly encourage people to check those out coriolis by the
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.360]  way is on there and and very highly regarded by memorial slone
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.160]  catering so they've got all the links to the research and everything else
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.560]  but what i thought was very interesting as they talked about like
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.240]  contamination like there was one acai berry that was contaminated by the
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.880]  tryptosomes i think or whatever the word is
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.800]  of um... you know these parasites and and you know things like that clearly
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:40.240]  you don't be taking acai berry supplements that are going to give you
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.680]  some parasitic disease so you know there is a wall for that but
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.800]  but i think i'm careful their food products which means they can harbor
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.160]  passage and uh... exactly and i think one of the other
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.200]  ones they were talking about kombucha that was brewed in
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.960]  in something that had been glazed and lead and people got lead poisoning so
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.560]  you know yeah i there there are certain issues but i you know i think we all
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.920]  are in agreement that we don't want the fda to say no you can't eat a mushroom
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.200]  any longer he told me let me think time for the phone call is if we can squeeze
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.320]  in another one before the break let's go to let's see jack listening in

[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.920]  that if you do order the supplement order it you know try to get your order in
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.640]  first because the people who ordered towards the end
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:38.240]  there was a bit of a delay i think you guys had to order in more products so
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:42.240]  it could be what up to a week or so or even two or three weeks before you
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.880]  actually get it rated uh... thousands of orders and
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.680]  that's more than we normally process in a day and so uh...
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:53.280]  it you know it could take three to four days uh... we're better
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:58.480]  prepares time so you can go to my website kmshow k m a those are my
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.560]  initials k m a show dot com and then on the right
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.240]  hand side it there is a blog link the blue link
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.440]  and i think it's right on my home page it's actually right at kmshow it's on
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.240]  the right hand side you'll see a box of the courier this mushroom that i take

[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.680]  science dot com and the product is called
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.640]  coriolis c-o-r-i-o-l-u-s coriolis mushroom

[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:31.840]  we can't use the word p-s-k because it's trademark
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.880]  right there's lots of aspirin but only coriolis super strength and
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:40.480]  yes and take it on an empty stomach because i didn't realize i was supposed
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.520]  to be doing that until recently so i take it in the morning on an empty
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.360]  stomach and then between meals because that way the polysaccharides
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.400]  don't distribute through the body and stimulate the immune system

[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.560]  they want to take away your alternatives on the internet
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:34.160]  they want to take your take away your alternatives through the media

[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:41.920]  i'm sure there are lots of foot right now to try to find a way to do it but
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:45.040]  we've got this tricky little thing called the first amendment that stands in
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:48.720]  the way of them doing that and as far as your alternatives
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:54.720]  for health i'm a big believer in evidence so i i actually got some email on my
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.400]  show yesterday i was reeling against some of the charlatans with bogus
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.040]  cancer cures that don't do anything that have
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.400]  absolutely no evidence other than a couple of smiling people who they
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:09.680]  they they you know say did great but there's no scientific evidence and
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:12.960]  my if there's one thing harvard taught me it was how to do research
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:19.920]  and you can go on to pubmed.com or pubmed.gov the one will redirect to
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.120]  the other pubmed is the um the the website repository
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:29.280]  for all of the peer reviewed academic medical journal studies
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.200]  go on there don't take my word for it or john saline's word for it go on there
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:38.960]  and look up coriolis mushroom at pubmed.com and you will see dozens of
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:42.720]  peer reviewed scientific medical journal articles on this
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:47.360]  you can look up coriolis c o r i o l us p s k
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:52.400]  at pubmed.com and you will see published in journals of oncology published in
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:55.680]  journals of biochemistry you'll see it a place after place
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.160]  that this is actually being shown to have a direct and immediate impact on the
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:03.520]  immune system powerful stuff the japanese have figured it out
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.560]  hopefully at some point here in the u s we'll get around this three thousand
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.480]  dollar new last shot that is so painful for women and other
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:14.560]  cancer patients and actually make the transition to psk but you don't have to
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.080]  wait for that you can do it directly you can do it yourself and this is why i
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.440]  say reach out for these alternatives when they're available to you
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:24.960]  um let's see in response to the call asking about the phone number
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.080]  john i actually went on your website and let me let me give the toll free
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.560]  number it's eight eight eight two eight three
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.960]  six five eight three that's mushroom science i know that you don't have a
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.320]  massive staff over there and and you're not staffed with 50 people answering
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.560]  the phone so i would encourage people to people to wait until tuesday afternoon
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:47.680]  to call what i'm there because i can answer the questions
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.880]  let's answer questions but if they want to place an order today would probably
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.080]  be the better time to do it while you still have stock because i know that
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:57.760]  you know whenever we talk about this right you you run out and then it takes
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:01.280]  a couple of weeks so uh... if people do want to just call in place in order the
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:04.640]  other thing you can do please remember the coupon code kathryn
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:09.120]  and when you go to mushroom science dot com and let me clarify again
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.800]  you don't want to get the choreolists elsewhere because it's not hot water

[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:59.040]  turbo charge can't wait all right well i am your host cathrine albrecht as you
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.200]  know i i'm you know i cover a bunch of stuff
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.920]  my my last 12 13 years of my life has been devoted
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.520]  to fighting against implantable microchips rfid
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:14.240]  incursion and other forms of privacy incursion and i'm kind of a new
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:18.160]  kick right now because i'm so frustrated with all the misinformation
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:21.120]  floating out there about cancer and if one in three of us is going to be
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:24.640]  diagnosed with a scourge of a disease you know that's more people than got the
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.080]  black plague back in europe during the plague years
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:33.200]  i mean this thing is it's coming and it's here and every time i turn around you
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:37.600]  know women in their 30s being stricken with this awful disease
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.880]  we really need to be thinking prevention we really need to be thinking
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:44.400]  treatment and we really need to be figuring out how to intelligently
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:47.760]  navigate the options that we have available
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:50.960]  and i would encourage you not to fall prey
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.520]  to the people who say oh yes just take my you know miracle holy water that i've
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:00.000]  that i've waved some ions over and it'll cure you of cancer don't go in there
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  to the conventional folks if you get cancer if you're diagnosed with cancer
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.440]  at the very least do yourself one favor
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.960]  get a professional oncologist opinion
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:13.840]  there is research out there you can find this again at pub med
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.840]  that shows that the people who travel more than 50 miles for their cancer
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:21.200]  treatment actually have a higher survival rate
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.840]  and that's not because travel somehow makes you healthier
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:27.440]  it's because traveling means that you've avoided your local
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.000]  podunk hospital and you've traveled to a world-class cancer center that's what
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.880]  i've done i've got a lovely little hospital right here in nashua that i
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.000]  could have gone to fact that's where i was first diagnosed
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.800]  but i take the hour and a half drive into boston
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:44.800]  to go to dana farber which is a world-class cancer center
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:47.600]  if i hadn't done that i would have gotten different treatment
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:51.920]  so at least at the very least get an opinion from an oncologist sit down
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:55.600]  and figure out what your options are before you absolutely throw the baby
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.880]  out with the bathwater people are living longer than ever
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:02.400]  with the cancer treatments available conventionally doesn't mean it's really
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.480]  good for you you got a really going tough to knock out the cancer
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:10.000]  you nurture yourself with the complimentary stuff and that's how you
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.360]  bring your health back and that's also what you can do to survive the
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.400]  treatments like the coriolis mushroom we were talking about
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.440]  all right really quickly let's go to mark who's been holding in florida with a
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:22.960]  question on cancer go ahead mark
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:26.960]  hey there are you yep i'm right here go right ahead your life
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.160]  yeah well ask you such an email and i had a link to uh...
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:33.920]  dr barinski uh... brazilian area there's a
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:39.280]  you video i'm very under cure i've watched his video i've watched the
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:42.960]  lorraine day video i own uh... the gerson books i've got the whole nine
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.440]  yards um... yes so i'm i'm very familiar your question
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:50.880]  awesome awesome no i just wanted to talk about you know how the fda tried to
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:54.640]  ruin this guy and you know all the juries that they brought
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:58.240]  well let me speak to that real quick mark because this is one of the things
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:01.200]  man i would i was going off on this uh... yesterday
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.000]  with my husband i'm like i'm writing a book i'm writing a book
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.160]  because the fact that the fda goes after somebody is not necessarily a badge of
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:09.120]  honor
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.120]  uh... oftentimes and i'm i'm gonna put brazilian ski to the side we could have
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:16.160]  a whole separate conversation because i think his his treatment is one of the
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:18.640]  ones that as far as i can tell is kind of on the edge
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:23.040]  like i can't totally discredit it i'm also not blown away with its effectiveness
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:26.880]  but there are true charlatans out there i mean real people like uh... there's a
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:30.000]  thing called what is it mms which is an actual
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  heavily toxic compound that would kill you if you were to take it
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.880]  and you got those people out there promoting that kind of stuff
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:40.240]  so i don't know when the fda goes after somebody it may really be because they
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:44.400]  deserve being gone after you know i'm i'm not a huge fan of the fda going after
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.400]  people but sometimes it's warranted so just because somebody
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.000]  that you know shut down by the fda doesn't mean they had a cancer cure
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  all right stay tuned we'll be right back

[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:33.600]  extremely busy you were on a stage doing the keynote address
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:37.280]  at the new yam sure liberty form right here in nashua and just uh... about a
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:40.160]  week ago and it was just awesome
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:43.520]  to have an opportunity to hear you speak and i have signed copies of all your
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:47.440]  books and i have been getting quite an education i gotta tell you i thought i
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:48.400]  knew
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.400]  a lot about american history in the economy and the meltdown and all of
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:56.320]  this but uh... after reading your books and i'm learning a whole lot more so
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.680]  you you've been busy
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:58.400]  um...
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:02.720]  talk that let's jump in i want to talk uh... first of all about some of the
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:07.040]  things going on in the news these days and uh... especially
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.080]  about an issue that i know you've talked about an alexa show in the past and
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.600]  that's nullification
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.920]  i actually opened today show talking about some of the local laws that are
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.080]  being at least proposed to see if they get passed but local and state level
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:22.400]  laws to bring freedom back
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:25.760]  and it really seems to me that it's on that state level and on that local
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.960]  level that we're beginning to see the political change rather than the top
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:31.200]  down change model out of washington
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:33.120]  what are your thoughts on that
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:36.880]  yeah i think a lot of people naturally they want to win the whole thing right
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:38.880]  away so they think well i better
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:42.800]  support so-and-so for congress or so-and-so for us senate
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.080]  but that really i think hasn't gotten us anywhere if you just look over the past
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:47.440]  hundred years
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.040]  you know i sometimes joke that uh... one of the world's shortest books should be
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.120]  a great conservative victories that what what are they like what
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.040]  in the victories have been entirely on the side of the advance of
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.480]  of the federal government so i think it's very encouraging to see that people
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:05.440]  have decided that maybe we ought to try something else try
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:08.720]  try at the local level to see what we can do to push back
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:09.600]  and
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:13.520]  so people have even begun using this word nullification that goes all the way
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:15.920]  back to the days of thomas jefferson
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:19.920]  and involves the idea that the states have to be the guardians of the
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:22.400]  constitution in the last resort
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:26.240]  and when you use the word nullification against the
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:30.400]  uh... the political and media establishments i mean it is like you are
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.440]  you're flashing a crucifix in front of dracula
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:37.600]  so to me that that makes it an end in itself i mean i love scaring these
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:42.000]  people making them think that they are in fact losing their grip over the minds
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.720]  of the public that we are having unapproved thoughts
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:48.480]  we're doing we're pursuing strategies we're not supposed to pursue
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.280]  and i i i'm glad to see that it's gaining traction even though
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:58.080]  with the exception of this program and a few isolated hosts here and there
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:02.240]  you will not hear nullification mentioned on any of the so-called
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.320]  patriotic right wing radio stations right that you won't hear
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:10.320]  mark levin talk about it john hennedy won't talk about it rush limbaugh won't
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.360]  talk about
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:14.400]  as usual when something might actually help
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:17.280]  not a word from any of the the usual suspects
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.000]  well and because nullification really is is their worst nightmare it's it's
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.120]  us taking power back away from them
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:28.160]  you know the the it seems like our whole whole political structure has been
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:31.520]  based at least during my lifetime on the federal government
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:36.320]  mandating these universal dictates i'll give you one example right here in new
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:38.320]  hampshire where you were recently visiting
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.680]  i don't know if you availed yourself of the opportunity not to wear your seat
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:46.400]  belt in the state of new hampshire but we are the only one out of 50 states that
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.040]  is said no to the federal highway uh... transportation funding
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.120]  and said pack we we don't want your national law that says we all have to
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:58.160]  wear seat belts by the way we have one of the highest rates in the nation of
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.320]  people actually wearing their seat belt
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.000]  but we're not doing it at the point of a government gun we're not required by
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.400]  law to do it we do it because it's common sense
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:09.600]  so you know you look at things like that where you've got one state that
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:12.160]  stands up and says heck no we don't want to do it
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:16.000]  and believe me we have gotten so much grief for just that one decision here in
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.200]  new hampshire comes up every single time we have an election cycle every
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:22.960]  single time funding gets discussed they want to you know put the screws to us
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:26.560]  and say well we won't give you your own money back your own money that we took
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:28.160]  from the state in taxes
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:31.280]  we won't give you your money back for for highway funding
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:34.720]  so that's just one example of a state being able to stand up and say
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.960]  heck no to something um... it seems like the big place we're seeing this now
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.160]  though is obonacare where's where's that going
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:45.920]  well i'm just quickly on the seat belt thing that i realized this is beside
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:49.200]  the real point is that the states have the power to deal with these issues on
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:50.160]  their own but
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:53.520]  it's interesting to note that uh... sam peltsman who is a university of
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.080]  chicago researcher actually found that
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:58.960]  when you have a seat belt law there's actually no
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:02.720]  difference in traffic fatalities it actually does not have any effect
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:04.000]  whatsoever because
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.680]  it's true that there are fewer people in the car who wind up injured
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:10.480]  but they're wind up being more pedestrians who are injured because
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.160]  marginally people drive more recklessly when they're wearing a seat belt
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.840]  so on balance the number of people who perish is the same regardless of the
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:18.960]  seat belt thing
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.960]  so so they're not even right even when they try to be bossy they're still
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:23.520]  wrong
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:27.520]  you know so but but in terms of obonacare that's getting a lot of attention to be
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:28.240]  sure
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:28.960]  in fact
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.640]  here's a very interesting item
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:34.640]  in south carolina which in some ways is the cradle of nullification but but
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:37.440]  really virginia and kentucky are
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:41.280]  later this month march nineteenth and twentieth there are some
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:42.720]  hearings going on
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:45.840]  where people can be testifying first before the whole general assembly of
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.840]  south carolina and then secondly before the
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:50.800]  house judiciary subcommittee on the
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:53.680]  constitutionality of state nullification and one of the people
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:54.720]  testifying
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:58.320]  on behalf of its constitutionality is a name i hope will be familiar to
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:14:59.760]  listeners of this program
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:02.880]  and that's walter williams who's a fantastic columnist
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:06.720]  he's a fill-in host for rush limbaugh but he's like the anti limbaugh
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:07.680]  and he's
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:10.400]  outstanding on issues like this
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.080]  and i mean if you know anything about walter williams he is that is going to
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:17.280]  be one youtube we are going to cherish for a good long time
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:20.240]  so yeah so so people are embracing this like crazy
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:25.120]  at the same time the official libertarian and conservative organizations out of
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:27.920]  washington dc won't touch it with a ten-foot poll
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:31.440]  they're going around trying to tell state officials to ignore nullification
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:33.520]  to to try to defeat it
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:37.360]  so you know it's as usual it's us against the whole establishment but you know
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.280]  you know how david and goliath turns out so i'm i'm willing to go with that
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:45.520]  well for people who may not understand the concept of nullification give us the
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:46.640]  rundown
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:48.240]  well the gist of it is
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:51.440]  that and this was jefferson's idea by and large
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.280]  that if you let the federal government police itself on the constitution it's
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:59.040]  not going to do a good job it has absolutely no interest whatsoever
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:03.920]  in limiting its own power and so if it is allowed to interpret the constitution
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:06.560]  monopolistically no one else can interpret it
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:09.760]  then well what do we what should we expect we should expect that it will
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:12.720]  continue to discover more and more powers for itself
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:16.400]  so it's not enough to say we've got three branches of the federal government
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:18.880]  and they check each other but what if they all
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:22.240]  unite to gang up on the rest of us who arrest us which is exactly what's
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:25.920]  happened well then we need another layer of protection and that's what
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:30.240]  nullification is where the states step in and say look we created this thing
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:32.720]  we were here before there was a federal union
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:36.080]  it's the states that created the federal union so we obviously
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:40.320]  as james madison said in the last resort the states the parties to the
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:43.600]  constitution have to have some defense mechanism
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:46.480]  so that the thing they created the federal government
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:50.320]  doesn't devour them and that's what nullification is the the
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:53.600]  assertion of power by the state government to prevent the enforcement
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:58.160]  in their state of an unconstitutional federal law
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:01.760]  so now obama care again is the one that comes to mind because i know that's the
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:05.280]  one that a lot of states have been really working to fight back against what
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:09.280]  what are some other issues that have hit this nullification hot button for the
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:12.800]  states well if anything i would say that there's been
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:17.600]  maybe even more enthusiasm regarding applying nullification to the various
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:20.960]  initiatives we've seen regarding gun ownership and restrictions on gun
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:24.560]  ownership this has gotten the attention of a great many
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.000]  people who otherwise would never have heard of this idea and now of course
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.960]  we're hearing about many sheriffs who are prepared
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:35.120]  to resist and not to enforce some of these new restrictions on gun ownership
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.000]  this is all very encouraging and interesting
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.280]  and indeed even though a lot of the folks in the tea party
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:45.520]  have been asleep at the wheel on many issues and they're much much too easily
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:49.200]  caught up with the the latest republican phony
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:53.440]  i have to give them credit for being willing to listen on nullification
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:57.120]  when their own heroes on tv and radio won't touch it with a 10-foot pole but
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:01.040]  the second amendment has now been a huge hot button issue in
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:04.560]  terms of nullify well let's talk about that so what might the
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:09.200]  federal government do and how might the the states respond to that
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:12.720]  well they could have they could impose various restrictions on magazine
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:16.560]  capacity they could impose various restrictions on the types of firearms
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:19.120]  people can own they could impose additional
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.880]  registration requirements and so on down the line they could
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:26.160]  do various measure take various approaches like that
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:29.920]  and we've seen for example in utah i think it was something like either
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:33.760]  28 out of 29 or 28 or 29 out of 30
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:37.760]  sheriffs signing a letter to the executive branch
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:42.160]  of the u.s government saying well you can you can pass these things all you
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:45.280]  want but we're not going to carry them into effect and we saw that also in
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:47.680]  arizona and then there are sheriffs all over the country
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:50.800]  saying we're not going to carry these things into effect and
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:55.360]  i'm sure or at least i strongly suspect that sheriff richard mac has been a
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:59.280]  guest on this program and sheriff maxview is that no president wants to
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:02.240]  have a showdown with a sheriff when presidents have got a certain amount of
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:04.720]  political capital they can use and they're not going to
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:09.040]  expend that capital fighting a sheriff when by and large no matter what
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:12.640]  differences there are the local level people like their local sheriff
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:15.600]  and if you are giving him a hard time they're not going to like you
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:18.880]  and if the sheriff actually defeats the president well this is a horrendous
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:22.560]  humiliation so by and large i think what will happen in some cases at the
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:26.240]  executive branch will decide it has other fish to fry it's not worth
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:30.240]  the aggravation of fighting this and you might actually eat out some victories

[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:46.720]  writing shotgun over the next hour as we go into the weekend so i love to do
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:49.840]  good news on friday because i figured we've got enough to worry about with
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:52.800]  our tough jobs everybody working nine to five
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:57.120]  or trying to find a job a lot of people out there in in that place as well so
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:59.840]  usually by the time the weekend rolls around it's a good time
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:03.840]  to just stretch just let all that stress roll off you as my mom would say like a
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:08.320]  water like water off the dock and loosen up those neck ties and
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:12.080]  take off those work boots you ladies with those high heels rub your aching
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:15.920]  feet because we're going to focus on a little bit of good news here tom wood
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:19.280]  is my guest this hour and i really believe that this
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:25.040]  nullification issue this states rights and just local action is one of the
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:29.360]  most encouraging things i have seen in my almost 15 years as an activist
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.960]  tom can you give us some reason for optimism right now it feels like
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:36.240]  everywhere we turn there's doom and gloom what is there to feel good about
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:42.880]  today well come on you can do it
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.960]  well i i mean i there are there are some good good cases for
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.000]  for optimism in the fact you know as we've been talking about the state
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.560]  nullification issue to me even more than any victories you might win from it
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:58.560]  the fact that so many people are willing to latch on to it when it's not
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.080]  part of the mainstream like people have been intimidated into thinking that
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:06.480]  if their opinions don't fall between you know rachel madow
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:10.800]  and joe scarborough then you know there's some kind of dangerous extremist and
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:13.280]  they better rethink what they're thinking but
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:16.560]  nullification is nowhere and nowhere to be found in that little
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:19.760]  restricted spectrum of thoughts that we are allowed to have in this country and
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.120]  the fact that more and more people are having this thought
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:27.200]  tells me that we are succeeding in breaking people away from conventional
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:29.920]  thinking and they feel better about having a
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:32.960]  thought that no has not been pre-approved for them by the new york times
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:36.800]  well good but the new york times has wrecked this country so of course if
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:40.080]  they don't like something that's almost always an endorsement
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.880]  so that means that the urgent thing i'm with you there and let me also i'll add
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.160]  my own two cents on on a direction i think that is is the right direction
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:52.080]  outside of the pages of new york times and that is the gmail labeling issue
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:56.160]  that that california you know they couldn't get their lawmakers to do it so
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:59.600]  they did a petition and said we'll get this darn thing on the ballot by hooker
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:03.360]  by crook and it it just seems like people are beginning
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:06.960]  to wake up to the fact that it's not the pundits in washington and the people
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:10.160]  on capitol hill that are going to make life better if it's going to get better
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:14.480]  we've got to roll up our sleeves and do it ourselves and that's encouraging to
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:17.360]  me that the people are starting to feel empowered again
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:21.920]  after decades or even maybe a generation or two of total apathy
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:26.320]  yeah i i agree completely when i was at the the freestate projects liberty form
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.960]  a couple weeks ago and if you guys don't know freestate project
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:32.560]  check out freestateproject.org because they are doing some great stuff
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:36.640]  the idea if those who don't know it is that they want to get as many liberty
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:40.160]  people to new hampshire as they can so that they can
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:44.880]  put pressure to make that one state of a place that's hospitable
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:48.160]  increasingly hospitable to liberty now i grew up in massachusetts which is the
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:52.080]  exact opposite and of course we we spent our time in new hampshire
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:56.400]  buying goods without taxes on yeah you drove over the border here we we
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:59.040]  live near the border we throw rocks at you guys jan they're in tax
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:02.160] achusetts right right i mean of course the real immigration
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:05.680]  problem in america is the border between massachusetts and new hampshire
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.280]  all these stupid idiots in massachusetts have screwed up that state
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.920]  and they want to move to him but anyway so the freestate project is doing
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:15.360]  wonderful things but what i like about it is what i was at their event
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.120]  everybody had a a table talking about the things they're doing
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:21.840]  right now they're not sitting there thinking well you know in four years
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:23.520]  we'll have another election and see what happens
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:26.320]  they're taking things into their own hands right now we're going to try this
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:29.120]  we're going to carve out this area of freedom that area of freedom
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:32.720]  we're going to do jury nullification for example or we're gonna we're gonna
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:36.880]  secede from the federal reserve system by using bitcoins and all this stuff
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:41.040]  this is just fascinated me there are so many young entrepreneurial minds who
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:44.240]  are taking those that clever mind that they have
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:48.480]  and putting it in the service of how can i live free in an unfree world
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:53.200]  so that the the strength of the the smarts of these young people
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:57.760]  going on on display just at this one conference made me think
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:00.960]  you know it the law even though things look pretty grim right now
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:04.880]  maybe in the long term as the federal government sees the wheels coming off
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:07.520]  and it it can't make good on a lot of its promises
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:10.240]  people will be looking for other answers and that's us
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:13.680]  yeah and and i thank you for mentioning bitcoins that was really
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:17.600]  awesome uh... the the conversation was happening about that at the liberty
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.800]  forum and we were out there too with the start page table

[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:02.080]  woods and i say new york times best-selling author
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:05.120]  because uh... i think that's meaningful
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:09.600]  tom woods is not writing your latest thriller novel he is writing some pretty
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:14.880]  hardcore commentary that is going directly in the face of what people are
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:18.000]  being told through the pages of things like the new york times so
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.840]  it's always exciting to see somebody who's really got it got it wired and
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:24.960]  saying it like it is to reach that level
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:28.480]  of prominence in the new york times his books by the way if you haven't read
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:32.080]  them yet the politically incorrect guide to american history
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:36.240]  is uh... it's a great read it's nice short little segments of things that you
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:40.480]  thought you knew but you knew wrong he also wrote the book and you can get
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:43.680]  this one wherever fine books are sold called rollback repealing big
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:46.960]  government before the coming fiscal collapse
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:50.880]  uh... the book meltdown a free market look at why the stock market collapsed
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:53.840]  if you want to understand what exactly went wrong and how we're in this
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:57.920]  financial mess tom woods book meltdown is the place to do it speaking of
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:00.880]  nullification this hour and of course he's got a book called
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:05.840]  nullification how to resist federal tyranny in the 21st century
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:09.840]  and that is a hardcover book all of this available at tom woods
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:13.920]  dot com want to encourage you to check it out phone lines here one eight hundred
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:17.680]  two five nine nine two three one if you have a question for
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:22.400]  our guest tom woods he's an expert on economics and history
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:26.240]  and just generally how to make things a little bit better around here
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:30.640]  so let's see tom before we i get to the phones the the phone calls here can you
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:34.000]  talk to us just briefly about your books and if people could only get one book
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.680]  what one would you recommend
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.160]  all golly yeah that's like one potato chip right how could you possibly
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:44.880]  but it's not well i don't know i mean i i i do like i i have a
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:48.640]  a sort of fondness for the politically incorrect guide to american history
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:52.240]  because that's the one that kind of launched me on to the map before then
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:56.880]  i was writing scholarly books which let's just say one writes scholarly books
[02:35:56.880 --> 02:36:00.640]  for the satisfaction of writing them not for the book sales yeah you got that
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:05.520]  right so we both know right so but yeah the politically
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.440]  incorrect guide to american history uh it's it's a it's a neat little book
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.280]  because it's meant to be sort of modeled after the the complete
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:16.080]  idiots guide or such and such for dummies
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:20.000]  and that that book actually was quite successful and so the publisher decided
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.160]  to do a whole series of books and now they have
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:26.080]  the politically incorrect guide to the constitution and to global warming and
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:29.520]  to all these different subjects that you kind of wish you knew about but you
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.600]  don't have time to read 20 books and so we we try to distill like the best
[02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:36.800]  stuff from the 20 books and and the stuff that's
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:40.160]  politically incorrect or not talked about we stuff it in there so
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:44.320]  maybe you could start there well yeah give us give us the one fact
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:47.280]  that most of our listeners don't know about american history
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:49.920]  that that would probably make our eyebrows shoot up
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:53.760]  oh gosh but this audience knows everything if i were to say no look
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:57.360]  you know andrew jackson helped the economy by getting rid of the second
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:00.160]  bank of the united states people would be yawning of
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:04.400]  of course i know that or if i say that it was actually perfectly legal for the
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:08.000]  southern states to secede from the union they say yeah well sure
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  uh but but then if i if i tell you this about you know today we were talking
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.880]  about nullification and how the states can use it today but
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:18.240]  i think it's a completely forgotten story this is why i was able to write a
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:21.760]  whole book called nullification it's a completely forgotten story how the
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:25.360]  states in through much of american history
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:28.080]  did in fact push back against the federal government and it would know it
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:31.440]  wasn't just the southern states and no it didn't have anything to do with
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:34.720]  slavery that to the contrary i show in case after case
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:38.480]  you have states and governors and legislatures saying no we are not going
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:43.360]  to do this go take a hike in fact um the second half of that book is just
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:47.760]  all documents old documents old speeches old statements
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:51.040]  by people in states all over the country so you don't have to take my word for
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.960]  this was the america we used to have where people didn't just sit back and
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:58.560]  say well i'll wait for the supreme court to dictate to me what my rights are
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.080]  no to the contrary this was a country where people said no no
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:05.520]  no you can't do this and one of my favorite examples comes from
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:09.040]  connecticut like connecticut is like the last place on earth we would look to
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:13.520]  today for leadership on anything but in 1809 the
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.200]  governor of connecticut jonathan trumbull said
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:20.960]  that what was being done to connecticut and new england with the embargo of
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:24.640]  jefferson and then later with madison as well
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:28.480]  this embargo and the searches and seizures were unconstitutional
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:32.400]  and so he was saying that no state official should lend any aid or support
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:35.840]  to this and he said that it falls back to the state
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.840]  legislatures in dangerous cases of usurped power
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:44.480]  to stand between the federal government and their people to protect them
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:48.240]  from the federal government usurping powers that was connecticut
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:50.960]  that was connecticut 200 years ago so i mean in other words even in connecticut
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:56.320]  people used to have guts these stories could be multiplied over and over and
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:59.920]  over and you know how many of these stories people learn in a typical
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:03.040]  american history classroom of course a big fat goose egg
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:06.640]  yeah that's my job is to dig them up and put them in nullification or put them
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:09.360]  in the politically incorrect guide to american history because if you don't
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:12.640]  have the history right you're not going to understand
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.240]  current events or you're not going to know actually what tools you have
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:20.480]  frankly to stand up for yourself well in nullification i think ties in
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:23.840]  directly with rand paul pulling the filibuster
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:27.360]  how many times have we seen a filibuster of any kind of magnitude
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:32.560]  that that did something like what rand paul did bring an issue
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:36.320]  not only to the attention of all the other members of congresses they sat
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:40.720]  there till midnight listening but to to the attention where the media had to
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:44.480]  cover something so we there are these tools out there and it's
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:47.760]  really cool seeing people like rand paul dust them off and get up there and use
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:51.120]  them and see states like south carolina yeah isn't that awesome
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:54.640]  and i would say on top of the service that it did
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:58.480]  from a political point of view it really was a stroke of genius on his part
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:01.840]  because between now and you know two years from now
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:05.040]  he is going to be jockeying for position against all these other people
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:08.480]  like jeb bush and marco rubio and paul ryan
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:12.800]  and ted cruise and all the others and now he just pulled something
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:16.880]  that i don't see how any of them can duplicate so even just from his own
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:21.120]  personal standpoint it it makes sense but i also think from a philosophical
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:24.640]  standpoint now whatever else somebody might say about rand i do think he was
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:29.440]  sincere on this issue and uh... anyway it was it was fantastic that there was
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:33.200]  actually one guy who made the wheels screech to a halt
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:36.720]  for just a half a day that's more than we can say for anybody else
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:41.120]  that's right and and he got this issue of drones being able to kill americans on
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:46.160]  american soil out of the the internal memos and onto the
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:49.600]  national stage where even the wall street journal and the new york times and
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:52.880]  time magazine is going to have to say something about it now
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.400]  so now you've got americans aware of the fact that yeah these drones in the
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:00.480]  skies really do want to kill you and maybe that's not so good so
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:04.080]  i think it's great i think it's part of the same nullification gmo foods all
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:07.200]  the stuff we're talking about where people are realizing we don't have to
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.000]  take this stuff lying down it's it's a good thing and i'm glad we've got
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.920]  people representing us and writing books about this and speaking about it
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:18.480]  and in the state halls of of power and it places like the new hampshire liberty
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:22.240]  forum all right let's go to the phone lines we've got travis listening in
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:25.600]  washington travis you're on with tom woodson catherine albrecht go right
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:26.720]  ahead
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:30.960]  hi um i was just curious i i got a question about sovereignty
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:34.880]  um do you know much about it i mean uh as far as i'm
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:39.040]  as far as i know the constitution was set up to regulate the states
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:42.960]  by washington dc which was a federal entity
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:47.440]  but when it comes down to the people themselves you basically have to claim
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:51.040]  your sovereignty to um assert any
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:55.600]  any dignity or power over um the federal government or the states
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:59.360]  and it goes back to like the articles of confederation
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:03.040]  are you talking about individual sovereignty of ourselves as as
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:06.480]  that's right that's right i'm talking about sovereignty of yourself and let
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:10.000]  let's let's talk about that tom because i know there's been a sort of a sovereign
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.760]  citizen movement that's had various degrees of successes and failures over
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:16.960]  the years do do we as individuals have rights
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:20.160]  over this corrupt system well sure i mean of course
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:24.080]  the whole natural rights tradition going back hundreds of years
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:28.480]  indicates that we we are the fundamental building blocks of the society and
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:31.920]  and anything like states or whatever come come later
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:35.360]  and these are just subsidiary institutions but of course we are the
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.960]  primary units the way the american system works is that
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:42.720]  the peoples of the states are considered to be the sovereigns not the state
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.720]  governments not the federal government the peoples of the states
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.880]  begin with the sovereign powers and then they apportion those powers between the
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:53.520]  states and the federal government so the federal government is not
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:57.440]  in charge uh the state's this the peoples of the states
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:00.800]  divide their powers between those two entities and then when they want to
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:03.360]  recall them they remain the sovereigns at any
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:06.960]  time they want to recall those powers they they can exercise their sovereign
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:10.920]  powers to do so now the governments don't think we have these powers which is
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:12.320]  the roadblock
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:16.200]  but i can i could prove this i mean in chapter four of nullification that's
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:17.920]  what that chapter is all about
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:21.800]  sorry travis encourage you get a copy of the book tom woods dot com is the
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:24.600]  website and uh... he talks about this and more in there
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:29.020]  you know when we start talking about though a are individual rights
[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:33.160]  you only have the rights as far as your actually able to exercise them and
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:36.320]  think about folks who said well in a second there's not a lot requiring us
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:38.280]  to pay income tax for example
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:41.640]  but just try not paying it and you'll wind up in jail
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:46.040]  so eighty eight at what point do the the nullification rights of the states
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:48.200]  for example just taking us up to the state level
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:51.320]  at what point is the federal government just say no i'm sorry state of south
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:53.920]  carolina or state of canada get or wherever
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:57.680]  we're gonna stop on you if you try to exert that right is that happening
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:00.800]  that is true of it and it's conceivable that it could happen we can't rule out
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:03.000]  that possibility
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.480]  it's my view that if you have a great many states working together in concert
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:10.920]  it becomes much more difficult for the federal government to figure out
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:14.280]  exactly how to handle it i mean consider all the states that are defying it
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:17.080]  on various issues involving marijuana
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:21.680]  now so far there has not been considerable pushback on that i mean we've
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:25.240]  got two states that just out now legalized marijuana just now
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:27.320]  you know i mean this is going on and they are
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:30.720]  trying to think of exactly how to deal with it they realize that there's
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:34.000]  you know any issue where congressman tom ten credo
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.600]  and a left-wing hippie both agree
[02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:39.720]  is an issue where the society has changed
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:44.520]  and do we want to expect again expand all our political capital sending tanks
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:45.800]  into colorado
[02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:48.680]  to throw pot smokers in the cages
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:51.560]  i i seems to me they have other things that they want to do
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:55.520]  well i think you you get the critical mass where where they really don't want
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:59.000]  to turn large numbers of us even further against the federal government than than
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:02.480]  we already are the thing is that what they would they want to exert power
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.600]  through through uh... persuading us that they're legitimate
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:11.120]  they don't want to have to exert power through the the expression of brute force
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:15.040]  because that has the unhappy consequence of alerting other people that
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:16.400]  there's something wrong
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:20.040]  they just want us to go to their crummy schools and be propagandized to thinking
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:23.400]  that it's good for us to be kicked around by these people that's the way
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:27.880]  they prefer to rule not not with the iron fist but with the fist in the in the
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:29.100]  in a glove
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:32.480]  yeah and i think that's why their control of the media is is so significant
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:35.200]  as well and why it's so important it shows like the alex joneshow and the
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:36.680]  work that alex is doing
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:40.120]  the work that you you've been doing and i know that you uh... guest host on other
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:42.520]  shows as well you're making the rounds
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:45.960]  i think that's why it's so important that we have our voices out there as
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:48.640]  alternative voices to this mainstream media
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.080]  all right let's go to dennis listening in colorado with a question on
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.640]  nullification dennis you're on with tom woods go ahead
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:58.360]  hi kathryn and tom up
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:00.640]  tom
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:02.400]  okay um...
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:06.720]  yeah i want to give you information about here in colorado
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:08.640]  i worked in the federal government
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:11.920]  here in colorado for twenty years and then
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:14.720]  i thought
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:16.940]  if there's a real movement of people
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:18.480]  uniting to save
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:20.720]  country from
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:24.840]  the uh... budget problem and uh... having to
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:27.700]  borrow forty percent or more of our
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:29.200]  money to pay the
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:30.400]  budget
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:33.120]  uh... so what i did
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:35.560]  was direct i resigned
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:38.600]  before i retired
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:41.920]  and so by resigning
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:43.400]  i didn't
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:47.200]  impact anybody a lot except myself
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:52.040]  i took all my money out of my savings and paid off my house
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:53.320]  and uh...
[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:56.920]  while i'm going with this nullification you'll see in a moment
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:58.360]  uh...
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:01.360]  i paid off all my bills and
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:02.400]  i did so
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:04.480]  within my means
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:07.800]  well i was just trying to set an example and
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:10.920]  i don't know if there's anyone out there that
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:13.960]  wants to sacrifice
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:15.840]  just give a little and
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:17.360]  everyone
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.800]  puts in a little
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:21.280]  uh... patriots will
[02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:24.600]  will bring back the budget if
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:27.200]  they uh...
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:29.600]  and along with the crowd
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:33.160]  well john is this is this more like a personal nullification like you yourself
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:37.640]  just saying i'm not going to participate any longer in the in the system
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:39.520]  why don't want to participate
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:40.360]  and waste
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:42.160]  brought an abuse
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:44.960]  and there's all three of those
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:46.540]  uh... the whistleblower
[02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:49.800]  provisions don't work
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:52.120]  by voicing my
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:53.040]  just now
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:54.600]  by leaving
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:57.440]  and talking about it
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:47:59.360]  basically all i could do
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:03.480]  tell me when i ask you something because one of the things on on my radio show
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:07.200]  and i i do a daily show from four to six p.m. also on the same network that you
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:09.120]  see and genesis network
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:13.560]  i've been talking a lot about uh... the the biblical call to come out of her my
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:17.800]  people you know this um... uh... come out of babel unless you be partakers of
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:18.840]  her sins
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.400]  or receivers of her plagues and i know that you're a uh... you know
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:24.400]  very devout catholic
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:28.280]  and have given a lot of thought to that connection as well between religion and
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:30.400]  you know faith in politics and such
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:33.640]  what do you think about people like john and i don't know who said i i just can't
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:35.960]  participate anymore i'm just going to come out
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:39.720]  does that make the the the machine stronger or weaker when we make those
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:41.020]  choices
[02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:44.520]  well people know about it than it and then it can make it weaker because of
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:45.480]  you know this
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:47.720]  the good example of one person
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:52.080]  is much more powerful than the example of a thousand drones
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:55.360]  uh... and but by drones i don't mean that now we have to clarify
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:58.040]  yeah i don't know if you just go with the flow right
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:01.360]  so that's that's very important but i think we need to follow that council in
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:02.920]  all areas of life
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:03.720]  and so
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:07.360]  you know education is an example and we got to get our kids to the point where
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:10.560]  and this is not easy for every family to do i don't want to make it sound like
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:13.800]  if your kids are in the government schools that your terrible person work
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:17.960]  it's hard i understand that it's hard to get your kids out of that system
[02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:21.000]  but if it's if it's possible
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:24.400]  that is a very important step forward to because it's through the media
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:28.280]  and through education that they get control of the american mind and in
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:29.840]  both of those ways
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:33.560]  there is increasingly a kind of an intellectual secession movement that's
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:36.640]  going on that is the most exciting thing
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:38.720]  that i've seen in my lifetime
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:42.800]  i think that homeschooling is is right on the money and i'm i'm actually banking
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:46.560]  on the future with all these homeschoolers coming up and saying no
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:50.600]  because they're going to be there they're not indoctrinated in in the same
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:52.560]  way that these government school kids are
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:56.200]  and you know i'll i'll keep saying it the work that i do on privacy you don't
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:49:59.280]  have to have a frequent shopper card you don't have to shop at the stores that
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:02.240]  are monitoring your purchases you don't have to be
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:05.800]  uh... a part of all of these systems there are alternatives that's why we
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:07.000]  were talking about you know
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.640]  coriolis mushroom or start page or
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:13.080]  uh... all the things that alex is talking about there's so many ways that
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:15.560]  we can say no to the system
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:20.040]  and just get jettison what they're doing you know if we all just stopped
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:24.280]  buying genetically modified foods and said heck no to nabisco and kellox and
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:28.440]  all those big brands you know overnight you see those guys scrambling to become
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:29.320]  better
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:32.880]  and i think the same is also true with the with the government system as well
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:39.720]  all right tom woods is my guest his website is tom woods dot com nice easy one to remember tom woods dot com
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:44.880]  wanna let you know that he has a liberty classroom speaking about education that i
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:46.560]  would encourage you to check out
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:49.880]  was talking about that at the liberty for me and it looks pretty awesome
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:51:00.880]  rights to change will be right
[02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:03.880]  do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:07.120]  did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:09.720]  as a vapor and as metal particles into your body
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:13.640]  where mercury deposits in your body it stops cells from functioning normally
[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:17.760]  animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by sixty percent
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:21.440]  mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:22.240]  in function
[02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:25.280]  the number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is
[02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:26.280]  glutathione
[02:51:26.280 --> 02:51:29.920]  the number one super food that helps turn on all seventy five trillion cells of
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:34.440]  your body to produce glutathione is non-denatured way protein from grass fed
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:35.400]  cows
[02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:39.800]  after investigating most high-end way proteins on the market only one is the
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:43.640]  most non-denatured the most active the most complete and in our opinion the
[02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:48.920]  most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw way it is one

[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:26.240]  continue to keep up that great relationship, I know Alex is doing such
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:27.360]  good work and
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:31.280]  really am just honored to have been a part of this week of radio.
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:36.280]  Tom Woods, before we wrap up this hour let me let you put in a plug for your
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:39.600]  Liberty classroom and also for some of your books and let people know how they
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:41.680]  can get more Tom Woods.
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:44.760]  Well you know we've been talking about ways that you can
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:48.760]  instead of just waiting for the political people to just hand you
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:52.400]  freedoms you can just do things yourself. There actually are ways
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:55.960]  very liberating ways that you can exercise freedom and help spread it to
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:57.320]  others and so
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:01.120]  I used to be a big complainer I would complain well the university professors
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:03.480]  are filling the kids heads with propaganda
[02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:07.320]  isn't that a shame but well look with the internet I can do something about that
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:09.680]  now I just turn the camera on myself
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:14.520]  and I can teach anybody who wants to listen so duh why am I waiting so long
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:18.760]  so I started website libertyclassroom.com where basically I'm teaching
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:23.120]  US history not in the way where we're supposed to worship the presidents and
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:27.160]  where would we be without presidents so-and-so and all this nonsense but
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:30.040]  with a much more critical eye on these people
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:33.600]  and we've got courses on that on economics on European history
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:36.680]  and they're all courses you just listen to in your car while you're driving
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:40.160]  and then you can ask us questions about them in our discussion forum so I it's
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:43.240]  the most exciting thing I've done it's at libertyclassroom.com
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:46.960]  and I put up a coupon code you can get a discount on it
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.960]  by typing in Alex in all caps like you're shouting
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:54.000]  Alex there we go
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  which you made me do
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  that's what I've been up to yeah that's what I've been up to and then also
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.440]  yeah I mean my books you can find them at tomwoods.com I think you'll like them
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:08.600]  but I'm working on a top secret project right now
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.160]  that basically involves homeschooling I'm putting together a K through 12
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:16.000]  homeschool curriculum for liberty people
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.640]  and it's going to be not just you're gonna learn great stuff but also
[02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:24.520]  we're going to train these students to spread the message so
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:28.000]  they all have to have a youtube channel they all got to start a blog
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  they all have to take public speaking so they're not just gonna have a lot of
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:34.120]  good knowledge in their heads they're going to be conveying this to others
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:37.000]  I'm very... when is this coming out when when can we wait for that?
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.560]  you'll start seeing it this fall you can start to enroll in it this fall in
