[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:38.560]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.560 --> 00:45.020]  It's already Tuesday, the 12th day of February, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones. We're gonna
[00:45.020 --> 00:51.760]  be here for the next three hours as we are, Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 PM Eastern.
[00:51.760 --> 00:57.480]  And then, of course, retransmitted on stations all across the United States, simulcast, Global
[00:57.480 --> 01:06.480]  Shortwave, WWCR, and XM Channel 166. The news websites are prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[01:06.480 --> 01:13.800]  Okay, it's another completely overloaded transmission. I didn't even really talk about the Pope Benedict's
[01:13.800 --> 01:19.560]  announcement that was made Sunday night that he'll resign, the first pope in 600 years
[01:19.560 --> 01:20.560]  to do that.
[01:20.560 --> 01:23.480]  The last time there was a major schism in the church. And whether you're a Christian
[01:23.480 --> 01:27.840]  or a Catholic, if you live on this planet, this is certainly a big deal. I believe it's
[01:27.840 --> 01:35.480]  because of scandals inside and basically data that has been breached inside the Vatican
[01:35.480 --> 01:42.280]  and that there is pressure being put on him to resign. Or that the information is so damaging,
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.320]  the blackmail information, that he's just stepping down in case it all comes out.
[01:47.320 --> 01:54.580]  There are major wars going on within the globalist camp. All of the major denominations of Christianity,
[01:54.580 --> 02:01.800]  the major Muslim leaders led by Saudi Arabia, the Sunnis, they're all pushing world government.
[02:01.800 --> 02:08.360]  Rat Singer, this current pope, while defending the unborn and things like that, which I think
[02:08.360 --> 02:15.440]  are admirable, has said global government, all the nations coming together, new world
[02:15.440 --> 02:17.240]  order pushing EU.
[02:17.240 --> 02:23.480]  So the Vatican is a big political machine that certainly stands to gain from a planetary
[02:23.480 --> 02:28.640]  government. And if you look at the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the Vatican is intimately
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.640]  involved in the establishment of that. And everybody knows I don't get into Jew bashing,
[02:32.640 --> 02:38.480]  Catholic bashing, Protestant bashing, Muslim bashing. But all of these major groups, the
[02:38.480 --> 02:45.580]  leadership in most cases, cuz it changes back and forth, is basically a mafia feeding off
[02:45.580 --> 02:47.560]  of their followers.
[02:47.560 --> 02:53.320]  And that's just a fact. And anything big and institutional tends to get corrupt over time.
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.480]  But we'll open the phones up today on the Dorner situation. And I'll give you updates
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.280]  on after we come back on the economy, how they're totally de-industrializing the US,
[03:03.280 --> 03:09.160]  raising taxes across the board, county, city, federal, fines, fees, regulations on steroids
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.440]  designed to bankrupt us and transfer all the wealth to China, where it's centrally controlled
[03:14.440 --> 03:19.600]  by the global New World Order, neo-robber barons.
[03:19.600 --> 03:24.560]  Neo-robber barons I think best describes these people. And David Icke is joining us. He's
[03:24.560 --> 03:33.020]  hard to get on. But I saw the report put out by the different universities at MIT conferring
[03:33.020 --> 03:37.420]  with the analysis of the German scientist. And there's a lot of other studies that have
[03:37.420 --> 03:38.420]  shown this.
[03:38.420 --> 03:42.800]  In fact, guys, I meant to do a file on this. You just got him so quickly. Will you guys
[03:42.800 --> 03:46.680]  print me some of the major scientific studies? There's been a bunch of them, where they've
[03:46.680 --> 03:57.160]  noticed that when you observe matter, it changes the way it behaves. In fact, not just when
[03:57.160 --> 04:01.520]  an electron microscope is looking at something, that changes the way it behaves.
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.760]  But when a human starts looking at it, even though there's no actual change in matter
[04:06.760 --> 04:12.800]  or no energy that can be seen, that can be measured in the scientific method that's known,
[04:12.800 --> 04:18.840]  going into the matter, suddenly when a human looks at it, and some of the studies show
[04:18.840 --> 04:24.860]  other animals this happens, but not all animals, humans is particularly powerful, the most
[04:24.860 --> 04:26.020]  powerful response.
[04:26.020 --> 04:30.520]  This has been proven, by the way, that the matter then changes the way it behaves when
[04:30.520 --> 04:35.820]  a human consciousness is staring at the other science daily. Quantum theory demonstrated
[04:35.820 --> 04:41.040]  observation affects reality. Print that for me. And so I walked in here today and it was
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.340]  David Icke on the sheet. Usually I'm more informed of things. They just got him so quickly
[04:45.340 --> 04:49.400]  because he's been saying this for, I don't know, 20 years after he had a vision while
[04:49.400 --> 04:53.400]  hiking in the mountains of, what was it, South America.
[04:53.400 --> 05:00.520]  All right, we're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us.
[05:00.520 --> 05:05.200]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[05:05.200 --> 05:09.200]  through the year from natural disasters like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[05:09.200 --> 05:13.440]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[05:13.440 --> 05:17.520]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at E Foods Direct hear from customers every
[05:17.520 --> 05:21.760]  day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny
[05:21.760 --> 05:26.240]  from New York City wrote in following hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores
[05:26.240 --> 05:30.300]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[05:30.300 --> 05:34.420]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early and one day
[05:34.420 --> 05:35.420]  too late.

[08:47.020 --> 08:52.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this 12th day of February 2013 on this
[08:52.300 --> 08:57.820]  Tuesday edition. The one, the only David Icke will be joining us because a lot of major
[08:57.820 --> 09:03.700]  universities and government studies are showing in multi-science disciplines that there are
[09:03.700 --> 09:08.860]  laws to the universe that don't fit into their old scientific models.
[09:08.860 --> 09:13.540]  Gee, you mean the government and the establishment doesn't know everything? We're going to be
[09:13.540 --> 09:19.820]  looking at that today and breaking down these big studies saying that it appears that the
[09:19.820 --> 09:29.780]  universe is a artificially projected system. To use the word computer simulation, as scientists
[09:29.780 --> 09:38.900]  are doing it, that would be like comparing a image of a paper airplane, a one dimensional
[09:38.900 --> 09:45.780]  image of a paper airplane to a Star Destroyer.
[09:45.780 --> 09:50.980]  If that was itself something actualized and built. When the globalists said that they
[09:50.980 --> 09:56.380]  have unlocked the secrets of DNA, they haven't unlocked the secrets of humans or a bingo
[09:56.380 --> 10:04.280]  tiger. They have taken a digital photograph of the DNA. It doesn't mean that they actually
[10:04.280 --> 10:11.200]  understand it. They have a photo of the tiger, a photo of the elephant, a photo of the human,
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.580]  and they are able to manipulate small parts of DNA and RNA in the case of viruses and
[10:16.580 --> 10:17.740]  get a desired effect.
[10:17.740 --> 10:22.340]  But down the road, it always mutates and turns into something completely different, a lot
[10:22.340 --> 10:28.620]  of times with disastrous effects. And that's the real crisis facing humanity and the question
[10:28.620 --> 10:34.020]  of will our civilization survive? Will humanity make it to the next level? The establishment
[10:34.020 --> 10:39.140]  is doing a couple things. They're digging in giant bunkers, armored vehicles, tanks,
[10:39.140 --> 10:43.860]  enough bullets in the US to wage a 30 year war against the American people.
[10:43.860 --> 10:51.940]  While trying to deindustrialize and simultaneously dumb down and sicken the general public, all
[10:51.940 --> 10:58.700]  of that is going on. All of that is unfolding while the establishment races ahead with technological
[10:58.700 --> 11:05.140]  developments that they know are very likely to create the crises that could lead to an
[11:05.140 --> 11:09.180]  extinction level event for humans.
[11:09.180 --> 11:13.780]  While lecturing us all day how our carbon dioxide that is part of the carbon cycle of
[11:13.780 --> 11:18.500]  the planet is so evil and how the flatulence of cows is going to kill us all when there's
[11:18.500 --> 11:24.380]  always been bovine in similar numbers ranging across the plains of the planet engaged in
[11:24.380 --> 11:32.340]  flatulence. So technically, the establishment is schizophrenic, conflicted, and out of control,
[11:32.340 --> 11:38.500]  but they're unified in a program of predatory dumbing the public down, robbing the public,
[11:38.500 --> 11:39.500]  destroying opportunity.
[11:39.500 --> 11:47.740]  The only opportunity they try to provide is funneled in to their power structures and
[11:47.740 --> 11:54.220]  their systems. Yeah, there it is, California EPA warns on cow flatulence. So that's a article
[11:54.220 --> 11:59.500]  out of Fox News from, I don't know, seven, eight years ago back in 2005. They're already
[11:59.500 --> 12:04.060]  regulating it and taxing it in places like Australia, and Canada is also now putting
[12:04.060 --> 12:05.060]  that into place.
[12:05.060 --> 12:09.900]  Okay, enough of that. A lot of things are going on, but I do wanna go to your phone
[12:09.900 --> 12:14.380]  calls ahead of our guests joining us, and then I have open phones as well in the third
[12:14.380 --> 12:22.220]  hour today. But here is some of the news that I have here in front of us. Police warn all
[12:22.220 --> 12:24.620]  black men you could be stopped and questioned.
[12:24.620 --> 12:30.240]  Well, yeah, they stop white guys and then shoot their car up thinking that they're Dorner.
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.500]  It's a total hysteria, drama queen behavior going on in Southern California. Is Christopher
[12:37.500 --> 12:42.540]  Dorner another psychiatric killer? Turns out he was under some type of psychiatric treatment
[12:42.540 --> 12:45.740]  for depression. You know what they subscribe for that?
[12:45.740 --> 12:52.900]  Mass murder, suicide pills known as serotonin reuptake inhibitors and others. LAPD trying
[12:52.900 --> 12:57.980]  to execute Dorner while engaging LA citizens with frenzies shoot to kill gunfire. That's
[12:57.980 --> 13:03.500]  up at infowars.com by Mike Adams of naturalnews.com. School board wants to take copyrights away
[13:03.500 --> 13:06.860]  from students and teachers. I'm gonna be getting more into that today.
[13:06.860 --> 13:10.740]  It's all part of a global trend. We're also gonna get into Bill Gates dodges questions
[13:10.740 --> 13:18.060]  on why he owns 500,000 shares of Monsanto, well, to release our population. Also, software
[13:18.060 --> 13:23.940]  that tracks people on social media created by a defense firm to track and also culture
[13:23.940 --> 13:26.180]  jam and engage in domestic propaganda.
[13:26.180 --> 13:31.620]  That's London Guardian. And we're gonna be getting into obviously Apocalypse Now. The
[13:31.620 --> 13:39.660]  final pope, that is the headline up at infowars.com by Paul Watson. And we don't put this type
[13:39.660 --> 13:45.500]  of news out. The Market Watch, the Wall Street Journal is our article in Paul Watson's video.
[13:45.500 --> 13:53.860]  A special report is concerning prophecy. Is the next pope the last pope? Medieval prophets
[13:53.860 --> 13:58.880]  says only one pontiff remains. So we're gonna be looking at that. The larger issue is why
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.140]  is he the first pope in 600 plus years to step down before dying?
[14:04.140 --> 14:09.300]  Pope John Paul II was the second longest sitting pontiff. And of course had Parkinson's and
[14:09.300 --> 14:16.100]  everything else had been shot up previously and still stayed on. So why is that tradition
[14:16.100 --> 14:25.140]  being broken? Obviously, you've had the internal documents of the Vatican stolen by his valet
[14:25.140 --> 14:28.940]  who's now been pardoned and all the rest of it.
[14:28.940 --> 14:34.340]  There's a battle within the New World Order over control of the Vatican. That is admittedly
[14:34.340 --> 14:38.660]  going on. And I think the evidence is this ties into it. So we're gonna get your take
[14:38.660 --> 14:47.500]  on that as well here today. And there's a lot of other important Dorner news that I've
[14:47.500 --> 14:56.460]  not gotten into yet that I want to also get into a little bit later.
[14:56.460 --> 15:03.300]  But they're thinking that he may have escaped into Mexico cuz they found a boat with a rope
[15:03.300 --> 15:08.940]  tied around the propeller and they think that might have been him. They think he's in the
[15:08.940 --> 15:15.460]  mountains. The images of SWAT teams in full armor marching around in the blizzard is pretty
[15:15.460 --> 15:19.900]  ridiculous. Yeah, it snows in some of those mountains there in California.
[15:19.900 --> 15:27.460]  It's just all ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous to see this type of thing happening. But as
[15:27.460 --> 15:35.380]  I said, we're gonna be getting more into that coming up today. Also in the economy area,
[15:35.380 --> 15:41.000]  McClatchy newspapers are reporting shelters are seeing more elderly homeless, more real
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.820]  people, not mentally ill folks who are real people, but sadly are broken down because
[15:47.820 --> 15:50.180]  of mental problems, not drug addicts.
[15:50.180 --> 15:56.380]  But real families, real old people, folks that have had everything they have taken.
[15:56.380 --> 16:01.040]  And the government will take an old lady's house for unpaid property taxes even though
[16:01.040 --> 16:08.980]  they can't pay them and are broke. They will take your house for unpaid federal and state
[16:08.980 --> 16:11.340]  taxes and they've got actuaries.
[16:11.340 --> 16:17.300]  They know the large portions are not gonna be able to pay. It's designed to wreck everything.
[16:17.300 --> 16:25.680]  The state of Texas now, if you get like three tickets and what is it in two years, you're
[16:25.680 --> 16:29.780]  not even told that when you go ahead and just pay the ticket, they're gonna charge you upwards
[16:29.780 --> 16:31.940]  of $10,000 over the next five years.
[16:31.940 --> 16:37.860]  And it's happened to people I know who get two speeding tickets and suddenly get multi-thousand
[16:37.860 --> 16:42.720]  dollar bills after they've already paid the ticket. And again, none of this is to run
[16:42.720 --> 16:48.700]  the system. It's to wreck the system. The power to tax is the power to destroy. So we're
[16:48.700 --> 16:51.900]  gonna be getting more into that.
[16:51.900 --> 16:59.340]  I have dispatched some of my reporters to video the next hour what is being reported
[16:59.340 --> 17:07.700]  by local news radio 590, our local affiliate, as the biggest procession they've ever seen.
[17:07.700 --> 17:14.020]  And it stretches, it left before sunrise this morning in Dallas, Chris Kyle, the slain Navy
[17:14.020 --> 17:21.580]  CCL reportedly killed at a gun range by someone he brought out there trying to treat for PTSD.
[17:21.580 --> 17:25.900]  Approximately 7,000 people attend memorial service for ex-Navy CCL, Chris Kyle at Cowboy
[17:25.900 --> 17:31.940]  Stadium in Arlington, Texas. And you've got a procession of motorcycle riders, citizens,
[17:31.940 --> 17:33.020]  you name it.
[17:33.020 --> 17:41.300]  It's shutting down the most traveled artery in the entire Midwest and through Texas, probably
[17:41.300 --> 17:50.500]  I-35 is arguably the most busy artery in the country. But security tight for slain sniper
[17:50.500 --> 17:56.580]  Chris Kyle's funeral procession. And it just goes into the security cuz I guess Al Qaeda
[17:56.580 --> 18:01.140]  might try to attack, just absolutely ridiculous.
[18:01.140 --> 18:06.220]  You mean tyranny is tight. Everything is selling the idea of total tyranny, but nevermind that
[18:06.220 --> 18:10.940]  the government could become the larger tyranny. APD releases ex-Navy CCL, Chris Kyle's funeral
[18:10.940 --> 18:17.140]  procession route. And it says the funeral procession for ex-Navy CCL Chief Petty Officer
[18:17.140 --> 18:23.220]  Chris Kyle will travel through Austin today. Iraq war veteran Eddie Ray Roth, 25, has been
[18:23.220 --> 18:27.900]  charged February 2nd killing of Colin's friend Chad Littlefield at the North Texas gun range.
[18:27.900 --> 18:32.780]  Nearly 7,000 people attended Kyle's memorial service at Monday at Cowboy Stadium. Tuesday,
[18:32.780 --> 18:38.740]  the procession will travel down I-35, exit 6th Street, travel east on 7th Street and
[18:38.740 --> 18:42.020]  north on Navasota Street to the Texas State Cemetery.
[18:42.020 --> 18:47.500]  That's the former Civil War cemetery, Confederate cemetery. APD Chief Art Acevedo tweeted Monday
[18:47.500 --> 18:52.700]  that the procession is scheduled to enter the northern city limits between 1130 AM and
[18:52.700 --> 18:59.620]  noon. Yeah, and they're behind, but a little bit afternoons is the info we've got.
[18:59.620 --> 19:03.980]  Also police say the cemetery will be closed to the public during the funeral. Well, obviously
[19:03.980 --> 19:07.700]  can't go visit your family there, they're buried there. Additionally, from 10 AM to
[19:07.700 --> 19:12.660]  2 PM, Navasota and Kamal Streets will be closed between 7th and 11th Streets, the sidewalk
[19:12.660 --> 19:13.660]  on the north side.
[19:13.660 --> 19:18.900]  I'm just going over that to show how out of control this is. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
[19:18.900 --> 19:23.060]  not against somebody getting a funeral procession, okay? And obviously I've interviewed Chris
[19:23.060 --> 19:27.860]  Kyle, I had a chance to talk to him. Jesse Ventura was suing him and winning in court
[19:27.860 --> 19:31.340]  over his claim. He punched him out and then changed his story that it was outside, then
[19:31.340 --> 19:34.880]  turned out Ventura had witnesses, it didn't happen.
[19:34.880 --> 19:39.740]  Kyle didn't, the whole thing's very suspicious. But I'll say this, why not have a funeral
[19:39.740 --> 19:44.340]  procession for all the troops dying of DU exposure? There is no procession, in fact,
[19:44.340 --> 19:50.820]  they won't even send people out to do the gun salute and the rituals. The truth is that
[19:50.820 --> 19:55.620]  more and more they treat the troops like absolute crap, but then they'll have these big giant
[19:55.620 --> 20:00.820]  events to create the illusion that they care.
[20:00.820 --> 20:05.500]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[20:05.500 --> 20:09.480]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[20:09.480 --> 20:13.720]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out

[20:26.520 --> 20:30.580]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[20:30.580 --> 20:34.700]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day

[23:09.780 --> 23:13.920]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the

[24:00.900 --> 24:11.380]  And we are back live. Alex Jones here. Thank you for joining us. David Icke on the nature
[24:11.380 --> 24:15.860]  of reality and all these big scientific reports coming out saying that the universe appears
[24:15.860 --> 24:22.320]  to be a computer simulation. That's their words. It shows a artificial force basically
[24:22.320 --> 24:28.340]  holding it all together, projecting it. That's what David's been saying for 20 years. He's
[24:28.340 --> 24:34.020]  been saying exactly that. So he's going to be joining us in the second hour. Whether
[24:34.020 --> 24:38.060]  you love him or hate him, he's certainly an intriguing individual that will also get his
[24:38.060 --> 24:45.060]  take on the expanded wars, the police state, the bankrupting of the planet, the mass shootings,
[24:45.060 --> 24:46.060]  all of it.
[24:46.060 --> 24:50.020]  Look forward to the discussion with David Icke. I'm going to give the number out right
[24:50.020 --> 24:57.420]  now, free for all, old callers, new callers, first time callers, whatever the case is.
[24:57.420 --> 25:00.340]  I want to get your take on what you think is going on behind the Vatican. There's a
[25:00.340 --> 25:03.780]  lot of theories out there. I'm going to break some of that down with the pub saying you
[25:03.780 --> 25:15.820]  should step down the next two weeks. 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231.
[25:15.820 --> 25:19.740]  Here's some of the other news I'm going to be getting into after we take some of your
[25:19.740 --> 25:26.740]  calls. Federal investigators suspected Dorner fled to Mexico, affidavit shows. Here's another
[25:26.740 --> 25:31.900]  one. Police worried Dorner may be capable of flying a plane. Warning issued to local
[25:31.900 --> 25:39.020]  airports, more government training given to this guy. LAPD crippled by Dorner's search
[25:39.020 --> 25:42.180]  limited in response to other crimes.
[25:42.180 --> 25:46.260]  But the LAPD supports the total abolition of citizens' right to keep and bear arms.
[25:46.260 --> 25:50.900]  They've been on record for at least 20 years, the police chiefs being federal puppets. They
[25:50.900 --> 25:55.700]  want the citizens disarmed just like Chicago and New York City while they run around festooned
[25:55.700 --> 26:02.100]  with weapons. And you've got three people killed, only two of them, police. And you've
[26:02.100 --> 26:05.300]  got cops dying every week in LA in car wrecks, I looked it up.
[26:05.300 --> 26:12.440]  And they are literally shooting up cars, shooting up women, shooting up men, beating people
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.500]  up, just freaking out in a total insane panic. Because more and more police, especially in
[26:18.500 --> 26:24.160]  big departments, are wannabe tough guys. They believe the sitcoms, they believe the dramas,
[26:24.160 --> 26:26.940]  they believe they're the superheroes.
[26:26.940 --> 26:32.500]  When cops get killed in car wrecks now, they'll have giant processions and all the rest of
[26:32.500 --> 26:37.740]  it. What about general citizens? Are we worth anything? And the answer is no, we just pay
[26:37.740 --> 26:42.700]  the paycheck. And again, I'm not even bashing police here. I'm saying what is it with Air
[26:42.700 --> 26:47.100]  Force One and red carpets and the Hollywood stars going to banquets with the politicians
[26:47.100 --> 26:52.620]  and Nancy Pelosi having, when she was Speaker of the House, Air Force Two that cost $10
[26:52.620 --> 26:54.660]  billion per trip or more.
[26:54.660 --> 27:00.100]  I mean, government has become this royal clash while they're reporting record numbers of
[27:00.100 --> 27:05.660]  old people becoming homeless. McClatchy newspapers report shelters seeing more elderly homeless.
[27:05.660 --> 27:11.180]  We're going bankrupt. I mean, if you don't pay your property tax, and I know of so many
[27:11.180 --> 27:15.300]  people who have a little bitty house with a little bitty backyard who are retired, who
[27:15.300 --> 27:18.140]  by the way are veterans, many of them.
[27:18.140 --> 27:21.920]  And the court comes and they take their house, and sometimes they try to squat in the house
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.600]  and a SWAT team comes and says come out with your hands up or we're gonna storm it. And
[27:26.600 --> 27:33.620]  sometimes you see in the news they kill the people inside. They will kill you, kill you
[27:33.620 --> 27:36.260]  cuz you don't really own that property.
[27:36.260 --> 27:41.140]  You pay a rent on it. And they're setting the economy up where it's impossible if you're
[27:41.140 --> 27:45.820]  not a criminal to live. The illegal aliens are above the law, a lot of the government
[27:45.820 --> 27:49.900]  people in California, the police get to run red lights even in their private cars. But
[27:49.900 --> 27:56.180]  so does the entire state employee force that came out years ago in the San Francisco Chronicle
[27:56.180 --> 28:01.740]  that over a million of them license plates cannot be read by license plate reading cameras
[28:01.740 --> 28:04.300]  and red light cameras.
[28:04.300 --> 28:09.480]  When it takes a photo and scans it, it cannot be read. So they run the toll roads, everything.
[28:09.480 --> 28:15.160]  They are God, they are Lord, they are king. This is what our founders went through. We
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.520]  know the police are king in North Korea. We know they're king in Mexico. If you're not
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.780]  cop your little people, to quote Blade Runner, we don't wanna live in a society like that
[28:25.780 --> 28:30.280]  where the cops are above the law because they serve the mafia above them who's really above
[28:30.280 --> 28:32.060]  the law.
[28:32.060 --> 28:36.780]  We don't wanna live in this gang culture. And we're seeing it in Los Angeles. Now, on
[28:36.780 --> 28:40.380]  the other extreme, people are saying good, kill cops. Yeah, kill their kids. I think
[28:40.380 --> 28:46.400]  it's sick. I think it's sick that all over Facebook and Twitter and CBS News and AP report
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.540]  like it's okay. Well, yeah, he might have got fired, it might have been wrong.
[28:50.540 --> 28:58.020]  He saw a cop kick a suspect. And so he killed the review board head's daughter, allegedly,
[28:58.020 --> 29:03.300]  and calls up taunting. I mean, that is so sick that someone kicked someone so you're
[29:03.300 --> 29:07.660]  gonna kill people's daughters. And the general public has never probably been in a fight,
[29:07.660 --> 29:09.280]  never killed anybody for sure.
[29:09.280 --> 29:13.080]  Never seen horrible vows, never seen dead kids in car wrecks. They're all wimpily on
[29:13.080 --> 29:19.340]  their computers going good, good, kill their families. I mean, it is so sick how barbarous
[29:19.340 --> 29:23.320]  we're getting. But what do you expect? The TV says torture's good, secret arrest is good,
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.840]  dehumanize the Arabs, dehumanize the Muslims, glass parking lot them.
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.520]  You don't think that that sick, aggressive, tyrannical military culture isn't gonna come
[29:32.520 --> 29:37.120]  home to roost? And when the Civil War starts, which they're trying to start, I mean, cops,
[29:37.120 --> 29:42.720]  you want something to be afraid of, you better hide out if the Civil War starts. Because
[29:42.720 --> 29:49.720]  you're gonna be an endangered species. We'll be right back, stay with us.

[32:05.540 --> 32:11.240]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[32:11.240 --> 32:16.400]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[32:59.720 --> 33:09.720]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:09.720 --> 33:37.480]  What's happening is we've been dehumanized. We don't have empathy for our friends and
[33:37.480 --> 33:41.560]  family when bad things happen to him. We certainly don't care about the person down the block
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.440]  and the world is so busy and so frantic and so distracted. And we've all seen hundreds
[33:46.440 --> 33:51.960]  of thousands of simulated killings on television and video games in the culture.
[33:51.960 --> 33:59.760]  That people can't differentiate anymore. Between what's real and fantasy, and so the general
[33:59.760 --> 34:05.720]  public by every metric worldwide is becoming more and more decadent. And this is a cycle
[34:05.720 --> 34:11.720]  society has gone through before, but the establishment is aware of human cycles and are on record
[34:11.720 --> 34:19.360]  and triplicate with the sociology, psychology, anthropology. The advertising techniques to
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.600]  guide all of this into a culture where it's really cool to not care about anybody but
[34:24.600 --> 34:25.700]  yourself.
[34:25.700 --> 34:30.580]  It's really cool to not be informed. It's really cool to be into being a failure and
[34:30.580 --> 34:36.880]  a loser and just not caring about anything. And if you do that with a hyper group of eugenicist
[34:36.880 --> 34:43.480]  based control freaks, if you do that, they will eat your lunch. They will run all over
[34:43.480 --> 34:46.200]  you up one side and down the other.
[34:46.200 --> 34:48.880]  Let me mention some of the other headlines I've got here and then I'm gonna go to your
[34:48.880 --> 34:57.120]  phone calls. Gold sellers in Houston must submit to fingerprints and mugshots. And I
[34:57.120 --> 35:02.320]  was down last week at the Piers Morgan interview in Katy outside Houston. And people are like,
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.600]  Alex, you haven't covered this, it's on the local news.
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.520]  And then I just forgot about it. And sure enough, we've got a link to local newscast,
[35:11.520 --> 35:22.080]  you name it, KTRK TV, you name it, where they are openly saying that when you go in, you
[35:22.080 --> 35:26.520]  get a mugshot and you get fingerprints to sell gold because they wanna be able to shut
[35:26.520 --> 35:31.580]  down that commodity as a real currency before they fully implode things.
[35:31.580 --> 35:35.280]  And they're trying to pass similar laws all over the country. The feds are behind this.
[35:35.280 --> 35:40.300]  They've banned cash two years ago in Louisiana and secondhand sales. Everything you'd expect
[35:40.300 --> 35:44.880]  inside a prison is now what's being implemented outside the prison. Everything's being turned
[35:44.880 --> 35:54.600]  into a prison. And they use national security and security as the pretext to be able to
[35:54.600 --> 35:56.480]  take control of everything.
[35:56.480 --> 36:04.860]  In fact, the Austin police are saying no one can come in to the Texas cemetery where people
[36:04.860 --> 36:12.880]  got their families buried, veterans, today because we're burying the Navy SEAL sniper
[36:12.880 --> 36:20.320]  Chris Kyle. And we're gonna shut down all of I-35, this has been going on since 6 AM.
[36:20.320 --> 36:25.560]  So for at least six to seven hours, we're talking traffic back down to 30 miles an hour,
[36:25.560 --> 36:31.320]  they're reporting, on the most busy highway in the United States. And the most busy stretch
[36:31.320 --> 36:40.840]  of it is between Dallas and San Antonio with Austin down on the southern leg of that.
[36:40.840 --> 36:44.800]  And they've got thousands of people on their motorcycles and their cars, whoever wants
[36:44.800 --> 36:50.720]  to join in. And again, the excuse to keep the press out and only have controlled press
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.160]  in is, the security, the terrorists might wanna strike as if terrorists couldn't wait
[36:55.160 --> 36:56.240]  on the side of the highway.
[36:56.240 --> 37:01.340]  And I've seen state employees on the news by the hundreds and the state police and everybody
[37:01.340 --> 37:07.520]  parked along the highway all day just eating sandwiches like it's an outing or something.
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.600]  And that's what they're reporting in California, that they're not responding to burglaries,
[37:11.600 --> 37:16.200]  robberies, hey, they're not writing tickets either. Doesn't matter, you just raise taxes
[37:16.200 --> 37:20.900]  on property taxes. They're just staying in their cars or staying in buildings, shaking
[37:20.900 --> 37:27.520]  in fear because one of their own is allegedly shot five people, killing three of them, two
[37:27.520 --> 37:28.960]  of them cops.
[37:28.960 --> 37:35.400]  LAPD, crippled by Dorner's search, limited response to other crimes, NBC LA, the manhunt
[37:35.400 --> 37:40.760]  for fugitive former LAPD officer and suspected murderer Christopher Dorner, has taken a toll
[37:40.760 --> 37:43.960]  on Southern California police departments. What about a toll on the citizens getting
[37:43.960 --> 37:47.760]  shot by the police or getting beat up or coming up to checkpoints and having guns pointed
[37:47.760 --> 37:48.760]  at them?
[37:48.760 --> 37:53.160]  We don't count, we don't get red carpets, we don't get parades, we're scum, we just
[37:53.160 --> 37:58.460]  pay the taxes. Hundreds of officers are working on the Dorner case, not just responding to
[37:58.460 --> 38:02.740]  every credible sighting, but also protecting at least 50 families connected to the angry
[38:02.740 --> 38:04.440]  manifesto Dorner allegedly wrote.
[38:04.440 --> 38:08.400]  You know, the police say it's not their job to protect you, and it isn't, it's their job
[38:08.400 --> 38:15.040]  to, for the magistrates and for the juries and grand juries to go grab people. My gosh,
[38:15.040 --> 38:22.560]  look at them on I-35 now, looks like they're going three miles an hour. That's them leaving
[38:22.560 --> 38:28.160]  this morning, going five miles an hour, my gosh, they may get here in two or three hours
[38:28.160 --> 38:29.280]  at the rate they are.
[38:29.280 --> 38:36.560]  And people are lining the processions everywhere. Every overpass with giant American flags,
[38:36.560 --> 38:44.840]  man. I wish they had processions for the troops dying and 22 committing suicide a day. I wish
[38:44.840 --> 38:51.280]  they would have processions on every overpass to stop using DU, that's a death sentence.
[38:51.280 --> 38:55.280]  I wish they'd have processions for not making the troops serve four, five, six, seven tours.
[38:55.280 --> 38:58.920]  I wish they'd have processions so that the major insurance companies in 99 wouldn't have
[38:58.920 --> 39:01.520]  done a deal with Clinton to steal the death benefits of the troops.
[39:01.520 --> 39:06.200]  But see, all that would actually care about the troops. When you get into tyrannies, the
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.520]  pageantry of the troops in Rome, you name it, gets crazier and crazier. Because it's
[39:11.520 --> 39:17.560]  about the state being God, the state being the hero, the state shutting down the highway,
[39:17.560 --> 39:19.240]  making a little people wait.
[39:19.240 --> 39:22.360]  The Queen of England, whenever she wants, she owns all the roads in London. Every day
[39:22.360 --> 39:29.120]  they routinely shut down random roads to teach everyone that she owns the roads and has the
[39:29.120 --> 39:35.140]  power. Sometimes she shuts down major rivers for a day and make ships wait just to exercise
[39:35.140 --> 39:40.680]  her power. In fact, I was in London a few years ago getting one of the tours and they
[39:40.680 --> 39:42.080]  said this and I'd read it.
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.880]  But I went and looked it up and found out they were still doing it. I mean, I knew they
[39:44.880 --> 39:49.520]  did it 100 years ago. Not that they, we can't go up this street today, the queen has closed
[39:49.520 --> 39:58.520]  it to exercise her power. That wasn't the term they used, to exercise her right. And
[39:58.520 --> 40:06.080]  see that's all this is, is you'll have police chiefs crying today. Chris Kyle got shot,
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.360]  and very suspiciously by the way, and I'm sad he's dead.
[40:09.360 --> 40:12.960]  And I talked to the guy for 45 minutes once when I was on Open Anthony show, seemed like
[40:12.960 --> 40:20.560]  a nice guy. My issue is, I was very conflicted over the whole thing. Cuz I like Ventura know
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.000]  he's telling the truth and Chris Kyle, was he psyop? Was it somebody dressed up like
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  Ventura?
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.400]  Ventura thinks it might have been. Cuz he has all the witnesses, was there for a commencement.
[40:29.400 --> 40:33.280]  Why on earth would he say something like that? We never talked like that before. Ventura
[40:33.280 --> 40:36.040]  thought I was doing a sick joke when I got a hold of him in Mexico to break the news
[40:36.040 --> 40:37.040]  to him.
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.560]  But the issue is, again, the police are just randomly shooting people's cars that aren't
[40:41.560 --> 40:48.480]  even trucks. Shooting up white people who obviously aren't black, stopping black people.
[40:48.480 --> 40:54.280]  Black women saying if you're black, we're gonna stop you. I mean, it is just crazy.
[40:54.280 --> 40:58.600]  And you'll see cops in LA, the photos where they stand there with the machine guns bugging
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.600]  their eyes out and acting like comic book characters like they're real tough. I mean,
[41:03.600 --> 41:09.480]  it's just not what even soldiers have acted like historically.
[41:09.480 --> 41:14.000]  It's like a nation of little kids playing superhero. And that's what Dorner, if you
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.880]  look at his psychology, was doing. But I mean, I remember two years ago they announced in
[41:18.880 --> 41:26.280]  Oakland, they weren't gonna respond to 35 crimes, including home invasion, robberies,
[41:26.280 --> 41:27.360]  you name it.
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.280]  But they're gonna be there writing you tickets. See, the government has never been there to
[41:32.280 --> 41:37.040]  protect you. It's there to be sent out by our juries and our grand juries to grab the
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.840]  criminals and bring them to us who are in charge, the juries. So the citizens will sit
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.200]  cuz we are the people, we are the government, we are the sovereign, we're on top of the
[41:47.200 --> 41:48.200]  government.
[41:48.200 --> 41:51.120]  They've now moved it back where it's always been throughout history, taking us back thousands
[41:51.120 --> 41:56.760]  of years. From the leap forward with 1776, they've taken us back to government on top
[41:56.760 --> 42:03.080]  with the badges and the crowns, the fancy hats, the plumes, the red carpets, the helicopters,
[42:03.080 --> 42:05.920]  the jets flying over.
[42:05.920 --> 42:15.000]  And again, like cheese to a rat, they glorify troops, glorify police, glorify the culture
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.600]  so that people that want status and wanna be superheroes imprinted by Hollywood. This
[42:20.600 --> 42:24.840]  is all on record by the psych warfare chiefs, they brag about it. We'll go enlist in the
[42:24.840 --> 42:34.800]  military, go enlist in the police to be these superheroes, to be these supermen, to become
[42:34.800 --> 42:36.880]  better than the general public.
[42:36.880 --> 42:40.040]  And then they're taught you are better than the general public. The general public are
[42:40.040 --> 42:44.280]  dumb and we're here to basically tell them what to do and then now it's not even that.
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.460]  The general public are the enemy. They're out to kill us and we're here to basically
[42:48.460 --> 42:53.640]  feed off of them. Now, not all police have converted to this and not all departments,
[42:53.640 --> 42:55.440]  but this is what they're trying to convert to.
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.320]  So gold sellers in Houston must submit to fingerprints and mugshots. Ron Paul files
[43:00.320 --> 43:06.640]  complaint with UN agency in fight over namesake website. And Fox News and others are criticizing
[43:06.640 --> 43:12.900]  Ron Paul going, you went to the UN to get your name RonPaul.com.
[43:12.900 --> 43:20.720]  That'd be like if somebody not named Alex Jones had my name and was operating and acting
[43:20.720 --> 43:24.000]  like they were me. And I'm not attacking the site that did it, I don't know them, that's
[43:24.000 --> 43:31.200]  not my issue. My point is, is that the UN has taken control of the Internet. Our government,
[43:31.200 --> 43:34.640]  the American people, our science created it along with British and German scientists,
[43:34.640 --> 43:37.280]  if you really wanna look into it, with some French scientists as well.
[43:37.280 --> 43:42.280]  But the US funded it through DARPA in the 60s, 70s, 80s, went live in the late 80s toward
[43:42.280 --> 43:46.160]  the general public could use it. The history of the Internet's there, Al Gore didn't create
[43:46.160 --> 43:51.800]  it in 1991, like he said, another one of his giant lies. I forgot, he's government, he
[43:51.800 --> 43:54.680]  can't lie, I'm a conspiracy theorist, I can't question a known liar.
[43:54.680 --> 43:58.600]  Okay, he invented it. Anyways, when Al Gore invented the Internet, I'm being sarcastic,
[43:58.600 --> 44:05.900]  when Al Gore said he invented the Internet, it was transferred from a private corporate
[44:05.900 --> 44:10.120]  system with the IPs. Now it's being fully transferred over to the UN, who says they
[44:10.120 --> 44:15.680]  wanna censor it, regulate it, and control it.
[44:15.680 --> 44:22.360]  And so Ron Paul has this website that he wants to now have his website and his TV show and
[44:22.360 --> 44:28.040]  his film and his books and his magazine, it's all coming out. Okay, I can tell you that
[44:28.040 --> 44:31.420]  now. It's not official yet, but you're gonna see a bunch of stuff announced in the next
[44:31.420 --> 44:32.420]  couple weeks.
[44:32.420 --> 44:36.900]  By the way, let's line Ron Paul up, say for his big media launch, we want him to launch
[44:36.900 --> 44:40.360]  part of it here. So let's try to get Ron Paul on it, it'll be two weeks, it'll be a month
[44:40.360 --> 44:48.500]  out, they need to get their website first, okay? And so he's got to go to who has it.
[44:48.500 --> 44:53.380]  It's like they say, Ron Paul votes against earmarks, but then takes them. Well, yeah,
[44:53.380 --> 44:58.100]  if the money, he votes against the federal money and doing it and votes to cut taxes,
[44:58.100 --> 45:04.040]  but then once the money's already there, then he has it deployed to his district.
[45:04.040 --> 45:07.740]  And they call it a hypocritical, that's a hypocritical. If the UN runs the Internet
[45:07.740 --> 45:12.520]  now, and that's where you've got to go to get it back, he criticizes that and says that
[45:12.520 --> 45:17.000]  shouldn't be the case, but that's where he has to go to get his thing back. I mean, people
[45:17.000 --> 45:23.060]  got Madonna's name, people have gotten so many other people's names and even acted like
[45:23.060 --> 45:24.460]  they're them.
[45:24.460 --> 45:29.440]  And you know what? There's a guy in Ireland who's a realtor who has the website Alex Jones
[45:29.440 --> 45:33.960]  last time I checked. I never tried to take it away from him. He had it before I was even
[45:33.960 --> 45:39.920]  had a website. He had it like in 96, I got my website in 97. And I think I offered to
[45:39.920 --> 45:42.360]  buy it once and didn't even get a response back.
[45:42.360 --> 45:45.700]  But the point is, is that I'm not gonna go to the UN and try to take it. And I probably
[45:45.700 --> 45:50.520]  wouldn't be able to anyways because it's set up on the old US system and it's very fair.
[45:50.520 --> 45:54.620]  The UN wants to get rid of that and say if you're not using a site properly for what
[45:54.620 --> 45:56.820]  they believe, it's taken from you.
[45:56.820 --> 46:00.020]  So see, all right, I've already digressed. I said I'd go to your phone calls. That's
[46:00.020 --> 46:06.920]  some of what we're going to be covering today. David Icke is coming up. TSA, naked x-ray
[46:06.920 --> 46:11.260]  scanners to be used in office buildings. LAPD is getting them. They're already being used
[46:11.260 --> 46:13.260]  in New York without a warrant.
[46:13.260 --> 46:17.940]  They frisk you and then force you into one. I mean, just beyond North Korea. Man sues
[46:17.940 --> 46:23.420]  TSA for $5 million following peanut butter arrest. That's up at drugsreport.com. Over
[46:23.420 --> 46:29.220]  on the left-hand side column, 24 hours in a shell for joking about sandwich spread.
[46:29.220 --> 46:34.460]  That's a prisonplanet.com article. Let's go to Paul in Washington. Paul, thanks for holding
[46:34.460 --> 46:35.460]  you on the air.
[46:35.460 --> 46:39.820]  How you doing, Alex? It's a real pleasure to talk to you on the phone. And you did wake
[46:39.820 --> 46:44.020]  me up and I know you hate hearing it, but I'm gonna say thank you like everybody else.
[46:44.020 --> 46:51.500]  You did wake me up and plenty of others. Prison Planet TV subscriber and I get the newsletter.
[46:51.500 --> 47:04.980]  So that being said, as far as David Icke goes, I think you owe him an apology. And it's kind
[47:04.980 --> 47:12.340]  of like when you understand what you're talking about, it's an awakening and it's the same
[47:12.340 --> 47:16.420]  thing with David Icke. And I don't think that you've given him a necessarily a fair shake
[47:16.420 --> 47:23.980]  in that regard. You sort of sound condescending sometimes to him and it's amplified over the
[47:23.980 --> 47:24.980]  air.
[47:24.980 --> 47:33.260]  Well, I disagree with you and I think that's how you're perceiving it. And I appreciate
[47:33.260 --> 47:40.940]  your call. About 13 years ago, I was in a World of Wonder, British Channel 4 and also
[47:40.940 --> 47:47.780]  aired here in the US on cable show Secret Rulers of the World. And they took one clip
[47:47.780 --> 47:52.300]  of me saying David Icke is a turd in the punch bowl because all the stuff he says can be
[47:52.300 --> 47:54.860]  documented except for the last three or 4%.
[47:54.860 --> 47:57.860]  And so I said I disagree with that, but that was out of context. I went on to say but he
[47:57.860 --> 48:03.100]  gets people thinking, I think that's positive. The Jesse Ventura show edited asked me about
[48:03.100 --> 48:08.220]  that. I said it, left it in kind of like I said that by itself again. So it's kind of
[48:08.220 --> 48:12.380]  a distraction and a diversion.
[48:12.380 --> 48:16.860]  I don't just believe the scientific reports by the way saying it's a simulation. That's
[48:16.860 --> 48:20.540]  their way of saying a computer simulation. That's their way of perceiving it. They see
[48:20.540 --> 48:25.060]  a force ordering it. I mean, they're seeing the plumbing in this thing. It's like walking
[48:25.060 --> 48:33.060]  up to a 2013 Corvette with all the biggest engine and everything and saying, I think
[48:33.060 --> 48:35.180]  this just appeared in a parking lot.
[48:35.180 --> 48:40.140]  Now obviously an intelligent designs behind it. They're seeing the plumbing now. And David
[48:40.140 --> 48:45.020]  has always described the universe as a computer hologram simulation. And so I'm getting him
[48:45.020 --> 48:49.700]  on even though he's a controversial figure to say, well, what do you think about this?
[48:49.700 --> 48:54.380]  This adds more credence. I don't know how that then elicits kind of in condescending.
[48:54.380 --> 48:58.900]  When I say whether you love him or hate him, he's always thought provoking. It's not like
[48:58.900 --> 49:03.580]  he's God or something. I mean, I'm saying whether you love him or hate him, it's gonna
[49:03.580 --> 49:10.300]  be interesting. See, I don't think that's, whether you love or hate Alex Jones, I cover
[49:10.300 --> 49:11.300]  some interesting things.
[49:11.300 --> 49:14.780]  I mean, I say whether you love me or hate me, government's too big, tyranny's growing,
[49:14.780 --> 49:19.900]  we're in trouble, decadence is out of control. And see, you said, you called it and thanked
[49:19.900 --> 49:24.260]  me. I just don't wanna be thanked anymore because I've heard it about a trillion times
[49:24.260 --> 49:28.740]  and I wanna thank you for being involved and listening.
[49:28.740 --> 49:33.820]  And it's frustrating cuz I have all these hopes and dreams that I can't even articulate
[49:33.820 --> 49:40.100]  properly. So I'm a very frustrated person. So people thanking me, it's almost like, I
[49:40.100 --> 49:45.180]  want you to thank me when we start arresting globalist. All right, let's go to Tyler in
[49:45.180 --> 49:46.740]  Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[49:46.740 --> 49:47.740]  Hey, Alex.
[49:47.740 --> 49:48.740]  Hey, buddy.
[49:48.740 --> 49:57.020]  I was just wanting to take a moment. Man, the stuff that you talk about with the psychotropics
[49:57.020 --> 50:02.980]  and everything, I honestly don't think people understand the severity of it. I mean, me,
[50:02.980 --> 50:08.220]  whenever I was younger, I could personally say that I've been on the psychotropics. I've
[50:08.220 --> 50:16.180]  been on Zoloft, Abilify, Adderall. And back whenever I was younger, the key to a hyperactive
[50:16.180 --> 50:21.820]  child to get them to calm down was, hey, put them on Adderall. No testing, the school counselor
[50:21.820 --> 50:28.720]  could put you on Adderall. And once you take that stuff and everything, because you're
[50:28.720 --> 50:32.180]  basically forced to take it because of this-
[50:32.180 --> 50:35.340]  Stay there, I want to talk to you when we come back and have you elaborate on what you're
[50:35.340 --> 50:38.380]  talking about here. And we'll do this next segment, the next, and David Icke joins us.
[50:38.380 --> 50:47.540]  But you're absolutely right. Look, I was a student aide my last year in high school.
[50:47.540 --> 50:54.220]  I think it was two periods a day because I'd finished all my other work. And all I watched
[50:54.220 --> 51:00.780]  was the school nurse put people on amphetamines.

[52:06.620 --> 52:11.620]  Pastor Jenny. For 25 years, I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.
[52:11.620 --> 52:17.340]  But in 2010, I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions
[52:17.340 --> 52:22.000]  of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.120]  I learned by taking RNA drops, I can begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve
[52:27.120 --> 52:31.420]  the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a
[52:31.420 --> 52:37.280]  free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.

[54:25.260 --> 54:29.820]  the New World Order where he thinks it's all going. By the way, they've got motorcycle
[54:29.820 --> 54:33.660]  riders with the Patriot Guard or whatever they're called wrecking.
[54:33.660 --> 54:40.940]  You've got other accidents with I-35 shut down for Chris Kyle. Maybe they should permanently
[54:40.940 --> 54:48.820]  shut down I-35 just to respect him. I mean, just put pylons out there, shut it down. Maybe
[54:48.820 --> 54:54.180]  everyone on earth should commit suicide as a sign of respect cuz it's government. And
[54:54.180 --> 54:57.460]  again, it's all about this drama queen society.
[54:57.460 --> 55:02.860]  It's bigger and crazier and wilder. And now the police won't come out on the street in
[55:02.860 --> 55:08.620]  LA shaking in fear. And it's just government is going completely insane. While they treat
[55:08.620 --> 55:14.220]  the troops the worst they've ever treated them in modern history. Amazing. I wanna go
[55:14.220 --> 55:18.820]  back to your phone calls here. We were talking to Tyler in Oklahoma. I don't know how old
[55:18.820 --> 55:19.820]  he is, but he sounds young.
[55:19.820 --> 55:25.940]  But he's saying in public school, this is what I experienced 20 something years ago.
[55:25.940 --> 55:30.900]  Was the school nurse in between telling me how handsome I was going, don't you wanna
[55:30.900 --> 55:36.100]  go on these types of drugs? It's like speed, don't you like drugs? And I said, no, I work
[55:36.100 --> 55:40.340]  out two hours a day. Do I look like I do drugs? And she was there part of the school just
[55:40.340 --> 55:42.620]  pushing people going there with a cold.
[55:42.620 --> 55:47.300]  She go, hey, here's the doctor's card. You wanna go on drugs? I take it. Gets you really
[55:47.300 --> 55:55.380]  high speed. And I would just sit there and watch this as I was in the office, running
[55:55.380 --> 55:59.760]  notes and stuff, coming back watching. And that's just what America is. So yes, the New
[55:59.760 --> 56:06.220]  Freedom Initiative, there's a big British study just came out two days ago, one on Sunday.
[56:06.220 --> 56:10.180]  I saw Paul Watson covering on the nightly news last night, it was in the London Guardian.
[56:10.180 --> 56:15.180]  Where they're pushing drugs on little kids when nothing's even wrong with them, as if
[56:15.180 --> 56:19.660]  the drugs help you anyways. And it's the same thing here, the New Freedom Initiative.
[56:19.660 --> 56:25.120]  That's how crazy it is. The whole Prozac class, the whole speed class, absolutely screwing
[56:25.120 --> 56:30.420]  them up. And are we gonna have a funeral procession for the kids that have heart attacks on Adderall
[56:30.420 --> 56:33.060]  and Ritalin and stuff, which they do?
[56:33.060 --> 56:38.320]  No, you see government and the media decides when something's important. They decide when
[56:38.320 --> 56:46.220]  something needs to be seen, they decide, they decide. And it's about the control of reality
[56:46.220 --> 56:51.260]  while they steal the death benefits of the tribes, while the IRS takes their houses.
[56:51.260 --> 56:55.180]  Every day I see articles where they're taking veterans' houses, and while they're ruining
[56:55.180 --> 56:59.380]  their lives, and while they're doing all this, and while they fight for the New World Order.
[56:59.380 --> 57:08.700]  Hey, we're having a big procession. And then shutting down public places, a giant cemetery,
[57:08.700 --> 57:14.540]  a big, huge public cemetery where people are publicly buried. Because well, a god is being
[57:14.540 --> 57:16.280]  buried.
[57:16.280 --> 57:21.620]  And people just lining the streets everywhere to see the hero. And again, if you ask them
[57:21.620 --> 57:25.300]  to lie on the street to see some guy dying of DU poisoning, no, I don't wanna hear about
[57:25.300 --> 57:29.860]  that. They just come out because now it's okay to be patriotic. Now we say it's okay.
[57:29.860 --> 57:34.660]  Go ahead and finish your point about public school, Tyler. What were you witnessing?
[57:34.660 --> 57:42.860]  Man, whenever I was in school, the nurses, the number one solution, if a kid were hyperactive,
[57:42.860 --> 57:48.980]  number one solution, put them on Ritalin. And if Ritalin didn't work, if Ritalin didn't
[57:48.980 --> 57:55.580]  calm them down enough, they were, or Adderall, they had Ritalin. And Ritalin, anybody who's
[57:55.580 --> 58:00.940]  ever been on it knows that you have to do blood tests and everything like that to make
[58:00.940 --> 58:01.940]  sure-
[58:01.940 --> 58:06.180]  Yeah, no, no, no. CPS workers just say your child is mentally ill, cuz they're crying
[58:06.180 --> 58:10.420]  for mommy. We're gonna put you on anti-psychotic, so you drool in the corner. When the two-year-old
[58:10.420 --> 58:14.500]  cries cuz they've been taken from mommy for no reason, they put them on drugs where their
[58:14.500 --> 58:15.500]  teeth fall out.
[58:15.500 --> 58:19.640]  I mean, I've shown photos of kids that have been in foster care one month, their teeth
[58:19.640 --> 58:23.660]  fall out. I mean, there's zombies out of, and it's like, so what? We got a parade to
[58:23.660 --> 58:29.060]  go to, man. The Founding Fathers is on, demonizing gun owners, that's patriotic to get those
[58:29.060 --> 58:36.540]  gun owners. Totally sick. All right, Jim, and DC, and others, your calls are coming
[58:36.540 --> 58:43.300]  up, and then David Icke joins us.
[58:43.300 --> 58:52.700]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:21.780]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:35.820]  All right, I'm going to take a few more calls right now on this Tuesday edition, and then
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:41.300]  David Ochs joining us for the balance of the hour. More and more major scientific institutions
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:46.820]  are coming out and saying the universe appears to be artificially created, and that there's
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:52.140]  some type of unseen force ordering it all, what they call a computer simulation. Obviously,
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.540]  it's far beyond that.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:59.540]  Cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation. Wired magazine.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:03.540]  That's all coming up with David Ochs. He's been saying that for, I don't know, about
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.220]  22 years. Very interesting. We'll also get his take on the mass shootings, the whole
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:11.300]  New World Order action, and where all that's going, the latest on Jimmy Savelle. We're
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.980]  going to move quick with David Ochs coming up.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.260]  All right, now let's go to Jim in California. Incident in a gun range he wants to talk about.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.260]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:24.420]  Hey, Alex. How's it going? This is Jim. Yeah, me and my buddy, we shoot at this gun range
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:32.340]  out here in San Mateo, California. And I've shot there many times. And recently we won.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:39.860]  I took a bolt action 308 and a 22 AR-15. My buddy brought his AR-15. And we've never had
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:45.300]  an incident in the past. No questions asked. What are you shooting? I got this or I got
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:51.580]  that. No problem. Here's your tag. Go out to your lane. And this time, when we went
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:57.620]  out there, the guy, his eyes kind of bugged out. And he said, well, what are you shooting
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:03.740]  a 308 and an AR-15 and a 22 caliber AR-15? Well, he called another range guy over there.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.820]  We've got to inspect. And I said, inspect for what? He said, well, we've got to make
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:13.020]  sure you've got a bullet button and no high cap mags. And I said, well, of course we don't
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:18.740]  have that. He said, this is California. Everything's legal here. We still have to check. It's the
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:25.740]  new rule. And so anyways, long story short, the whole time there, these guys are pecking
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:31.140]  around us, just kind of like we're criminals. They're just walking around. And my little
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:37.700]  22, he doesn't have a hold open catch. So unless you have the magazine in it, of course
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.340]  they wouldn't allow me to keep the magazine in to have the bolt back.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:46.660]  No, no, what's happening is they're telling gun shops and gun ranges, demonize the second
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:51.260]  amendment, do what we say outside of law. They're telling gun shops, don't sell semi-auto
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:57.060]  even where it's legal and just getting them to comply. That's the admitted plan that the
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:02.220]  establishment has put out. So how did it end? Well, you know, finally I told the guy, I
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:06.900]  said, hey, listen, I said, you saw me, you saw me make the rifle clear. I said, the other
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.900]  guy did.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.980]  I said, it's up on the rack. I haven't even touched it yet. I'm shooting my bolt action.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.740]  You know, I said, you want me to put it away or something? I mean, what is, I mean, you
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.340]  know, you're walking around us. I'm trying to shoot here. I'm trying to spot my, you
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:26.020]  know, side of my scope. I said, oh no, no problem. But you know, the whole time there's
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:31.500]  a lot of pressure and I noticed a lot of people weren't shooting any semi-autos, which is
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500]  strange.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:37.220]  So no, see, it's mental illness. That's why they're creating a psychological obsession
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:42.580]  with black guns and with AR-15s. And a lot of people are scared. They don't want to lose
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.540]  their business. And that's why they're going to lose everything. They're going to keep
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.620]  complying, complying, complying until it's all shut down.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:53.700]  And then you can go twice a year where your guns are held in lockers, where police, you
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:58.180]  have to pay thousands of dollars a month to be able to do it, watch you shoot, henpeck
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.260]  you the whole time and your guns are kept there. And they've already proposed it and
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:07.500]  they will do it. Listen, this is a nation of worshipping government now. It was a nation
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:12.820]  of hating government and loving liberty. Now it's a nation of worshipping government. It's
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:17.920]  not patriotism when people go out to a military parade on average in gravel.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:25.700]  It is about worshipping the fraud, the lie, the, so how did this end?
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.980]  Well, they eventually kind of left me alone, but I noticed that there wasn't anybody else
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:35.220]  shooting any ARs out there. Of course, I haven't been out there in a while. So maybe these
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.580]  guys caught on early on and figured they didn't want to be harassed either. So they just brought
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:43.820]  their pulse actions out there. But I encourage people in the area, you know, bring your ARs
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.940]  out there, shoot, you know, don't let these people hold it back.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.620]  Absolutely. That's why it's so beautiful when people open carry because they want to act
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.120]  like guns are already illegal. And the fact that we've been on the offense carrying guns
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.940]  openly is really freaking them out. It's a battle. They can get the guns, they can get
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.160]  them all.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:06.340]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,

[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:08.340]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:13.680]  at info wars dot com. And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:19.620]  just so chillingly convincing. And that's dreams from my real father by Joel Gilbert
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:25.220]  available at info wars dot com. This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing

[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:35.580]  network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we are back
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:43.220]  live. Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday, the 12th day of February 2013
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.220]  transmission.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:50.180]  And for the balance of this hour, we're going to have a former Green Party head, former
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:56.100]  BBC newscaster, sportscaster, former champion goalie, and best selling author David Ike
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:02.040]  on with us. And we're gonna get into the mass shootings and his take on that. The government
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.500]  openly using Al-Qaeda to attack Libya and Syria where that's going.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:13.180]  What he makes of the pope announcing he's gonna step down, those internal battles going
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:19.200]  on there. The latest on the Jimmy Savelle story tied in the British royal family and
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:26.920]  reports of pedophilia, aka like Penn State. All of that is going to be coming up with
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:31.760]  our guest today to get his take on things. But if you punch this up for TV viewers, radio
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.020]  listeners can just go to infoawars.com, and we have all this linked.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:43.100]  Wired magazine cosmic rays offer clue to our universe could be a computer simulation and
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:48.200]  recent measurements of cosmic ray particles are correct. Then we may have the first evidence
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.980]  of the universe as we know it is really a giant computer simulation. Humans have explored
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.160]  the laws of our universe for many years.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.380]  And it's not uncommon to hear people talk about how amazing it is that certain fundamental
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:02.500]  values are just right for life to exist. Some people have wondered if that's because the
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.340]  whole universe is actually some kind of sandbox simulation. We're merely characters in some
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:13.420]  cosmic game of Sims. If that's true, then there should be a point at which we can bump
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.620]  up against the edges of the simulator like Jim Carrey's character escaping from the Truman
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.620]  show.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:23.520]  And now a team of physicists think that a particular measurement of some cosmic ray
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:29.500]  particles might be the first such indication of those edges. The idea that we might be
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.260]  living in an artificial reality constructed by something higher than ourselves has been
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:39.860]  a recurring philosophical hypothesis for centuries, Plato's allegory of the cave. And it just
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:47.580]  goes on breaking down the other people theorizing on a brain vat.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:55.420]  These are all variants, the matrix and the red pill. Well, now German scientists have
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:59.220]  done a big in-depth study. We're gonna be giving you more details of and breaking down
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:03.500]  and are finding this. But other scientists are actually finding it when they look at
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:11.500]  black holes, when they observe things, when they have a computer observe something.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.340]  It doesn't change the equation when a human starts observing it. It changes what's happening
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:20.780]  with the matter. And I've got some of those studies, I'll show a document cam here for
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:25.860]  viewers. Again, if you're a radio listener, just go to info-wash-news.com to watch or
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.980]  present planet.tv, we'll get you there.
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:33.060]  We are living inside a computer simulation. Again, that's the headline out of discovery.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.020]  How to tell whether we're living in a computer simulation, that's out of slate. Do we live
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:46.700]  in a computer simulation, washington.edu? UW researchers say the idea can be tested.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.360]  And it just goes on from there with the researchers at the University of Washington conferring
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.900]  with the university in Bonn, Germany. We got John Rappaport at info-wash.com. Are we all
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.100]  living inside a virtual simulation? We are all artists made in the image of the creator,
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.760]  the great artist.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:10.540]  And again, I personally think this adds to spiritual understanding, doesn't take away
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:18.660]  from it. The atheist say that the only thing that exists is what they can see in their
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:23.900]  narrow two slash three dimensional system. Even though the science all shows higher dimensions,
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:31.380]  the mathematics, the equations of top people, of course, throughout the last 100 years,
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:36.320]  the mechanics physicists like Einstein and others.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.740]  So many of them who were a theist look at the research, look at the evidence, the geneticist
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:45.220]  and say something made this and believe in a higher power. Now again, when the scientists
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:50.260]  say it looks like a computer simulation, there's a lattice holding it together, conforming
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:57.020]  it artificially, that doesn't mean there isn't a God or a master creator. That adds to that.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:02.100]  Okay, some people are saying, you're trying to tear down religion. Well, religion is,
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:08.360]  the way it's set up, as Christ said, are these establishment systems, the Pharisees, others
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.940]  trying to put themselves up as God and you've got to go through them instead of getting
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:14.940]  directly to God.
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.580]  And this is not a religious show. My point is, we know there's a much wider universe
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:26.260]  going on and universes stacked on top of universes and 600 plus billion galaxies photographed
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:31.020]  by Hubble alone, which is the equivalent of a toy telescope with what we're going to have
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.660]  soon, is limitless.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:39.100]  But we can interface with it. We can imagine it. What we imagine, we've proven we can end
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:45.360]  up building. And it shows that we are made in the image of the creator. We are creators
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:51.300]  and the system does everything it can to limit that. And that's what David Eich's been saying
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:56.200]  for 20 plus years. He said the universe is a computer projection hologram.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.100]  He's written it in more than 10 books. I've read many of them. And they're using the same
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:06.300]  terms David is now using. Obviously, they're telling us about this now. They've known for
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:12.220]  a long time. But David, I wanted to get you on because this just adds more credence to
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.220]  what you've been saying.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:18.900]  You've heard my introduction to this. And we're gonna break more of the actuals, not
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:23.700]  just this German university, but others confirming this and what this really means. David Eich,
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.700]  thank you for joining us.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:32.940]  Hello, Alex. Yeah, it's quite surreal for me, actually, in the last six months or so,
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:41.420]  to look at all the things that I've been ridiculed for, dismissed for, including by the much
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:48.180]  of the alternative media. Yeah, David Eich's a crazy madman and he's a diversion and he's
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:53.460]  just pushing people away in the wrong direction. He's a disinformer and all that stuff. And
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:15:01.540]  now it's beginning to come out because, and I hope that this is something that people
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:06.900]  will remember when they're worried about what people think of them, and whether they should
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:11.620]  speak their truth, knowing they're going to get laughed at or dismissed, or whether they
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:17.580]  should keep their head down and just be good little slaves and good little conformers.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:22.300]  But if you keep speaking your truth, if it has any validity, it will eventually be shown
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:29.340]  to be so. And I would start like this, Alex, what we've got to appreciate, to understand
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:32.740]  the conspiracy because this is where the conspiracy is coming from. The people at the core of
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:38.260]  the core of the core, they understand this and therefore they want to keep this awareness
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:42.700]  of the reality that we're actually experiencing from the global population. Because if we
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:49.780]  don't know and they do, they are in a fantastic position of manipulating our perception. And
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:16:00.780]  that's what it is. Whether it's setting up fake crazy people going with guns to take
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:09.700]  away and disarm Americans, what is that? That is a manipulation of perception of the population.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:15.220]  Which are dangerous and all that stuff. To hide the real reality, which is just a scam
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:22.540]  to disarm America. So all these bloody people in uniform with fantastic levels of military
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:27.500]  hardware and weaponry now and what we call policemen, laughingly, around America, can
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:32.940]  then take over the population without any problem whatsoever. It's all about perception,
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:40.300]  but there is this massive, it's multi-layered, but there is this massive manipulation of
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:46.620]  perception which is reality itself. And I think what we need to first of all start at
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:53.540]  is what is the universe as we perceive it? It is information. The universe is information
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:17:01.620]  and decoding information. And if you take the analogy of a computer, when you put information
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:10.900]  into a computer in the way of a disk or data stick, what you're putting in there are not
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:18.380]  pictures and graphics and texts coming up on the screen. They're not on that information
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:31.380]  source. In that form, they are codes, they are mathematics and electrical pulses. The
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:37.660]  computer then decodes that into the form that we see on the screen, which is all the things
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:45.540]  that we call the internet and computers. We are doing the same through a holographic biological
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:51.860]  computer of enormous advancement that we call the human body. And we are picking up information
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:57.940]  sources in the form of vibrational information, waveform information, which is then turned
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:03.860]  by the five senses into electrical information, which is communicated to the brain. And from
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:08.740]  that information, the brain constructs the reality that we think we're experiencing outside
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:17.540]  of us, but it's actually inside of us in the sense that I'm describing. Now, say you had
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:23.900]  and I'm suggesting very strongly Alex that this is the situation we face. Say you had
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:32.820]  a reality where the information source is giving you a certain information from which
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:40.540]  you are decoding a reality. And it's a reality that is fantastically different to this one.
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:44.900]  It's about love. It's about the expansion of awareness, knowing that we are infinite
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:50.060]  consciousness having an experience. We are not the experience itself. We are not our
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:55.420]  name. We are not our job. We're not our life story. That is the experience. We are the
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.920]  consciousness having that.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.480]  The system doesn't want that. It's like Bill Hicks said, hey, the guys that say this is
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:06.280]  all just a ride, we kill those people. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly why they do that.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.520]  This is why so-called visionaries have always been dangerous to the prevailing order no
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.420]  matter what point in what we call history you look at. But say this happened and I'm
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:21.020]  suggesting it has happened. If you have a computer system and it's giving you a certain
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:26.560]  reality on the screen, there are people, we know this now, it's a fundamental part of
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:36.180]  life who can hack in to that computer and give it a fake information source, which the
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:45.520]  computer then decodes and therefore creates a very different reality on the screen because
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:50.180]  the information that you should normally be decoding into that reality has been hacked
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.740]  there. We got to go to break. We're gonna come right back with this and we'll get to
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:57.980]  the latest news and developments. David Icke's our guest. I'm Alex Jones. His site's davidicke.com.

[01:20:52.640 --> 01:21:02.900]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. Social unrest, food shortages,
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:09.540]  political turmoil, EMPs, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, riots, flooding. It's not

[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:36.980]  and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:41.220]  at interest, forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:44.740]  stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:48.420]  of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a

[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:13.060]  The matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now in this very room, you can see
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:18.460]  it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:24.580]  you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your tax. It is the world that has
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:30.980]  been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave. Like everyone
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:36.340]  else, you were born into bondage. Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:46.860]  touch. A prison for your mind. The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:53.260]  on for your mind. Alright, this is a short segment, long segment
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:57.940]  coming up. We'll get into other issues and news with David Icke. But David, going back
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:03.020]  20 years ago, because I remember, I remember first reading one of your books about 17 years
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:07.700]  ago when I first got on air and my cousin had read it a year before. So it was whatever
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:13.180]  book you'd written 18 years ago. I forget the names and I'm like, this is far out. This
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:17.060]  is crazy. And my cousin's like, no, no, this is really interesting. This guy's really interesting.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:20.260]  So I read it and found it to be interesting. I forget which book that is. Maybe you can
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:24.060]  remind me, but you were talking about a three dimensional, the universe being a hologram
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:28.620]  projected, projected by what? Again, this isn't even attacking Christianity or religion
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:35.020]  from my perspective. This reaffirms my faith. Because I mean, this is a giant universe,
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:39.800]  hundreds of millions of galaxies. And there is this force they're finding in genetics,
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:45.060]  in the wave theory, in everything that's making the scientists realize this is designed.
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:49.060]  And now we realize that the establishment knows this. They're trying to keep us from
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:53.920]  learning that we've been hacked. And they are trying to force the red carpet, the glitz,
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.860]  the glam, the fake culture in on us.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:01.140]  They're trying to destroy the family, destroy the individual, destroy the nation state.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:06.660]  What are they trying to build? Because they see us as viruses. David, you've laid out
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:12.660]  your theory, probably, let's not exaggerate, 40, 50 times on my show, graciously, over
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:16.260]  the last, I don't know, 12 years or so we've been talking to each other. Folks know what
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.860]  you've said, they know what the scientists are saying, and more and more major universities
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:24.060]  that have these supercomputers, and these devices that can measure, you know, literally
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.420]  the ether that the ancients talked about.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:31.380]  What is it then? What are they trying to build? What do the controllers want? What are they
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:35.680]  trying to block us from? Realizing there's a whole universe and they're not God? I mean,
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.680]  what is it?
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:46.120]  Well, the thing is, Alex, that the next step on from what they're discovering is what exactly
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:54.020]  are they discovering? Is it the universe as we perceive it, or is it the hack? And I would
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:27:01.260]  strongly suggest that what science has been poking around at and trying to understand
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.300]  and going down cul-de-sacs galore because it won't go where the real information is
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:08.580]  because the whole foundation of its mainstream science-
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.540]  The universe is the hack. That's what I was saying to the guys the other day, that what
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.460]  they're seeing is the hack.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:25.060]  Well, what they are identifying is, yes, the hack. And what they're going to find is that
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:31.260]  the speed of light is not only not the fastest speed in existence, it's pedestrian compared
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:37.860]  with what is possible. And that the speed of light is the wall of the hack. And, you
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:43.220]  know, this is so important if we're going to get anywhere, we're putting this world
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:46.620]  is actually wouldn't it be nice if we started to understand what the world is? That would
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:54.120]  give us a chance, wouldn't it? Let me just put this to you. We are receiving, according
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:01.700]  to mainstream science, about 11 million pieces of what they call impressions, light impressions,
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:10.080]  information, in other words, or bodies of information, to the eye, 11 million every
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:21.740]  second. The brain takes 40 of those to construct the reality we think we're experiencing. We
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:30.700]  can only decode through the body in what we call the physical world, a unbelievable fraction
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:36.740]  of what exists, even within the electromagnetic spectrum, this tiny frequency range called
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:42.540]  visible lights, all we can see. And outside of that, you've got the x ray level and the
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:48.860]  infrared level and all the others. We can't see those. That's how tiny this, this this
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:53.240]  free now they've proven the dark matter. It's gone from theory to prove and now they're
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:59.680]  learning that 97% of everything is dark matter. What is it? Well, they call they call it dark
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:05.180]  matter. I just call it the invisible and the visible to the conscious mind and the visible
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:15.500]  is it's laughable. It is so tiny. It is laughable. That is the hack and the electromagnetic spectrum
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:20.740]  and within everything within the speed of light, I suggest is the hack and what all
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:30.740]  they're doing is that scene from the matrix you played before we came back. It's all around
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:38.180]  Neil, even in a Neo, even in this very room, that is the information source. It's everywhere.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:43.700]  It's like the wireless internet. If you're in a room, I'll tell you what, we got a break.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:48.420]  Long segment coming up. Wow. David Icah here with us talking about the nature of reality.
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:54.740]  Is it all a hack? Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones

[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:11.260]  I like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:20.740]  tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:27.540]  on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:35.500]  but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:49.500]  natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:55.460]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:10.020]  it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease. A cancer of this planet. You are a plague.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:20.180]  We are the cure. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:27.860]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:32.820]  Okay David Icke is our guest. He got cut off there by that short segment. He wants to finish
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:38.860]  up with his take on what science is going to do as they bump up against what he's saying
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:44.680]  is the hack, not actually the real reality. Pretty heavy stuff but look, I find it's healthy
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:50.220]  to do. Just to get your mind outside the box, we know the culture's hacked. We know they
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:52.060]  want us in an artificial reality.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:57.840]  They're trying to force us into an even deeper one with the virtual realities and the virtual
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:02.820]  video games and people aren't living in the real world and in denial and ten hours of
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:08.620]  TV or video games a day and all the drugs and the chemicals and the food and water.
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:13.020]  The establishment wants to dumb us down and David, humor me because I want your take on
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:15.380]  this. I want you to answer a question and then get back into the nature of reality.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:20.860]  They don't want to get your take on the mass shootings in general. Some brief answers about
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:26.780]  where things are going and then also the Pope stepping down. That hasn't happened in 600
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:32.580]  years. What your take is on that, we'll discover that with David Icke of davidicke.com. If you
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:39.340]  just joined us, I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com. Best-selling author, researcher, trailblazer.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:42.940]  You can't deny so much of what he said has come true, unfortunately. I wish it wasn't
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:46.580]  the case. David Icke joining us now, people can't deny. A lot of what we've talked about
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:53.780]  has come true. I wish I was wrong, but reality is much more wild than what we can even perceive.
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:57.740]  I think that's the bottom line here. But you just heard that clip from The Matrix, I think
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:04.000]  the second one where Agent Smith is saying humanity is a disease. Do the global controllers
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.700]  want more of us or are they really going to try to go to robots because they'll follow
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:14.020]  orders. But the establishment loves to feed on humans like a predator class. They call
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:19.540]  themselves another species in all of their literature, the psychopath class. Will they
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:24.380]  actually get rid of this? What is their in-game goal if they had their way, David, and then
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:28.660]  get back into the nature of reality and then those other subjects?
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:35.540]  Well I think in terms of numbers, from a control point of view, humanity is out of control
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:41.660]  in terms of numbers and they want to bring the numbers down dramatically. This is basically,
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:48.420]  I suggest, what has happened after a quarter of a century of researching this in 50 odd
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:55.140]  countries. The hack is basically a bad copy of the reality we should be experiencing and
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:37:02.600]  would be experiencing without the hack. If you look in the ancient world, all over the
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:07.880]  ancient world and the Garden of Eden and all that stuff is all symbolically part of this
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:15.820]  whole story. And the themes are that the human form was genetically manipulated. I suggest
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:22.620]  it was genetically manipulated to tune us into the hack. If you've got a radio on a
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:28.340]  certain station, it's getting a certain reality by decoding the frequency of that station
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:35.940]  and then you hack into that station and you change the reality of the experience of the
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:43.100]  reality and to do that you have to get to the station dial onto your new hacked frequency
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:47.420]  that you're imposing. That's basically what's happened.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:56.580]  So the process once that was done of a copy that at the time wasn't a million miles different
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:01.680]  from the reality it was a copy of, though it was a bad copy of it. It's literally like
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.780]  downloading a copy of something on a computer. I mean, we're not talking computers on a desktop,
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:15.760]  we're talking unbelievable levels of possibility and awareness to do that. But then over this
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:23.860]  period since this hack was kicked in, they have been slowly, slowly now at a very fast
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:32.840]  rate changing and changing and changing the hack into an even more extreme version, which
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:39.380]  is closer and closer to what they are, they being the entities that have done it. And
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:45.620]  they are incredibly robotic. This is what Christianity calls the demons. It's what Islam
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:52.100]  calls the jinn. It's what the ancient Gnostics called the Archons, the different names for
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:57.700]  all over the world in different cultures. Same theme, same force we're talking about.
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:04.700]  Very robotic, it's very computer like, and it has no emotion. Now, what I'm describing
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:12.620]  here are the bloodlines that are being identified in the hack, the Rockefeller's, the Rothschild's,
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:17.460]  the royal families and all these people. They are representatives, they are if you like
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:26.660]  the ancient Smiths of these hack creators within the hack to manipulate on their behalf,
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:33.940]  their middle men and women manipulating within the hack. And the idea is to move us and the
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:44.620]  hack closer and closer and closer to what they are, computer like robots and transhumanism,
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:49.940]  which is to introduce more and more technology in the body. So we're part robot, part human
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:57.220]  is all part of this story, because it's making us more and more and more like they are. They
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:04.580]  do not have what I call creative imagination. Humans have it, they do not have it for reasons
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:12.580]  I talk about at length in my books. And thus, they have they are feeding and manipulating
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:21.500]  creativity to create our own prison. They are parasites. Thus, what is the banking system,
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:28.020]  which is their banking system? It's parasitic. What is the corporation network, which is
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:32.340]  their corporation network? Parasitic. What are the royal families? Parasitic. What are
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:37.540]  the governments? Parasitic. And they're all expressions of this force, because these agents
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:41.540]  Smiths, if you like, have taken over government, they've taken over corporations, in fact,
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:46.680]  they created them, they've taken over the medical system, which is why alternative sources
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:53.140]  of health are suppressed and practitioners targeted. This is why they're filling us with
[01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:59.840]  vaccines and rubbish and chemical toxins in the food and in the drink and in the water.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:08.100]  It's all connected. It's suppressing human potential down to them because if you are
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:16.340]  one eyed, and you want to control two eyed, you have got to make the two eyed blind. And
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:24.780]  that is what is going on multi level constantly 24 seven to make humans blind. So in that
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:32.820]  in the land of the blind, the one eyed man, these, the this force is, is king. And Alex
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:41.360]  on your show every day, you are presenting stories of the multi level expressions of
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:48.180]  what I've just talked about, dumbing down, dumbing down, dubbing down education, dumbing
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:56.060]  down. Why? Because they do not want a clear thinking, sharp, open minded expanded awareness
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:01.280]  that is gonna see the game for what it is. And I have to say this too. I mean, this might
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:06.080]  upset a few people. I really don't care. I'm not here to win a popularity contest. I want
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:14.100]  humanity to be free. At last, at last, 11 million pieces of information received through
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:23.920]  to the brain. Every second we process 40 infinite reality, we see a tiny, tiny, tiny frequency
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:32.220]  range called visible light that's almost non existent. Don't anyone tell me that you are
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:40.420]  gonna get the lowdown on yourself, your reality, your world and what's going into it in on
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:47.300]  it inside it from one book, whether it's the Bible, whether it's the Quran, whether it's
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:52.660]  what any other religion follows, it's not going to happen. You're not going to get it
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:57.780]  by understanding or following republicanism or, or the Democrats, you're not going to
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:03.260]  get it from your cultural beliefs, from your academic beliefs, from your racial beliefs.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:09.700]  These are all divide and rule mechanisms within the hack to keep the target population at
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:16.380]  war with itself and in mind prisons that it will not leave. Because if I take this information
[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:21.260]  as being possible, it's not what's in the book. It's not what's in my belief system.
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:29.500]  And this is the key. Belief systems are the currency of control. Absolutely the bottom
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:35.620]  line if they can get people to believe something rigidly and immovably, they put them in a
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:41.180]  box and they're not coming out until they decide to look at the world dispassionately
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:46.800]  and take information on the basis of its credibility and not on the basis of whether it fits in
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:51.620]  with a belief system. This is why they don't care if you're a rigid believer in this religion
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:55.660]  or that religion or this politics or that politics or you're an atheist. They don't
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:01.820]  care as long as you've got a rigid belief, they have got you. And I tell you, we are
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:08.440]  at a point now, people of the world where we have got to open our minds to see what's
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:13.060]  going on. Because if we don't, there are no answers. There are no answers to the hack
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:18.900]  within the hack. There are answers to the hack when we expand our awareness to go beyond
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.980]  it in terms of our perception of reality.
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:28.740]  David Icke is our guest, filmmaker, bestselling author, researcher, former BBC News presenter,
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:36.940]  sports champion goalie. If you just joined us again, I'm Alex Jones, your host. David,
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:40.260]  time always flies when you're here with us. Let me just calmly lay this out and then get
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:43.220]  your take on this and then shift into other subjects. Cuz I know you've been up since
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:46.020]  5 AM and you're writing your new book and you've gotta leave soon or I'll keep you in
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.020]  the next hour.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:51.780]  Maybe we'll twist your arm to do that. But the point is, I've read what Ray Kurzweil
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:55.580]  said, I've read what the other transhumanists have said. I know the whole history of them,
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:00.580]  how they come out of the end of eugenics in the early 50s out of the eugenics society.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.340]  Aldous Huxley's brother Julian Huxley starts the transhumanist movement. They're not saying
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:08.580]  humans are gonna merge with computers by itself.
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:12.580]  They're saying we've taken control of human evolution, to use their words, whether people
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:17.020]  believe in that or not. We've taken control and we're going to empower you, but we're
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:21.600]  gonna squash everybody else like bugs. You will accept this or die and you'll be like
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:24.080]  a bug as soon as we get this brain boost.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.340]  But then I see every piece of tech they roll out is designed to dehumanize, not to empower.
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:33.280]  So I'm not against the technology, the fact it's all infected, it's all deformed. It's
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:39.340]  all designed to poison and limit from the smart meters to the phones to all of it. We
[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:43.880]  can obviously hack the matrix back ourselves and use that to reach people in the matrix
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.760]  to use the movie analogy.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:50.500]  But people need to understand if they haven't read the writings of all the top transhumanist,
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:54.340]  they're selling the new liberation through this. But saying all the rest of us will be
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:46:00.640]  animals who are exterminated because we won't, we'll be like bugs. This is Hitlerian rolled
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:05.260]  out with these big conferences with top military, top Hollywood.
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.100]  William Shatner, who I don't think is a bad guy, goes to it. And they have these big Kurzweil
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:14.100]  events where they're gonna be gods and we won't even count and we're going to accept
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:18.900]  it or we won't even be able to communicate. When meanwhile, it's all done when you read
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:22.860]  deeper to actually destroy us and enslave us.
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:28.220]  I mean, this is beyond science fiction, what the technocratic elite, and I've studied them.
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:33.940]  If you go back to the 1850s with Galton and Wedgwood and the Huxleys all intermarrying
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:38.500]  with the British royalty, they all envisioned, we're gonna have the genetics, we're gonna
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:41.100]  discover that, the biometrics, the control grid.
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:47.820]  They chart 165 years ago, about 1850 or so, everything that would then unfold in books
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:54.460]  I own, that is not human. I mean, talk about demons, whatever. They are channeling and
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:47:00.840]  building something so dark, it staggers the mind. And so I want listeners to know, as
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:05.980]  wild as what David Icke is saying, these people believe it and talk about it, and they believe
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:10.900]  they're gonna be the new gods of the future, and they want to shutter our consciousness.
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:20.140]  Alex, you used a term there which really sums up the game, dehumanize. I was just saying
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:29.780]  a few minutes ago, the idea is to turn us into computer-like, robot-like, emotionless
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:37.700]  expressions of them. And to do that, they must dehumanize us. And there are certain
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:43.300]  key words that can be, just a few key words that can be used to describe this force that
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:47.740]  I'm talking about. One, it's a parasite. That's why everything it does is parasiting. The
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:53.700]  tax system and all these fines and all these new regulations and stuff that they're bringing
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:59.860]  in, that is just increasing the parasitical nature of the society and those that are controlling
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:06.660]  society. Another key word is deceit. That goes without saying. And another one is distort,
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:14.020]  distortion. Everything is about distorting reality. Why? Because what they're doing is
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:20.260]  distorting the original reality and distorting it to become closer to their reality.
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:24.420]  That's why the propaganda doesn't make any sense because the elite, so-called elite,
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:29.820]  are insane and ugly in their souls and their spirits. And that's why they're turning up
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:35.540]  the taxes and regulations in their own words to wreck us and to bankrupt us, to drive us
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:38.540]  into their arms so we can now be under their control.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:43.180]  Exactly, that's exactly what they're doing. And this is, I've been talking about this
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:48.900]  in my books for a very long time. All this financial crash, if people are gonna sit around
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:54.440]  waiting for the upturn, well, I should get some food in cuz you got a long wait cuz the
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:56.300]  idea is not to upturn it.
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:02.460]  The idea now is to drive it on and on and on. So the humans are driven economically
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:06.060]  into the ground. I mean, look around the world, look around America, what's happening? My
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:07.060]  goodness.
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:11.720]  And you said that in 2008, you said we're not coming out of this until we defeat them.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:16.300]  This is the long, dark winter. This is the shutdown while they give us false hope and
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.820]  pose as saviors.
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:23.100]  Yeah, we see this is another thing. Go on, we talk forever. Another one of the great
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:29.900]  techniques is buying time. Look at the Palestinians in Israel, all these roadmaps and talks about
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:34.500]  talks and all that stuff, load of rubbish. The Israelis don't want any of that to come
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:41.200]  to fruition. They're buying time to complete the genocide. And so they'll buy time. No,
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:47.260]  the upturn's coming. Oh, it's just around the corner. No key, no need to do anything.
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:52.260]  We've got it sorted. And it's just buying time to allow it to get worse. And when you
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:53.260]  talk about-
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.940]  But even that's a divide and conquer as well, with the globalists are playing both sides
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.800]  of that.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.280]  They have to divide and rule 7 billion when there's a handful of them in full knowledge
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:05.320]  of what they're doing. That's the key. This is why I say, I don't care what your religion
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:10.760]  is or no religion. I don't care what your belief system is. Let's just put it aside
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:14.140]  and come together because we're all in this together. And let's, if you want to argue
[01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:17.760]  about the belief systems, let's argue in the concentration camp, shall we? That'd be a
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:20.760]  good time. We'll have plenty of time. Well, not too long, but we'll have enough time to
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:25.080]  see if your belief system's better than mine. Come on, people. It's time to grow up because
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.560]  they want us to be children in the worst sense of-
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:31.960]  Look at how they're hyping black on white, white on black racism all in the media. I
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:36.560]  mean, they are desperately hitting the divide and conquer button like I've never seen.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:43.360]  Yes, exactly. Because they're pushing on now to complete the job. And one of the reasons
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:47.920]  that they're pushing it on as fast as they can in an almost panic stricken way is they're
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:54.200]  trying to lock down everything before the human race, which it is doing, though my goodness
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:58.600]  not quick enough for me, before the human race wakes up to the point-
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:01.260]  And throws the fleas off. Stay there, David Icke.
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:05.960]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:09.920]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.160]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out

[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:26.960]  from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.040]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:35.160]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day

[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:06.800]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:12.880]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:18.180]  device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:22.240]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece to the Washington Post warning
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:27.080]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:31.800]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:37.880]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:43.560]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:48.760]  exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:54.000]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.400]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.

[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.320]  We've got a new book you're writing. I wanna have you back home when that comes out. You
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:58.800]  wanted to comment on Huxley and people, not the Huxley we know of in this 20th century
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:02.620]  with Brave New World in 32, but his grandfather.
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.480]  How did they envision genetic engineering, total control, robots under their control
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:15.760]  160 years ago? Well, it comes through to Aldous Huxley as well with Brave New World who, of
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:21.360]  course, was connected into the Fabian Society, a major secret society with a network. And
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:27.680]  that's where George Orwell, Eric Blair, his real name, got his information for 1984.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:33.720]  From the perspective that I'm coming from, Alex, it's really, really simple. Those that
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:41.000]  are the Agent Smiths, if you like, and the Huxleys, there certainly were, they are coming,
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.320]  and the Raw family, and the Raw families, and the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds,
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:52.480]  they're coming from a different point of perception for this reason. Imagine that you're playing
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:57:00.680]  a computer game and you know where the computer game goes because you've seen it. You know
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:06.280]  where it goes. Or you're watching a movie and you know where it goes. You know how the
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:14.200]  plot unfolds and where it ends. But the people in the movie, i.e. the human race, they ain't
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:20.000]  seen the movie. They think the movie's real. They think things are happening by random
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.900]  means, when actually it's unfolding because it's programmed to unfold that way. That's
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:32.680]  what's happening with the hack. Now, we as a human race, if we get out of our five sense
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:41.560]  level of reality, which is very weak comparatively in changing reality, and get into awareness,
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:46.760]  consciousness, and realize the true nature of who we are, and we do that collectively,
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:55.440]  then it's over. It's over. This cannot unfold with that level of awareness, power, information,
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.880]  creative imagination.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:00.760]  We got to go to break. We got to go to break, but I want to bring up to you why they do
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.400]  Illuminati rituals at the Super Bowl and the Olympics. I know you've talked about that.
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:07.720]  I'm glad I remembered that. I want to raise that. We'll get into the Vatican thing. We're
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:11.560]  going to break right now. David Icke, third hour coming up here in just a moment. We'll
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:15.880]  be right back with David Icke. I'm going to show you a live Skype video for TV viewers
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:22.100]  of the Texas official state cemetery. Aaron Dykes is there, the royal establishment. Local
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:27.240]  Fox was telling him that he needed to be quiet and he couldn't be 300 yards away from the
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:30.920]  funeral, giving us a report. Well, the rest of the mainstream media does talking reports.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:35.000]  See, Infowars is much bigger than Local Fox, but they're God. They're telling him to shut
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.640]  up, but we're there covering the Navy SEALs funeral. More of that coming up. Stay with
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:39.640]  us.

[01:59:49.840 --> 02:00:07.480]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:16.800]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:23.440]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:34.840]  We've got live video feeds from the funeral of Chris Kyle, the big ritual. We're going
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.840]  to talk about ritual with David in the next segment. And how, oh, ignore the troops dying
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.680]  of DU poisoning, but oh, we're going to have a big giant shutdown I-35 for six hours and
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:48.600]  have a big funeral for a Navy SEAL sniper. And I'm not here bashing Chris Kyle. It's
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:54.760]  just this is a manipulation. What is the obsession with ritual, the royal wedding, all of it?
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.080]  What is it really about? It's not about honoring the troops. The globalists say that they're
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:03.480]  the number one terror threat because they're creatures that went out and robotically did
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:06.000]  their work, that may wake up, may get off the reservation.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.200]  David, this is your short segment, long segment coming up. David Icke, our guest of DavidIke.com.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:16.120]  David, in the time we've got, what's going on with the pope? And we've got Wall Street
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:21.980]  Journal saying prophecy is the next pope, the last, and all sorts of other hysteria.
[02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:25.240]  What's going on here? Well, I think there's a very good chance,
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:33.920]  Alex, that the Roman church will not last a desperately long time now because the Roman
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:39.200]  church has not just got skeletons in the cupboard, it's got whole cemeteries going back hundreds
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:45.240]  of years. And, you know, there's a television program. I think when going out tonight in
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:51.480]  America or going out, they watched it online last night. You can watch it online anywhere
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:02:02.820]  in the world. And it's English title, if you like, is Silence in the House of God. And
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:09.880]  it just confirms, in a mainstream documentary, what I've discovered all around the world
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:15.800]  in the last 20, nearly 25 years. And that is the scale of pedophilia and child abuse.
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.280]  There's a reason for that. It connects into the hack. It connects into the energy vampiring
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:23.640]  of those behind the hack. This is all part of it. Children's energy, they want-
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.320]  And why are they saying vampires are good everywhere? Children's shows.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:33.320]  Yeah, exactly, Alex. What they're doing is trying to get us closer and closer to them
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:38.800]  so their extremes become mainstream and acceptable to us more and more.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.040]  Torture, secret arrest, Hotel Transylvania, the vampires are the sweet ones, the humans
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:51.720]  are the bad ones. That's all part of the preparation and the conditioning to get us to accept extremes
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:03:00.520]  and outrages as a natural part of life. But what surrounds this resignation of the Pope,
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:10.720]  I would suggest, is that Joseph Ratzinger, his real name, is the biggest child abuse
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:19.160]  cover-upper, if you like, cover-upper of child abuse on the planet. In 1981, Pope John Paul
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:26.720]  II, who was not the rose-colored person he was painted and promoted as, he made Ratzinger,
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.920]  the head of something called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the CDF. Now,
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:37.720]  this was formerly the supreme sacred congregation of the Roman and universal inquisition. It
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:47.160]  was the holy inquisition, the mass murdering, torturing of non-believers. And in 2001, the
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:54.960]  same Pope, Pope John Paul II, decreed that all child abuse cases affecting the Roman
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:03.920]  Catholic Church worldwide would come through this CDF and directly through Ratzinger, every
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:14.120]  single one. And the job of Ratzinger, which he carried out with great employment vigorously,
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:24.080]  was to cover up as much as possible and therefore stop what would be and will be, I suggest,
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:31.000]  when it does come out, church-destroying truth about child abuse and the scale of it worldwide.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.880]  And in covering it up, Alex, he denied justice to the children who'd been abused and allowed
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.960]  pedophile priests and bishops and all the rest of it to stay in their jobs or maybe
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:47.280]  move parishes or whatever, but stay in their jobs and continue to abuse children.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:50.920]  Amazing, which is exactly what you said about Penn State before it came out and what you
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:56.600]  said about the BBC presenter who hangs out with the royalty, who we now know was a Satanist.
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:01.080]  Oh, by the way, let's talk about that. You said that first.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:05.880]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:09.880]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:14.120]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.200]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:22.440]  day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:26.920]  from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Almost all the grocery stores
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:31.000]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.120]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day

[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:10.840]  the Infowar.
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:19.280]  All right, it's our final segment with David Icke. We may cram in a call or two for him
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:25.520]  from folks like William. I am Alex Jones, your host. A ton of news and your calls coming
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:29.800]  up after he leaves us. David, we got to move quickly now. If people just joined us, you're
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:34.960]  saying it's television program set to air here and in England and you gave the name
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:41.280]  of them and I pulled up London Guardian with the reports that he was over the committee
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:46.800]  that helped suppress the child abuse back in the 80s and things. And now he's resigned.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:50.200]  It's a huge deal. The media is acting like they don't know why he resigned.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:55.840]  Yeah, exactly, exactly. But, you know, popes don't resign Alex. He's the first one to resign
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:00.400]  in 600 years. They're saying ill health, but they're very vague about what that ill health
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:10.160]  is. And his previous mate, Pope John Paul II, he stayed as pope for the last four years
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:15.060]  of his life with Parkinson's disease, severe arthritis. He could hardly speak or hear,
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:20.520]  but it kept going because popes don't resign. Now this one has suddenly resigned. I'm telling
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:26.480]  you, it's to do with the scale of child abuse that this man has been covering up year after
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:33.320]  year after year. The bubble's about to burst and on so many levels the bubble's about to
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:34.320]  burst.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:35.320]  Sure, let's move quick now though.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:40.540]  Yeah, you mentioned Jimmy Saville. Jimmy Saville, the whole thing in this country, a thing called
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:44.680]  Operation U Tree with the Metropolitan Police in London, that's just been a massive cover
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:49.520]  up of these connections with the royal family and the Thatcher administration. But there
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:56.940]  are other things going on that are connecting more and more dots and more and more connections
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:10:03.240]  into the pedophilia connections into the Thatcher administration, which was a cesspit, a cesspool
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:05.280]  beyond description.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:10.640]  And that's going to blow eventually as well. And I've said for all these years, pedophilia
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:14.560]  and Satanism are the cement that holds the whole thing together.
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:18.560]  You said not only was he a pedophile before it came out, but he was a Satanist. Now that's
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:22.960]  mainstream news of him taking little kids to satanic rituals and raping them.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:27.640]  Yeah, I also said that he was a necrophiliac, which has also come out as well. And what
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.680]  is a necrophiliac? There's someone at once sex with dead people. It's about death.
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:34.720]  And again, you heard that when you were working at the BBC?
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:38.880]  No, no, this was much later. I met a lady-
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:41.960]  That's right, she came and visited you. But of course, you were top news presenter there
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.280]  for folks that don't know.
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:47.760]  I didn't know Saville. I mean, the BBC is a massive organization. I was in sport and
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:51.960]  news, and he was in wherever he was. But I always thought he was a very strange man.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.280]  Anyone that saw him on television, this was one strange-
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:02.880]  He looks like the archetypal pervert trying to rape kids in the trench coat at the park.
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:08.600]  Yeah, but I met a lady in the late 1990s who was a close friend of Princess Diana for nine
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:15.080]  years. And she gave me the lowdown on everything, including Saville, because Saville was so
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:23.800]  close. I mean, she said, Princess Diana just kind of hated the guy, Saville, because he
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:30.520]  was so close to the royal family, Alex, that this has now come out, that he was acting
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:34.120]  as a go between Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:38.680]  He was the top liaison. He was the one that had the keys to all their palaces and the
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:45.000]  highest level security clearance above anybody and bragged, I supply things to them. And
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.080]  they're constantly digging up the skeletons of little kids on royal palaces. What's going
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.440]  on there?
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:58.400]  The thing is that, you see, we've been talking in this chat about, if you like, the Agent
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:03.720]  Smiths being living in one world and the population living in another world. And the two interact,
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:05.200]  but that's about it.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:09.600]  No, they see our kids like going to the store and getting a pizza. I mean, they're eating
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:11.000]  us. We are the food.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:17.320]  Well, yeah, because they see us like humans see, you know, cattle and stuff like that.
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:28.200]  But the thing is that the life that they lead is so extreme. It's so dark. It's so based
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:29.200]  on-
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.520]  Okay, here's an example. I remember you in a book, I forget which one, saying Al Gore
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:36.680]  carries giant packages of blood around with him everywhere. And I thought, that's it.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:40.800]  This guy's crazy. It's where the internet got really big. It's about 95, 96. Years later,
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:45.600]  I saw it in the news that, why does Al Gore insist on having all these blood types in
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:50.160]  a refrigerator that follows him everywhere he goes, not even his own blood? And they
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:55.760]  said, we don't know, he won't say. What is Al Gore doing with the refrigerator of blood?
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:02.000]  Well, the thing is that these bloodlines, for the way it's gone today, let's call them
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:11.240]  the Agent Smith bloodlines. They are only partly human. They also are partly these entities,
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:17.240]  demons, jinn, archons, whatever you want to call them. And therefore, they are hybrids.
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.200]  And to hold their human form within the hack, you know, because it's a hologram. It's not
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:28.120]  a physical body. Physical bodies can't, you know, shift shape, but holograms can. This
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:33.480]  is why we need to understand reality, to get a real grasp on what is happening all around
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:39.400]  us. And to hold human form, they do drink blood. It's not the only reason, but because
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:46.820]  it carries the human genetic code, and the human code in their DNA open. Whereas otherwise,
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:50.300]  you know, they would look very different. And this is what shape-shifting is about.
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:54.960]  You see, people laugh at shape-shifting because, and this is an age-old thing. It's not just
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:01.200]  modern experience. This goes back as far as history goes back, this theme of shape-shifting.
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.480]  We dismiss it, or you people dismiss it, because they say you can't go from a physical body
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:10.320]  to a physical body. No, you can't. But that's not what's happening. You see, everything
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:16.400]  is energy, waveform energy, including the human body. It only becomes what we call physical
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:20.840]  when we've decoded it from the waveform through to the electrical into the holographic.
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:25.080]  Okay, well, regardless, they think all this is going on. They are a bunch of Luciferian
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:27.640]  devil worshippers. They're skull and bones, you name it, out of their minds. Let me ask
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:31.360]  you this, we gotta move quick here, David. You've always talked about how these sporting
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:37.320]  events, these big ones, are religious events. Now, the last four or five Super Bowls, with
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:42.840]  Janet Jackson and the sun symbol on her breast, and the lights going out this year for 33
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:49.600]  minutes and 55 seconds, right after she does the Illuminati symbol, Beyonce imaging shoving
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.040]  a microphone into it.
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:56.280]  So a double symbol of sexual congress going on, and then people in the crowd getting up
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:01.000]  and doing it. And Hitler coming up with the modern Olympics and the rings and the weird
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.080]  rituals there. And people say, well, they're just having a ritual. They get off on it.
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:09.840]  I've been at Bohemian Grove. I've seen videos shot by ABC News of Skull and Bones. They
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:15.200]  take this stuff deadly serious. I've talked to psychiatrists and people that have treated
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:22.360]  high level folks, obviously can't say cuz of the doctor-client privilege.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:29.280]  But I mean, I had dinner with, and I looked the lady up with a famous person that worked
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:35.400]  for Princess Diana out in Hollywood one time at dinner at Martin Sheen's house of all places.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:37.760]  And she was saying, let me just tell you, it's all true what you're saying and then
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:42.760]  some, okay? Let me just say it's crazy. And that's all she would say. But I mean, these
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:46.720]  people are out of their minds. I mean, regardless whether it's real or not and spiritual, they
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:47.720]  believe it.
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:51.000]  And so what's going on with the rituals in the Super Bowl and stuff getting more and
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.800]  more overt and all the rappers saying they're in the Illuminati?
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:16:02.160]  Well, it's a couple of things we can talk about here. First of all, 80%, according to
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:09.360]  mainstream science anyway, 80% of the information that the brain constructs into our experience
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:15.200]  reality comes through the visual senses. And thus, this is where symbolism comes from.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.960]  This is why they put these symbols all around us. Because, see, I'm speaking now, and as
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:29.080]  I speak, my vocal cords are vibrating a waveform vibration field of information. That's what
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:37.120]  the voice is. And it passes between me and people listening to me now in a form that's
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:40.280]  not words, it is vibrational information.
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:47.120]  The ear picks that up and sends it to the brain. And the brain then decodes that vibrational
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:55.800]  electrical information into words. The only time that my voice speaking now exists as
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:57.600]  words is when the receiver-
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:01.080]  Sure. Why are they doing the rituals, though? Why do they think they get power?
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:10.160]  Yeah, this is where I'm going with this. Now, a visual subject, whether it's a symbol or
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:17.680]  something on a stage or whatever, that's also an information field, which carries the information
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:25.800]  that it represents. And therefore, that is going on the same journey except through the
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:33.880]  eyes this time to the brain to be decoded into a sense of reality. In other words, symbols
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:40.400]  through this mechanism are access gateways to the brain and the mind and the perception.
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:46.200]  Now when you do these rituals, and this is why they're doing ancient Babylonian and other
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:52.240]  rituals today that they've done for thousands of years and more, is because the rituals,
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:18:01.120]  the colors, the chants, everything that takes part, the symbols involved, they create a
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:10.880]  particular vibrational field. And these fields connect them to these entities operating beyond
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:18.080]  the walls of the hack. And thus, as they create these rituals and the Olympic rituals at the
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:23.560]  London Olympics in 2012 were absolutely classically blatant in front of your eyes, if you know
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:32.880]  what you're looking for. They are creating this energy field that is connecting into
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:42.000]  these entities. Now, there's a great line, energy flows where attention goes. When you
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:49.360]  give something your attention, you make an energetic connection between you and it.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:53.680]  That's why they block all of I-35 and make all the news watch. It's not about the dead
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:58.480]  soldier, about the state sucking our attention, our time, our energy, our power.
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:05.720]  Yes, you mentioned an experience you had on a chat we had some time ago, Alex, where you
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:08.960]  were sitting, I think it was in a restaurant, and you said you felt like two eyes were staring
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:13.960]  you in the back or, you know, going in your back and you turn around someone was staring
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:20.760]  at you. That attention of that person upon you, you could feel because that attention
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:26.440]  creates an energetic connection. So when we focus and what was it a billion people focusing
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:32.160]  on the opening ceremony of the London Olympics worldwide, and you get the Super Bowl audience
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:37.200]  again worldwide focusing on these rituals, there is an energetic connection and we are
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.200]  affected by this affecting our perception.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.680]  Hold on, I know you got to go and it's late. Do one more five minute segment, six minute
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:47.440]  segment with us after this break to finish up on this and tie it into daily science.
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:52.160]  Science Daily, quantum theory demonstrated observation affects reality. We're going to
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:56.080]  talk about that finishing up and take one call for David Icke and get a sneak peek on
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:20:00.480]  his new book. Stay with us. One more segment with David Icke. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:07.640]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the info wars.com team want to relay to you

[02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:20.340]  going to get to William and George and Joshua and Jack we'll go to one call. Here in just
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:24.140]  a moment William in Mississippi wants to talk to David been holding patiently. You mentioned
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:27.740]  how they want our eyes on them they believe they're getting spiritual power the globalist
[02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:31.820]  talk about this openly Francois Mitterrand the French president and others were open
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:37.900]  occultist who talked about public events being rituals on TV to get power Hitler called his
[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:42.680]  giant mass rallies with 500,000 people rituals to get power.
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:48.040]  Here's an equation of 7.5 billion people on earth less than a thousand members of elite
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:58.900]  families that own the planet. You're talking about 0.0000013333333. So it's not the 2%
[02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:08.220]  it's the 0.0000013333333 who are manipulating us and not even all of those thousand or so
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:12.140]  members that Rothkopf at the Kissinger group estimates actually own the planet through
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:18.060]  monopoly some of them aren't even fully aware of what's going on in fact a lot of them are
[02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:19.060]  just compartmentalized.
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:23.540]  Now here's Science Daily quantum theory demonstrated observation affects reality this came out
[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:29.020]  in 98 since then countless other research has been done proving that when you observe
[02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:33.700]  something it changes it not when a computer does it a human looking at something they
[02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:39.060]  don't know why changes the neurons and electrons and things. I mean David this just adds more
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:43.500]  validity to what you're saying what you I guess at a spiritual level had an epiphany
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:48.500]  to 20 something years ago but this is why you're saying that they want us looking at
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:49.500]  them?
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:55.460]  Yeah well the thing is that this is why you know they've found that different scientists
[02:25:55.460 --> 02:26:00.420]  can have different outcomes to different experiments because depending on their attitude to the
[02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:07.780]  experiment it can change the experiment. Now this is so important this Alex because I was
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:13.180]  mentioning earlier just before a break that this program is playing out and it will play
[02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:19.380]  out unless it's something something intervenes in it and and what can intervene in it is
[02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:25.140]  human awareness because human awareness looks at the program in other words it's daily experience
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:31.620]  and it changes it once it knows what it's looking at and so this whole deal has been
[02:26:31.620 --> 02:26:40.860]  to hold human collective awareness or perception in a certain way of looking and perceiving
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:47.940]  things so that it will not do on any scale what you've described in the article which
[02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:54.820]  is the attention changing reality because if we look at this on anything like a mass
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:27:02.100]  scale and we realize what we're looking at gone because that attention and awareness
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:06.420]  behind the attention will change and that's why they stage the mass shootings and things
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:12.740]  is again to get our attention they have to keep us in a certain band of attention in
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:19.460]  other words perception of reality because then if that is our perception of reality
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:24.140]  we will fear based attention reality fear based attention focused on them let's jam
[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:29.100]  in one call here william in mississippi william you're on the air with david i go ahead hey
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:33.540]  can you guys hear me we can go ahead with your question mr ike uh hey first off i just
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:37.860]  wanted to say uh i was lucky enough to grow up with a father who let me uh listen to your
[02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:42.180]  speeches a lot and uh when i was in school one of our teachers kept calling you mr icky
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:47.100]  and i had to correct them in front of everybody i've been called worse i wanted to say that
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:51.300]  i think there's a lot of uh correlations between your theories of the anunnaki or the rest
[02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:56.220]  of the reptilian humanoids and uh vampires so let's assume that they uh an intelligent
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:28:01.060]  species of reptiles survive these things in their dinosaurs and evolve further well what
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:05.740]  would be the uh correlations between them and vampires well let's just look at reptiles
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:09.540]  and vampires they both have two things beetle mammals they're both nocturnal they're both
[02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:13.180]  described as cold like all right well i don't want to get off into it you got to get your
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:17.660]  question in there david thank you for the call sir go ahead uh cheers uh very good question
[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:23.780]  and um one of the things that happens when you research this in country after country
[02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:29.540]  and culture after country uh culture is that you the penny drops eventually you're actually
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:33.460]  looking at the same thing they're just using different names for it this is why you can
[02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:38.580]  see the same thing described in all the religions every culture said whether it was asian latin
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:44.400]  american before that mesoamerican european babylonian don't go near the castle they'll
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:51.700]  grab you and eat you yeah i mean vampires what uh are called by the gnostics archons
[02:28:51.700 --> 02:29:00.740]  the the jinn of islam the the the demons the uh all these different uh names so i've had
[02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:05.500]  vampire hunting parties that went out in their major cities every week yeah now what do vampires
[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:11.780]  do they feed off human blood and they feed off human energy and that's what these people
[02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:19.360]  behind the hack do and that is why their representatives within the hack do it and that is what satanism
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:24.100]  is all about well christians call it the devil you can call it whatever you want to call
[02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:28.180]  it but the establishment believes all this whether it's real or part of it's real or
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:32.580]  none of it's real there's a lot more going on on out there than meets the eye david when's
[02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:38.700]  your new book coming out uh well um probably in the autumn in the fall um but i think it's
[02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:44.360]  uh it's it's the best thing i've done because uh there comes a time when you cross a line
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.420]  and suddenly the pennies drop no david we're out of time let me say bye to you during the

[02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:22.220]  in control and i for one want it to stop as quickly as possible i'm going to go to your
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:27.820]  calls here in just a moment i want to tell people though about some exciting news linus
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:33.120]  pauling was back in the 60s won the nobel prize i'm gonna do a whole piece on this for
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:40.060]  showing that super large dosages of pure vitamin c was able to make people live longer and
[02:34:40.060 --> 02:34:45.380]  absolutely knock out cancer now they've tried to suppress that information since then but
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:49.780]  here's an article out of the street and this is up at info wars dot com was on the wall
[02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:53.920]  street journal and also yahoo news young jeopardy that's all the products i sell at info wars
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:58.900]  health dot com discounted with the free shipping and other perks for info wars dot com readers
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:04.300]  and radio listeners and it breaks down that beyond tangy tangerine ultimate classic depending
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:11.140]  on which area 95 killed cancerous colon cells no healthy cells killed and they did other
[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:15.380]  studies with other products that do the same thing because of the super high concentration
[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:20.020]  of vitamin c and a bunch of other vitamins and minerals that only beyond tangy tangerine
[02:35:20.020 --> 02:35:26.540]  ultimate classic and it's also now in the people got tired of the alex pack part of
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:31.780]  it being liquid so now there's minerals vitamins amino acids essential fatty acids and more
[02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:37.700]  30 packets of the healthy start pack or alex pack the plant derived minerals everything
[02:35:37.700 --> 02:35:41.500]  where it's just in pills instead of the liquid now i personally think liquid tends to be

[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:12.660]  you very much i've been listening to you for years i've actually debated whether i'd call
[02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:18.420]  your show or not for a long time i used to be uh working in the canadian government uh
[02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:23.820]  and had a rough shoulder with some pretty big people and i've got some information for
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:29.600]  you first thing good news bill c30 known as the online surveillance and wireless wiretapping
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:36.540]  bill didn't pass uh... yesterday according to uh... our justice minister a minister because
[02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:42.040]  of the uh... canadian public opposition so that's a good uh... victory for us in in the
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:47.860]  info war uh... but this prime minister we have now the complete globalist uh... he's
[02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:51.900]  just absolutely disgusting he just sold one of our biggest oil companies next into the
[02:39:51.900 --> 02:39:56.740]  chinese government uh... last month we have basically no more control of our oil fields
[02:39:56.740 --> 02:40:02.660]  on alberta uh... what else is he done here he's got uh... jeez i don't even know like
[02:40:02.660 --> 02:40:08.300]  there's so much stuff here uh... but another thing too when i was up there you say these
[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:13.460]  people are mentally ill man did you ever nail it like these people that i've talked to their
[02:40:13.460 --> 02:40:20.460]  naming their kids after like historical people uh... one one guy who is uh... in the cabinet
[02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:25.420]  in the canadian government right now named one of his kids after uh... uh... the queen
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:30.060]  somebody in the queen's family they're talking about like all this is royalty this and that
[02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:34.180]  and i thought these people are absolutely crazy uh... you want to talk about al gore
[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:36.060]  you're talking about him earlier
[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:37.960]  i was actually told
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:39.560]  two years before
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:41.680]  it when the nobel peace prize
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:46.260]  he wanted to be president uh... they told him no the elite said you can't do it
[02:40:46.260 --> 02:40:49.340]  uh... you're going to win the nobel peace prize you're going to be the champion for
[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:51.220]  the global warming uh...
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:53.600]  uh... garbage that we're going to spewed out
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:57.820]  and you know i just i couldn't take it anymore alex i had to call in and spread the word
[02:40:57.820 --> 02:41:00.900]  because uh... most of the stuff you say is true
[02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:06.940]  and about this mental illness thing man they have a god complex i'm completely convinced
[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:11.540]  that they actually think they're part of the divide they think that they they get their
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:14.820]  mission like when they go to bed at night i don't know what they're thinking but it's
[02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:19.500]  definitely what's happening
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:23.580]  very very interesting very very interesting i gotta say this on air i'm sure they don't
[02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:24.700]  mean any trouble
[02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:30.220]  as i compared a lot of agencies they're one of the better ones the texas rangers are here
[02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:31.800]  or one texas ranger
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:35.360]  and the shows over officially heard about twenty minutes of the talk to him
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:38.940]  but i just want to get that out so they want to talk about chris kyle
[02:41:38.940 --> 02:41:42.700]  and they're having the big event right now here in town burying him in fact let's go
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:44.440]  to that live video feed
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:51.440]  uh... here in a moment aaron dikes is out there uh... videotaping the funeral service
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:53.140]  uh...
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:56.940]  secret service f b i texas rangers
[02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:01.460]  this should be interesting so i'll find out exactly what this is about
[02:42:01.460 --> 02:42:05.900]  uh... here in uh... just a moment
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:07.980]  well actually said what it was about
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:11.940]  it was about the marines giving us info about chris uh... about the guy that reportedly
[02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:15.100]  shot chris kyle exclusive photo we got
[02:42:15.100 --> 02:42:16.100]  and uh...
[02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:19.600]  i can tell you right now i'm not giving up my sources i don't know that's what they want
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:21.460]  but uh...
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:24.740]  all options in the uk and i told him i don't want to know sources when he does
[02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:26.020]  and so
[02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:27.560]  uh... that's the end of it
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:31.580]  data system does not want to find out what's going on with us and uh... and
[02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:33.260]  uh... texas ranger that's here
[02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:36.820]  uh... let's go ahead and return to come back into the almost off so i'll just
[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:39.060]  call back and get this over with
[02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:40.140]  other stuff today
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:42.960]  uh... let's go to george in connecticut
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:44.980]  you're on the air go ahead george
[02:42:44.980 --> 02:42:50.100]  i i i thought it would be a sort of uh... insight into that uh... this uh... universal
[02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:51.620]  matrix you could say
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:56.660]  uh... i had a uh... profound uh... uh... experience about thirty years ago when i
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:59.100]  was uh... dabbling into all sorts of uh...
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:04.300]  darkened and and like arts of uh... of the of the e s p nature
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:08.660]  and i had an angelic experience and it was uh... quite unnerving considering if you've
[02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:11.020]  doubled in things and something like that happens
[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:15.620]  but uh... i was babbling into the defense of what is the true nature of god
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:19.240]  and what is the power of god and love was that was the answer i got from the
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:20.720]  angelic and and and
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:23.020]  then i had to go to a
[02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:26.140]  example of how it really was the most powerful
[02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:27.380]  force in the universe
[02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:28.980]  and allowed me to be packed
[02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:31.100]  uh... by malevolent spirit
[02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:35.460]  and until i learned that defending myself wasn't the issue
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:38.380]  but you don't think a lot of and and sending a lot of those things are
[02:43:38.380 --> 02:43:42.540]  attacking me and then they diminished in power and then they actually turned into
[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:44.820]  beings of light
[02:43:44.820 --> 02:43:48.280]  what we've got to learn that we're in the matrix the matrix is the is trying
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:51.140]  to create a fear base so we stay within the bubble
[02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:57.940]  if we try to we use a lot of and don't allow them to destroy us and and and and
[02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:02.180]  react to that in a negative fashion we can react to protect ourselves
[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:06.140]  but not to curse them not to go after them in that way because that gives them
[02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:11.260]  power that keeps us in the matrix and gives them power when we use the love
[02:44:11.260 --> 02:44:17.740]  it basically then transcends that and then destroys their power
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:21.000]  now i agree with you and i don't want to be you know you know religious
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:25.860]  arguments and things like that that everybody seems to engage in nowadays
[02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:27.200]  but
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:30.880]  uh... i know this people some people misunderstand what i'm doing with the
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:32.100]  broadcast
[02:44:32.100 --> 02:44:35.220]  uh... and uh... they think that
[02:44:35.220 --> 02:44:37.700]  i'm trying to scare them
[02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:39.820]  when i cover all these scary things
[02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:43.220]  i'm trying to realize this is already going on whether you admit it or not
[02:44:43.220 --> 02:44:44.900]  let's do something about it
[02:44:44.900 --> 02:44:47.780]  again if somebody's house was on fire and they were sleeping you're banging on
[02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:49.380]  the door
[02:44:49.380 --> 02:44:52.580]  going to get out your house on fire coming or go quit fear mongering as you
[02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:56.420]  know smoke comes out the windows and fire comes out the roof
[02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:59.620]  i'm trying to get people i think people are want to do something about this i
[02:44:59.620 --> 02:45:01.000]  think people
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.580]  needed understand folks that are so
[02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:07.080]  totally grip with fear i mean take the l a p d
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:11.300]  all of southern california locked down police staying indoors not on the you
[02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:14.500]  know getting out of the squad cars not on motorcycles not on foot
[02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:18.340]  running around machine gun shooting women in cars and trucks only look like
[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:19.260]  this guy
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:21.820]  shooting men that don't look like him
[02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:24.700]  and if they are the wicked flee when number soon i'm not saying they're all
[02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:26.420]  wicked but it's a wicked culture
[02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:28.180]  i mean statistically
[02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:29.340]  cops die
[02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:32.820]  every couple days i've looked it up in in southern california and it's very
[02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:34.980]  dangerous driving around to get hit they
[02:45:34.980 --> 02:45:38.500]  they get shot things are always but it's not hyped up like this
[02:45:38.500 --> 02:45:40.700]  and so it just shows they can hype up
[02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:43.780]  paid to cops are dead five people shot
[02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:47.980]  and they're and they literally are just running around in total fear in a p r
[02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:49.300]  disaster
[02:45:49.300 --> 02:45:51.980]  and it is just beyond bizarre
[02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:53.700]  that it could ever get to this point
[02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:56.640]  uh... but but it shows this culture of fear in fact here it is
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:59.260]  obama this is informed works dot com
[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:00.820]  obama
[02:46:00.820 --> 02:46:04.980]  disarms marines during inauguration
[02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:07.980]  and uh... it goes uh... note the missing rifle
[02:46:07.980 --> 02:46:11.140]  bolts in the video capture above
[02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:15.140]  and they've always inaugurations of there's no need they don't have ammo and
[02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:16.300]  that gets checked
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:20.340]  uh... and and they should be in our salute it's it's blank she don't want to
[02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:22.260]  shoot some a mile away
[02:46:22.260 --> 02:46:25.780]  uh... in a popular area but but now when even when general show up at the
[02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:26.780]  secretary of defense
[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:28.420]  all the ammo is taken
[02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:31.380]  they do inspections of the officers they go in and make sure it's out of the
[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:36.200]  barracks they they check their clips they say leave your guns no guns
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:40.780]  uh... because they dislike and hate the military so much but in the same
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:44.460]  politicians have these big giant parades for the military so they look like
[02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:45.600]  heroes
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:49.620]  uh... and uh... so that ties into this total state of fear
[02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:53.100]  where now you know some of the second walk out in front of ten thousand troops
[02:46:53.100 --> 02:46:54.860]  and nobody shot him
[02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:57.680]  and i'm not saying he's a good guy but the point is
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:00.580]  our leaders act completely cowardly
[02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:02.300]  i mean they just live in total fear
[02:47:02.300 --> 02:47:04.260]  i mean statistically
[02:47:04.260 --> 02:47:07.340]  i try to remind myself i'm driving on the highway in the morning where there
[02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:10.380]  are cars that come right out of the lane on this four lane road two lanes one way
[02:47:10.380 --> 02:47:13.440]  two lanes the other that if you know somebody i see i see fatality accidents
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:14.900]  every few months on the road
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:16.860]  on this particular road is very dangerous
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:18.700]  uh... i see it uh...
[02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:22.440]  i see wrecks every week i mean just devastating wrecks because if somebody's
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:25.900]  looking at their phone or drops coffee on themselves or tire blows they're into
[02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:26.580]  your lane
[02:47:26.580 --> 02:47:29.300]  i told my wife we should always drive in the slow lane on this road is so
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:30.040]  dangerous
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:32.380]  because statistically that's the number one cause of death
[02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:34.060]  my little darling children
[02:47:34.060 --> 02:47:36.380]  that i would give my life for a split second
[02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:38.700]  i still stick in a car ten can
[02:47:38.700 --> 02:47:42.500]  going seventy miles down the road with other cars on seventy on a road that has
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:44.460]  deaths all the time
[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:47.860]  but where's the fear there's not the fears is part of life
[02:47:47.860 --> 02:47:51.560]  and that's why i'm afraid of not being killed by the new world order
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:55.780]  and i know life so short anyways i mean i just i don't get surrendering to fear
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:58.420]  that's why some people here this show and they go that guy scares the day
[02:47:58.420 --> 02:47:59.980]  lights out of me
[02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:02.440]  i've talked to military people and i've talked to
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:05.380]  uh... others that say i just can't listen it's too scary
[02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:07.980]  well you're scared cuz you're not doing anything about it
[02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:10.540]  i'm not here trying to scare you trying to get you moving
[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:13.480]  i'm saying look this is going on let's do something
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:16.500]  and it's not like hey i've got courage
[02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:18.300]  folks
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:20.540]  i do not have courage
[02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:23.020]  i don't even know if courage is a real thing
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:27.020]  i think it's a default are you gonna stand up for yourself
[02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:30.140]  i mean you see the footage in nazi germany of the piles of dead bodies and
[02:48:30.140 --> 02:48:33.720]  ditches they're shooting mass graves and the people hats and hands it's their
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:36.820]  turn and they they curtsy the soldier in the authority figure and run in and get
[02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:40.620]  shot americans are like that today a uniform they'd they kill their own kids
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:46.820]  i'm telling you a lot of them that they worship uniforms not liberty not freedom
[02:48:46.820 --> 02:48:49.960]  you know they worship the flag not what it symbolizes
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:53.220]  they don't even support what it symbolizes it would be a parade for the constitution
[02:48:53.220 --> 02:48:58.900]  constitution has been run over but they wrap all their tyranny in that packaging
[02:48:58.900 --> 02:49:04.340]  and it just totally freaks me out that that that some some of the people in in
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:08.140]  the warsaw ghetto some of the jews and others fought back a few times and were
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:09.760]  called heroes
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:12.780]  for fighting back so they wouldn't be taken and killed i call that just being
[02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:15.660]  normal
[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:19.360]  but i mean i have a hat
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:22.460]  usually you're marching men women and children into a pit shooting them and
[02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:25.500]  you and you and and and i'm a hero
[02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:28.580]  if i would run over and try to break the neck of somebody or you know did do
[02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:31.360]  something to him and that's not a hero
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:34.980]  if i go in my garage and there is a raccoon in there and this has happened before
[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:37.580]  and i might get out of here and it's sitting there eating dog food looking at me
[02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:41.020]  and i get a broom and start going like this it'll hiss at me and stuff and if
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:45.140]  you were to corner one it would attack you
[02:49:45.140 --> 02:49:49.020]  that raccoon is not something tough it's just normal okay
[02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:51.380]  that's what i'm trying to get out here
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:53.500]  we're gonna break and uh...
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:56.860]  come back to thank you george for the call and we're gonna come back to uh...
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:49:59.500]  joshua

[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:03.580]  and patricia try to cram those in here and i gotta go find out what the texas
[02:50:03.580 --> 02:50:04.940]  ranger wants
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:06.560]  uh...
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.620]  somebody with chris kyle there's no end of this
[02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:12.180]  uh...
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:15.340]  so i'll be able to find out what's going on with that
[02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:18.260]  and there's a new piers morgan thing going on behind the scenes to that i'm
[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:20.780]  not a liberty to talk about this point
[02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:23.460]  you know who did that piers morgan thing who got all that going i didn't know
[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:28.060]  this till about a week after the media said you can blame matt drudge for this
[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:30.760]  now i looked at matt's tweets i mean i look at him a couple times a day but i've
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:34.420]  not missed it and he had actually sent it to them and i was talking to one of
[02:50:34.420 --> 02:50:38.160]  their producers when i was down there last week when piers morgan was down here and they said
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:40.380]  yeah that is where we got the idea
[02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:44.980]  so uh... matt drudge does it again
[02:50:44.980 --> 02:50:49.180]  that's that that was the impetus the impetus the thought
[02:50:49.180 --> 02:50:51.240]  that the chain reaction triggered
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.700]  uh... all of that

[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:35.920]  pope and prophecy go ahead joshua
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:36.920]  hi alex
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:41.220]  they have a a question for you um... i was uh... you know read my bible like i
[02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:46.080]  do sometimes and uh... i noticed that in matthew twelve and luke eleven
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:48.260]  that it talks about the profit jonah
[02:54:48.260 --> 02:54:52.760]  and i was able to connect that with the alex jones
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:57.140]  uh... in the same way that uh... no stardom is predicted history
[02:54:57.140 --> 02:54:58.320]  as hitler
[02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:01.160]  whereas you know like jonah's would be like joe
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:04.600]  and uh... i knew that this was connected to sort of the entire thing here and
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:08.600]  then kind of bringing the pope situation with the malachi prophecies and
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:10.020]  you know you've got like this
[02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:13.540]  probably isn't all i don't believe in nostradamus i mean he may he said a king
[02:55:13.540 --> 02:55:14.640]  will be killed
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:16.900]  jousting kings got killed every
[02:55:16.900 --> 02:55:19.000]  year in different parts of europe jousting
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.680]  i mean uh... you know hister hitler it's all i mean i don't put anything into that
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:23.720]  and there have been
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:26.080]  millions of people named jones
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:28.160]  and jones is the uh...
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:30.520]  the antecedent of it is jonas
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:31.920]  you go back to about
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:35.280]  eleven hundred in wales they were converting the christian names from
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:39.800]  gaelic or celtic names celtic names and went over to that so go ahead
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:43.000]  so you don't think that you're the profit jonas that the bible speaks of in
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  the end time that
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:51.400]  you're constantly trying to get people
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:53.020]  to basically like
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:56.600]  they you know like you know dot go along with this whole you know plan to you
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:55:58.280]  know gender twenty one you roll over
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:55:59.460]  all that stuff
[02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:02.220]  and getting the repair and it says that
[02:56:02.220 --> 02:56:04.640]  that's going to happen for you basically
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:07.680]  all right well god bless you for a friend of the i think we've all got a
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:11.000]  job in god's plan and and you know i just want people thinking outside the
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:11.960]  box
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:15.520]  and realize people running things on other best interest at heart
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:19.080]  i'm not even necessarily you know convince this is this is the you know
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:22.640]  the end times the mark of the beast i i believe all that i see it being set up
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:25.800]  and coming but things always take a lot longer than what people think
[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:28.160]  you know preachers are saying the world's gonna end every day ever so i
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:31.240]  mean it's just it just never ends but god bless you i appreciate your call
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:32.440]  patricia
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:38.400]  uh... you're uh... on the air go ahead calling from colorado

[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:49.840]  the dole they've set the system up where
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:52.060]  it's very hard to get ahead of the old days
[02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:54.840]  even if you only had meager skills and you're willing to work you could end up
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:56.200]  being comfortable
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:56:58.440]  they're trying to get rid of that civilization i want to make you
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:01.480]  dependent i want to get control of your life
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:08.240]  so what should i do then since i have control of my life i am on the dole
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:09.960]  you know i'm
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:12.720]  go volunteer at a church do you go to church
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:13.600]  yes i do
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:14.920]  well that's good
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:17.600]  go volunteer at the church and try to help people
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:21.400]  and go go offered an intern you know uh... things that i mean it's such a
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:24.220]  complex question i have to counsel you for like two hours
[02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:26.380]  to figure out ways to help you
[02:57:26.380 --> 02:57:29.140]  uh... the church should be helping you
[02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:31.760]  and trying to figure out ways to get you a job and
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:37.520]  get you some skills do you have any skills?
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:38.960]  i don't
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:41.480]  i'm sure i have some skills i can clean and stuff
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:43.600]  i don't like to but i can clean
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:47.480]  well if you don't want to be on the dole go join a maid service and do that and
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:50.800]  through that hard work you're gonna live longer anyway sitting around is one of the
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:54.760]  biggest forms of bad health sedentary lifestyles
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:57.320]  uh... and uh... hard work's good for you
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:59.800]  uh... and i'd start right there
[02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:03.460]  uh... or you could also do things like stay on the dole for a while but
[02:58:03.460 --> 02:58:05.120]  pick up cans or
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:07.640]  paint little paintings and go try to sell them on the street
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.160]  to then gain a nest egg of money to then get off the dole
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:13.800]  it's hard to ever get off once you're on i understand that there's a lot of
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:15.840]  things you can do
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:18.880]  you ever thought about going and working for a yard company
[02:58:18.880 --> 02:58:21.080]  get in pretty good shape doing that
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:22.200]  yard company
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:24.960]  yeah mow yards i've done it
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:26.680]  and also can i ask you something else?
[02:58:26.680 --> 02:58:28.720]  sure what is it real fast?
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:29.960]  you know wifi
[02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:32.680]  what's the best way to fight that?
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:36.000]  well listen it's one thing wifi studies show isn't good for you but the
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.240]  really high-powered stuff like smart meters
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:42.760]  that's what's bad
