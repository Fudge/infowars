[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:26.640]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well ladies and gentlemen
[00:26.640 --> 00:34.560]  you will not want to miss today's transmission Joe Beggs and team did flying into Mexico and
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.560]  they discovered some very suspicious looking facilities that tie into what judicial watch
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.720]  says they have evidence of al Qaeda base ISIS base a couple miles over the Texas border outside
[00:45.720 --> 00:50.560]  of El Paso Joe Beggs is joining us the bottom of the hour from inside Mexico it looks like
[00:50.560 --> 00:56.320]  who's just gonna leave it at that it's almost scary to turn him loose though because he's
[00:56.320 --> 01:01.920]  in Josh are so bold we're gonna see what happens we have visas for al Qaeda Michael
[01:01.920 --> 01:06.360]  Springman who blew the whistle on the Saudis being involved in 9-11 it was ordered to stand
[01:06.360 --> 01:14.000]  down absolutely bombshell info that's all coming up but here is a short video report
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.600]  that's up on info wars dot com of the info wars crew going into Mexico with amazing aerial
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.840]  surveillance footage you want to get this video out on Facebook Twitter and everywhere
[01:23.840 --> 01:44.720]  this is a maximum action alert it's on info wars dot com here it is
[01:44.720 --> 01:53.240]  the radio let's go info wars dot com is the video
[01:53.240 --> 01:57.840]  Joe Beggs here with info wars dot com now today we are in Santa Teresa New Mexico just
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.080]  west of El Paso Texas and what we're going to do is we're going to fly over an opera
[02:02.080 --> 02:07.120]  that is the area that has been deemed hostile by the judicial watch basically saying that
[02:07.120 --> 02:12.360]  ISIS has been operating out of there due to some reports from the Mexican military and
[02:12.360 --> 02:16.440]  some police in that area as well now we're here back in September covering some of this
[02:16.440 --> 02:21.480]  stuff and we showed you just how easy it was to cross over the border and I did that dress
[02:21.480 --> 02:25.680]  as an ISIS jihadi as well so one of the things I'm looking for is a combat veteran being
[02:25.680 --> 02:31.680]  in Iraq and Afghanistan when I was in Iraq we basically lived two miles from a Taliban
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.440]  training camp not knowing that it was there in operation because all we could see on the
[02:36.440 --> 02:43.280]  ground were just these big mud walls we call Colots after the fact that we had some Kiowa
[02:43.280 --> 02:48.880]  pilots able to fly over they got footage showing that that was indeed a Taliban training camp
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.520]  so for 15 months we're out here deployed driving up and down the road not knowing what's behind
[02:53.520 --> 02:58.080]  it that's why we want to get out here fly over take a look see what's going on because
[02:58.080 --> 03:00.920]  a lot of the people who are going to live in an opera are not going to be able to see
[03:00.920 --> 03:04.680]  if there's anything beyond walls and that's what we're hoping to achieve here with this
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.080]  flight today to get a bird's-eye view and look down to see if we can find anything that
[03:09.080 --> 03:19.520]  is suspicious this is re-turning these effects this is like a full war and you make it all
[03:19.520 --> 03:26.000]  possible now as soon as we reach the altitude that we're going to be flying at before this
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.200]  emission to try to get video of these ISIS bases that could possibly be on the other
[03:30.200 --> 03:35.880]  side of El Paso in an opera we were able to get a little bit closer and see that the border
[03:35.880 --> 03:41.120]  stops off right where we were at on the ground earlier it does it right at the edge of a
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.800]  mountain every time just like we saw back in Arizona showing you how wide open these
[03:46.800 --> 03:52.680]  borders are this is a very serious problem and now we have ISIS at our doorstep one
[03:52.680 --> 03:56.800]  of the places that we saw that was really strange was this large compound that was empty
[03:56.800 --> 04:02.080]  in the middle with a big tower and just outside of it was a piece of pavement with a cross
[04:02.080 --> 04:06.520]  sticking out with what appears to be these burn marks all around it we're not sure what
[04:06.520 --> 04:11.160]  that is but from this high up it definitely looks a little strange and at one point we're
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.760]  able to go back and look at the footage and zoom in and we saw a truck that appeared to
[04:15.760 --> 04:22.040]  be leading a group of unknown amount of people marching across this desert area to the base
[04:22.040 --> 04:27.520]  of the mountain where quite frankly there is zero security whatsoever so this is why
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.320]  I've decided to go into Mexico this is why I want to get out there and get destroyed
[04:32.320 --> 04:37.080]  because we were unable to see anything from this high up so I want to get out there on
[04:37.080 --> 04:42.360]  the ground and try to find this ISIS camp that we've heard about so be sure to stay
[04:42.360 --> 04:49.680]  tuned tomorrow we're going to cross an undisclosed location for my safety this is extremely dangerous
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.400]  no one goes over there really especially a gringo like myself I'm going to try to be
[04:54.400 --> 04:59.000]  as cool calm and camouflage that's right pray for him he joins us in 30 minutes we
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.880]  all know the countless cases where young black men had drugs or guns planted on them by police
[05:03.880 --> 05:08.280]  now the tables have turned by a former black police officer Jeffrey Walker from Daily Mail
[05:08.280 --> 05:12.400]  a disgraced ex-police officer testifying against his drug squad colleagues acknowledged
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.840]  on Tuesday that he stole drug money planted evidence and lied on paperwork too many times
[05:16.840 --> 05:22.000]  to count his victims in his own words were white college boy khaki pants types who were
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.160]  easy to intimidate now that mr. Walker is out of a job maybe he should try his hand at
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.200]  the DEA apparently having wild sex parties and accepting gifts from drug dealers and
[05:30.200 --> 05:35.560]  working with the Sinaloa cartel is no big deal DEA head Michelle Leonhardt said I can't
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.900]  fire I can't recommend a penalty when asked why she is not fired or revoked the security
[05:39.900 --> 05:44.520]  clearance of agents named in the March 2015 OIG report which included an account of an
[05:44.520 --> 05:49.000]  agent hitting a prostitute in the face with a glass over a money dispute so mr. Walker
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  you can probably get a job with the biggest drug dealers on earth and continue your disreputable

[08:11.520 --> 08:17.120]  on their way it's chance of suffering dammit why because while the junction may be used
[08:17.120 --> 08:23.520]  loo of conversation words will always retain their power words offer the means to meaning
[08:23.520 --> 08:31.440]  and for those who listen the annunciation of truth there is something terribly wrong with
[08:31.440 --> 08:35.080]  this country isn't that you designed it sir you wanted it for a proof you told me every
[08:35.080 --> 08:40.760]  television in longer cruelty and intolerance and depression and where once you have the
[08:40.760 --> 08:45.920]  freedom to object to something can speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems
[08:45.920 --> 08:51.160]  of surveillance perversing your conformity and serve your submachine cameras how did
[08:51.160 --> 08:57.120]  this happen who's to blame certainly there are those who are more responsible than others
[08:57.120 --> 09:02.960]  they will be held accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you
[09:02.960 --> 09:09.960]  need only look into a mirror I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't
[09:09.960 --> 09:17.200]  be war terror disease there were a myriad of problems conspired to corrupt your reason
[09:17.200 --> 09:22.680]  and rob you of your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.960]  to the now high chancellor Adam Sutler he promised you order he promised you peace and all he
[09:28.960 --> 09:42.600]  demanded in return was your silent to obedient consent there is a war it's happening now
[09:42.600 --> 09:49.400]  we will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has come we are the resistance
[09:49.400 --> 09:57.720]  we are the info war thank you for joining us on this live worldwide Thursday the 16th
[09:57.720 --> 10:06.240]  the day of April 2015 to say that today is yet another incredible overload of key intel
[10:06.240 --> 10:12.000]  is basically putting it lightly I mean there is just so much that we're going to be getting
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.680]  to here I quite frankly don't know where to start Joe Biggs and Josh Owens our reporter
[10:18.680 --> 10:23.000]  with a pilot went into Mexico where judicial watch claims they have been told from the
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.560]  Mexican government and others that there are ISIS training camps and they found very suspicious
[10:27.560 --> 10:40.200]  looking facilities that they are now going to go in on foot and investigate in fact and
[10:40.200 --> 10:44.040]  I am letting them make their own decisions this is their mission should they choose to
[10:44.040 --> 10:49.240]  take it in fact I didn't even say go into Mexico I just said go down there get a plane
[10:49.240 --> 10:54.600]  investigate if you want to go in do it well they want to go in and they are reportedly
[10:54.600 --> 11:01.560]  going to be in place if the skype is working a few miles inside Mexico investigating live
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.480]  ladies and gentlemen you notice mainstream media doesn't do this nobody does this vice
[11:06.480 --> 11:11.560]  doesn't do this by the way we hope to get other people to start doing this it's not
[11:11.560 --> 11:18.560]  fun to always be on the tip of the spear and I'll tell you we're at the tip of the spear
[11:18.560 --> 11:23.600]  here at info wars and our reporters like Joe Biggs and others are right at the tip of the
[11:23.600 --> 11:28.200]  tip so pray for them because that's one of the most dangerous areas of Mexico where they
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.640]  are right now mass graves have been found all over the place by the hundreds and I mean
[11:32.640 --> 11:38.680]  hundreds of people per mass grave 50 people 60 people 30 people graves of children graves
[11:38.680 --> 11:48.640]  of women I don't know if they actually found a al-qaeda base I've blown up the video it
[11:48.640 --> 11:56.560]  looks more like if you can believe it even worse than that there's a lot of Satanism
[11:56.560 --> 12:01.160]  down there on the border and it looks like some type of if you don't live in Texas you
[12:01.160 --> 12:05.080]  don't know about this has been in Texas monthly Dallas morning news growing up they're always
[12:05.080 --> 12:09.160]  finding some pit with a couple hundred people dead with their hearts chopped out and it'll
[12:09.160 --> 12:14.920]  be a footnote in the newspaper that they were sacrificed with the drug cartels and the drug
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.200]  cartels will also grab men that they've been going after usually who were against the drug
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.200]  operations they'll try to torture them and if they can't break them the Satanists flip
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.800]  out so bad will then kill themselves it was a whole Texas monthly article about that when
[12:27.800 --> 12:31.640]  I was a teenager I remember my dad was reading it being blown away by it and then I read
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.600]  it and was just like this really goes on but if you don't live down here you don't know
[12:35.600 --> 12:43.720]  about it because it just sounds so crazy but the cartels are whacked out of their minds
[12:43.720 --> 12:49.320]  so I've been reviewing this morning the over the top HD footage they got when they flew
[12:49.320 --> 12:56.360]  down to about a thousand feet and were zoomed in this is human intelligence out there taking
[12:56.360 --> 13:03.120]  action Joe Biggs will join us with Josh Owens and I kind of told him I said maybe you shouldn't
[13:03.120 --> 13:06.960]  go in Mexico they're like now can we make the decision I said you can make the decision
[13:06.960 --> 13:14.440]  but it's obviously extremely dangerous so pray form books but that's Joe wants to get
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.760]  the mission done and Owens has you know been there with the feds threatened to shooting
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.640]  with David Knight they're at the bunny ranch situation they were at the front of the line
[13:23.640 --> 13:26.920]  there and they just have a lot of courage your great Americans and I'm really honored
[13:26.920 --> 13:30.360]  to be working with them I know you're honored to be associated with them as well as listeners
[13:30.360 --> 13:35.000]  and we're all together is just a Patriots that love freedom love America love to process
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.960]  love the family love the Second Amendment love justice love freedom love prosperity
[13:41.960 --> 13:47.320]  and are proud of the virtues of women are proud of the virtues of men our children we have
[13:47.320 --> 13:52.320]  a good view of humanity and a positive view and the truth is it's just like the allegory
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.040]  of Ifra Vendetta where the government at the top's bad and the police are oppressing
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.160]  the population but it's a police detective in the end that ends up helping bring the
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.400]  whole system down that's actually how history works it was members of the Stasi high level
[14:05.400 --> 14:11.400]  not going along with mowing down people at the Berlin Wall that made that finally happen
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.880]  and so truth will win in the end make no mistake history shows that that's what the global
[14:16.880 --> 14:23.880]  is trying to project an image of invincibility of invulnerability of infallibility they're
[14:23.880 --> 14:27.160]  not I want to give you an example of that before I get to the biggest news of the day
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.440]  that is over the top and confirms everything we thought and it's worse than we thought
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.920]  on the subject of preparing for war with the American people it's bad jade elms bad it's
[14:36.920 --> 14:40.800]  worse than we thought and things are moving very very quickly right now there's there's
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.480]  a reason they freaked out when we covered this we cover these military operations all the
[14:44.480 --> 14:49.440]  time they don't freak out and it's because we struck on something very big and we may
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.660]  be able to stop Obama and the globalists from pulling something but there's articles even
[14:53.660 --> 14:58.240]  mainstream news the elite are running around feverishly gearing up for something is the
[14:58.240 --> 15:03.240]  stock market collapse is it war with Russia is it war with Iran there's a lot of different
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.760]  crises out there but the preparations are to fight gun owners and veterans libertarians
[15:08.760 --> 15:17.200]  and conservatives and we've got new coast guard memos exclusively an info wars dot com
[15:17.200 --> 15:22.040]  say that if the American people try to repel a tyrannical takeover they actually say if
[15:22.040 --> 15:27.480]  we try to stop tearing they're going to take us out they actually use those words just
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.960]  like the army uses two years ago the word reeducation camp that's directly out of the
[15:31.960 --> 15:37.360]  Soviet Union they use the word that they're preparing reeducation camps you understand
[15:37.360 --> 15:44.920]  that's declassified do you understand having got to the new stuff yet but it's freaking
[15:44.920 --> 15:50.440]  me out they use the word reeducation camp and how to process us by our social security
[15:50.440 --> 16:00.320]  numbers when they were hiring camp guards for civil unrest in America on Fez biz ops
[16:00.320 --> 16:06.360]  website and they just hope that you're too lazy to go check it out for yourself I mean
[16:06.360 --> 16:11.160]  this is twilight zone there's no reason any of this has to happen it's illegal it's over
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.520]  the top but so is everything else so is opening the borders so is the NSA spying on us it's
[16:15.520 --> 16:24.400]  crazy but we're run by a bunch of people that worship Frank Marshall Davis and the weatherman
[16:24.400 --> 16:27.960]  I mean do you understand that they're sitting there with America they can't stop they want
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.160]  to break it they hate it they want to break it it's not that America's ever been perfect
[16:32.160 --> 16:38.520]  but my god compared to George Soros and a bunch of weirdos man I mean the hedge of protection
[16:38.520 --> 16:45.280]  around this country's dropping speaking though of how the evil will fall the the TSA is meant
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.040]  to be a nationwide takeover force with checkpoints on the highways you'll have to get a waiver
[16:49.040 --> 16:54.760]  by them to have any job at 711 or as a cattle rancher or as a teacher anything told you
[16:54.760 --> 16:59.640]  that 14 years ago as I watched a two-hour cabinet meeting on C-span where they're all
[16:59.640 --> 17:05.000]  here now you see it's all happening the good news is they don't grow up under 12 year olds
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.360]  or put them in the scanners because of lawsuits they're backing off at many airports because
[17:10.360 --> 17:13.480]  everybody knows the borders are wide open it's all security theater and more and more
[17:13.480 --> 17:18.520]  agents are going public former TSA agent unleashed these are all on drudgereport.com let's punch
[17:18.520 --> 17:26.120]  drudgereport.com up for TV viewers radio listeners go there this is the fall of the TSA facade
[17:26.120 --> 17:30.640]  it's it's beginning and it'll take years for it to fully implode but you you can stick a
[17:30.640 --> 17:36.280]  fork in it they're going to be done very quickly the fire is hot the stakes are on they're
[17:36.280 --> 17:45.140]  almost done former TSA agent unleashed groping scandal as business as usual abuse of passengers
[17:45.140 --> 17:50.720]  daily occurs many hands on people's private parts naked body scanners useless they're
[17:50.720 --> 17:55.120]  not useless to Chertoff who company made three billion he made up something like fifty something
[17:55.120 --> 17:59.800]  million himself it's pretty good job to order those as they had a homeland security and one
[17:59.800 --> 18:05.400]  year later leave office and take delivery of the cash you like if I was the governor
[18:05.400 --> 18:11.040]  and I ordered something that costs you know in Texas fifty million dollars and then I
[18:11.040 --> 18:15.040]  retire a year later come the head of the company when the money comes in and delivery happens
[18:15.040 --> 18:19.680]  then I get part of it I mean it's totally criminal conflict of interest but there it
[18:19.680 --> 18:23.880]  is the facade's dropping we told you they draw you out of line on purpose to grope you
[18:23.880 --> 18:29.480]  and harass you pedophiles go after kids pervs go after women of the gay pervs go after other
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.640]  men people like what are you homophobic yeah you know what see that's how they now the gay
[18:33.640 --> 18:36.640]  person wants to grow up it's okay because they're gay no it's wrong if somebody wants
[18:36.640 --> 18:41.520]  to grow up a kid you want to grow up a woman or a man I don't care pedophilia things even
[18:41.520 --> 18:48.400]  worse obviously because they're children so tech dirt TSA's investigation to groping agents
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.440]  insured they wouldn't be prosecuted and see it's in tech dirt that's good news I mean
[18:54.440 --> 19:00.280]  it's hardcore technology news but I would even call it mainstream it's huge but why is that
[19:00.280 --> 19:04.240]  what is being reported it should be on every channel out there you know when it finally
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.520]  does break though they'll try to get more funding and quote have training kind of like
[19:08.520 --> 19:12.400]  the VA got more funding for death panels for trips and then they just keep the death panels
[19:12.400 --> 19:16.840]  going it's like they won't fill the potholes but then they always want to increase city
[19:16.840 --> 19:21.800]  funding then they still won't fill the potholes but it's all about they have certain tactics
[19:21.800 --> 19:28.040]  they run you know the Vatican is holding an exorcism training course we all experience

[33:43.280 --> 33:49.160]  11 the gentleman flew his sesson into the White House grounds and crashed it and if you follow
[33:49.160 --> 33:54.120]  the copycat effect this is going to be happening a lot more as the media obsesses on this and
[33:54.120 --> 33:58.640]  covers this the thing to do will then be to crawl under the White House fence like a four
[33:58.640 --> 34:04.880]  year old did a few days ago hey Alex Munner correction of the capital on capital on that's
[34:04.880 --> 34:13.320]  right I'm going from memory so September 11 1994 was the capital on not the White House
[34:13.320 --> 34:19.160]  though somebody else flew a plane landed at the White House if I remember correctly though
[34:19.160 --> 34:27.320]  that was Frank Eugene quarter I guess that crashed into the capital on but that's the
[34:27.320 --> 34:31.800]  type of news we've got swirling around out there signs that the elites are feverishly
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.480]  preparing for something big what is the world what in the world are the elite up to that's

[34:57.800 --> 35:01.680]  ties into our story with Joe Beggs we're about to break down even the third amendment is
[35:01.680 --> 35:09.280]  dead police forcibly occupy home to gain tactical advantage against suspect yeah I think you
[35:09.280 --> 35:14.680]  should let the police in if there's like a hostage situation or something next door but
[35:14.680 --> 35:19.560]  they shouldn't be able to force you out it's just a property rights issue and people say
[35:19.560 --> 35:24.120]  I'll be reasonable well it always in history becomes unreasonable when you don't have the

[35:47.880 --> 35:52.800]  at all of that Russia blames us for security crisis turmoil in Ukraine actually you should
[35:52.800 --> 35:59.520]  blame George Soros I saw a clip that I meant to give you that Gary French he sent me George
[35:59.520 --> 36:07.320]  Soros a few days ago at a conference it's video I think the headline is George Soros
[36:07.320 --> 36:12.800]  says global government in trouble but really if you watch the clip he goes we've got the
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.080]  crisis of the Middle East the crisis in Ukraine and other crises and the answer is more global
[36:17.080 --> 36:22.440]  government global governance by these people in their end game taking over right now is
[36:22.440 --> 36:28.840]  what's causing all of it and it's always give us more power we'll fix it got a big autism
[36:28.840 --> 36:36.040]  problem the answer is more glyphosate a new MIT study just came out saying that by 2025
[36:36.040 --> 36:42.120]  half of children will be autistic and they fingered glyphosate well it's a cocktail but
[36:42.120 --> 36:47.240]  we know that by the third round of shots with boys who have a weaker blood brain barrier
[36:47.240 --> 36:53.000]  of a medical doctor scientist brain surgeons on about this that autism and boys is seven
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.400]  times more common and they're 18 months old at the third round and junior never talks
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.800]  again or he screams cuss words at you for the rest of your life or good you know just
[37:01.800 --> 37:10.680]  makes chirping sounds and I tell you it's very very sad what's happened to these children
[37:10.680 --> 37:17.440]  especially when they become 200 pound adults and are not inhibited they have credible strength
[37:17.440 --> 37:25.040]  50% will have autism how's that sound oh nothing's going on the elite don't want to hurt us
[37:25.040 --> 37:30.760]  everything's fine if we just support armored vehicles on the streets we'll be safe no that
[37:30.760 --> 37:38.160]  is to control the population as we're imploded into poverty for social engineering now after
[37:38.160 --> 37:42.440]  Joe Biggs leaves us here in a moment holders gunband lists targets veterans I'm going to
[37:42.440 --> 37:49.360]  tell that article military bulletin labels patriot groups militia domestic terrorists
[37:49.360 --> 37:56.440]  they say break for April 19 terror attacks like the one that the Clintons ran in 1995
[37:56.440 --> 38:01.360]  I mean we know the names of the feds we have their hotel receipts world net daily broke
[38:01.360 --> 38:08.560]  it a judicial watch local news when we know who did it who planted the bombs what went
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.080]  on who they set up the cops they killed to cover it up I mean it's open and shut I could
[38:13.080 --> 38:18.960]  go into a jury and put on two days of evidence and then say go ahead and put on your defense
[38:18.960 --> 38:32.680]  guaranteed death penalties guaranteed open and shut I didn't put on the stand the cops
[38:32.680 --> 38:38.320]  like Don Browning the head of the canine unit highly decorated Marine Corps veteran Vietnam
[38:38.320 --> 38:42.600]  when they came to his office and then another time at the water cooler the FBI said you
[38:42.600 --> 38:48.360]  keep investigating you and your wife are dead oh these are very nice people and again the
[38:48.360 --> 38:53.560]  general FBI is even involved it was a special White House run cadres and you know who was
[38:53.560 --> 39:01.960]  running that unit the outgoing he's been out going for a year attorney general Eric older
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.040]  the same one who ran the other false flag of fast and furious and got caught and see
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.600]  the underwear bombing fast and furious the chemical attacks against Assad you blamed
[39:10.600 --> 39:16.120]  on Assad you got caught turned out it was Saudi Arabian nerve gas launched by Al Qaeda
[39:16.120 --> 39:22.120]  aka ISIS everything you do you don't have the Midas touch you have the Mr. Hankey touch
[39:22.120 --> 39:30.160]  we all know Mr. Hankey is on South Park everything you touch turns to Bravo Sierra the tricks
[39:30.160 --> 39:38.360]  don't work no more but yeah you're still in control out of power for now so just keep
[39:38.360 --> 39:45.400]  on going because here's the deal you can't just take me out now and take out a few hundred
[39:45.400 --> 39:53.040]  people and have this stop the blueprints the game plan the playbook is out and people are
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.480]  going I guess Alex isn't that smart actually he was just going off what they said they
[39:57.480 --> 40:02.000]  did and I guess it is all obvious I just didn't have the courage to admit it but folks now
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.480]  do understand it's not about courage it's about survival there is no debate about what's
[40:08.480 --> 40:12.800]  going on here we're in the hands of total criminals but I've learned one thing in this
[40:12.800 --> 40:18.720]  world only thing that gives orders to quote Tony Montana is way those and the globalist
[40:18.720 --> 40:29.840]  have had some big arrogant put spa bravada filled eggs but it's not working anymore ladies
[40:29.840 --> 40:35.840]  and gentlemen because they thought we were all just scared of them no people were lazy
[40:35.840 --> 40:39.760]  and people were fat and happy but now they've been pushed enough to kind of look around
[40:39.760 --> 40:46.080]  and go oh my god and it's past now the laziness they're going we're in danger a fire has been
[40:46.080 --> 40:49.720]  led under the bus and then these clips are coming up bloggers compared to ISIS during
[40:49.720 --> 40:55.160]  congressional hearing just mainline bloggers are terrorists we must be shut down to show
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.960]  you where these criminals in government are going but but there are good people in Congress
[41:01.960 --> 41:05.600]  there are good people in the FBI there are good people in the White House even I happen
[41:05.600 --> 41:10.880]  to know that there are good people in every party there are good people in every city
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.760]  and town in the corporations in the system they're the ones that give us the information
[41:15.760 --> 41:21.760]  we were given the information from the Coast Guard and they're freaking out they're actually
[41:21.760 --> 41:29.520]  saying veterans are going to blow stuff up everybody I talked to knows I told the story
[41:29.520 --> 41:32.760]  we're going to Joe Biggs about I was at the Travis County SWAT team offices they invited
[41:32.760 --> 41:36.560]  me over on time because I was next door yelling at the county commissioners they said come
[41:36.560 --> 41:40.240]  on Alex just come over here and have a cup of coffee with us and it was just look patriot
[41:40.240 --> 41:45.640]  literature new American magazine Oklahoma City cover up videos people say well I bet
[41:45.640 --> 41:49.400]  that's because they were watching you guys know they weren't it's the local newscast
[41:49.400 --> 41:53.880]  of the bombs that didn't go off and the witnesses to the bombs and who planted them and the
[41:53.880 --> 41:57.880]  head of the HUD department seeing the men who did it she said what are you doing oh we're
[41:57.880 --> 42:03.000]  putting in telephone lines and there were big gray sticks of butter and McVeigh was with
[42:03.000 --> 42:12.360]  them FBI ATF and CIA connected German intelligence operatives now I'm going to stop right there
[42:12.360 --> 42:18.400]  I'm going to stop right there I'm going to go to Joe Biggs on the border and Joe for
[42:18.400 --> 42:21.040]  security reasons obviously you're in a very dangerous area the border one of the most
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.240]  dangerous in the country there by El Paso in Mexico you did an amazing HD overflight
[42:26.240 --> 42:30.880]  that will roll some footage of while you're talking in the background tell us exactly
[42:30.880 --> 42:35.000]  what you saw what unfolded and I don't want to say what you're planning next you wouldn't
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.720]  even say whether you'd be in Mexico now or wouldn't be in Mexico looks to me like you're
[42:38.720 --> 42:44.520]  right on the border with Mexico former staff sergeant in the Army Joe Biggs really fighting
[42:44.520 --> 42:49.240]  for the Republic now out there with our info war is a veteran Josh Owens so go ahead Joe
[42:49.240 --> 42:56.520]  Biggs Joe Biggs info wars.com we're sending out here on the border of El Paso and Juarez
[42:56.520 --> 43:00.720]  yesterday we had the opportunity to fly over in a small Cessna and get some aerial footage
[43:00.720 --> 43:08.360]  of the cities of Juarez and Napa on the other side of the mountain ranges behind me and
[43:08.360 --> 43:13.280]  what we saw were a few suspicious things we saw a truck that was actually leading what
[43:13.280 --> 43:19.880]  seemed to be four or five adults towards the range where there is no fence whatsoever so
[43:19.880 --> 43:23.360]  that could have been like a possible coyote leading these guys to the area where they
[43:23.360 --> 43:28.160]  could cross over in that area it would be easy to get over because the border fence ends
[43:28.160 --> 43:31.240]  right at the edge of the mountain and then there's nothing there you don't see anything
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.760]  for about a mile or so and there's a lot of deep crevices out there because we walked
[43:35.760 --> 43:41.280]  out there on foot before we went up on the plane we saw a few places like compounds things
[43:41.280 --> 43:45.040]  you would see over in Iraq but the big outside walls that you wouldn't be able to see from
[43:45.040 --> 43:49.320]  the ground level that you would only be able to see from the air which look a lot like
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.760]  what we called colots in Iraq and Afghanistan so those are the kind of the key places that
[43:53.760 --> 43:59.600]  I want to look at if I'm able to get over in there today on the ground so today my plan
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.600]  is to get over there and try to take a look around in an opera the thing is though the
[44:04.600 --> 44:08.520]  driver's a little sketchy right now he's been calling us kind of saying he's scared to do
[44:08.520 --> 44:12.200]  this I'm trying to push him and get him a little bit more comfortable to be willing
[44:12.200 --> 44:16.520]  to pick me up at the border because I'm going to walk over what we've been told so far as
[44:16.520 --> 44:22.040]  I'm able to go about 15 miles into the border without a passport but the funny thing is
[44:22.040 --> 44:27.360]  is what we're hearing now is that in order for me to come back I need a passport and
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.560]  I don't have one of those yet I'm so ain't no mind to come in so that's the weird thing
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.720]  the guy who's going to come get me doesn't have a passport he can come both sides back
[44:36.720 --> 44:41.720]  and forth whatsoever but me being a gringo a white boy here in America it makes me hard
[44:41.720 --> 44:45.320]  to even get back into my own country or if you are black or Hispanic or Asian and American
[44:45.320 --> 44:49.960]  you don't have the same rights as the illegals and to be clear your military ID just expired
[44:49.960 --> 44:54.000]  so you haven't gotten a passport yet you've got that in right now something that we hadn't
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.200]  really thought about Joe's let's get that done immediately when you get back but separately
[44:59.200 --> 45:03.400]  you know a photo ID should be enough for them they'll just run it and prove that you're
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.960]  a US citizen that's what we're hoping for so I mean we're going to go down there and
[45:07.960 --> 45:12.600]  I'm not going to say what entrance I'm going in there's a number of entrances into a Juarez
[45:12.600 --> 45:18.680]  and other parts surrounding this area Josh has his right Josh has his yeah he's got one
[45:18.680 --> 45:21.960]  yeah but that's a whole story end of itself you know won't let an American citizen in
[45:21.960 --> 45:26.320]  with his driver's license but the illegals are allowed to drive back and forth yeah exactly
[45:26.320 --> 45:30.400]  I mean the fact that we're just trying to go over there and find out whether or not this
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.640]  there there's an ISIS base or not you know if I get hassled for something like that you
[45:34.640 --> 45:39.080]  know that's just crazy well let's be clear that's I mean this area you're going in is
[45:39.080 --> 45:43.880]  a major smuggling drug route in fact they say it's probably the most dangerous area on the
[45:43.880 --> 45:48.720]  border the 2200 mile border for those that don't know we can pull up some of the headlines
[45:48.720 --> 45:54.360]  the massive mass graves that they find on a routine basis right over where you're about
[45:54.360 --> 46:00.000]  to go pretty creepy Joe so you don't have to do this this is and you sure that you and
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.960]  Josh want to try to go over there and try to actually find this ISIS base yeah I'm
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.240]  going to go do it I've got this I've got a couple of friends in this area they're going
[46:09.240 --> 46:14.800]  to help me out and Josh is actually going to stay back here as a support with a radio
[46:14.800 --> 46:19.320]  so that way if something does happen I can contact him immediately and he can notify
[46:19.320 --> 46:22.920]  the proper authorities in case something happens because if we both go over there and something
[46:22.920 --> 46:27.760]  happens then we're pretty much screwed so I'm just going to go over there and try to get
[46:27.760 --> 46:31.280]  this done myself so it always happens in the movies the people split up we probably should
[46:31.280 --> 46:36.360]  have sent three people down there or four well the more the more the more of us that
[46:36.360 --> 46:40.440]  look like me and the same vehicle the more suspicious that vehicle is going to look so
[46:40.440 --> 46:45.040]  I'm going to be kind of buried around a few people in there and hopefully we can get this
[46:45.040 --> 46:50.960]  done all right well great job Joe and obviously I don't want to say anymore because I don't
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.960]  want to give any more information on but if the government won't do their job we will
[46:54.960 --> 47:01.800]  judicial watch is very accurate throughout the years doesn't well all the local news
[47:01.800 --> 47:05.640]  agencies in this area for the past few days keeps saying that now this is not true it's
[47:05.640 --> 47:10.680]  not true you know but meanwhile we get reports eventually from border patrol where they're
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.360]  catching these guys coming over the border so I just think it's I think it's too early
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.800]  to go ahead and say that it's not true when they obviously don't know we actually we have
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.600]  proof that these guys have been crossing in places like McAllen and Brownsville why not
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.480]  in an area like this if it was going to be ISIS if they were going to cross over why
[47:28.480 --> 47:32.960]  would you cross over in Brownsville where there's nothing when there's electric grids
[47:32.960 --> 47:36.840]  here there's UTEP there's a military I just thought of something the head of Northcom
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.640]  said that ISIS is in the Caribbean and that they're worried about infiltrating up from
[47:41.640 --> 47:45.360]  Central and South America through Mexico that was a month ago can we put that headline on
[47:45.360 --> 47:50.240]  screen head of Northcom is worried about ISIS infiltrating the Caribbean and Latin America
[47:50.240 --> 47:56.600]  through Texas so again the the local media and the national media and the Obama media
[47:56.600 --> 48:03.560]  keeps lying we know the second largest group of other than Mexicans because Mexicans Chinese
[48:03.560 --> 48:08.320]  and and and then it's Middle Easterners are the third largest group that are being caught
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.680]  thousands a month in that sector so you got thousands a month you got congressmen bringing
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.840]  it up you've got Northcom saying it you've got the FBI down there investigating and then
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.040]  you've got ICE who's not invited in fact I have a new judicial watch article here Joe
[48:22.040 --> 48:27.360]  FBI holds special meeting in Juarez to address ISIS DHS not invited that's because the top
[48:27.360 --> 48:33.240]  of DHS is completely run by a bunch of Ford Foundation you know Bill Ayers types well
[48:33.240 --> 48:36.760]  the thing I don't understand is the fact that the FBI will come out and say that there is
[48:36.760 --> 48:41.440]  ISIS in all 50 states but it's completely mind-blowing to think that they could be over
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.400]  here in this area whatsoever so I mean if they can be in every 50 say here why couldn't
[48:46.400 --> 48:52.920]  they be over here as well absolutely you're you're totally accurate on that and again
[48:52.920 --> 48:55.960]  we're going to pull up those articles maybe it was the head of Southcom I know it's an
[48:55.960 --> 49:01.880]  admiral head of Southcom it was about two months ago says that ISIS is coming into
[49:01.880 --> 49:07.080]  Latin America and infiltrating up and that that is one of their biggest concerns I mean
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.440]  that was AP Reuters that actually got a lot of attention I want to get that on screen
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.120]  I become very obsessive compulsive about putting everything we talk about up on screen I want
[49:16.120 --> 49:21.200]  to put the article up on screen well that's what makes us stand above the others Alex
[49:21.200 --> 49:25.520]  is the fact that we show proof about what we're talking about whereas these local medias
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.200]  regurgitate whatever their force fed by DHS and other government officials I mean there's
[49:30.200 --> 49:36.120]  a local congressman around here who apparently in a Gateway Pundit article threatened the
[49:36.120 --> 49:42.840]  local border patrol and agents around here because they were they were basically feeding
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.520]  information to judicial watch and what he was saying is basically that information is
[49:47.520 --> 49:51.960]  true and it doesn't need to be out there and said that these people would be fired or spend
[49:51.960 --> 49:56.520]  time in jail if they continue to speak with judicial watch and get this information out
[49:56.520 --> 50:01.000]  here and this is the same congressman I can't remember his full name like Beto something
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.440]  or Bezos he actually spoke with the local ABC affiliate today and sent them a letter
[50:06.440 --> 50:12.360]  saying that all these allegations of ISIS being over in an opera war is in south of
[50:12.360 --> 50:18.080]  the border are just completely and totally false well Joe I just pulled up the Newsweek
[50:18.080 --> 50:23.160]  headline general warns of ISIS fighters entering US through Caribbean and he goes on to say
[50:23.160 --> 50:27.560]  through Mexico and that's the United States Southern command Northcom came out a week
[50:27.560 --> 50:32.200]  later so we were right on both counts and said the same thing stay there Joe Biggs reporting
[50:32.200 --> 50:38.320]  with Josh Owens from right on the Mexican-Texas border this is all coming up and then we'll
[50:38.320 --> 50:47.120]  also pull up the headline FBI ISIS operating in all 50 states and listen they're recruiting
[50:47.120 --> 50:51.600]  jihadis all over the world most of them come from the west this is real folks this could
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.720]  be what Obama uses to bring in martial law we're trying to blow this operation wide open
[50:55.720 --> 51:03.160]  hi this is Ted Anderson have you ever wondered why banks stockbrokers investment advisors

[54:33.840 --> 54:41.200]  newsweek articles and others with south com north com the fbi shang ices pouring in but
[54:41.200 --> 54:45.860]  then local news the obama ministration say we're liars we're conspiracy theorist when
[54:45.860 --> 54:51.440]  judicial watch has all these sources confirming that it's going on i mean this is out of control
[54:51.440 --> 54:57.280]  and bare minimum we know ices other groups fund themselves in human trafficking i have
[54:57.280 --> 55:02.480]  no doubt they're there probably just smuggling regular Arabs and Muslims in who don't know
[55:02.480 --> 55:06.080]  how to speak Spanish basically and we know that they've linked up with the cartels that's
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.240]  been in the news for years and are funding themselves now through narcotics trafficking
[55:10.240 --> 55:13.480]  and i just can't believe our government is going to allow this to basically grow and
[55:13.480 --> 55:18.440]  go on down there what do you think the hope is by higher ups because i don't know how
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.240]  they're going to spend an ices attack in this country when they left the borders wide open
[55:22.240 --> 55:26.560]  joe biggs i mean i don't know how they're going to pull it off quite honestly but i mean it
[55:26.560 --> 55:30.320]  seems like it's something they're trying to do you know i i i think of something like
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.880]  that does happen especially we've been saying this for for years and it's a possibility if
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.320]  something like that does happen i mean it's just going to be all out chaos you know especially
[55:39.320 --> 55:43.040]  in an area like this i mean we've got the largest tank division to my right quite a
[55:43.040 --> 55:47.240]  few miles away you know it'd be very hard for something like that for these guys to
[55:47.240 --> 55:50.720]  launch an assault right here but i mean if they're going to do it you know these guys
[55:50.720 --> 55:55.560]  really don't care they're pure evil you know like i said our government is dr frankenstein
[55:55.560 --> 55:59.640]  these guys are the monster they created quite frankly they've gotten out of control and
[55:59.640 --> 56:06.240]  for some reason our government still funds them still drops some ammunition and weapons
[56:06.240 --> 56:10.400]  so i mean it's just mind blowing i mean it's so hard to tell what it is they're trying
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.200]  to pull off here but i mean it's just disgusting all right well i've talked to you off air
[56:15.200 --> 56:22.200]  you've got a pretty good plan and so the pucker factor into serious around us we're worried
[56:22.200 --> 56:26.560]  about you obviously because folks this really is the most dangerous area of mexico probably
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.240]  the most dangerous i mean we can pull up headlines about all the mass graves out there and then
[56:31.240 --> 56:35.960]  killing us tourists that just stray across there i mean it's it's it's bad but joe's
[56:35.960 --> 56:41.800]  got a good plan uh there's a headline nobody especially the government knows how many mass
[56:41.800 --> 56:46.840]  graves have been found in mexico joe how when do you plan to be out of there because i want
[56:46.840 --> 56:50.720]  to talk to you immediately as soon as you get out of there and know you're okay because
[56:50.720 --> 56:54.200]  i'm going to be standing around the telephone and won't be able to get anything else done
[56:54.200 --> 56:58.920]  until we know that um well i don't want to give a time as to when i'm going to be going
[56:58.920 --> 57:03.520]  over specifically but you're going to be done done today or yeah i mean i'm only going
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.680]  to go over for about an hour and uh because that area where they're suspected at isn't
[57:08.680 --> 57:12.400]  that big of an area so i should be able to get around there pretty quick within an hour
[57:12.400 --> 57:17.120]  and get back over here all right well we'll be backing you up here and obviously then

[57:40.160 --> 57:47.080]  operations that's why there's mexican marinos over on our side this is just ridiculous and

[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:58.920]  got a plan this is a pretty good plan to go ahead uh but you don't see mainline reporters down there
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.840]  for a good reason and then there's commenters on the video like children going better be proof by

[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:50.600]  but i just love how people sitting there at their keyboards are talking about our reporters down

[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.520]  that shawty arabia was involved but there was a ordered stand down through the entire system
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:00.520]  and now we have the new york post to attack 9-11 truthers with the headline yesterday
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.280]  how the fbi is whitewashing the saudi connection in 9-11 and then goes back to it see they always
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.160]  frame 9-11 truth is that you're saying like wiley coyote they actually said this uh this
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.800]  was a talking point they used that the bush is used but then chris mathews of hardball used
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:25.480]  that i quote alex jones quote believes this is a quote a talking point it's been newspapers
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:30.840]  that like wiley coyote george w bush had a detonator plunger and blew up the world trade
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.240]  centers no i never said that i said criminal elements working at the international level
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:43.080]  had drills that day ordered to stand down and then you extrapolate out to the al qaeda being
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:48.360]  allowed into the country the cia threatening the visa section to let them in saying they really work
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:54.200]  for us uh colonel steven butler of the defense language school saying some of these guys trained
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:10:01.240]  at my base you add all that together we know we're being lied to so we're simply saying the official
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.840]  story isn't true and that's been proven and because we don't know exactly what happened then you can
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:13.400]  debate all day like i've done it like clue that's how you figure out an investigation what really
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:19.960]  happened and i'll ask michael springman j michael springman uh his view he has a new book out that
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.960]  i just started reading uh reading and i even learned something from it and i've studied this
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:32.760]  in depth visas for al qaeda cia handouts that rock the world an insider's view and the book is now
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.960]  available he's a former u.s diplomat exposes the leadership and policies that spawned a deadly
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:42.200]  international conflict and killed over a million iraqis springman holds degrees from american
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.600]  university georgetown university and catholic university of america he currently practices law
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:53.320]  in washington dc again springman serves the u.s state department government is diplomat state

[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.200]  the u.s commerce department he left federal services and currently practices law in the washington dc
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:10.920]  area michael springman dot com michael springman two ends at the end dot com will tweet out his
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.960]  book and website right now please at real alex jones please retweet that talk about courage
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:22.440]  he blew it wide open in a few canadian british and us papers and german papers but it was
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.560]  shut down everywhere else we got him on the air going back 14 years ago 15 10 anniversaries coming
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:33.960]  up and he was one of the key people to expose what happened and tie that in today with judicial watch
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.000]  who covered what he said back then fbi holds special meaning and war as to address isis
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.120]  dhs not invited there's another headline general warns the head of south com of isis fighters
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.040]  entering the u.s through caribbean he says they get into the caribbean and get in through mexico
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:58.040]  that's newsweek so understand what happened on 9 11 is replaying again and good fbi tried to expose
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:03.880]  the people training not to land the planes or takeoff in minneapolis and in phoenix and in
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:10.760]  dalas and got made to stand down so this is going on the government's not our enemy criminal
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.480]  elements within it that are exploiting this to launch wars and take our liberties are in my view
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:21.240]  now i'm done with that preface mr springman great to have you back after many years i think we're
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.720]  on about six years ago and then 14 years ago but god bless you for your incredible courage
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.800]  and for continuing to stand up and writing this book i know you're a successful lawyer
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.200]  in your own right don't need to you know write a book but i'm glad you've written this testament
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.160]  as a witness to what you saw thank you so much sir well thank you for having me on the program
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.200]  i'm delighted to be able to speak to your audience and to do my best to answer any questions you
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.400]  might have well let's do this let's let you quarter back at it first take us back to 9 11
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.680]  walk us through the book and then give us your take on what you think's currently happening
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.320]  because boy isn't it pertinent today how our government funded uh the free Syrian army that
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.840]  was really al-qaeda now they're isis uh and now we were told al-qaeda and muslim extremists were
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:09.640]  defeated now it's a bigger threat than ever three wars later yeah it's basically changing their brand
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.960]  names uh when i was in jeta and oh that's more than 20 years ago now uh i was being pressured
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:21.400]  to issue visas to people that had no ties to either Saudi Arabia or to their own country
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:26.680]  they couldn't explain why they were going to america and i was being ordered by jay frayers
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:32.920]  the consul general who some suspected working for the central intelligence agency and other
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:39.960]  people with the consulate to issue these visas um never gave me an explanation why if they had uh
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:46.680]  conceivably i would have been dumb enough to um uh issue the visas that they wanted uh on the basis
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:50.600]  of why i work for the federal government you work for the federal government this is a federal
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:57.000]  government uh interest i'll do it but no they couldn't do that so after i was out of the foreign
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.280]  service and back in dc uh we had september 11th and uh joe trender the journalists who tipped me
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:09.320]  off to what they were really doing recruiting the mujahideen to fight the soviets in afghanistan
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.080]  to go to the federal government to go to the department of justice and the fbi and say this
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.360]  is what it was really going on this is where you guys ought to look and i was passed from
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:25.880]  office to office to office and finally the washington field office for the fbi said
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:32.600]  oh we'll call you back well that was 14 years ago since then i've been speaking out on this
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:41.560]  i've been writing about this and aside from the canadian broadcast and corporation rye uh rt um
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:50.280]  and uh a german journalist uh i've been ignored by the american press the mainstream media the
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:56.280]  thawning corporate media as rebecca calls it well they certainly are fawning and if you
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.960]  just joined us visas for al-qaeda cia handouts that rock the world j michael springman let's
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.600]  let's go back and look at this because do you feel vindicated now before we walk through it
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.080]  that you do have the head of the 911 commission coming out saying they basically covered up stood
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.800]  down for saudi arabia i mean that's that that that's complicity right there and it's now even in the
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:22.840]  new york post that demonized anyone including firefighters and police that question 911 well
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.400]  it makes me feel a bit better but then you've got to look at the fact that uh they've kept a
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:33.880]  lid on this for 20 years or more now uh they've ruined people's lives they've mocked them in print
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:41.800]  and so forth so uh it's better but uh the wheels still haven't still haven't come off the wagon
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.320]  and nobody's in jail and nobody's been executed well i want to give you the floor right now as
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.360]  best you can tell break down exactly what happened with the hijackers what your colleagues tried to
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:59.160]  do what you reported on and exposed and then all these years later what do you think really
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:07.320]  happened on 911 okay well going back to me in jeta uh i had gotten the strange conversation with
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:12.120]  then american ambassador walter cutler who was in town for consultations with state department
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:18.040]  officials and uh one of the people from the the saudi desk the people who follow what's going
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.400]  on in a given country uh called me and said cutlers in town do you want to say hello to him
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:30.680]  i say yeah sure i figured it'd be a five minute hello and goodbye session and he spends 45 minutes
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:36.040]  talking to me about all the problems that my predecessor gretta holts had created for the
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:43.240]  embassy in riyadh she was refusing visas so he said to the servants of rich saudi women they're
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:48.040]  seamstresses hairdressers and all these other factotums and they just couldn't travel without them
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.960]  and i thought he's telling me something but i have actually no idea what he's telling me
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:00.920]  so when this was over i talked to the desk officer and i said what was that all about
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:07.640]  he said i have no idea cutler was just a queer duck well i get off the jeta get all this i'm
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:12.680]  welcome with oakum norms people tell me uh you're such an improvement over gretta holts she was such
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.840]  a bitch she was a troublemaker and nobody could get along with her and so forth well after a bit
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:25.320]  i started getting pressure on issuing visas that people who weren't qualified uh one guy or actually
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.920]  two pakistanis i think were going to a trade show and they couldn't name the trade show in the united
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:38.520]  states and couldn't tell me what city was located in but paul arvid trade tv it a case officer according
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:46.040]  to um namebase.org uh who was working undercover at the commercial section called me and demanded
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:51.400]  visas for these guys and i said no they hadn't proved that they have any compelling reason
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.920]  to come back either to Saudi arabia or their own country so then he calls justice given named
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.240]  stevens the head of the consular section and got these guys their visas and this pretty much went
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:10.600]  on for the 18 months or so that i was in jeta nobody could explain this um and the odd thing was
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:20.440]  eric walkenbush the um keo al ken b ush the head of the cia base at the consulate uh he came to me
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:26.440]  and said mike we've got this iranian agent we want him in washington for consultations uh we
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:34.360]  really need to have him there uh can you issue a visa wink wink well the guy had a clean passport
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:40.600]  he had previous visas to go to the united states in it he was working at a running in fact the family
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:47.160]  had a um uh oriental rug shop in the town and he was going to visit clients he had their names
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.640]  there on a sheet of paper on company litterhead he talked about what he was going to do there he
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:57.240]  answered all my questions and i issued him a visa and i said good god send me more people like him
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.480]  and i still to this day don't know why qualkenbush tipped me the link about this guy
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:10.120]  but said not a word about all these other people who uh were really sleazy characters that the
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:15.880]  agency was sending uh to the us for training to send on to afghanistan to the war against the
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:22.120]  soviets so that's why you say this went on 20 years because this was happening even before 9 11
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.760]  now fast forward from my memory you end up leaving but then you've talked to colleagues and find out
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:32.120]  they were told the same thing with mohammed adda and others walk us through that okay well um
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:39.720]  once i was out i heard from joe trento the journalist uh who follows national security
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:45.000]  issues that the real reason they wanted visas for these guys was to send them to afghanistan
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.560]  they were creating the mocha head in and i said that's why they got so bad when i refused the
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:58.360]  visas and i started researching i started writing letters i sent letters to uh everybody involved
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:03.960]  including joseph peo neal the so-called inspector who came out into and really wanted me to tell
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:09.800]  him what was going on in jeta and he said i'll protect you and he didn't he passed the word to
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:17.160]  the state department and the cia uh of whom i think he uh was a member uh to get rid of me
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:23.240]  and i had nothing but trouble after that once i was out of state and after i talked to trento uh
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.600]  i had written an article about this published in covert action quarterly uh the hand that rules
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:37.240]  the visa machine rocks the world uh this got me a few interviews and um i tried after that to learn
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.360]  exactly why i had been thrown out of state i filed a freedom of information act request
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:53.000]  and a freedom of information act lawsuit around though maybe uh 1991 1992 thereabouts and got
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:01.640]  nowhere uh as time went by i read sent letters to everybody else who i had been involved with frayers
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:07.320]  and henry ensher and karen cesahara his successor as political officer and what was really going
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:13.960]  on in jeta you know time is going by you can tell me dead silence so then i filed a freedom of
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:19.240]  information act request and ultimately another lawsuit uh i guess about three years ago now
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:25.400]  asking what i should have asked for the first time around all of the visas that had been overruled by
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:33.720]  frayers and justice stevens and when i was in jeta the filing cabinets were bulging with old visa
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:39.720]  applications that nobody had shredded they were five 10 15 years old and my staff said to me look
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:44.920]  like if we shred these things like we're supposed to do every year we're never going to deal with
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:50.840]  100 to 200 visa applicants today we're getting and we got a choice you want us to shred documents or
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:22:00.680]  you want us to uh work on these visa applications so i said do the visas and uh the lawsuit again
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:08.600]  was dismissed by um reggie walton uh a bush appointee a guy who was put onto the foreign
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:14.920]  intelligence surveillance act court the secret court and he first demanded the names of all
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:22.280]  45 000 visa applicants a year i was dealing with and i said that's impossible and the state said
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.760]  well we shred these documents every year and i said that's impossible wouldn't give them an affidavit
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:35.800]  about the bulging overflowing file cabinets and he simply dismissed the case and i said well i want
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:42.360]  to know who dismissed who or who shredded these documents uh what was their names what was their
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:49.960]  rank when it was done don't you people keep records uh there's a guy in the british government
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.840]  nick pope who had written about uh freedom of information and national security and he had
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:02.440]  mentioned that well you know in a big organization papers go missing files get misplaced and so for
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.120]  it but if you're dealing with government if you're dealing with national security issues if you're
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:15.160]  dealing with uh major uh topics like visa applications these don't go missing and if they do there's a
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:21.640]  very questionable reason for why and we need to investigate something like this well that prompted
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:27.480]  me to start writing the book and in the course of doing the research i found out that basically as
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:37.160]  i began to suspect the people who were sent to afghanistan uh also were sent to yugoslavia i found
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:44.600]  through john shinler's book um unholy terror uh that these were some of the guys that had been
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.880]  trained in afghanistan and fought in bosnia and were involved with the playing or the execution
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:57.320]  of september 11th now let's stop right there this is so huge the kla out of albania involved taking
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:04.200]  over areas from syria syria fights back they're called terrorists on the news nato bombsome
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.840]  they might say the serbs are perfect the point is is that again using them as a secret army and
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.520]  then meanwhile using the drug money from what i've read to launch the next operation that's exactly
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:22.520]  right uh they uh the guys got nato intelligence the guys got nato training um the guys got uh
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:28.520]  uh money to uh and drugs to sell back and forth to finance their operations just like they did
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:34.520]  with iran contra uh in michel jasodoski's website there are a number of articles global research
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:40.120]  canada that talk about using drug money to fund the war in yugoslavia and to destroy the country
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:46.120]  i i want to go back to 9 11 and again we just joined us visas for al qaeda the former head of the
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:52.280]  jenice saudi arabian us embassy visa section who saw them letting terrorists fly around before then
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:57.160]  after talked to people involved and he's gonna get to that in a moment basically said hey you
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:01.000]  know let these people in they're not really terrorists they work for us i wanted to get back
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.680]  to that in a moment but to know that they are using al qaeda type groups as secret armies
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:13.480]  against the serbs against our basic liberties using that threat to take our freedoms against
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:20.600]  uh syria libya iraq i mean all over the world this is getting so obvious what do you make now of
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:28.280]  the reports by south com that isis is coming in to the caribbean and mexico and into the us is
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:35.000]  is that just hype to get more government funding or are they covering their butt i don't know for
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.880]  sure i the first i heard but actually was uh when you mentioned this on your show uh just
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:48.120]  a few minutes ago um i'm inclined to think this is more like uh george bush and uh these other
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:55.000]  people saying well if you we don't stop iran and ronald reagan if we don't stop uh uh the contras
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:03.320]  in uh in nicaragua they were gonna have to stop them in harley in texas uh i would suspect that
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:10.760]  this is basically hype and beating the drums for more security more uh removal of personal liberty
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:18.520]  and to pop more money into uh these organizations in the middle east to destroy the rest of the
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.640]  the region uh there's still uh a few people left there who are fighting back they're doing it in
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:29.400]  yemen uh bashar al-asad he may not be the world's best president but uh he didn't start the war
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.320]  already certainly better than al-qaeda and i'm going to be able to speak to that i agreed until
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.840]  about six months ago with your view that it's just more hype to get more fbi funding and more
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:42.520]  homeland security funding the issue is though i see him allowing ices to recruit uh you know 18
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:48.840]  25 year olds all over the world from the us canada europe england australia to fly there to fight
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:56.200]  it is a proxy army and i see it being promoted domestically is kind of trendy and then i ask
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:01.880]  are they going to allow ices to attack to even take more liberties uh it's just getting really
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.720]  really suspicious yeah it's conceivable i mean uh when they were recruiting for afghanistan there
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:13.960]  were 52 recruiting offices in the united states for the mujahideen they were rounding up arab
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.640]  americans uh to either fund the operation or to be recruited and trained to go and fight in
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.840]  afghanistan i was thunderstruck that i hadn't heard about that at all but it was in peter
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.520]  bergen's book the osama bin laden i know that's right and that's now admitted and of course regan
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:33.800]  didn't don't want to blame regan he didn't know at the time either but obviously he had all those
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.520]  meetings the white house with the taliban leaders and i mean ridiculous film footage but it you know
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:45.480]  that happened yeah wow uh i want to get into the book in the next segment i skipped a break
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:51.240]  we got a few minutes left here give us the meat for new audiences that just tuned in of because
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.360]  it's so groundbreaking what you were able to discover and talking to your colleagues that
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.600]  were still in the state department about how many of the hijackers were actually given visas
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:04.200]  to come into the united states even though they were on a terrorist list and what story was given
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:12.520]  to to force the uh the embassy to do that well uh as i discovered in researching the book um well
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:18.360]  15 of the 19 hijackers according to los angeles times years ago got their visas from jeta and i
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:23.240]  thought i had raised enough hell with my freedom of information act lawsuits and letters and speaking
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:32.200]  out that they would stop this stuff um but i learned in doing the research that this shana
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:40.040]  steinger s t e i n g e r she was hired for my position uh in jeta to issue visas straight out
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:47.000]  of columbia university uh at f s o for a very high rank with someone for someone with no experience
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:55.160]  no training and um just the student background she did this she issued the visas gave equivocable
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:01.320]  answers to the uh 9 11 commission and has since gotten promotions and is still working for the
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:08.360]  state department wow and we know mohammed out of it and others were able to go to some other
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:13.240]  training camps other part of the world and come back through saturday and then into the us uh
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.760]  that's what i have seen you know these guys uh moved all around they got visas from the us
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.800]  and if you get a visa from an american consult or an embassy and you go to another country uh
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.360]  they're very quick to issue you a visa because well the americans had investigated them they
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:35.880]  have better resources than we do um and additionally went and they came back and uh it it removes
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:41.240]  bars to their travel amazing stay there there's this ties into everything we see happening now
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.120]  now the book visas for al-qaeda j michael springman i'm alex jones stay with us

[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:06.040]  let's talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble cause but modern feminists
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:12.520]  huh well instead of fighting for say paid and protected maternity leave they want to ban words
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:20.360]  shirts and man spreading come on that's cultural marxism which asserts that culture and language
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:26.360]  is responsible for oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state encourages
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:31.800]  gender wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:37.320]  in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women as the late
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:43.000]  erin russo revealed the rockefellers bankrolled feminism and not because they had any interest
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.280]  in women's rights but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta the state

[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:30.200]  tell us more about the book itself well the book starts out essentially talking about my experience
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:36.200]  in the state department and the problems i had getting in and the problems i had once i was in
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:42.680]  uh we've mentioned this a little bit earlier about my issues with jeta um i went on from
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:50.120]  jeta to stuttgart in germany where i had been there some years before um and it turned out that
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:56.920]  the two the two of the three consuls general that were there uh worked for the central intelligence
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:03.480]  agency in fact i was told by the legal advisor's office at the state department not to link day
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:10.120]  amount at the da y like the day of the week amount and dug jones to any of the american
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:18.200]  intelligence services uh these were guys that they blocked me from what i was doing created
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:27.480]  difficulties for me in the office um and it was just absolutely amazing they refused to do anything
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:33.640]  and all about uh following what was going on in germany with the younger generation they clung
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:41.240]  to the old guard the people who uh were in their 70s and 80s and above who uh had lived for the war
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:48.600]  in the end of the war and just loved america and couldn't or wouldn't see any good in talking to
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.280]  anybody else who might have had a different opinion about the united states who might have had a
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:58.840]  different opinion to where germany was going but uh it was a um it was a rocky ride there for two years
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:07.320]  as well so uh i went on from there and then pointed out some of the problems these people created
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.280]  and how they violated the law and regulations so bottom line they were letting al qaeda
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:17.640]  saudi arabian secret armies have us visas that basically get them in any country in the world
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:22.200]  so they could carry out their nasty operations narcotics trafficking murder terrorist attacks you
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:28.600]  name it oh not in sudgart but in in jeta this is what they were doing absolutely yeah i want to
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.640]  continue with a book that walks through how all this works in fine detail it's so important but
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.640]  go back because you got caught off with a break talk about the kla because that's come out since
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:43.160]  you talked about it that that so much the 9-11 funding came out of there albania all of that the
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:49.320]  clinton's when this is bipartisan this is this is how they fund this stuff yeah it was run very
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.960]  much like they ran iran contra they were slipping money in secret to people they were giving training
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:42:01.480]  in secret to people uh they had um intelligence given them uh clinton didn't have a a clue above
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.840]  foreign affairs and he went along with these people uh they wanted to do to uva suave what they had
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:13.480]  done to afghanistan and create a cadre of uh essentially terrorists a wrecking crew if you will
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:17.880]  that went from that would go from country to country and by god they've done it it's they've
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:25.960]  started in afghanistan they went to uva suave uh they had um drug money running the place they had
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:33.560]  they even worked with the iranians to fly plane loads of weapons and supplies in uh the german
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:41.720]  uh uh delegate to the uh uh the peace talks and to the uh mediation conferences they had
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:48.440]  he was a fellow from their external intelligence service the bundes nachrichtendienst so it was a
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.680]  really nasty operation all the way through and it wasn't quite as well concealed as they've done
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:43:01.880]  in since then they were still learning i guess uh they took one guy um a norwegian helicopter
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:08.680]  pilot a captain um iban moldestad to uh hotel balcony and threatened to throw him off because
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:14.200]  he was asking questions about unmarked aircraft with fighter escorts flying into airfields in
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:19.400]  uga suave and he wanted to know where they were coming from and he contacted the nato
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:24.840]  aviation center in vichenza italy and uh nobody wanted to talk about this
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:33.080]  man i mean it just sounds like a giant mafia worldwide is using radical jihadi to destabilize
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.960]  countries and sometimes they overthrow the country and put them in charge or they remove them and
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:44.280]  then they come in and make massive you know amounts of money off of the response uh it just sounds
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:49.640]  like something specter would do out of a james bond movie it's it's it's almost too fantastic to
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:56.760]  believe you've got uh uh uga suave have broken up into small ineffective statelets uh they've been
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:02.840]  trying for years to break iraq into three pieces they haven't quite succeeded but the the kurdish
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:10.440]  north through the israeli influence and american efforts is almost a separate country uh and they're
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:17.000]  trying to split the the she is south from the suni center as well they haven't quite done it but
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.400]  they've in fact wrecked everything in the country where you have the electricity for only a few hours
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:27.560]  a day um nobody has any education anymore it was one of the the shining lights in the middle east
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:36.680]  with the great literacy rate uh women were uh had equal rights with men uh people were educated
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:43.400]  the language of instruction for doctors medical doctors was english uh and uga suave is with
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:49.000]  i'm not uga suave i'm sorry iraq is a failed state um they moved the people in the libya
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:56.120]  and murdered gaddafi uh libya under gaddafi's rule while he may not have been a wonderful uh
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:04.360]  philosopher king leader but under his rule uh libya had one of the highest standards of living
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:11.960]  in all of africa they murdered him shot the country up destroyed the country and you read in the
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:17.480]  paper every day that there's a new terrorist attack there is a new uh government and there is a
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:23.880]  attempted secede from one part of the place or the other and then they moved all the bad guys into
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:30.680]  syria and they've done pretty much the same thing there syria is essentially a non-state now uh it
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:37.080]  damascus uh the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world uh is about the only thing that
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:45.640]  bashar al-asad really controls and they destroyed most of the uh uh united nations world heritage
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:52.600]  sites uh and nobody seems to care uh they just seem to think that well we need to get rid of bashar
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:58.920]  al-asad and then syria will be so much better but they ignore the the fact that bashar al-asad
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:06.600]  has kept together a patchwork of religions and cultures and philosophies together and uh while
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:13.160]  syria might not have been a country with a fantastic standard of living and uh so forth
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:19.960]  sure i mean compared to al-qaeda asad is a philosopher king and expanding on that
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.440]  hillary said i made a mistake in libya and they have these headlines saying libya now a failed state
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.200]  hell on earth thousands being killed a month uh black avarice has been targeted by jihadis
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:38.360]  and they act like they screwed up the plan was to destabilize it because libya was uplifting
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:44.840]  all of africa it was creating an investment fund that actually was helping so i mean you could say
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.400]  qaddafi was a bad guy a long time ago but he actually was starting to live more frugally and
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:54.840]  was giving almost all the money to the people i'm not endorsing socialism but he was actually doing
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:00.040]  it and it was actually working in the public works he was putting in and the money he was
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:05.960]  giving other countries and now all of africa is is as you know they admit descending into hell
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:13.560]  and al-qaeda forces are spreading all over the continent i mean and and and then african says
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:20.120]  oh now we can come in to deal with the threat yeah i was talking about that on rt a couple
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:27.400]  weeks ago with a guy from um hyra university who was an expert on africa and he and i agreed
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:33.080]  that this book around business is just another version of al-qaeda another rebranding of the
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:40.520]  the franchise of lunatics and crazies that allegedly espoused islam and it was a we thought
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.560]  both of us that this is another way to destabilize that part of africa because it was spreading
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:54.760]  beyond the original infection point to other countries nearby simply amazing the new book
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:01.640]  visas for al-qaeda where's the best place for people to find at amazon.com thinking from amazon.com
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:08.520]  it's in amazon in the u.s and amazon in britain france in germany as well people need to read
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.440]  this book and see the facts for themselves especially now that all this is coming out
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  as they see we told you so they can also get it as an ebook as well well that's fantastic let's go
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:24.440]  ahead and talk to jeff in georgia jeff thanks for holding her on the air uh thanks alex um great to
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:30.360]  talk to you today uh great conversation great guest it'd be great to have uh macafe him siebel
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:36.200]  edmunds tosh pumley else didn't at the same table and get some stories from that um specifically
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:41.800]  i'd call to ask his reaction when he saw this whole uh underwear bomber thing go down an exposure
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:47.160]  by uh kurt katt school came recall his name exactly but uh the exposure of that and how the man was
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:53.480]  led on the plane and again signed up by cia and allowed on board well basically from what i entered
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:49:00.120]  to stand uh this underwear bomber somehow uh he didn't really have the proper paperwork to get on
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:07.480]  the airplane he didn't have a visa i think that's right and he was shepherded through uh uh a security
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:12.840]  a sharp dressed well-spoken american man basically argued and ordered them to let him in so knowing
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.960]  your background who has enough power to order people to do that the united states government
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:26.280]  tsa uh the cia the state department uh we don't know the uh it was an israeli company that was
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  running the security at the airport and uh it was you know so strange that you know somebody puts
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.800]  underwear uh fills his underwear with with explosives and tries to set them off on the
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:44.120]  airplane uh that's more along the lines of the uh the uh the shoe bomber where the guy tried to set
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:50.840]  fire to the shoe in the cabin that all it does is create an opportunity for creating fear on creating
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:56.280]  uh tighter alleged security security theory i think it's better work for it
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.720]  i think basically it's it's um it's absolutely nonsense and then that makes everyone a suspect
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:11.000]  when it's the shoes it's the belt it's the shampoo yeah or a breast belt for women who are lactating
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.200]  now that's who you gotta watch can't trust anybody but the government and the big corporations
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:21.480]  that run it jeff does that answer your question uh yeah and then just to tie in that well we do
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:27.000]  know what the uh you know uh who benefited from that and that was uh shirt off as soon as he leaves
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  the government he goes to work for the company that had the body scanners all lined up and ready to go
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.320]  no that's all right that's what i understand

[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:28.120]  april 19th that's what all these military drills are about and then it's the right wings supporting
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:31.720]  the whole police state takeover and meanwhile they're being prepared to attack them it's just
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:39.560]  hilarious it wasn't so sick also they're saying it's sexist if you don't want a overweight girlfriend
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:45.480]  and that it's a conspiracy of the male patriarchy that we don't want that in the news paul watson
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:50.200]  breaks it down i don't know i don't really i'm not into really skinny women i'm going to be
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:56.760]  honest i like voluptuous i mean i think everybody has different tastes some people are into 400 pound
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:01.480]  women i mean that's that's that's how this works you can be in what you can like what you want
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:06.760]  i'm gonna like what i like i mean turkey i hear they like big one or at least they used to that's
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:12.600]  fine you can have them uh it's just that we're allowed to have our own views and our own taste
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:16.440]  but that's coming up the next hour i want to do this segment and five more minutes with our guests
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:21.000]  if you can stay with us so we have enough time to take some of these calls and we have mr springman
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.840]  visas for al-qaeda author with us jerry in west virginia you're on the air
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:33.560]  yes hi alex and mr springman i just really am curious about the 28 pages that were unclassified
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:40.520]  and have yet to be released i also lived in saudi arabia and no one is aware of all the americans
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:48.680]  and uk's that are locked up in the saudi jails that aramco arabian america oil company whom i worked
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:55.800]  for uh doesn't do anything to help these american and brits and other people that are there and the
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:02.840]  stories can go on of the horrendous treatment of foreigners and expats living in saudi arabia
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:06.680]  but that's politically correct i mean they're allowed to because it's the right thing to do
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.000]  just like mexico can torture our people and that's okay um do you have a question for mr springman
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:17.240]  yes i want to know where the 28 pages are that's a great question what do you make of all that and
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:22.760]  the people that have seen it and what they say mr springman well the thing of it is that the united
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:29.000]  states tends to overclassify a lot of things but also at the same time uh they will not let anything
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.960]  out that will make the government look bad that will make a politician look bad that will make a
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:43.480]  decision look bad so i i think the 28 pages are a either nothing or b uh it's a bombshell and it
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:49.160]  shows the ties of the saudi's and maybe the israelis and the american government officials
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:55.960]  to september 11 and the only way to learn about it is to declassify the 28 pages well i've talked
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:01.880]  to congressman jones and others and they say they've seen it it's it's beyond that it's it's
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:06.200]  stand down it's that people were ordered to basically shut up and let it happen because they
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:11.240]  didn't want to quote embarrass saudi arabia yeah well if that's the case and i can see them holding
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:17.640]  the lid on and doing a damnedest to uh keep the truth from getting out what happens if it does
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.400]  come out that saudi arabia around the attach and that our own government stood down that makes them
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:28.280]  complicit doesn't it oh yes indeed and the united states is working with the saudi's to destabilize
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:33.320]  all the countries in the middle east most notably now uh in yemen it's the saudi's with american
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:41.400]  advice and assistance and intelligence from nsa spies in the sky uh to go and kill civilians
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:47.400]  and in yemen because they're the wrong brand of islam and because the saudi's want complete control
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.720]  of the arabian peninsula that's right it's about saudi arabia setting up a globalist empire

[01:59:53.960 --> 02:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:22.200]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones i'm not a
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:28.280]  diplomat like our guest michael springman but i have studied history is a kind of fascinating and
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:38.200]  up until about 1963 or so the u.s. generally did try to build up countries and and if they
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.760]  did an overthrow they tried to put in a better government and actually tried to build up the
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:48.440]  industry of the country to then make them an ally and a successful partner it was still corrupt
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:54.040]  picking winners and losers violating the doctrine of george washington even the Monroe doctrine
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:00.040]  but since then it's degenerated until they're not even trying to overthrow countries to get
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:06.280]  somebody bad out they want to degenerate syria degenerate syria degenerate all these countries
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:13.240]  they want to wreck them and then leave them wrecked and that's not even good for business globally
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:17.640]  so that's my view on it mr springman what do you think's behind this then we'll talk to
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:24.520]  steven and others well i i think uh your point is is pretty much on the mark the uh they don't want
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:31.960]  a a viable functioning democracy or something close to democracy with a healthy economy making
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:37.880]  life better and better for the inhabitants uh they want to destabilize and destroy the countries
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:44.200]  because it gives them more effective control they can move uh the cian they can promise them the
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.640]  sun moon and stars with the rebuild of their economy using american contractors and american
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:57.960]  equipment and so forth uh but basically i think it's um uh the rebuilding is more of a way of
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:03.960]  shifting money from one pocket to another pocket that in iraq for example they have all these horrible
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:11.320]  tales of corruption and money going missing but nobody goes to jail for it nobody gets investigated
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:18.760]  it's basically a a big scam wreck the country give us control of the various factions we've
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:24.840]  created to fight one another and we'll promise you that you will have a much better country next year
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:31.240]  except that doesn't happen but in the meantime money is exchanged banks get rich it's a high
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:37.320]  tech way to conquer countries yeah yeah i mean it's uh it's like the roman empire divide and rule
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:42.840]  wow i agree with that it's just a fact uh steven and michigan you're on the air with our guests go
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:49.080]  ahead hey elix thanks for having me on uh my question for your guest is how can the mainstream
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:55.800]  media completely ignore all the evidence that 9-11 wasn't an inside job that's a good question
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:03.880]  yeah the mainstream media uh is run in the united states at least maybe four or five large corporations
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:09.640]  uh they don't want to offend advertisers uh they're very close to the government as bob parry noted
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:16.840]  in some of his books about uh how he was tossed out of the associated press uh they want feel
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:23.240]  good stories they don't want to antagonize anybody that has any power and they want to keep their uh
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:27.240]  good relations within the federal government and they've allowed corruption to totally take over now
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:34.040]  exactly good question steve thank you bob and colorado i think the last caller we have time for
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:37.720]  them i'll go to erin after you leave us go ahead bob you have any questions for mr springman
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:47.000]  yes sir um the recently released isis video promises another 9-11 now we know 9-11 was an
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.960]  inside job so i don't know what to make of that i was just curious what your take is i mean mind
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:57.080]  briefly it's another inside job if you let these groups build up get armed they're crazy jihadis but
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:01.960]  you let them in it's like putting a bunch of black widows in your neighbor's bed you didn't make the
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:06.600]  black widows bite them you just let them in to do it or a bucket of rattlesnakes so mr springman
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:13.080]  well basically uh they like to keep the fear alive and as sharyl benard had said she was a
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:19.880]  rand analyst who was married to zame khalilzad who had been american ambassador to afghanistan to
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:25.720]  iraq and to the united nations she said we went out and we knew we couldn't beat the soviets in
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:32.040]  any possible way so we decided to collect and arm and train the most outrageous zealots the most crazy
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:37.560]  fanatics we could find and we turned them loose and they killed everybody they killed the moderates
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:42.840]  they killed the progressives they killed everybody who didn't agree with them and you end up with this
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:47.880]  cadre of vicious extremists that have been turned into what i call the the arab afghan
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:53.400]  region that fights anywhere and anywhere the united states sees elements amazing mr springman
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:56.680]  godspeed thank you for your courage we're gonna be right back stay with us
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:03.800]  the vaccination lies in hysteria continue to ramp up in california the tomecula valley school

[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:31.240]  code 120325 and the particulars of the exemption can be found in california health and safety code

[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:30.920]  we've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks energy shots they've got a ton of money there sourced
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:38.280]  from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:42.760]  they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:47.400]  but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:52.760]  goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and i love it visit info wars life dot com today

[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:31.960]  all right i have loaded phone lines here and the guest are still on the subject of 9-11 i think
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:37.800]  that's fine now the calls are and then i'm going to intersect that into all this news that's
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:43.000]  unfolding because i don't look at news separately i look at it the body of work
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.440]  i don't need the police to tell me and i'm glad they've arrested them and it's good it's a good
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:55.320]  start that the tsa singles out good-looking men and women and then of their pedophile
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:01.880]  children to grope and abuse them or that the tsa has been caught in documents it's now mainstream news
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:05.560]  covering all of this up
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:14.040]  this is how they operate and now you'll see the system come out and try to defend them and
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:21.160]  cover it up or maybe even stage a bombing this is getting really predictable former tsa agent
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:27.080]  unleashed groping scandal as this is usual abuse of passengers daily occurrence many hands on people's
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:34.360]  private parts naked body scanners useless agent shielded from prosecution people always ask when
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:40.920]  i fly that's off drudgereport.com all mainstream news articles people ask hey dummy why don't you
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:46.680]  just naked scan then then you won't get groped no they pull out probably every 10th person randomly
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:52.120]  or they want to grope you and still grope you you get the trusted travelers thing i travel quite a
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:59.160]  bit and i mean the they pull the trusted travelers out too and then grope you it's all bull the only
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:04.360]  control i have this is a no cause of lawsuits they got to let you opt out of being radiated
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:09.560]  because i know they save those images and that's come out but you look at that and you look at
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:14.440]  how they're funding al-qaeda funding isis letting them build up letting them get ready to attack us
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:20.680]  it's it's completely obvious and then you look at the degeneration of the american government
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:28.040]  out of straussian ideas from the university of chicago mainly that injustifies the means
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:32.120]  and then no matter how bad you do things it's okay if it's for a good aim
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:43.080]  well a that never ends up working like that in history and then b the globalists never had a good
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:51.880]  aim yes in situational ethics there might be a time to torture somebody but very rarely and you
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:57.720]  obviously don't put it down on paper you don't codify it into law and you don't say it's legitimate
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:03.080]  because it's always ends up being worse because of fake confessions and discrediting real confessions
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:08.520]  and then discredits the system discredits the rule of law and the civilization falls and that's
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:14.280]  what the criminals want they want you to know the laws discredited they want you to know it's
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:20.520]  unevenly distributed they want you to hate the government and the police and make it about the
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:27.880]  government and big government buildings and faceless cops by faceless you know in their cars
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:33.400]  instead of us letting it happen and the fact that our government's run by foreign special interest
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:40.120]  i mean that is spectacular that our government is publicly run by foreign banks and then even
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:44.280]  the head of the ap came out and said the government's becoming tyrannical and trying to suppress the
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:51.720]  news and going after journalists and not releasing any information the ap is the most lapdog organization
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:58.920]  there is but it's got a lot of real journalists working there and i've talked to ap section chiefs
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:03.880]  i've talked to reuters section chiefs when they call me back and they go off record mr jones
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:09.400]  i've never seen them kill a story like this directly this is real news
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.640]  they used to call the ap all the time he's got a lot of stuff in the ap
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:20.920]  and they said we've been told nothing from you it's in the system it's in the ap system do not
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:27.480]  talk to alex jones not at the reporter level but at the section chief level it pops up a note
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:35.080]  no no the unspeakable name look at fox news they won't say my name now they go we all know who
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:41.480]  we're talking about from austin texas they're all like whoa whoa because i have the former head
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:48.360]  of technical of the nsa on i have the former head of the jeta uh visa union on i have generals on
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:56.760]  i have all these i mean they hate this show because we are an example of people that cannot
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:02.520]  be intimidated or shut down without them putting a bullet in my head or setting me up and hell they
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:07.240]  might do that they're just afraid how to do it because it might blow up in their face
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:13.880]  but see that's the gamble i'm willing to take i'm not going to sit here and roll over this because
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:19.720]  i understand how to how degeneration and rotting happens it starts at the head like a fish and
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:27.720]  moves down and the people in washington are so out of control so crazy that they've got to be stopped
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:33.880]  and and and there is no end anymore there is no oh we do bad things for a good it's humans are bad
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:38.120]  getting rid of people's good humans are dumb they're ugly they're you know they we're gonna have a
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:42.440]  world without humans that's the cosmology all the leader in the news saying we're gonna live forever
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:48.280]  with life extension that's back on the news today i'll cover it after we take calls so what i'm getting
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:56.600]  at here is that the dinosaur media and the dinosaur system is basically has dementia
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:04.440]  and it's running kind of an old battle plan the old computers are still there the old systems of
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:11.400]  control the old programs are there but they're degenerating and getting more corrupt by the minute
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:21.240]  and the death rows of the dinosaur media we're beginning to see and now many of the dinosaur
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:27.720]  outlets understand they're on the chopping block and wow they really are being told what to say by
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:33.000]  the government they're really being told don't criticize illy clinton don't criticize uh obama
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.800]  they're really openly being threatened now and they've got their own egos they're like wait a minute
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:42.440]  and now they're being told yeah we're gonna go ahead and start taking pension funds over to protect
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:48.600]  them of course and we're gonna go ahead and start arresting some dissidents and everything we see
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:15:00.840]  points towards clear preparation for a major event or events economic military we're not sure
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:06.120]  we know there's a lot of balls in the air a lot of things that could fall first
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:12.120]  but what we do know is after that crisis they're coming after let's go to the list
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.440]  we've gotten thousands of it's in thousands of pages and hundreds of public documents now
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.840]  there's no denial i have three or four new articles today
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:32.040]  veterans well first combat veterans veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives christians
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:40.120]  right down that line and they say the big enemy is is evangelicals evangelicals are some of the
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:47.240]  most lapdog to government but they're stubborn and won't do certain things abortion and they won't
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:55.400]  take microchips and they have had their psych warfare experts study evangelicals and they know
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:01.640]  that they have a bigger relationship with god than they do with physical things the followers
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:08.040]  not the fake preachers so why are they getting ready to go after evangelicals because they know
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:14.440]  they're going to say no to what's coming you can tell everything by the enemy's attack profile
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:18.600]  you can see what they're guarding what they're ready for what they're worried about to know
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:24.680]  where their weaknesses are and i'm not just being chilled by them where i'm getting fooled they try
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:29.080]  to hide what they're afraid of they try to not discuss what they're afraid of they don't want
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:33.160]  people to understand that we understand their critical weaknesses they're illegitimate they're
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:42.280]  far in control they have people's uh you know goodwill uh in their target they are incredibly
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:50.680]  corrupt and degenerate they're going to screw over their minions why would we want to be run by crooks
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:58.680]  why would we want to turn our system over to a bunch of people that don't like prosperity i mean
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:06.680]  can you get that through your head new order comes in prosperity goes out the door think about our
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:13.960]  elite bipartisan that would put over 200 000 jihadi al qaeda in to blow up every church and kill every
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:18.840]  christian they found in non-radical muslim and there are non-radical muslim folks alawites and
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:26.280]  others forcing fathers to truck bomb police barracks or they kill their kids that's what most
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:31.080]  of suicide bombings are okay i just shot your five-year-old i'm gonna shoot your three-year-old
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:34.840]  and two-year-old and then your wife next if you don't suit up and drive this truck up
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:40.040]  and still they just pull over at the first cop and say they got my kids i can't i can't blow
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:44.840]  you up though i just i can't do it and they kill their family those are real cases our government
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:53.080]  is doing that what do you think they'll do to us huh huh and the military finally two years ago
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:56.760]  was faced with this and said we're not gonna be part of this and the chairman of the joints
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:03.480]  he's went to obama and said no air offensive they were false flagging blaming chemicals on a side
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:11.800]  it was a daily scam i mean really military really good job for saying no but what about the brass
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:18.120]  at the top that didn't i mean would you really want your name signed on your soul maybe you

[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.400]  going to get into the police state news and the other news i tell you this is just three articles
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:20.040]  today though bloggers compared to terrorists want to shut us down in congress military bulletin
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:25.720]  labels militia domestic terrorists says their attacks can be any minute and holders taking
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:32.040]  guns from veterans outside of law it's unbelievable treason and i guess we sit here and we take it
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:36.040]  so that's why they do it but i don't want to get violent because that's the row they want to go down
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:46.040]  but then they're just going to stage stuff they just want a key pushing somebody blows up
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:55.960]  but i look at people like obama and michael more and melissa harris perry that are running a lot
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:26:00.760]  of this she got globalist above that have the master plan but these people these little
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:04.840]  these little globalist they have no idea what it's going to be like when all this stuff really kicks
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:14.200]  off like all the other tyrants i mean hitler had an iron cross first class that's congressional
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:18.520]  medal honor he's a pretty smart guy but he was evil deep down and you saw what happened to him
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:23.240]  he thought it had a he thought he thought he had it all figured out he said hitler compared to
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:27.320]  to a michael more i mean there's no comparison in intellect
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:34.760]  and so you just keep thinking you're invincible you just let me tell you something i know i'm not
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:40.760]  invincible that's the opposite i don't think i'm in control god's in control and i just try to do
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:46.200]  the right thing and say god is up to you whatever happens i don't pray to god to protect me pray to
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:50.200]  god to protect my children selfishly i just say god please whatever your will is have it done and
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:55.560]  please make me strong because i'm weak and help me rise up against the enemy raise me up against
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:27:01.320]  them make me strong give me intellect give me discernment and god's giving it to me in fact
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:07.480]  it's scary it's scary to have god's blessing and i know i'm in this evil body with this evil mind
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:11.560]  and i'm aware of my sin which is not that big compared to most people's but man let me tell you
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:17.720]  get close to god you really see how dirty you are and then i look at these globalists i could see
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:22.920]  their dirt man i could see their spiritual wickedness like it's an aura and it makes me want to vomit
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:31.160]  i hate them i hate the entities they've become mike and washington you're on the air go ahead
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:40.200]  here go ahead awesome so uh yesterday i was scrolling through my facebook and i see the news
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:47.960]  post a picture of the police belaying out of a helicopter with their k9 dog just hanging from
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:56.440]  the helicopter as well in his arms and uh that immediately bothered me i uh that's not okay
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:00.680]  you know we should we should not have that yeah i mean you can individually say the cops are good
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:06.440]  but there's a major projection escalation of force gearing up and in all the major training manuals
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:12.440]  we're the target the best people in america so yes this is for us and you instinctively know it's bad
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:21.320]  i do remember you guys had a how to show down here when uh girl in spokane seen the bear cat at
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:30.200]  uh at walmart and uh she she took the video of it and he said he was uh he was there but or he the bear
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:36.920]  cat is uh for constitutionalists whose stockpile weapons and ammo see see see hold on that there's
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:41.000]  the problem i'm trying to write articles and do shows about this and i can't even think of one
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.760]  tenth of it exactly every indicator we've got imagine a dash control with a thousand lights and
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:53.800]  like all 997 are blinking right there everywhere we have them training to take us on and then going
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:58.360]  no we're not no we're not no we're not there's nothing to jade helm there's no drones there's no
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:02.920]  exactly and then they got all threatening and said we were threatening the police
[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:10.360]  by even covering the report remember that oh yeah and another thing that is disturbing about that
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:19.240]  picture i've seen is uh that they're canine dog that they have just in in the in a sheriff deputy
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:25.880]  thurman's arms and canine laszlo just sitting in his arms nobody asked that dog if it wants to

[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:35.480]  with you but i actually love it but let me just talk about this with you for a minute just imagine
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:41.800]  we're having to have this conversation here in this country i mean this is just crazy this is
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:46.440]  crazy it's the military industrial complex folks it's taken over eisenhower warned us
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:53.960]  he'd be called a terrorist today we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:30:03.880]  radio network i was born on the prairies where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break
[02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:10.600]  the light of the sun i was born where there were no enclosures geronimo i wonder what he thinks of
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:15.720]  the permanent checkpoints where you're quizzed about your citizenship about having to submit to
[02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:21.400]  bag searches to ride public transportation his thoughts on nonviolent offenders riding away in
[02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:27.400]  prisons they say that in these current times we are more quotes civilized but are we really
[02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:33.640]  more free when the persian army demanded king leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:39.000]  the outnumbered king shouted molon lave or come and take them even though leonidas was
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:44.600]  eventually defeated by a much larger adversary he is not remembered for his loss he lives in
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:51.240]  history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense the desire to disarm the people is nothing new

[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:12.120]  these clips from bloggers compared to isis can go and do that thank you but also i was going to ask
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:20.680]  you a little bit about the platform that it provides for fringe and radical views not just in
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:30.040]  russia but worldwide as as sort of the the extreme fringe is given a platform for what
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:37.320]  otherwise would not be considered reputable television you know most broadcasts wouldn't
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:44.120]  have on the the types of voices with these conspiratorial theories but maybe you could
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:53.320]  explain the process that rt undertakes to select its experts and i'll just turn it over to the
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:59.480]  panel for your responses and why it's effective i think you had mentioned that it provides this
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:08.280]  voice for for fringe voices extremists and it works because it provides a place for these people
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:15.000]  a place where these people can congregate and feed off of each other's biases it's almost
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:22.040]  like a community that is almost like a cult i would say that is formed online and they mobilize
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:29.320]  and they they feel like they are part of some enlightened um fight against the establishment
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:36.440]  that they um and they they find a home they find a place where they're heard and how they find a
[02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:41.880]  sense of belonging people are heard in america where they can where they can um a platform to
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:49.480]  to voice their deranged views by using the internet to mobilize people that feel displaced
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.760]  that feel like they've been on the outskirts of society a better place where they can find a
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:01.480]  sense of belonging and maybe uh make a difference in their own way um and it's a problem and and
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:09.320]  we see that it's effective we see that they are shaping the discussion online on message boards
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:15.000]  on twitter on social media and uh the internet you know we we thought that it would be this place
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:20.840]  where where uh you know it's wonderful in a lot of ways because a lot of different viewpoints and
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:26.600]  a lot of different people have a voice like never before but unfortunately it's provided a forum
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:32.600]  where disinformation false theories uh people that are just trying to make a name for themselves
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:37.160]  she's definitely talking about lovers or whatever that have absolutely no accountability for the
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:45.480]  truth are able to rile up a mass amount of people online hey alex you know who that is
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:50.520]  that is the lady who quit rt live on the air when the whole russia thing was yeah it turned out
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:54.200]  now she's a government agent and it turned out that was all staged too right totally and that's
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:59.320]  what that's what this is that was an inspiration to make us seem like her that were bad and by the
[02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:06.200]  way this is so epic uh the crews have been trying to get me to cover it all day uh you know i feel
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.760]  bad in that i'm up here having a coughing fit while even cover it i probably need to shoot a
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:16.440]  special report for the nightly news on this and just give it some over-the-top headline because
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:21.240]  it this isn't epic enough the headline paul joseph watson has is great it's just sometimes
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:26.040]  reality is more fantastic than a headline uh bloggers compared to isis during congressional
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:30.600]  hearing we'll play the third clip here in a moment people who challenge establishment narratives online
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:36.520]  linked with terrorist organization when it's this very government um funding the terrorist
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:42.120]  destroying our rights i mean look we told you the nsa was spying they were we told you that
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:47.400]  florida was brain damaging you now it's mainstream news they they can't stand that they've lost all
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:54.440]  this credibility and so now they have these little six sniveling uh you know meetings and events
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:42:03.080]  where they are just up there sickeningly acting like they control reality and i want rob do
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:10.280]  enforce not only news news director to be able to chime in on this but bloggers compared to isis
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:14.600]  during congressional hearing people who challenge establishment narrative online linked with
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:19.480]  terrorist organization bloggers conspiracy theorist and people who challenge establishment
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:23.800]  narratives on the internet were all linked to isis terrorist during a chilling congressional
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:29.560]  hearing which took place yesterday but even more amazing is that they talk about how we
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:35.480]  all have a voice and we're being listened to and blah blah blah the hearing hosted by
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:39.080]  house foreign relations committee and the reason i know folks those are government talking points
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:43.480]  that madow and all of them use on us and media matters that's a white house narrative she was
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:49.720]  reading she's talking about us because on msnbc and stuff they list as my name the hearing hosted by
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:54.680]  house foreign relations committee was titled confronting russia's weaponization of information
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:58.840]  and that's the new thing they're claiming if you don't go along with the new world order with the
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:04.360]  federal reserve that you're russian agents that they love to say that about me and accuse russian
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:09.560]  state broadcaster rt of weaponizing conspiracy theories to spread propaganda i was told by the
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:14.440]  head of rt us which didn't have that big of an audience but i'd go on there every couple weeks
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:18.760]  you know when they asked me i'd go on japanese and british and iranian tv and you know
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:24.840]  you know venezuelan tv or brazilian tv i've been on mexican tv and they'd be alex rt was calling
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:29.880]  you two or three times a week to get on i remember that 2009 2010 you were going on there all the
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:34.120]  time and then something changed well i was told by the people they said no the white house is
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:39.480]  going to try to take our license if we don't and so then they try to put people on that would
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:45.240]  basically spout their view in an attempt to keep rt on cable it's been dropped on a lot of systems
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:50.600]  so it's not that rt's perfect it's that this is an experience of the censorship and the control
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.880]  and trying to claim that i'm some type of russian agent which has been named they've said that
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:44:01.000]  because i have gone on rt i mean i'm not a japanese agent or a british agent either
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.360]  but but go ahead and make your point and then let's get into these people and what they're talking
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:08.680]  about well right after she did her stunt where she quit live on the air she was interviewed by
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:16.680]  cmbc msnbc cnn all these different organizations and and so she's now this authority they've made
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:20.520]  her into an authority to where now she can come on and say oh these people are extremists how did
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:25.160]  you find your guests and she and she quit and prospered of course we know who she works with
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:31.400]  and who she's looked up with she's a very interesting person anyways do you have anything
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:35.320]  else to say there rob dick well i think it's looking more and more that this this looks like
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:40.840]  kind of government paid agent activity to me that's what this well it doesn't matter she's up there
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:44.840]  saying it's horrible that the internet's there we thought the internet would be good but it's not
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:50.920]  anymore right i mean that's exactly where they're going with the censorship this is like uh uh uh
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:54.760]  they're all together but you know i forget the name it's like wrestling you know you have the
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:59.160]  good guys and bad guys but they're both on the same team they all get it's a staged event and
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:03.080]  she's loyal opposition that's what it is loyal opposition marking that the internet provided
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:07.480]  a platform for fringe voices and extremists wall characterized people who challenge establishment
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:12.920]  narratives as a cult that's right if we challenge the official known liars and think that raising the
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:17.400]  debt limit does raise the debt limit or that we did build our own business if we don't do what they
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:24.760]  say we're a cult no wonder everyone's deserting these people they mobilize listen they mobilize
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:30.520]  and they feel they're part of something enlightening in a fight against the establishment they find a
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:37.240]  platform to voice their deranged views referring to comments i mean this is total joke and they're
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:41.880]  saying conspiracy theories on rt they're talking about me they're talking about all of you though
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:47.960]  folks so they can shut me up they can shut you up go ahead well and this is a perfect example of this
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:54.040]  is the congressman from el paso who is threatening uh the different agencies to find the whistleblower
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:46:00.040]  to judicial watch but if you believe what judicial watches says oh we must be a cult but we have
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:03.800]  congressman going around trying to shut down these leaks that are going on just so we can
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.080]  know who's coming through our border it's it's right i want to leave the border open in the
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:12.600]  north american union and they they're about to sign on the new asia union that's in my stack today
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:19.160]  without any votes and then we're called traders because we're paying attention but i'm just so
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:24.440]  sick of them putting up condescending men and women to tell us what reality we can even look at
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.360]  i mean i think folks tune in info wars dot com and they they can tell they're getting a lot more
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:33.320]  reality than what they're getting from these people it's really pathetic and now and i just
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:37.960]  finished a video actually i just put it up on youtube about the uh the these little police
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:43.720]  departments acting like nsa agents where they're sending trojan virus uh contaminated hard drives
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:48.200]  to lawyers to lawyers yeah to try to break into their computers and it totally you know just
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:51.960]  imagine the attorney oh hi we're the police department here's a free hard drive yeah exactly
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:56.040]  this is all the evidence you wanted you know and they did under the auspices of providing
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:01.080]  the evidence they were asking for or to discovery totally yeah the government is in a revolution
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:05.560]  of committing felonies to get away with it and set the precedent that they are above the law
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:10.120]  the ultimate form of discrimination and that trickle down is happening to these local departments
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:15.640]  now now they all think they're junior tsa junior nsa agents it's disgusting well they made the
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:20.760]  decision to try to shut down opposition and shut off the internet and it's not gonna work uh your
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:26.200]  your videos online i'll give folks the headline uh to that video local police caught acting like
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:33.880]  the nsa absolutely and uh and and criminally infecting computers it violates so many laws
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:39.640]  to spy on an attorney client privilege i mean you and the lawyers won't you know stand up to it
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:43.320]  they'll roll over well and the lawyer that this happened to he went to the state police he went
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:47.000]  to other agencies and they're saying oh it's not a big deal they're saying that's not a big deal
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:51.960]  it none of them will enforce on the others that's how you get lawlessness what we have is a rogue
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:57.000]  government exactly that's all i have to say all right thank you very much i'm glad you did that

[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.920]  more time so folks can actually hear that from her own mouth we thought the internet was good
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:23.400]  we thought free speech was good but it let them organize it let people talk to each other and
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:27.400]  feel like they had value it let them think they were changing and finding the establishment
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:33.400]  it let i mean it sounds like a space alien talking imagine a meeting inside the board
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:37.720]  command base we cannot let them have communications sire or they will believe that they can be
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:44.280]  independent from us we must i mean it's just these people are i think easier to beat than
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:49.320]  folks think i mean this is really a giant pile of crap that we're dealing with
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:55.880]  some bedraggled stupid little reporter up there talking about how she didn't like the first amendment
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:05.320]  okay what a joke let's see people are sick let's go to that clip by using the internet
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:11.560]  to mobilize people that feel displaced that feel like they've been on the outskirts of society
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:16.680]  and give them a place where they can find a sense of belonging they can say don't make a
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:22.040]  difference in their own way um and it's a problem and and we see that it's effective
[02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:29.320]  see that it's effective shaping the discussion online on boards on twitter we ought to take
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:34.360]  this into a special report and show madal going he's effective he's getting bills passed he's dangerous

[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:21.320]  down the road other issues but the globalists are just a sickening joke um michelle feyland just
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:27.640]  showed me six washington state state reps i've had a few of them on as guests the one's exposing a
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:35.480]  lot of the tyranny and there they are wearing the 1776 pens from um info or store dot com
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:42.520]  from aid 1776 dot com so we ought to send out the tweet do your state reps for the 1776 pen

[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:52.840]  the globalists are afraid of is as good people at the state level come together realize the

[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:03.960]  fighting these people i'm not that articulate i don't have all the answers and they're totally
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:07.960]  scared of us and hate us and have tried all these dirty tricks that fail by god's grace

[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:27.080]  that's why we don't want to just fight with local government for no reason we need to try to point
[02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:30.840]  out that we are the straight and narrow folks that are exposing what's happening and that we
