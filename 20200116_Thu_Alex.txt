[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  Well, I gotta tell you, this Beastie Voice song is the best way to start the broadcast today,
[00:18.000 --> 00:27.000]  because everything the globalists are doing is sabotaging the human body, the human cells, the human mind, the human soul.
[00:27.000 --> 00:37.000]  Just textbook down the line, the most vicious, most devastating attacks they can carry out against us that they can get away with, they do.
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  But never too big of a frontal attack to get us awake, nor hind legs ready to fight.
[00:44.000 --> 00:57.520]  You have to find our spirit and awaken, and not lay down to these people.
[00:57.520 --> 01:01.060]  And that's why they hate this broadcast, because we are awake.
[01:01.060 --> 01:03.440]  You want to put something on my tombstone?
[01:03.440 --> 01:04.440]  Awake!
[01:04.440 --> 01:05.760]  I am awake!
[01:05.760 --> 01:10.040]  You're not going to sabotage our species anymore.
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.180]  our species anymore. You're not going to stand on our way, Satan. Get behind us and
[01:14.180 --> 01:17.040]  end with Jesus Christ.
[01:17.040 --> 01:25.040]  Try that on for size, Satan. Because it's not arrogance. I'm not a man that's powerful.
[01:25.040 --> 01:31.040]  That God behind me is powerful. And I turn myself over to that God. And that devil's
[01:31.040 --> 01:38.040]  throwing everything it can against me. But my God is God. And cannot fall. I fall. It's
[01:38.040 --> 01:45.040]  God's plan. I live to be a hundred. It's God's plan. Turn it over to God. God's going to handle it.
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.040]  But that doesn't mean we lay there in the ditch and think God's going to march out and do it.
[01:50.040 --> 01:56.040]  God put us here to do it through us. We are the hand of God.
[01:56.040 --> 02:05.040]  Alright, let's lay it out here. You can feel the energy. They are definitely going to pull
[02:05.040 --> 02:11.040]  Charlottesville 2.0. It's going to be squared. It's going to be much bigger, exponentially.
[02:11.040 --> 02:19.040]  Orders of magnitude. And we're going to be there on the front lines. And you can feel,
[02:19.040 --> 02:30.040]  to use the Darth Vader, quote, a disturbance in the force. A big one. And all I feel is victory.
[02:30.040 --> 02:39.040]  They used to run false flags when they had the presidency. And they ordered Delta Force
[02:39.040 --> 02:48.040]  to stage the bombing of a federal building. And they ordered Delta Force to stage the
[02:48.040 --> 03:01.040]  1999 events in Washington State and Seattle. But they don't have the military. They don't have those units
[03:01.040 --> 03:05.040]  that can carry out false flags under the president's order anymore. And by the way,
[03:05.040 --> 03:11.040]  when Clinton ordered all that stuff, it was the beginning of the end of the deep state.
[03:11.040 --> 03:17.040]  So they're going to have their dirty little foundation turds out there trying to pull
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.040]  something off, trying to trick people into a mass shooting. They got mentally ill wind-up
[03:21.040 --> 03:25.040]  toys, drugged up, probably in comas right now. They're going to turn back on and try to roll out
[03:25.040 --> 03:31.040]  in D.C. and in Virginia and probably places we didn't think of. But everybody's got to be on
[03:31.040 --> 03:38.040]  maximum alert right now in the next few weeks, especially next week, with the trial of the
[03:38.040 --> 03:47.040]  president to start Tuesday. So they know what they're doing. They've done it before. But they're
[03:47.040 --> 03:53.040]  not going to get away with it this time. I'm going to be there. You're going to be there.
[03:53.040 --> 03:58.040]  And we're going to be watching their every move. And the police are there watching. And the FBI is
[03:58.040 --> 04:03.040]  there watching, not at the top. And it's not a cliche to kiss the police's ass or the FBI.
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.040]  Everybody knows I used to be on their ass before I had deeper understanding of what was really
[04:07.040 --> 04:12.040]  going on. Just like America is where the battle is for good and for evil, we have both here
[04:12.040 --> 04:18.040]  because we are destined to decide the destiny of the planet. There's good and bad coming together
[04:18.040 --> 04:21.040]  in the fight here. Just like there's good and bad in the government and good and bad in the
[04:21.040 --> 04:25.040]  military and good and bad in law enforcement. But there's something about the real world and
[04:25.040 --> 04:33.040]  tragedy that kicks the fake brave out of these things and where real people are there. And I'm
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.040]  telling you, we almost have control of the government. Again, we the people and the new
[04:37.040 --> 04:42.040]  older doesn't know what to do and everything they do fails. But they're going to try to take the
[04:42.040 --> 04:48.040]  president out next week. So it's time to hit our knees and pray to God. And then it's time
[04:48.040 --> 04:55.040]  like the wind in sails God's will to fill up our hearts with strength and discernment to
[04:55.040 --> 05:06.040]  move forward. I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that
[05:06.040 --> 05:11.040]  without you we won't be on the air. And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you
[05:11.040 --> 05:15.040]  should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better
[05:15.040 --> 05:20.040]  and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers. But something I should spend more time on is
[05:20.040 --> 05:27.040]  just reminding you that these products are really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've
[05:27.040 --> 05:31.040]  seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements
[05:31.040 --> 05:37.040]  are all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere
[05:37.040 --> 05:44.040]  else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden to support Info Wars. It
[05:44.040 --> 05:51.040]  really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[05:51.040 --> 05:55.040]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better. So visit
[05:55.040 --> 06:15.040]  InfoWarsStore.com today. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:15.040 --> 06:25.040]  front lines of the Info War. We are Go. Climate Earth is Go. Set for launch, interdimensional,
[06:25.040 --> 06:33.040]  and the enemy's making a move. They won't stop launch. Launch began a long time ago from
[06:33.040 --> 06:49.040]  which is making it official a space force. We see the Earth from here. You got it. You
[06:49.040 --> 07:01.040]  got it. You got it. That connection with God that means everything. Not the Ferraris,
[07:01.040 --> 07:08.040]  not the helicopters, not the money. That's all just icing on the cake, the consciousness
[07:08.040 --> 07:17.040]  and connection to God and connection to that divine spark gives us. We don't worship the
[07:17.040 --> 07:32.040]  creation. We worship the Creator, made in the image. Ready to launch. Launch on it. And
[07:32.040 --> 07:40.040]  the globalists want control of humanity to warp us into their tools and their slaves.
[07:40.040 --> 07:47.040]  It's not going to happen. In fact, all their attacks on us may mow down billions, but it's
[07:47.040 --> 07:55.040]  going to make a large remnant of us even stronger because when you decide to overcome their
[07:55.040 --> 08:05.040]  attacks, when you decide to make their venom into wine, they fall. All right, let's break
[08:05.040 --> 08:18.040]  it down. Well, I was sure of it before, but there's no sure of it now. It's 100 percent.
[08:18.040 --> 08:26.040]  The nasty, chai-com funded anti-American trash is making its move on America and we could
[08:26.040 --> 08:31.040]  kick the hell out of the British Empire, never been defeated because it was our country and
[08:31.040 --> 08:37.040]  they were pushing us around and they knew we were in the right. They didn't have the
[08:37.040 --> 08:49.040]  Providence or the will or the discernment or the bill of the deed. That was the old globalist
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.040]  empire in control of that and those were people fleeing England and Scotland and Ireland and
[08:55.040 --> 09:03.040]  Germany and the Netherlands to come here and build a new Atlantis. Didn't mean they were
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.040]  perfect angels, but they believed in humanity. They believed in getting rid of feudalism.
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.040]  They believed in getting rid of slavery. They believed in empowering their fellow humans
[09:12.040 --> 09:18.040]  and it was that idea that still threatens the Satanist. Satanists claim they're all about
[09:18.040 --> 09:27.040]  the individual and empowerment. They're all about selfishness. They're all about betrayal
[09:27.040 --> 09:36.040]  and what they're all about is weakness. The devil is a cosmic loser, a piece of filth.
[09:36.040 --> 09:41.040]  Like an adult that trips toddlers as they run down the hall and tells themselves how smart
[09:41.040 --> 09:55.040]  they are, fallen and everybody knows that misery loves company. So if there was any doubt about
[09:55.040 --> 10:07.040]  what's coming up next week, now it's all in crystal focus and it's trumps to lose.
[10:07.040 --> 10:15.040]  That's the American people that are going to be the deciding factor. The governor came
[10:15.040 --> 10:27.040]  out in a disgusting 26 minute press conference and laid out the blueprint. They always pre-programmed
[10:27.040 --> 10:32.040]  with the script they're about to roll and you've seen all the prescripting with Biden's
[10:32.040 --> 10:37.040]  campaign and the media and the lawsuits against us for pointing out that deep state was colliding
[10:37.040 --> 10:46.040]  groups a few years ago in Virginia. In Charlottesville, I am so honored to have the CIA suing me and
[10:46.040 --> 10:53.040]  the entire law department of Georgetown University shaking with hate at us because we exposed
[10:53.040 --> 10:59.040]  that was a synthetic operation. So now, see, when you sue me, I don't run away. I run towards
[10:59.040 --> 11:10.040]  you. See, I'm a heat seeking information warfare missile and where you run is where I follow.
[11:10.040 --> 11:17.040]  I go towards the fight, not away from it because that's the only way to get these people off
[11:17.040 --> 11:25.040]  our children. It's a real pleasure. I don't say that for effect. You need to get to the point,
[11:25.040 --> 11:32.040]  folks, where it's a real pleasure as a man to be able to stand up to these pedophiles
[11:32.040 --> 11:37.040]  of devil worshipers when these innocents can't do it. That's why it's a sick abomination
[11:37.040 --> 11:43.040]  when you call in and tell me I'm a hero or I'm something special. That's like saying
[11:43.040 --> 11:52.040]  I'm having funny con pie vanilla ice cream in July with my grandma. You're all born for
[11:52.040 --> 11:59.040]  this. It's not heroic to stand up for life or what's right. Like I tell you, it's like
[11:59.040 --> 12:04.040]  sucking air into your damn lungs. It ain't heroic. It's about living. It's about doing
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.040]  the right thing and that's what we're built for instead of spending our lives bowing down
[12:09.040 --> 12:17.040]  and being a bunch of cowards. I'm going to tell you right now. There's no doubt that
[12:17.040 --> 12:23.040]  they're going to try to kill Trump next week. I'm telling you, it's so dangerous next week.
[12:23.040 --> 12:27.040]  Everybody's like, well, this impeachment is a joke. They're not going to convict him in
[12:27.040 --> 12:35.040]  the Senate. They need that symbol for what they then trigger next week. Black churches
[12:35.040 --> 12:40.040]  getting shot up, gay bars getting blown up. That's what they're getting set up for. And
[12:40.040 --> 12:47.040]  you'll think it's in Virginia when it's going to be in California or Texas or Michigan
[12:47.040 --> 12:55.040]  or Illinois or Florida or Mississippi. But everybody better have their eyeballs wide
[12:55.040 --> 13:01.040]  open. And I'm not talking about just your eyeballs, but your gut and that's your spirit. And
[13:01.040 --> 13:07.040]  that's getting orders for on top. You go with that. You'll never go wrong. Man, I started
[13:07.040 --> 13:14.040]  going with my gut 100%. It's unbelievable. There's nothing like the sixth sense. There's
[13:14.040 --> 13:19.040]  nothing like the real vision and the enemy knows we all have it and that's why they're
[13:19.040 --> 13:24.040]  so scared. So they try to trick us with all the fear they pump us full of when our sense,
[13:24.040 --> 13:29.040]  our spirit knows they're bad, is scared of them, not even scared as enraged and wants
[13:29.040 --> 13:33.040]  to attack them, wants to get them out of our world. And then they tell you, oh, that rage
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.040]  you have, it's because those are black people or that rage you've got because it's those
[13:37.040 --> 13:41.040]  white people over there. That rage you've got because it's those Russians or this or
[13:41.040 --> 13:48.040]  that. And what it is is that spirit of evil. It's not humans that are a problem. I talk
[13:48.040 --> 13:54.040]  about China all day. There's no greater victims than the Chinese people, a smart, powerful
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.040]  ancient civilization, but in shackles to a high tech slavery. And you've got a thousand
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.040]  movies about blacks being slaves and it doesn't take away from what they went through. Take
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.040]  away that makes you stronger. Not a good thing makes you stronger. And it's the same thing
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.040]  here. But the Chinese people aren't being put through something that makes them stronger.
[14:13.040 --> 14:18.040]  It's scientific to make them not even see what's hitting them and to suck them dry and
[14:18.040 --> 14:24.040]  you can see them spiritually closed, shut down, being fed on by these metaphysical
[14:24.040 --> 14:29.040]  spiders and we need to free them. We need to free everybody. And that's what I want to
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.040]  do. As a primitive man, I see people saying I'm bad for what color I am. And that's how
[14:33.040 --> 14:39.040]  we developed ourselves and I understand tribalism and I understand how powerful it is. And I
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.040]  totally understand where people come from. Black racist, white racist, Mexican racist.
[14:44.040 --> 14:50.040]  I get it because people mess with you because people are tribal. If you're at some wasp
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.040]  country club, they're all fighting with each other over who's richer and in what clique.
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.040]  That's what humans do at a low level. I want to unify people around Jesus Christ and real
[14:59.040 --> 15:06.040]  power. Not because we want power, but because power is what we need to do to build a bigger
[15:06.040 --> 15:11.040]  universe that God set us out to do and missions God has prepared for us and ready. We've just
[15:11.040 --> 15:16.040]  got to be tested here because there's nothing worth anything in the universe that hadn't
[15:16.040 --> 15:21.040]  fought for. And that's all this is. And I can tell you folks, I've seen the other side.
[15:21.040 --> 15:27.040]  I've seen it cleared today. I've spent more time than you can imagine on the other side
[15:27.040 --> 15:33.040]  than I've spent here. And I can tell you the devil's real, God's real and these pathetic
[15:33.040 --> 15:38.040]  servants of evil look like jellyfish slugs because they are, they're dead already. They
[15:38.040 --> 15:43.040]  don't have a spirit anymore. They've been destroyed. They turn their free will over.
[15:43.040 --> 15:49.040]  They got tricked. Just thank God every day you're not one of them and pray to save the
[15:49.040 --> 15:54.040]  young, not be obscured by the enemy's operations. I'm going to cover the news and the plan for
[15:54.040 --> 16:17.040]  the future.
[16:17.040 --> 16:28.040]  I'm going to cover the news and the plan for the future.
[16:47.040 --> 17:15.040]  I'm going to cover the news and the plan for the future.
[17:15.040 --> 17:44.040]  I'm going to cover the news and the plan for the future.
[17:44.040 --> 17:48.040]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless
[17:48.040 --> 18:15.040]  tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com. That's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.040]  It gives people the best results. We either private label it or we develop our own with
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.040]  top developers. And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy,
[18:25.040 --> 18:30.040]  my focus. I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible. So do yourself
[18:30.040 --> 18:35.040]  a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence. You can't lose except if you
[18:35.040 --> 18:39.040]  don't take action because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that
[18:39.040 --> 18:45.040]  is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace in our action. But you need
[18:45.040 --> 18:48.040]  these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[18:48.040 --> 18:52.040]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth. That's
[18:52.040 --> 18:57.040]  how we span in the face of the NWO instead of imploding. We're fighting to win and we
[18:57.040 --> 19:20.040]  are winning. Thanks to you.
[19:28.040 --> 19:34.040]  Thanks to the products in force life. I still got sick every couple of years and you know,
[19:34.040 --> 19:39.040]  I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that. But now that
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.040]  I religiously take the products to them for worse life or the highest quality supplements
[19:44.040 --> 19:51.040]  you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore. It's probably been three,
[19:51.040 --> 19:57.040]  four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the
[19:57.040 --> 20:23.040]  great products. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Only the Holy Spirit overcome
[20:23.040 --> 20:30.040]  the space time continuum in our planet through our souls. Electrochemical transceivers broadcasting
[20:30.040 --> 20:44.040]  the spirit of God through every dimension. We are back live. America is fighting for
[20:44.040 --> 20:54.040]  life right now and America is winning. But America is bleeding and the enemy comes for
[20:54.040 --> 21:01.040]  our weak, our young and our defenseless and you can feel them cry out to God constantly.
[21:01.040 --> 21:10.040]  It creates a psychic rage that have not acted upon. You will commit suicide. Your body will
[21:10.040 --> 21:15.040]  fall apart. You will get cancer because your body empathizes with the death and the torture
[21:15.040 --> 21:22.040]  of the children and the innocent and wishes to join them because your body, your cells
[21:22.040 --> 21:29.040]  have empathy and are disgusted with you for not taking action. You don't become weaker
[21:29.040 --> 21:35.040]  standing up for the innocent. You become stronger. You don't become weaker getting close to God.
[21:35.040 --> 21:50.040]  You become unbelievably powerful and the enemy fears that power. All right. There's no doubt
[21:50.040 --> 22:01.040]  that the enemy is making its move and there is no doubt that we're only here because our
[22:01.040 --> 22:10.040]  ancestors were so strong and prepared. They prepared in law. They prepared in science.
[22:10.040 --> 22:18.040]  They prepared in their spirits. They prepared in their very will and action for the time
[22:18.040 --> 22:24.040]  that is now coming for us to escape the attempt of the enemy to destroy us because right when
[22:24.040 --> 22:30.040]  we become technological, that's when the enemy comes in and tries to seduce the human species
[22:30.040 --> 22:39.040]  and destroy us. But we have to decide to destroy ourselves. We have to make that deal. And
[22:39.040 --> 22:49.040]  so all this other trappings, all the other confetti means nothing. And as people get in
[22:49.040 --> 22:53.040]  touch with God, they're not going to care about Hollywood anymore. They're not going
[22:53.040 --> 23:02.040]  to be under the dominion of the enemy. And I just can't help it preach at times like these
[23:02.040 --> 23:14.040]  because it's at times like these when the political and spiritual and cultural lines, the
[23:14.040 --> 23:26.040]  planets align in 2020. And what is about to happen right now is such an incredible moment
[23:26.040 --> 23:32.040]  that the word epic doesn't serve it because it's overused. It's like when you really talk
[23:32.040 --> 23:36.040]  about Hitler or you really talk about Stalin or you really talk about Genghis Khan. There's
[23:36.040 --> 23:41.040]  so much talk about this person's Hitler, this person's Genghis Khan, that there's not really
[23:41.040 --> 23:53.040]  Genghis Khan roasting babies on spits for no reason but just to be and to feed that energy
[23:53.040 --> 24:00.040]  of destruction. So there's polar opposites in the universe, total destruction of life
[24:00.040 --> 24:11.040]  and life. And people have to make the decision. Do you serve life or do you serve death? And
[24:11.040 --> 24:16.040]  people think their top death is powerful. All the guys, the motorcycle gangs, even the
[24:16.040 --> 24:21.040]  military, skulls, skulls, skulls. But that skull is just what's left over of a human,
[24:21.040 --> 24:27.040]  real power is life. The scary patch would be a family, the military or the family on
[24:27.040 --> 24:38.040]  their arm. Wow, that was a military that had that. That would be the strong grip. Because
[24:38.040 --> 24:42.040]  there's no reason to kill people unless they're hurting innocents. There's no power in killing
[24:42.040 --> 24:48.040]  them. A real power is having the will to do whatever it takes to stop it and to die if
[24:48.040 --> 24:53.040]  you need to. And once you cross that point, one thing they really get good and leave for
[24:53.040 --> 25:06.040]  that is that V recreates clearly for a person that's probably his daughter, they never make
[25:06.040 --> 25:15.040]  it clear, a concentration camp and the torture and a reeducation camp. And then they say,
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.040]  you need to betray people. We're going to blow your head off. And she says, blow my head off
[25:19.040 --> 25:26.040]  then. And at that point, she's free. That's why they have to attack him for us. That's
[25:26.040 --> 25:31.040]  why they have to lie about us and lie about you. That's why they have to continually say
[25:31.040 --> 25:36.040]  we're losers and that we're dishonest and we're not real and we're failures because they fear
[25:36.040 --> 25:44.040]  the fact above all else that we're not followers like they are. And that we don't feel powerful
[25:44.040 --> 25:52.040]  when we see a bunch of soulless people hunched over drooling. It makes us feel weak. You
[25:52.040 --> 25:57.040]  see Satanists and corrupt people like Tim Cook, when you see him in that bow tie at the
[25:57.040 --> 26:01.040]  Golden Globes, he's not being his little fake wimpy guy, but the mean corporate guy that
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.040]  runs sleigh of camps and suicide nets and forced drugging and the real operations actually
[26:05.040 --> 26:11.040]  tearing humans apart. He's there with all those other demon peacocks just raging with
[26:11.040 --> 26:18.040]  his evil will to do bad and not tearing me a jerk. He thinks that's powerful to do whatever
[26:18.040 --> 26:28.040]  he wants and stomp on little people. You talk about being cut off from God. God hates
[26:28.040 --> 26:40.040]  Tim Cook. You know who Tim Cook, when he goes to hell, which is just a dimension. Tim Cook
[26:40.040 --> 26:48.040]  is going to be in a jail cell for eternity with himself, a jail cell he built. And his
[26:48.040 --> 26:53.040]  burning hatred for humanity is going to be the fires of hell that he created because
[26:53.040 --> 26:59.040]  the truth is, God didn't create hell. It's the one thing God didn't create. It's what
[26:59.040 --> 27:04.040]  people with free wills did who decided to turn against God. In fact, the only original
[27:04.040 --> 27:10.040]  thing in the universe outside of God's consciousness is hell. And that's why Christ went to hell
[27:10.040 --> 27:19.040]  to prove God himself could come to our level and do it, to take the keys to hell and death.
[27:19.040 --> 27:25.040]  And say, Satan, you created all this. You created the sin and destruction and the knowledge
[27:25.040 --> 27:30.040]  of evil and doing perverse, destructive things to innocence. And you tried to pervert all this
[27:30.040 --> 27:38.040]  goodness. Well, guess what? I'm going to march straight in after I take on every crime and
[27:38.040 --> 27:44.040]  every sin and feel every single drop of it because God's got eternity to just stop the
[27:44.040 --> 27:53.040]  watch and go, I'm taking every bit of it. No painkillers. I'm taking every bit of it that
[27:53.040 --> 27:58.040]  ever happened, did happen and was going to happen because that's justice because God created
[27:58.040 --> 28:03.040]  us. And if God could have guilt, it's that to have other sentient beings to spend eternity
[28:03.040 --> 28:11.040]  with God had to give us the power to be real and to choose. And so that meant there were
[28:11.040 --> 28:17.040]  those that would choose to create the things you see Hollywood creating and the things you
[28:17.040 --> 28:23.040]  see all of them doing. It's a giant, sick, disgusting joke. And everyone should thank
[28:23.040 --> 28:34.040]  themselves every millisecond. They're not Tim Cook. Who is a slave? Who will be imprisoned
[28:34.040 --> 28:41.040]  for eternity in himself and his selfishness and his cutoffness that he thinks is so powerful,
[28:41.040 --> 28:46.040]  screwing everyone over, smashing people under his thumb, grinding his heels into those
[28:46.040 --> 28:53.040]  children. You built hell. You are hell. And you are going into that black hole, Tim Cook.
[28:53.040 --> 29:22.040]  You are damned to hate ease.

[30:58.040 --> 31:05.040]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know. Everybody
[31:05.040 --> 31:12.040]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the
[31:12.040 --> 31:18.040]  flu vaccine right before they get it and that they get the worst case of the flu of their
[31:18.040 --> 31:26.040]  life. But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and
[31:26.040 --> 31:31.040]  clinics to get the injections. It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies
[31:31.040 --> 31:36.040]  in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of
[31:36.040 --> 31:41.040]  getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity. It goes on and on. Or the fact
[31:41.040 --> 31:46.040]  that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation, that the flu vaccine
[31:46.040 --> 31:53.040]  has never, ever even worked. But how do you prop up a hoax? You keep the giant hoax going.
[31:53.040 --> 31:58.040]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.

[33:20.040 --> 33:35.040]  I don't want to interrupt but I'm leaving. You've been doing great Owen. You're going
[33:35.040 --> 33:40.040]  to finish up with these calls within Gregory's and of course Harrison Smith are going to
[33:40.040 --> 33:44.040]  take another hour of calls. Cruz volunteered to do it. So we're here live covering this
[33:44.040 --> 33:48.040]  hoping everything de-escalates. So the live coverage continues. Everybody spread those
[33:48.040 --> 33:53.040]  legs. The gloves are hacking us trying to shut this down. Don't let them win. No BS.
[33:53.040 --> 33:56.040]  Everything straight shooting here. See, I don't have some Mackie value manipulative
[33:56.040 --> 34:02.040]  view with me. It's all straightforward attack. That's the real power. Don't act so
[34:02.040 --> 34:08.040]  surprised. Globalist. You didn't think you could silence the American people. Did you
[34:08.040 --> 34:14.040]  join band not video and I will complete your training together. We can overthrow the
[34:14.040 --> 34:28.040]  emperor and restore the republic. You know, I remember the gun confiscation
[34:28.040 --> 34:36.040]  questionnaires. They were given out by George H. W. Bush and about Bill Clinton at
[34:36.040 --> 34:43.040]  classified levels. So to recreate it, a smart conservative think tank in like 1995
[34:43.040 --> 34:48.040]  had the military do the questionnaire as the way to get the classified questionnaire
[34:48.040 --> 34:56.040]  out and to cause a system wide debate about it. And I was so unsophisticated back
[34:56.040 --> 35:02.040]  then when I had like three star generals and stuff. I was only because I had a show.
[35:02.040 --> 35:05.040]  It wasn't that I was that important. There was nowhere to get stuff out. So you
[35:05.040 --> 35:09.040]  know, like retired three star generals calling you up and former deputy FBI
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.040]  directors, you know, and all this kind of crazy stuff. They're like, you got to do
[35:13.040 --> 35:16.040]  this, you got to do that. They're like, yeah, the military and the police, they
[35:16.040 --> 35:18.040]  be telling me how they're planning to turn them against the people how they're
[35:18.040 --> 35:21.040]  planning to do all this. And they call me back six months later and go, it's not
[35:21.040 --> 35:26.040]  the police that are bad. It's how they're trying to the program. It's the program.
[35:26.040 --> 35:30.040]  I said, well, you just come on air, General Parton or the other. I mean, I'm
[35:30.040 --> 35:35.040]  like 25 years old and I don't know what I'm like, the police, the police are bad.
[35:35.040 --> 35:40.040]  No, no, the police, not the police are bad. They're training the police for an
[35:40.040 --> 35:45.040]  authoritarian takeover. You got to warn the police. That's the thing about trying
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.040]  to wake up young people. They got all the strength. They got everything, but they
[35:49.040 --> 35:53.040]  just don't even they're listening. They hear what you're saying, but they only
[35:53.040 --> 35:58.040]  get one part of it. And it just took a long time to figure it all out. But and
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.040]  of course, the police got problems. They're a manifestation of us. We're a
[36:01.040 --> 36:07.040]  fallen country and a fallen world. But yesterday we're taking all these calls
[36:07.040 --> 36:16.040]  and it's different than having the actual document, which we've showed was on the
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.040]  news 20 years ago and Obama did it again. I don't know, like 13 years ago. This
[36:22.040 --> 36:28.040]  was about, you know, 10, 11 years ago, right when he got in office 2010 when
[36:28.040 --> 36:33.040]  they were officially asking, will you take guns? Will you break up families? Will
[36:33.040 --> 36:36.040]  you then they put out manuals saying, we're going to do this like it's well,
[36:36.040 --> 36:42.040]  it's I've got my orders here. I'm as if they ever thought that would get everybody
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.040]  on board with it because it was official Army manuals. It's like having Beto go,
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.040]  I'm going to confiscate the guns. And then every Democrat candidate, like 11
[36:50.040 --> 36:56.040]  others go, Yeah, we want to confiscate all the guns. And we'll kill you. You
[36:56.040 --> 37:00.040]  know, we'll use nuclear weapons on you. Folks went, Whoa, this is exactly what
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.040]  my grandpa or my neighbor told me. And who were those grandpas because it's
[37:04.040 --> 37:09.040]  not about kissing, but it's about the people that knew. And they were always
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.040]  like, Oh, that's just your crazy old uncle over there. And you know, the crazy old
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.040]  uncle was like a CIA assassin. I'm gonna talk about my family just in general,
[37:17.040 --> 37:20.040]  you know, it's like, Oh, yeah, that's it. Oh, that's the crazy old uncle. He says
[37:20.040 --> 37:24.040]  this is how the country works. Everything because they knew they were
[37:24.040 --> 37:27.040]  there. And they always thought they were doing something for a good reason until
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.040]  they found out the compartmentalization because they followed the orders until
[37:31.040 --> 37:37.040]  it got to a certain point. And then it was like, Holy hell, it's about
[37:37.040 --> 37:44.040]  vampires and blood drinking and screwing little kids. Because the average person
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.040]  is hit with that and just says, There's no way this could be true.
[37:48.040 --> 37:55.040]  And then you break through the wall and it's all you find. You're like, What the
[37:55.040 --> 38:00.040]  hell's going on here? That's their cult. That's their bag. That's what they do.
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.040]  And our denial of this is what allows it to happen. You think I want to cover
[38:05.040 --> 38:11.040]  children's toys with little blonde girls with genitals that they're giving kids
[38:11.040 --> 38:16.040]  to screw them up. Pito dolls. No, I don't want to cover that. You need to know
[38:16.040 --> 38:25.040]  that children are being hit with that. You think I like sitting here
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.040]  constantly studying evil and what they're up to. You think I like it? No, I don't
[38:30.040 --> 38:38.040]  like it at all. But there's a reaction that happens when I face it and I deal
[38:38.040 --> 38:44.040]  with it. I get closer to God and I only look at it long enough to know what's
[38:44.040 --> 38:51.040]  going on and assess it. I'm going to tell you right now, folks, everybody needs
[38:51.040 --> 38:56.040]  to understand that if you don't fight this, just as sure as the sun came up
[38:56.040 --> 39:00.040]  this morning when you stand before God doesn't say, I don't know you. How heavy
[39:00.040 --> 39:06.040]  is that? I don't know you. You're not a man after my own heart. You're not a
[39:06.040 --> 39:11.040]  woman after my own heart. I don't know you because if you know me, you wouldn't
[39:11.040 --> 39:14.040]  be standing there putting up with this because let me tell you something. God
[39:14.040 --> 39:18.040]  hates people that know evil is going on and don't fight it more than the people
[39:18.040 --> 39:24.040]  doing it. There's a sick form of respect that God has for people that are
[39:24.040 --> 39:28.040]  consciously evil and do bad. God hates and wants to destroy them. But people
[39:28.040 --> 39:33.040]  that know what's going on and actually have a connection to God, that's like
[39:33.040 --> 39:39.040]  nerve endings up to God and God is just like, what you know this is wrong. You
[39:39.040 --> 39:44.040]  don't like torturing children. You don't like drinking their blood. Will they beg
[39:44.040 --> 39:48.040]  for mommy? You don't like inventing new evils, but you don't do anything. I am
[39:48.040 --> 39:53.040]  on a really turn you over to yourself. You damn coward. I said I wouldn't preach
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.040]  anymore. I'm just so sick of these people. I came here today and I'd already
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.040]  been researching last night and this morning I had hundreds of articles and
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.040]  video clips. I just can't even look at it anymore. I mean, it's enough to read
[40:04.040 --> 40:09.040]  the transcript of what Governor Northup said because it's an exact script. He's
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.040]  following the exact script. We already saw them pre-programming and now it's an
[40:13.040 --> 40:17.040]  official script, which means they're going operational. And we got to just sit
[40:17.040 --> 40:21.040]  here and wait for them to come at a mass shooting or a bombing and blame it on
[40:21.040 --> 40:25.040]  us. And it's not getting blamed for it. They're going to blame me. They're
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.040]  going to blame you. They're going to blame every gun owner. It's that we know
[40:30.040 --> 40:45.040]  they're doing it and we can't stop them. I mean, that guy is such, he's perfect.
[40:45.040 --> 40:52.040]  He's perfect for Satan. He is a science officer in the New World Order that is a
[40:52.040 --> 40:56.040]  specialist in keeping babies alive while they get the orders in before they take
[40:56.040 --> 41:00.040]  their organs and tricking mothers and doing it. I mean, he brags about how he
[41:00.040 --> 41:04.040]  kills babies after they're born and calls it keeping them comfortable with that
[41:04.040 --> 41:13.040]  degenerate fake Southern accent that makes me want to vomit. And then, of course,
[41:13.040 --> 41:18.040]  he's running around in KKK outfits and all that stuff. It's like whatever is
[41:18.040 --> 41:23.040]  inappropriate, whatever is sneaky, whatever is weird, whatever is dirty, whatever
[41:23.040 --> 41:37.040]  is filthy, he's into it. Because what he is is a controller. He's sold out. He's
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.040]  all about getting poor white people to hate poor black people. And that's all he
[41:42.040 --> 41:45.040]  does. And now, well, we're going to teach him here in Virginia. We're going to get
[41:45.040 --> 41:49.040]  them all killing each other. But his little Virginia stunt didn't go over too
[41:49.040 --> 41:59.040]  well. He didn't really carry out what they wanted a few years ago. So they're
[41:59.040 --> 42:05.040]  going to do it up real nice for everybody. And the globalists are threatened by
[42:05.040 --> 42:09.040]  the South. Strong, hardworking people that actually care about each other, black,
[42:09.040 --> 42:13.040]  white, old, young, you name it. And they're so scared of that. And they're so
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.040]  scared of that rural community. And they're so scared of that Christianity, so
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.040]  they want us all killing each other. Well, fentanyl doesn't give a damn what
[42:21.040 --> 42:23.040]  color you are. It's coming to kill you because the chai comms are shipping it
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.040]  in there. Do you remember that next time you hear a black racist or white racist
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.040]  when these people shooting their mouth off about all this person doing that?
[42:30.040 --> 42:35.040]  I was like, remember, it's the globalists shipping that fentanyl in to kill you and
[42:35.040 --> 42:39.040]  your family. It's killing millions now. And Trump's trying to stop it. They're
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.040]  trying to stop him from stopping. All right, I'll play him. I'll give the number
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.040]  one. But it was just so amazing to hear those military and police people call in
[42:47.040 --> 42:51.040]  who got those training manuals and then the gun confiscation plans. I mean,
[42:51.040 --> 42:55.040]  it's in the news that happened. But to hear how they all turned against it and how
[42:55.040 --> 43:02.040]  it woke them up, that's so beautiful. Hey, you there. We have a problem. You see,
[43:02.040 --> 43:09.040]  there is a baby. The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready. The father of
[43:09.040 --> 43:15.040]  this baby doesn't want to settle down. The mother starts to have regrets. The
[43:15.040 --> 43:23.040]  father considers leaving town. But a friend says there's a solution. She says
[43:23.040 --> 43:30.040]  to have an abortion. The mother decides to look into it. The clinic assures her
[43:30.040 --> 43:36.040]  it's safe. She's made her decision. She's going to have an abortion. The problem
[43:36.040 --> 43:40.040]  is that baby is you.
[44:06.040 --> 44:10.040]  There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere you can place your bet
[44:10.040 --> 44:16.040]  in a fight where it's going to have more hour per dollar. Your bang for your
[44:16.040 --> 44:22.040]  buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.040]  system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy. And
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.040]  so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the
[44:30.040 --> 44:34.040]  fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the
[44:34.040 --> 44:40.040]  move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I
[44:40.040 --> 44:44.040]  want to attack. I want to go after the globalists. And just believe me, ladies
[44:44.040 --> 44:46.040]  and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to
[44:46.040 --> 44:49.040]  fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in
[44:49.040 --> 44:53.040]  the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and
[44:53.040 --> 44:56.040]  my family, for your family. Because we're in this together.
[44:56.040 --> 45:04.040]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from Four Wars. Your
[45:04.040 --> 45:09.040]  support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist
[45:09.040 --> 45:13.040]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just in the U.S.
[45:13.040 --> 45:18.040]  worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting
[45:18.040 --> 45:23.040]  Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well. You're still lacking on the big
[45:23.040 --> 45:27.040]  censorship, taking action against that in some other areas, but trying to end the
[45:27.040 --> 45:31.040]  wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's been
[45:31.040 --> 45:36.040]  doing an amazing job. But now more than ever, we really have to realize that
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.040]  we're being targeted because we are effective. And the globalists are
[45:40.040 --> 45:45.040]  beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way. And so we're
[45:45.040 --> 45:48.040]  going to see some major fireworks out of them. But it's critical to not let
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.040]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us. That's an
[45:53.040 --> 45:57.040]  attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and
[45:57.040 --> 46:18.040]  stay happy.
[46:27.040 --> 46:32.040]  It also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans, but also
[46:32.040 --> 46:38.040]  re-mineralizes the teeth. Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.040]  knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis. This is all proven. You can
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.040]  make claims with this. But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this
[46:45.040 --> 46:50.040]  good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a
[46:50.040 --> 46:55.040]  healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel. So we're really proud of it.
[46:55.040 --> 46:59.040]  We're proud of the operation M4store.com. That's why we're still on air.
[46:59.040 --> 47:19.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.880 --> 47:24.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:24.360 --> 47:33.080]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[47:33.080 --> 47:40.280]  It's just the constant frustration is why can't everybody see and why do we have to
[47:40.280 --> 47:48.920]  go through this and why does evil even exist?
[47:48.920 --> 48:03.280]  This willed force wants to hurt innocents and it's because the universe is free will.
[48:03.280 --> 48:11.120]  Freedom has a cost at every level.
[48:11.120 --> 48:24.200]  Freedom comes with great responsibility because freedom is power and power will circle is
[48:24.200 --> 48:32.200]  responsibility but it's responsibility that animates our synapses.
[48:32.200 --> 48:37.600]  Alright I'm going to play some of the governor and I'm just going to explain this again.
[48:37.600 --> 48:40.940]  I know the listeners know this but all I can do is be an emergency beacon.
[48:40.940 --> 48:42.440]  This is the assault.
[48:42.440 --> 48:43.440]  This is the attack.
[48:43.440 --> 48:45.200]  You can see it.
[48:45.200 --> 48:46.760]  You can smell it.
[48:46.760 --> 48:52.880]  They'll try again and I think they're going to fail next week but while the Senate trial
[48:52.880 --> 48:56.960]  the president starts Tuesday we'll be there live covering it from Capitol Hill.
[48:56.960 --> 49:00.800]  Imagine we got to be there.
[49:00.800 --> 49:07.680]  While all of that is going on just south of there in Virginia where the Revolutionary War
[49:07.680 --> 49:17.920]  kicked off they're in Boston, Massachusetts, Twin Places and where the Civil War started
[49:17.920 --> 49:21.080]  the deep state is obsessed with history repeating.
[49:21.080 --> 49:25.640]  They don't have any presence but they've learned history repeats and so if they can
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.600]  try to make history repeat they've learned that's a lucky number.
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.840]  And so they're betting like a craps table everything on Virginia and Charlottesville
[49:34.840 --> 49:42.520]  Square and the governor is running around flapping his little vampire bat wings.
[49:42.520 --> 49:50.560]  You talk about a peckerwood man that guy's just, I'm not going to go into that guy.
[49:50.560 --> 49:51.560]  How weak he is.
[49:51.560 --> 49:52.560]  How pathetic he is.
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.200]  How evil he is and the fact that he's ruling over everybody and pissing on dead children
[49:58.200 --> 50:09.640]  selling their fricking organs and the reason I'm mad is my cells tell me you're bad.
[50:09.640 --> 50:13.720]  You need to get him but they got it all set up where he's the victim if we stand up for
[50:13.720 --> 50:19.400]  kids he's killing we're the bad guys so we got to sit there and watch him salivate and
[50:19.400 --> 50:30.400]  literally get an erection while he's talking about them.
[50:30.400 --> 50:34.920]  The man is an abomination but here's the thing they'll make an attempt on his life.
[50:34.920 --> 50:41.200]  I want him to live a long time in a prison cell I wish no arm upon governor Northam and
[50:41.200 --> 50:47.120]  they know that we're pissed they know it's a natural response and they want to stage
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.200]  it to say the natural response to the guy just rubbing himself like play that demon
[50:53.200 --> 50:54.200]  devil worshipers.
[50:54.200 --> 51:02.200]  The person identifies as a vampire coven witch leader a man dressed like a woman but notice
[51:02.200 --> 51:05.000]  now it's not a woman they say a woman is a vampire.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.800]  It's a dude with a shaved head with fake things with a baby rubbing blood on them you're like
[51:09.800 --> 51:13.960]  well first you're a man that's a woman now you're a vampire that's a woman it's all about
[51:13.960 --> 51:20.320]  that mind game let him identify he's a vampire that wants to kill babies and then he's just
[51:20.320 --> 51:26.280]  rubbing blood the dead baby on him and just you want to see it that's the bottom of the
[51:26.280 --> 51:32.160]  rat hole right there you want to go down the rabbit hole that's what's at the bottom that
[51:32.160 --> 51:38.600]  thing right there a creepy psycho but if he calls it an art project everyone at the bar
[51:38.600 --> 51:44.120]  stands around because it's deviant and destructive and they're already so dead the only glimmer
[51:44.120 --> 51:51.640]  they get in that in that black hole of hell is a little ray of God's hate hitting them
[51:51.640 --> 51:55.720]  they could have God completely joined with them and experience things they could never
[51:55.720 --> 52:03.920]  imagine but they just want God's hate and that's why they have comedy central shows
[52:03.920 --> 52:09.680]  that go I killed my daughter I killed my baby I loved it I had power it was a little girl
[52:09.680 --> 52:13.840]  was gonna have a great life and I feel powerful I murdered it because I'm a selfish piece
[52:13.840 --> 52:23.920]  of garbage I am governor of Virginia I'd play the clip for new listeners that don't
[52:23.920 --> 52:28.080]  know about it but I just can't watch it again can you I mean I've got like hours of video
[52:28.080 --> 52:34.880]  of leftist public events when I am God the orgasm I have when I chopped my son up when
[52:34.880 --> 52:44.200]  I saw his dead body I love you Satan I mean it's literal hellraiser it's not Linda Blair
[52:44.200 --> 52:51.320]  in a movie it's the real world and she squats down like she's taking a dump when she talks
[52:51.320 --> 52:57.480]  about how she killed her child eat like the sioppers go and then squat like you're taking
[52:57.480 --> 53:04.720]  a dump at the metaphysical image of it's a piece of crap you know who's gonna be flushed
[53:04.720 --> 53:11.920]  down the galactic toilet it's you lady it's Michelle Wolf you're damned hell because you

[53:55.720 --> 53:59.400]  manage them because you're so damn dumb you need to poison everybody so you can feel big
[53:59.400 --> 54:05.520]  oh that's really so powerful oh my God they love going into the mall and seeing half the
[54:05.520 --> 54:09.280]  kids manly retarded for the damn shots it's way worse than what they say I mean half the
[54:09.280 --> 54:14.440]  kids out there freaking already dead basically great job man great you're a really cool guy
[54:14.440 --> 54:21.000]  blowing out their transmitters with nanotech freaking stuff they've had 30 years eating
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.120]  their synapses that connect electrochemically to the big guy wow wow you're gonna be cut
[54:27.120 --> 54:31.840]  off from God with that little move buddy boy and if you think you're cutting those kids
[54:31.840 --> 54:41.400]  off from God you're wrong it's you it's gonna be eternally torn into pieces but I wish
[54:41.400 --> 54:48.240]  you a long healthy life like an exhibit in a museum of what a piece of bullying filthy
[54:48.240 --> 54:58.040]  arrogant trash is you know there's nobody dislikes plugging more than me the products
[54:58.040 --> 55:03.800]  are great if you like fighting tyranny and you like standing up and you like getting
[55:03.800 --> 55:08.400]  great products go to enforce.com I'm gonna leave it at that okay I mean seriously because
[55:08.400 --> 55:11.520]  I bang my head up against the wall to fund this place and I'm not complaining if you
[55:11.520 --> 55:15.240]  know what I just have learned I gotta give it to God and if we're gonna get the funding
[55:15.240 --> 55:20.480]  to expand and stuff I mean I don't have any worry going to Virginia going to DC going anywhere
[55:20.480 --> 55:23.640]  people coming after me and death threats and all that stuff because I mean it's all in
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.920]  God's hands literally I'm a little selfish I go listen God if they if they shit with
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.200]  a high power rifle I don't want to be paralyzed or you know vegetable just make sure their
[55:33.200 --> 55:37.320]  aim is really good because I don't want to die it's the opposite I love life so much
[55:37.320 --> 55:42.200]  I just am ready to die and you said I will never commit suicide I don't want to die I
[55:42.200 --> 55:48.760]  just I just might be there my flesh says if you get killed who's gonna take care of children
[55:48.760 --> 55:54.240]  God's gonna take care of that you're gonna take care of that because I've realized the
[55:54.240 --> 55:58.000]  only way I can stay sane and it happened to me about 3am last night it's not just to say
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.880]  that I gotta turn everything over to God because even though I say on air you gotta turn over
[56:04.880 --> 56:12.480]  God but all of us try to do it ourselves we can't do it folks and I gotta tell you when
[56:12.480 --> 56:20.200]  I really turned over God the depth of my vision that I already thought was super intense and
[56:20.200 --> 56:25.080]  it was driving me crazy because it's torturing me I know you feel the same way as good people
[56:25.080 --> 56:29.880]  when I finally just said I just it's like a person in the ocean for swimming for a hundred
[56:29.880 --> 56:35.760]  miles finally hit and land it was just like oh God I'm turning it all over to you whatever
[56:35.760 --> 56:42.640]  happens it's all in your will and just thank you for what you've done and that's what matters
[56:42.640 --> 56:48.920]  and it's all about free will God's like what can you handle and the minute I made that
[56:48.920 --> 56:56.680]  decision it was not even the discernment got turned up it did but it was almost like it
[56:56.680 --> 57:00.120]  was like you don't even need to look at that stuff anymore it's all right you already see
[57:00.120 --> 57:09.520]  it all you just gotta turn it loose and you gotta take action and you gotta let me take
[57:09.520 --> 57:18.400]  control and you gotta be satisfied son because that's all God wants like the song from Eric
[57:18.400 --> 57:27.000]  Skinner where all his mother wants is for him to be satisfied and that's the message is
[57:27.000 --> 57:35.280]  satisfaction is God is that relationship not some dirty church and some devil by the pulpit
[57:35.280 --> 57:41.080]  but you and God that's real and that's all that matters that's all that matters nobody
[57:41.080 --> 57:45.040]  out there should commit suicide nobody out there should feel bad about yourselves you
[57:45.040 --> 57:50.920]  are in contact with God I love watching David night in the morning I love tuning in to Owen
[57:50.920 --> 57:56.040]  Troyer I love all the other shows we do here but I'll be honest with you we run during
[57:56.040 --> 58:01.640]  the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads so you think you don't
[58:01.640 --> 58:05.920]  want to hear an ad I don't want to hear an ad but here's the bottom line we're barely
[58:05.920 --> 58:09.840]  paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalist not contract I don't
[58:09.840 --> 58:15.240]  want them to win so listen you've got this guarantee for me we saw enough product we'll
[58:15.240 --> 58:19.400]  have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalist run for their
[58:19.400 --> 58:24.680]  money but we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus X2 these will change
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.720]  your life go check out the turmeric products check out the water filtration air filtration
[58:28.720 --> 58:33.160]  check it all out whatever you do take action and know be part of the second American revolution
[58:33.160 --> 58:36.840]  be part of crushing the globalist and get great products at the same time info or store
[58:36.840 --> 58:41.880]  dot com is the umbrella site enforce life dot com is the supplements take action now
[58:41.880 --> 58:52.360]  and fund the info or for your own future the globalists know that I will never willingly
[58:52.360 --> 58:59.240]  give up I've said it many times I will never give in I will never give up but I could give
[58:59.240 --> 59:05.920]  out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity
[59:05.920 --> 59:11.880]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been
[59:11.880 --> 59:18.560]  silenced in cyberspace that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech
[59:18.560 --> 59:24.880]  and to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[59:24.880 --> 59:30.720]  by spreading the word about news wars dot com in force dot com and banned on video and

[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:12.640]  what you expect no i'm gonna talk to people who are actually honest okay i'm what did
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:18.960]  i said it's not honest your entire attitude but i'm not gonna talk so our time is better
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:23.160]  invested elsewhere and i'd rather wear where else no one's talking nobody's here well we're
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:26.680]  training right now and then we're gonna go and talk to people on campus we're gonna find

[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:40.280]  please can you let us back to our training so just ignoring the facts is not gonna make

[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:55.760]  which you are not if i ever said this dishonest doesn't matter you're from info wars what is
[1:02:55.760 --> 1:03:01.600]  info wars said this dishonest everything name one thing that gave frogs in the war mean
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:08.520]  atrazine the chemical runoff from from pharmaceuticals from pharmaceuticals and chemicals we put

[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:26.640]  all in for uninformed that's your problem you're uninformed you have no idea what's
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:29.560]  going on you don't know what's going on in the bernie sanders campaign you have no idea
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:32.960]  what's going on in politics and as soon as someone comes in front of you who has an idea
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:37.720]  you want to silence their free speech and act like it doesn't happen okay so so so this
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:41.840]  is your average bernie sanders supporters they have no clue about the bernie sanders
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:47.480]  campaign out here promoting socialism but they don't want to talk politics even though
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:51.320]  they're out here campaigning for bernie sanders so i'm gonna give you guys one last chance
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:56.960]  to make yourselves look good here so why do you support bernie sanders i'm not gonna mention
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:04:02.040]  that but i'm not gonna talk about that but i'm gonna say that we're not advocating socialism
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:07.480]  but i kind of wish we were because i am a socialist and it would be good for this country so bernie
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:14.040]  is not a socialist no you want socialism absolutely what what country has an example of socialism
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:19.720]  you'd like to bring here apparently i can't talk about that so i thought you were the
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:25.080]  trainee are you the trainer if you want to talk to the bernie so wait are you the trainer
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:28.640]  or trainee if you want to talk to the bernie sanders campaign and that girl is thinking
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:38.520]  about one thing she's like i'm with the wrong person sorry he's already taken you have done
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:46.320]  well lord zeta do what must be done can you imagine raising children like that person
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:52.600]  right there or for socialism we can't say that he doesn't even get he says i'm a liar
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:58.520]  i'm a fraud right here face it doesn't even get it i would thank you for everything you've
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:03.680]  done for the info war but i know you're like me you don't want my thanks you want victory
[1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:07.400]  over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off
[1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:10.960]  your back and off your children's back and you know what i'm the same way and that's
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:15.720]  why we're on the same damn team and it's why info wars has been delivering time and time
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:22.880]  again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:29.880]  i'm committed to a future for humanity and i know you are as well so thank you in 2019
[1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:33.400]  for standing with us because you are the info war and i want to thank you for committing
[1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:38.400]  to stand with us in 2020 however you can for bottom my heart for my family and from the
[1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:43.120]  great crew at info wars i want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know
[1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:49.360]  that's not just words that's reality you have made history we have made history together
[1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:56.360]  info wars dot com only has power because of you and i suggest you use it
[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:26.360]  and
[1:06:49.360 --> 1:07:00.800]  look at this person look at this individual but we're not individuals we are we're not
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:10.320]  the globalists seek to create an omnipresence so that they can enforce their will through
[1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:23.360]  the omnipresence which is the inverse of god who has omnipresence to enforce free will
[1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:30.320]  what do you think is going to win that cosmic battle but it is sad for those that don't
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:37.760]  dial into it you look at bad not video which has gotten massive traffic now and the site
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:44.480]  looks great works good except when there's like 200,000 people on it or something sometimes
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:47.840]  and so we're working on it we're not google we're not apple we don't got any slave factories
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:54.880]  in china but i mean i just look at what owen is churning out like a machine like a machine
[1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:59.920]  gun with unlimited ammo and barrels that never melt and i just go to his channel on there
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:08.160]  and i was like this is solid gold but you understand something owen's work is like a tree falling
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:14.960]  in the forest that no one hears doesn't make a sound so i'm explaining something do an
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:27.200]  overhead shot please you can have a sperm and you can have the egg and there's a whole
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:35.680]  potential universe there a man and a woman that information going in to detonate this incredible
[1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:40.720]  consciousness and what's going to begin in that transceiver that's going to pick up
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:47.120]  the interdimensional spirit loaded into it but that's a detonator
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:58.080]  but if there's not a womb and there's not a person and there's not an infrastructure to
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:05.680]  take care of this there's not a planet to take care of this it can't go to its next level
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:15.840]  it needs a sun needs a moon to perfectly hold it in orbit make sure all conditions are just right
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:24.320]  but this isn't going to be strong in this development unless something attacks it
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:39.520]  it's strong that's the same thing with oh and shroy or any of our reporters
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:45.680]  the ball doesn't move down the field without you
[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:50.480]  so when i sit here and i tell you you're important
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:54.320]  everything
[1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:04.720]  everything we do doesn't have an effect unless you care about it unless you promote it
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:10.960]  and i want to explain something it's not like you promoting the show is a sub level of this
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:18.560]  it's the top of the pyramid it's easy to want freedom and want justice and you've got to have
[1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:24.480]  people that are willing to be demonized and attacked to do it that's like getting air when
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:30.160]  you've been underwater people who haven't experienced the truth don't know that it's our job to show them
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:37.440]  but the ball doesn't go down the field without you and you're like yeah let's forget that i know
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:43.440]  you get it because you understand it i'm not talking to you i'm explaining to the listeners i
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:48.400]  know you already know this but the prodigal son's one of the most important parallels and and and
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:11:00.240]  master classes in the bible you know the story rich landowner owns a big farm big big ranch plantation
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:10.240]  and his second born son comes to him when he turns that like 13 14 years old's a man
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:16.640]  and says i want my inheritance the father says i respect you so much you're my son
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:23.760]  here's a third of everything we got he runs off for a decade parting animal all the fake friends
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:30.080]  all the sex all the everything blasted out of his brain he finally comes back half naked doesn't
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:33.920]  know who he is a crazy homeless person and they get him and they bathe him and they feed him for a
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.720]  week getting back halfway normal and the oldest son who's running things for the old dad comes in
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:49.600]  he says man that guy's a freaking loser and you are throwing this huge party for him and killing
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:57.040]  the red heifer you're the best beef we've got and doing all of this honoring him
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:04.560]  the father says you're worth a thousand times what he is i don't need to give you that
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:10.640]  you've got everything you you're the you're my first born you're the one that performs
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:16.800]  nothing against folks in our first born but that's the parable of it it doesn't that's our family
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:23.360]  a just a little bit of who you are is so valuable that he came back
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:33.040]  and that's what we've got to understand here is that this broadcast is not for all of you
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:37.600]  that know as much as i do or more and i know you know that we've got to get to the lost sheep
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:43.440]  that's who god wants us to get and i and i love to say oh just focus on the leaders
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:47.120]  and just just don't worry about the dumb dumb public man can anybody sit here and watch these
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:51.040]  people fall to the brainwashing and i get it i can't go out in the crowd with these leftists
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:54.720]  going at you and your family we're going to kill you and not start calling them you know pieces of
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:58.640]  filth and scum because they are i mean that's what they follow they aren't they are trash you are what
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:03.760]  you eat and they're so dumbed out i've tried to talk to them i've tried to be nice that that's
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:11.360]  what they really spit on you so i'm not christ like i mean i'll say it i'm christ like i'm
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:15.680]  going to die for freedom but man i can't sit there and be nice to people like this and i don't know
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:21.040]  how to be nice to him i so i'm admitting all this to you on air how how do we do this it's just
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:30.400]  that i know that we have to sit there and tell the truth and we have to talk to the most unintelligent
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.720]  people because they've still got a spirit and and how we treat them is how we treat ourselves and
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:39.520]  not treating the general public like they are amazing because they are still connected to god
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:46.160]  they are amazing is what allowed them into that state we who are leaders have to animate them
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:51.760]  we're the like the nuclear fuel rods going in that create the reaction and cause the steam we
[1:13:51.760 --> 1:14:00.080]  have to energize them they're failing their fallenness is a reflection on those of us that are
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:06.800]  connected to god and so the essence of satanism is looking down on dumb people because a satanist
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:12.480]  has some knowledge of god and the real world and power and decides to use it to screw people over
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:20.640]  and so you want to be the opposite of that you want to treat people it's like garbage in garbage
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:25.840]  out well you know you know the medium is the message they dumb the communications down and
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:32.320]  make them not make sense to screw people up we have to give people complex thought we have to
[1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:37.920]  we have to state things in their real esoteric form and then bring them out of the esoteric
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:44.320]  and the hidden so that they understand that we have to give people the master class up front
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:48.960]  so they can then pick up the pieces they get at the subconscious and spiritual level
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:54.480]  they already know all this because they were made by god we're not talking to the cerebral cortex
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:15:01.120]  program poison dumb down facsimile we're talking right to the spirit and it knows and we're saying
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:05.760]  you need to wake up you need to activate you need to resist and it starts with that relationship
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:09.200]  with god because we could talk about this all day long no matter what's happening to me no matter
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:16.480]  what's going on i can instantly as i'm constantly in contact with god but i can absolutely a hundred
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:25.120]  percent charge into god just absolutely pours in and there's no experience like it there's no
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:28.880]  drug like it there's no sex like it there's not your firstborn child being born in front of you
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:33.840]  like it when you dial into god the only thing you keep asking is why doesn't everybody want this
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:41.040]  why doesn't everybody have this and it's because ladies and gentlemen they have been slowly and
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:47.440]  manipulated from birth to be shuttered and not experience it and satan spends all his time trying
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:52.400]  to hide this from them that's what the illuminati says they're illuminated they're not their darkness
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:16:00.320]  we are the true illuminators we can all agree these are troubled times right so do you know who's on

[1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:24.880]  of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:30.560]  is the coral calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:35.600]  that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it

[1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:31.600]  the mother decides to look into it the clinic assures her it's safe she's made her decision
[1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:38.080]  she's going to have an abortion the problem is that baby is you

[1:19:54.560 --> 1:20:10.480]  out for the voiceless you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:26.480]  you
[1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:38.880]  i want to apologize for the listeners but i've got to put the fuel rods in
[1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:46.000]  i got to show you the enemy i don't want to look either i'm going to look because that's what
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:59.840]  children face that's what they see that's brian stelter that's the enemy right there
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:04.160]  that's not a human
[1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:10.560]  that's a demon god look at it jesus
[1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:14.720]  why
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:23.840]  look at that predator man wow he doesn't even know what it is and we are letting it hurt us
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:32.400]  we are letting it run around but that's what the enemy can muster notice they can't get any
[1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:37.760]  powerful voices they can't get any strong people they can't get anybody charismatic or dynamic
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:43.520]  because the cells of those people they could be black they could be white they could be asian
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:48.000]  they could be hispanic they could be old they could be young the cells of good people resonate
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:55.440]  with god they you you can't even join that you can just be tricked into serving it by telling you
[1:21:55.440 --> 1:22:01.680]  it's the moral authority put it back on screen real quick the reason i raise that is if you
[1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:08.960]  walked into a car dealership and a dude walked over like that you'd hide your children but look
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:16.800]  at this latest photo hbo teams with cnn's brian stelter for documentary about the rise of fake
[1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:23.840]  news and you can guess who's going to be starring in that look at the officious
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:36.960]  flip it practiced air of power a woman would see right through that that is a man with zero power
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:45.200]  zero and we need to point that out because this is a puffed up creature of jeff zucker
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:51.280]  whose job is censoring people and all this he has like a hundred thousand viewers on the show
[1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:58.880]  he's a joke but that's the devil he's got the system he's got the whole weapon system
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:07.680]  because he metaphysically forget needle cock he doesn't have a dick okay and i'm and i'm sorry
[1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:14.640]  to use that analogy but it's a family show this guy wants to rule you because he's a nobody
[1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:20.560]  i mean what type of nobody because it's not just in one photo he gets up on red carpets
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:24.880]  all these events where the peacocks come in when no one's even there and they like at restaurants
[1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:28.240]  or anywhere there's you know those red carpets everywhere there's like a thing they go oh i'm
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:33.920]  powerful it's like a ritual about i've arrived i have the corporate seals behind me
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.320]  and i'm a hero no brian you're not a hero
[1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:44.320]  so
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:54.080]  best part of you ran down your mother's ass crack and we all know it delay that i'm out of control
[1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:57.680]  i'm just being honest i can't help it that's the enemy right there
[1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:05.120]  and you destroy him with the truth and he thinks you're weak and he thinks he chose the right side
[1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:15.840]  i mean that is an abomination a walking talking demon how about your baby center maybe you should
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:20.800]  run a daycare service oh yeah hey i bet he'd be good to kill hey who wants to drop their kids off
[1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:27.600]  at brian's tilter's house oh you think the kids straight over there that is a psychotic filth
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:33.760]  you know from time to time i will look at stelter because i want to know what the devil
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:39.280]  look let me tell you if anybody that that's it folks that's that's in satan's army that's what
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:50.880]  generals look like fake empty slaves and he's blind as a bat man he's tone deaf and he ain't
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:58.560]  Beethoven he doesn't have any feeling he doesn't have anything he is literally the bottom of the
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:07.280]  universe he is the scum of the earth he is a absolutely destroyed soulless piece of trash
[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:14.000]  and i don't say that to victoriously declare it i'm saying get away from it run get behind me satan
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.640]  let's get as fast as as fast as we can let's take our children and race to the other side of the
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:22.720]  universe from that because at the next level you're going to find out what's really going on folks
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:29.040]  and i'm telling you it's already a race a bomb was detonated this is a weapon and god has spread
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:35.200]  out life as fast as god can because we think of god as invincible and omnipresent and god is if we
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:44.800]  believe in god and stand up but let me tell you the bomb the bomb doesn't think it just destroys
[1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:50.160]  it carries out the destruction of children period it's its primary mission it's all it does is kill
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:56.160]  life and they see children as the potential of the future and they attack attack and
[1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:03.680]  that's why they're powerful is because it's a program it's not a soul now let's let's let's
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:08.000]  talk about another demon one that actually you know as a doctor involved in keeping babies alive

[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:08.080]  not doing enough so so insurer and look at him kicking ass because that's where you get stuff done
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:12.720]  and that's when you win the game and this isn't some football game this is our families and the
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:18.240]  whole shooting match we're talking about so if you're not fired up just go serve satan and get on
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:25.840]  your knees and decide you want to be a brian stelter so i got up this morning i saw this in
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:32.320]  full wars dot com article that i wouldn't saw the stories about it dental assistant i was dental
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:39.680]  assistant once yeah how about nepotism my dad got me a job of the dentist six months made good money
[1:35:39.680 --> 1:35:48.160]  doing this minimal training but dental assistant fired for expressing support for trump on facebook
[1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:56.640]  yeah that's that's how this works and then we as a group don't feel threatened by that
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:03.440]  that another american i mean that's like that's like taking a big old knife big old dagger
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:11.920]  and just cutting the finger off that problem we better better not talk about how we like
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:16.960]  trump we'll get fired well you might as well shove that right in your heart then
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:24.320]  because what they did to her they did to me and that's not some patronizing thing about
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:30.080]  how i'm a big sweet bleeding heart i'm not a bleeding heart i'm building nations you're
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:36.800]  building nations we're men and when people are fired because they support the president duly
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:41.440]  elected we got a problem in this country with a bunch of damn authoritarians
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:52.080]  she's got a name robin pollock wrongfully fired on go fund me the left will give millions to one
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:56.480]  of their one of their pedophile chief spies or whatever you know turns out like most of
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:00.160]  the people that testify get from her like her pedophiles well of course they are that's the club
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:04.640]  they're in oh but a young woman gets fired oh we're not going to raise the money for her
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:10.640]  conservatives have to start not stepping up to the plate how about fighting for your life how
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:14.000]  about just putting a fight up i know our listeners the folks that are putting the fight up that's
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.440]  why they're scared of you they're scared of folks putting the fight up but you understand what i'm
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:30.720]  saying folks fighting is not heroic it's survival it's not heroic to fight it's a default and i'm
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:35.840]  asking listeners for a default position for her and for info wars and for yourself because if we
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:40.960]  don't get pissed about somebody losing their job because they support the president of the united
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:47.120]  states and if we don't see the people that fired her for that as a threat to everything decent
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.920]  and little hitlers in the making little stallings the making little mouths the tongues the making
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:58.640]  then we don't deserve the birthright that we've been given i'm gonna stop right there general

[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:29.200]  i i what does it have to do with me and then at the end of the day she was like well because
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:34.960]  um we just can't be getting bad reviews she really didn't give me a reason so i went and did
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:40.400]  my own research on their facebook page and i came to find out it was just one review and this person
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:45.840]  pretty much called me a racist because i posted on news media actually it was the night before the
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:53.920]  rally just to clarify that and um i posted on the news media just saying make america great again
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:59.360]  and you know you sit there and you watch all these people just slander our president and stuff and i

[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:18.080]  cow people contact you uh obviously it's public dental office that's for free speech in milwaukee
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:20.560]  i mean they haven't burned it down yet as the bernie sanders folks want to
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:28.880]  oh my goodness well i'm i'm according on my facebook one of my facebook posts post i was
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:35.120]  called a trump clan and that's okay i can be in part of the trump clan i'm fine with it
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:40.560]  as a you know to one of the responses and stuff i was like just like the bernie sanders clan and
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:46.320]  an obama clan so they take every word like they want to change the name of a hall that's lynched
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:51.840]  because somebody got lynched like the irish namespan uh the clan just means a tribe or a group or a
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:57.600]  family in scottish so exactly now they're trying to even demonize the word clan because the kkk
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:03.280]  said we're a family so now because the kkk using a scottish name for family now now now we can't
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:09.200]  use it do you see how they attack language oh yeah well anyways i'm a dental assistant a bit of
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:15.520]  dental assistant for almost nine years i feel like i do my job thoroughly i don't i've i always have
[1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:21.040]  dentists come back and say to me that you know i go above them beyond i'm not trying to throw my
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:25.360]  resume out there or anything and stuff but yeah i would like to be back as a dental assistant but
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:32.800]  in an office where i'm not going to be criticized for my religion or my politics or anything like
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:38.400]  that but i don't bring that into the building or whatever i leave it at the door and if people
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:44.080]  want to talk about it and stuff i can agree with them or disagree with them and i don't care but i
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.680]  you know like they said to me pretty much they were like oh did you do this on company time did
[1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:54.080]  you do this while you were on the clock or anything and i said no i was sitting on the couch
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:58.960]  mining my own business watching my tv show and just scrolling through facebook reading you know
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:04.960]  articles and whatnot and posting my freedom and committed a thought crime have you been taught
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:09.920]  you how about you apologize to zuckerberg and the people that reported you why don't you bow to them
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:19.520]  and say kind of can my can my son have food you want to bow to them no way no way no way i'll be
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:25.120]  fine i'm good i'm a strong woman and stuff and i'll get through this at the end of the day you
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:31.760]  know i'm still gonna support my president he's done a fine job and um let's make america great
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:36.960]  again and keep it great you know and keep it ongoing for years to come and the reason why
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:41.920]  i fight so hard for this is for my little one because it's like what is his future going to be
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:48.320]  like is he you know going to be slanted for you know what he says when he's older and it's just
[1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:53.360]  it's just unbelievable i have no first amendment anymore and it's very very disturbing you know
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:58.320]  well i had a feeling that once i got the cork out of the bottle you start really talking a lot
[1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:02.000]  do do one more little segment with us and get back to your son because i want you to just let
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:07.120]  it go talk about what it's like to be a normal just person working and then the thought police
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:10.240]  are on there and they find out who you are and they they find out where you work and then they
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:14.320]  stalk you and then they make a complaint and you're fired and then you're just like i don't
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:21.200]  want to go after my employer and i just try yeah you're right god loves you well i'm i'm i'm trying
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:26.880]  to find an attorney that's perfect for the situation and i've had a few people contact me
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:33.840]  but it's like it's a very very fine line because wisconsin is that state where they can fire you
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:40.000]  for anything no i get it at cause but they can't do it in a discriminatory way because of because
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:44.320]  of your political views the point is they it doesn't matter what the lawyers say they need to be punished
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:52.880]  knock on wood i am not tempting faith but everybody around the office especially folks
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:58.880]  that have worked there a long time have noticed that i really don't ever get sick now again i might
[1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:04.320]  get sick tomorrow because i just made that statement i'm not tempting faith i'll say that again because
[1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:08.320]  i am superstitious when it comes down to that i'm very thankful the good lord for the constitution
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:15.200]  i've been given but up until about eight nine years ago when i started taking x2
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:21.520]  in the product's enforced life i i still got sick every couple years and you know i still get
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:27.040]  sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that but now that i religiously
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:31.920]  take the products of infowars life or the highest quality supplements you're gonna find out there
[1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:40.480]  i just never did a fever anymore it's probably been three four years since i've had a fever
[1:58:41.200 --> 1:58:44.880]  it's just crazy so i chalk it up to genetics and the great products

[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:49.360]  we'll just walk down there if that's what we're gonna do but
[2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:56.160]  but trump he is creeping down there maybe he's right maybe he's wrong
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:01.600]  but we southern trump

[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:11.920]  not to the establishment
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:20.080]  all right in closing we have the thought criminal robert pollackon who lost her job in
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:24.560]  milwaukee for supporting the president on facebook just saying make america great again 2020
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:29.440]  in the three and a half four minutes we have other points you want to relate to the public
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:32.960]  we appreciate you speaking out because countless others you hit on the head with a hammer and
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:38.800]  they just go away forever and learn how to submit but you didn't well i mean
[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:44.480]  i didn't know what to say i was kind of speechless i was like well on to the next and i said that
[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:49.120]  to my friends and then another thing that they pointed out they're like we need to like this
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:55.280]  person that wrongfully like blasted you and made you lose your job they they were like you need
[2:01:55.280 --> 2:02:02.000]  to put him on blast too but he's like gone it completely m i a his name is william this third
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:09.760]  blossom is his name is william uh something but batachi or something like that he lives in two
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:15.520]  rivers which is like north of two hours north of milwaukee so he doesn't even live in the water
[2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:19.920]  maybe that's a name we don't know who it is but just someone's creeping around making sure women
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:25.200]  lose their jobs for supporting the president oh he's a wonderful person he's a real person he's
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:30.640]  got a record a long record and stuff but i looked him up and i had a bully he bullies women i'm
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:37.840]  surprised i was a real man it's a real yeah he's got to come to like kawanda and stuff and i and he's
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:44.240]  he's i feel like he's a manipulator and stuff in a way you know and just does whatever he feels
[2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:50.320]  like and just hey i'm gonna go ruin this girl's life i privately did message him after the fact
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:54.960]  that i got fired i saw his name and i went online and i messaged him and i said to him i said i want
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:03:03.920]  you to know for your actions and what you did in your review it got me fired well his response
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:11.760]  back to me was make america great again wow and then he blocked me so well he sounds like a real
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:17.280]  tough guy uh yeah i think he just hides behind his computer and just doesn't really want to be
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:23.280]  an advocate for does he not get metaphysically because if i got a woman fired for a job for no
[2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:30.240]  reason i'd like i fear god feel bad i'd be scared not of her of god like like screwing women over
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:35.120]  for no reason is like really bad luck these guys don't get why there's such losers man
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:43.120]  yeah i don't i mean my friends are you know they the one thing that they that is being said is a
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:49.200]  lot about the dental office and stuff precision dental all and blasting all them when at the same
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:54.960]  time they should be blasting this guy too because if he never made that post a review i'd still be at
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:04:01.120]  work and i'd be at work right now so no you're saying you're saying why go out of precision
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:07.680]  dental when we should go after and expose this this unamerican this anti-humanist anti-free
[2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:13.920]  expression this this want to be slave master right well i think that we should go out there both
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:19.600]  it's a big deal you know i was wrongfully fired because of his review you know and it's
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:27.920]  it's my right as a american to be able to freely speak the way i want and they don't want you to
[2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:33.840]  exercise that and they they punch you in the nose go ahead but they're a lot but they're allowed to
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:41.520]  do it themselves and then when a you know a trump supporter that is all a hundred percent about
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:45.280]  hold on we're back in 60 seconds i want you to finish that thought let me have another guest

[2:05:53.840 --> 2:06:04.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[2:06:04.640 --> 2:06:25.440]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:33.520]  now baby i can talk to steven wilford is one of the heroes won't call himself that of what
[2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:41.600]  happened a few years ago in texas at a church shooting a mass shooting that did happen and
[2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:47.280]  we're going to be breaking that down with him and going over it and getting his context on
[2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:55.760]  what happened at this latest church shooting where another patriot took out this individual
[2:06:55.760 --> 2:07:01.200]  in less than six seconds and just got the big award from the from the governor which which
[2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:05.680]  i totally agree he needs to get we to honor people that do this and volunteer to do this
[2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:10.800]  because criminals and crazy people are targeting schools and churches and it's it's it's absolutely
[2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:15.280]  terrible so we'll talk to him here in just a moment i was finishing up with a dental assistant
[2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:24.640]  fired in milwaukee wisconsin uh for expressing support for trump on facebook and so uh you
[2:07:24.640 --> 2:07:30.080]  were making a point in closing when we ran to the break so uh please uh continue and finish
[2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:35.520]  up what you were going to talk about that miss paulik well my point is this is that at the
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:40.480]  end of the day we all should be able to still be americans and be able to have our freedom of
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:45.760]  speech no matter where we are i understand that you know in a business you need to be professional
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:51.280]  and you know especially in like the medical field and stuff and you can't rant rave but you know
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:56.800]  when i'm outside in my own world and i'm not you know associating myself with my you know
[2:07:56.800 --> 2:08:01.600]  professional life or anything like that i think that i should be able to be able to have that voice
[2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:08.160]  to be able to speak to advocate for people and to have my beliefs and to be able to support the
[2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:13.280]  president so it's just really disturbing that this is how our country has became and i you know
[2:08:13.280 --> 2:08:19.600]  my mother she's elderly and stuff and she grew up in the you know the late 50s and 40s and um
[2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:25.440]  she you know that that was her time and she's like times have changed completely she goes because
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:31.520]  they've all thrown god out the window and she goes if we brought god back into the window our

[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:10.880]  up front here the state police have put out a report we put these reports out years ago
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:15.840]  showing that in cells people that are into post-humanist movements environmental movements
[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:27.520]  and into satanism and into involuntary celibacy are almost every mass shooter and mass shootings
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:36.320]  happen and they're real and sandy hook happened and parkland happened in 2018 and all that and
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:40.800]  parkland i said that happened i didn't just cover the media like sandy hook seven years ago and people
[2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:46.800]  questioned it and then they edited tapes to me i i said that happened i said the police stood down
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:51.600]  which later was confirmed we had students on the day after you saw them on skype and and seeing
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:55.920]  it went oh those are fake students those aren't real they did what they said i do so when we try to
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:01.040]  get guests on sometimes uh you know i've had some of the uh parkland parents on who write books and
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:05.360]  stuff are great people and they're like i'm told not to come on here but i'm i'm i'm gonna do it
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:10.560]  because i've seen you're showing you're a good guy i've talked about sandy hook one tenth of one hundredth
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:15.680]  of a percent but the media run stories every day jones is attacking sandy hook families jones is
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:20.160]  saying it didn't happen and then they democrat hillary put an ad with edited tape of me quoting
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:24.400]  what folks said me saying yeah they stage babies and incubators didn't die and they stay you know
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:29.760]  jesse small it stages stuff i mean that they just staged abc news just stage that the thing saying
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:35.200]  that trump blew up or let them blow up a Curtis city it was knob creek shootout it's okay to question
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:41.040]  but every time we have mass shootings now they change the subject from the heroes that stop it
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:46.400]  and and and cut back on the number of dead to saying that they're crisis actors and it didn't
[2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:51.040]  happen and all this and then they say i'm saying it currently i never even said it the way they
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:56.560]  said i said it but they steal your identity and they say you're this person so we'll get this
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:12:01.680]  guest on and he said listen i don't know the yard of my wife doesn't she said the sandy hook thing
[2:12:01.680 --> 2:12:06.800]  so i just any chance i can when explained that's not my identity i never sent people after their
[2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:12.080]  families it's a lie and it's the media saying that in my name over and over again but that's not
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:16.560]  why we got him on he's willing to say whatever he wants i know that one of the same crazies that
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:20.480]  came to our office if i'm going to say names and threatened us in his obviously a schizophrenic
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:25.920]  came and attacked them and said that they were making stuff up people didn't die no real shooters
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:31.040]  are going out shooting people it's real and there's crazy people and there's a state police report
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:40.640]  there's an fbi file on it and all this stuff is is 99.9 of it is 100 real okay and and i want to
[2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:45.680]  say that because if i think something's fake i'll tell you if i think it's fake but i've learned
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:49.520]  not place devil's advocate goal these folks are saying this because of this this and that they'll
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:54.400]  take that clip out they'll put that on the news and they'll say that so i'm done talking about it
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:58.080]  everybody says god you're on the news every day about this what would stop people walk in the
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:02.160]  store they'll stop talking about those tids and how it didn't happen that and i've had people
[2:13:02.160 --> 2:13:06.480]  actually kind of slugged me in the arm and i'm like whoa that notice i got a beard now that was
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:11.680]  years ago out of context or like i'm like listen that's a media lie i want to talk about what
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:16.800]  happened up by dallas and fort worth i want to play that clip when we come back and i want to
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:22.000]  talk about how good people with guns is the answer just jihadists run over folks with cars we don't
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:27.280]  blame the cars the media does they say you know a truck attack people know a jihadi did it but we
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:32.640]  know not to blame the trucks we blame the person well we don't blame the guns and so the media's
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:40.800]  really changed the subject i've noticed um like they came out and said that i said nobody died in
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:47.520]  uh there was a few articles saying that about uh at the walmart last year and in ohio i was reading
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:52.640]  their facebook's and twitter's where they said they were incels that love satan and loved bernie
[2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:57.520]  sanders let's see that's how they change the subject so they want me off the air so i can't
[2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:02.640]  point out who's really doing this and then and so i i didn't used to understand all this i mean
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:06.480]  we all grow we all learn and used to i didn't realize how big my show was we're gonna break
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:10.160]  them back with our guests but i'm just getting this off my chest because he was asking about the
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:14.240]  other day i just everything's out on the air now just there's nothing nothing secret here
[2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:18.720]  none of it and i used to follow what the internet thought you know because the internet's like we
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:23.040]  don't believe this happened we blah blah blah here's this anomaly and then years later i found out
[2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:28.480]  well i think that did happen those those anomalies were were false the minute though i went and said
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:31.920]  hey stop saying i'm the sandy hook guy i've really talked about i think it happened they went oh you
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:38.240]  lied about it you you you said nobody died you lied about that you knew that to make it my
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.720]  identity when i hardly ever talked about it so i want my identity back and i want listeners
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:47.520]  understand it's not about me it's about how they change the subject so my guest wants to talk about
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:51.520]  when you're gonna break in one minute we'll come back to him but let's not talk about that that's
[2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:58.560]  a lie that's not real let's talk about the fact that it's men and women but mainly men all across
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:05.040]  this country that every week are stopping shooters who are psychotic demons who go into churches
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:12.240]  that's satanic see and go into stores to kill people for no reason but they want attention
[2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:17.520]  so let's get his spiritual view on that as well why they're attacking churches but i know when he
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:24.800]  comes on he'll get news articles uh man that stop killer goes on sandy hook denier it's a weapon and
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:30.320]  when he experiences it he'll then figure it out he's a plumber but people say oh the plumber that's
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:33.840]  plumbers the smartest people around they know how stuff actually works they get jobs done he'll then
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:38.800]  understand what i've been through not as a victim i'm not a victim but he'll understand what i've
[2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:42.560]  learned so others don't go through it because let me tell you gotta be run over by this media
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:47.920]  before you figure it out so a real hero who stopped the mass killer before he killed more people

[2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:05.520]  or it's happened to someone you know everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:12.080]  end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it and they get the worst
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:20.720]  case of the flu of their life but still by concentration camp victims they line up at the
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.920]  different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections it doesn't matter that studies
[2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:31.120]  mainline government studies in canada in europe show that when you take the flu vaccine it doubles
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:36.800]  your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity it goes on and on
[2:19:36.800 --> 2:19:42.640]  or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:50.160]  has never ever even worked but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the giant hoax going no wonder

[2:19:59.600 --> 2:20:16.080]  jones show
[2:20:19.600 --> 2:20:23.680]  double weeks ago up in the dallas foreworth area a
[2:20:23.680 --> 2:20:30.880]  crazy mentally ill homeless person who'd been helped for years by individuals came in and began
[2:20:30.880 --> 2:20:36.800]  shooting them but within six seconds a patriot who just won an award from the governor and he
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:41.280]  doesn't want the award but we need to award that and honor that and point that out none heroes never
[2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:52.880]  won awards but they need him he he fired back because jack wilson's his name well we saw some
[2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:56.720]  body who started shooting at the individual and drove out of the church and another man ended

[2:21:24.640 --> 2:21:31.200]  those names but we don't know the names of people that just quietly stand up against these murders
[2:21:31.200 --> 2:21:35.200]  and stop a lot more people getting killed so i wanted to get him on just about the world and
[2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:40.400]  what he sees happening and where he sees all this going steven wilford uh we really appreciate you
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:44.880]  as a fellow texan coming on the show and and i know people you know told you the propaganda
[2:21:44.880 --> 2:21:48.320]  about us and i that's why i set that up earlier with the truth what happened so you would know
[2:21:48.320 --> 2:21:51.680]  what others would know but shepard from that not distracting from what's happening and and
[2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:54.960]  what you've done and what others have done what would you like to get into first we appreciate
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:22:02.240]  you coming on well i guess what i have to do first is business uh second amendment foundation
[2:22:02.240 --> 2:22:12.400]  is sponsoring me today and uh that would be uh saf dot org and uh i would like to also promote
[2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:23.680]  my website steven wilford steven wilford dot com s t e p h e n w i l l e f o r d dot com
[2:22:25.680 --> 2:22:29.440]  where do you want to start with what happened with you a few years ago or this newest event
[2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:33.840]  or some leftist saying why are people armed in texas that was the big you know c n m was
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:38.160]  like why are people armed in the church without even saying will you stop the crazy person
[2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:46.560]  crazy person yeah i'll tell you the only thing that will stop a shooter is when a second gun
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:54.400]  arrives at the scene and it doesn't matter whether it's another gun in the hands of a police officer
[2:22:54.400 --> 2:23:01.360]  or another just individual like myself that's what stops a shooter is just another gun coming
[2:23:01.360 --> 2:23:10.480]  on to the scene i i i appreciate jack wilson and his team i would also like to recognize
[2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:18.240]  the two men that lost their lives that day also uh they're just as much heroes as jack wilson is
[2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:28.720]  because they confronted the shooter and um they occupied him talk about that because people
[2:23:28.720 --> 2:23:31.600]  just see the headlines i remember reading that that's important tell folks what happened
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:39.440]  well uh the the two guys first that they were watching the shooter because they have a safety
[2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:49.760]  response team at their church and they already had identified him as a uh we call him jdl r's
[2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:59.360]  just don't look right and uh the guy had on a um had on a wig and a fake beard and a trench coat
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:07.360]  and they were watching him and when he became aggressive the two guys that got shot first
[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:15.200]  they were engaging him and uh they he was able to get a shotgun out and shoot and kill them both
[2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:22.640]  but they engaged him enough that he didn't shoot any other innocents and then jack wilson was able
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:28.480]  to step up and make an amazing shot across the room so those men that died were like the marines
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:36.080]  that jump on the hang grenades they yeah they were they were they were honorable men that understood
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:42.960]  they're going to protect their church their church community their friends their neighbors
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:51.680]  uh and they stepped up and and they took bullets for them and uh that's honorable thing because
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:57.360]  that's an office they agreed to do that's i guess the honorable means you honor what you're gonna do
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:04.400]  yeah they they they stepped up they put their lives on the line and that ultimately they lost
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:11.680]  their lives but i i will say those men woke up in the arms of jesus and that's not a bad day
[2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:16.880]  well i tell you it brings tears my eyes because i think about how selfish hollywood is have you
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:21.280]  seen the videos that they're pushing all over hollywood of having women talk about how much they
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:24.720]  enjoyed killing their children and then they go i know they're babies and i like killing them and
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:29.360]  i'm powerful it's the opposite you don't want to talk about yourself it's the opposite of the you
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:35.680]  know of those of those men that died these people they're selfishness they wear it like it's a crown
[2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:43.040]  when really it's a big like jesus said it's a big giant boulder tied around their neck this is the
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:51.840]  problem with our with our country nowadays when we stopped valuing lives and even the most innocent
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:59.360]  lives in this country uh unborn babies they're innocent they're beautiful they're they're god's
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:06.240]  gift to this country their total potential they are they are the blessings that god gives us and
[2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:13.040]  and we have to stop aborting those children and they they wonder you know because when we were
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:20.480]  in high school uh we came to school with guns in the racks in the back of our trucks what's the
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:27.280]  difference between them and now because we didn't have satanism we were good people the difference
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:37.440]  is now as we have no value in life when we can take the most innocent and abort them we are not
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:45.200]  valuing life at any either end of the spectrum because now we have uh in some states assisted
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:50.880]  suicide for the elderly there you go that's a perfect example those two men right there are
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:56.000]  heroes just as much as jack is and they're not black they're not like they're patriots they're
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:03.680]  americans they're christians they are they are and and i i feel for their families but and i pray
[2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:09.360]  for their families but what a legacy what a legacy they've left that their families know what's
[2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:16.480]  important in life and again they woke up in the arms of jesus too and one of these things
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:20.320]  driving these satanists like the state police report says they're satanist i mean that's what
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:25.040]  they are what that what is going on but suddenly satanist is popping out attacking churches i
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:34.480]  mean this is crazy well you know god the bible talks about this being a fallen world and and it is
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:42.560]  it's a fallen world and and you can't stop evil from starting but i can tell you men like jack
[2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:49.760]  can stop it for the duration of it that's right you can't stop its birth but you sure as hell kill
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:59.200]  it you can you can stop it from continuing and and i encourage anybody to go out and get trained
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:05.840]  to carry a gun and and that's why they hate the second amendment is just like chicago or dc they
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:12.720]  want to have their reign of terror upon us don't they yeah they don't like me because i i grabbed
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:20.320]  the very gun that they say is evil i grabbed an ar-15 and ran across the street um they they
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:28.400]  think the gun is evil and it's not the gun i defend it my community with my my firearm and well
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:32.000]  you don't like to talk about yourself but let's go back to that day two years ago it's almost
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:36.960]  three years ago when we come back with steven wilford and and and steven we're gonna go to

[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:46.480]  appreciate you it's just amazing it's just amazing how they turned heroes into bad guys
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:50.960]  i don't know if you saw the news folks they said the folks that shot the bad guy were bad to have
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:56.960]  guns in in up by dallas in white settlement we can all agree these are troubled times right

[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:14.640]  us worldwide and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic
[2:30:14.640 --> 2:30:20.640]  liberty is amazing as well you're still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against
[2:30:20.640 --> 2:30:24.960]  that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against
[2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:31.200]  communist china trump's for doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:37.760]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:42.400]  against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:48.240]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[2:30:48.240 --> 2:30:53.440]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy

[2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:35.840]  i'm going to go back to our guests here and i'm almost still guilty that i'm not harping more on
[2:33:36.640 --> 2:33:42.480]  what the left of the globalist trying to cook up in virginia i i hope and pray everything they do
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:48.160]  fizzles out with the civil war they're trying to start doesn't go the way they want to go
[2:33:48.160 --> 2:33:59.040]  go and i just burn with desire to try to figure out how to stop them i know you burn with desire
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:05.040]  you're either on fire or not there's no in between and we're awake we're on fire
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:10.160]  and you look at those that aren't on fire and you wish they could join you but they just don't
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:15.600]  know what it's like but a man that's on fire is steven wilford uh he had no interviews i've seen
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:19.600]  a few times in the news he's the guy that first stopped the shooter and ran him out and he got
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:22.560]  killed by another patriot that we talked about earlier
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:31.360]  johnny lagendorf here in texas and back when they did it and back when this just happened a few weeks
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:42.800]  ago up in the white settlement the media focused on two things why are people armed in texas and
[2:34:42.800 --> 2:34:48.000]  white settlement well white just means the guys that found the town's named white in england they
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  just changed the name of a town from uh white cliffs there's white cliffs on the beach to
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:55.760]  see if ships come in like oh the town's white cliff you know when you see you see white cliffs
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:35:02.640]  kind of like you know oak grove or names come from big fish first time somebody got there and
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:07.200]  named it they caught a big-ass fish they're big fish or white fish uh but that's how they tried
[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:10.720]  to change the subject because they want you to hear about the mass shooters and you can type this in
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:16.400]  media promoting mass shootings causes mass shootings they've got hundreds of university
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:23.040]  studies that hyping it and glorifying the shooters who are always these incel devil
[2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:28.160]  worshipers state police report and i'm just so proud of the state police getting that report
[2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:33.120]  out because our own paul watson spearheaded the last five years exposing incels and it's very
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:37.920]  exciting going back to steven wilford steven i could ask you a million questions but you've
[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:42.400]  got the floor if you just take over what do you want to say about america and about the world and
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:47.360]  about people blaming folks that take out the shooters saying well you're the problem i mean
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:51.760]  i'm sure you've seen that well how they think that upside down logic's going to work when
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:56.320]  these very same democrat politicians have all got bodyguards and live in armored fortresses
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:06.400]  i want to mention again that i'm sponsored today by uh second amendment foundation and you can go to
[2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:13.040]  saf.org and i love those folks i'm glad because we've got to support the second amendment you're
[2:36:13.040 --> 2:36:20.000]  right how do we do that that's a good place to start just go to saf.org and and find out who
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:28.320]  they are and support them uh they're a large organization to get committed to to back in
[2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:33.840]  the second amendment and our freedoms and and i want to talk a little you you mentioned it
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:41.440]  that uh what's happening in virginia i'm speaking on monday uh in virginia and they're hoping to
[2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:48.320]  have a hundred thousand people there in virginia and uh you know it'd be quite a crowd to be able
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:54.960]  to speak and be honored to to speak to virginians and and uh virginia is where it all started
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:37:01.040]  that's it's virginia uh the founding fathers talk about that we always talk about boston which is
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:09.200]  amazing as well but let's talk about how it started in virginia but uh george washington
[2:37:09.200 --> 2:37:16.240]  and and thomas jefferson they were both born and raised in virginia and uh they crashed that's right
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:26.080]  virginia ignited the revolution that virginia ignited the revolution um the uh declaration of
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:33.840]  independence was formed in virginia the constitution was written in virginia virginia was one of the
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:41.680]  most important states there was and and uh blood was spilled of many patriots in their streets and
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:50.640]  in their farms and stuff fighting for the freedoms that we enjoy today and uh we we cannot let that
[2:37:50.640 --> 2:37:59.200]  go we cannot let our freedoms go away there's been too many patriots throughout history i
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:03.040]  totally agree and we're told america's not exceptional blah blah blah why does everybody
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:08.080]  want to come here no we were founded by exceptional people the only folks to ever beat the british
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:14.240]  empire period not napoleon hitler nobody could beat it we beat it we're it and like it's not like
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:19.600]  we're bragging we're just saying hey we're not playing games and we need to rediscover that greatness
[2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:23.760]  why do they run it down because they fear it tyrants fear the red white and blue
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:32.720]  of lexington and concord the british were coming and they had several hundred troops and they were
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:42.000]  coming to get a cash of weapons and they were met by patriots around two thousand or better
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:46.720]  they're just organized in the last minute they call them minute men and they grabbed their guns and
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:53.200]  they met them and said you're not coming to take our guns and yet the same thing is happening in
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:59.840]  virginia right now where the governor is saying we're going to outlaw your guns we're going to
[2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:05.360]  outlaw your guns and we're going to come to your door and we're going to get them and there's going
[2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:12.960]  to be a hundred thousand patriots that are at the the lawn of the capital and right away the governor
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:19.680]  went around declared a state of emergency so that he could turn around and say oh
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:25.040]  now we won't let you bring your guns when you come to the capital and he is called for the
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:34.160]  state police he's called for the capital police and he's called for the richman police to stand
[2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:44.960]  together in riot gear to stop citizens good guys with guns he's not worried about the evil people
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:52.960]  with guns he wants to stop citizens good people good law-biting citizens with guns from coming
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:59.120]  on to the capital and if you turn around and you strip the citizens of their guns and then somebody
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:05.360]  radical from the outside comes and starts shooting that's what this second amendment is all about
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:15.120]  your ability to protect yourselves that's right good having the capacity to defend itself and
[2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:22.560]  i want to tell people right now that the the good law-biting citizens carrying guns we are not the
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:29.520]  aggressors here we are not going to come and and try to shoot at the politicians but i'm gonna oh
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:34.160]  yeah they're already they're already phrasing it is that they may stage a false flag which is why
[2:40:34.160 --> 2:40:38.080]  i'm not saying sandy hook was staged we have to look at every event could be provocateur and i
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:42.800]  believe sandy hook happened but they you know the left could provocateur they could have a left
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:46.880]  that's go out there and in cell and start shooting people and say he's with us how do we deal with
[2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:55.600]  that i'm i'm gonna tell you that we aren't the aggressors here but if they come to our doors
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:41:03.520]  to take our guns you don't come into my home unless you are the aggressor and you're not
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:09.520]  going to come to my house and and just expect to remove my guns without a fight no i understand

[2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:16.480]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:22.480]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:28.400]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting

[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:39.440]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:44.880]  by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:11.760]  the articles admitting all of that as well but going back to steven wilford one of the folks
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:18.480]  that stopped the shooter a few years ago uh in southern on springs texas uh and the surrounding
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:24.400]  areas uh he's here with us right now and he's making a lot of good points about the world and
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:29.920]  where we are and what's happening and what's coming next getting back to virginia you're right the
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:34.080]  governor's saying i'm coming for your guns i'm gonna confiscate them as americans we have a right
[2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:39.040]  to say no to that but why do you think they're doing that now it's because we're politically
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:45.760]  winning they want trigger a national emergency while the president is in trial in the senate
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:51.040]  to try to create such a hysteria he's removed from office not for the false charges but because
[2:49:51.040 --> 2:49:57.520]  of the 25th amendment the hysteria what do you think about that i don't know i don't i don't
[2:49:57.520 --> 2:50:05.040]  like to get into conspiracy theories and stop them why things happen i i just i want to know i want
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:13.200]  people to know that they need to stand up and stand against tyranny all together and we don't need
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:21.760]  to be the aggressors here we don't need to be the ones to start this but um no i agree with you
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:26.160]  but it's just not a conspiracy theory and our people should go out there they should be there
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:31.600]  i agree we shouldn't let that intimidate us a thousand million percent to infinity agree with
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:38.480]  you i'm saying the left is famous for staging stuff i go out to events with democrats they'll
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:42.080]  have guys in wheelchair it's gonna punch me in the back or pinch me or whatever trying to get me
[2:50:42.080 --> 2:50:46.000]  to head of because they're in a wheelchair auntie foe puts women out front when they're blocking
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:50.320]  entrance to an event so they can say you attacked a woman when you try to go through a line i'm just
[2:50:50.320 --> 2:50:55.360]  saying i'm going to virginia i'll see you there i'll shake your hand i'm saying why do you think
[2:50:55.360 --> 2:51:02.240]  the governor and the democrats are so bolden or emboldened so brazen i'll say brazen i said bolden
[2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:07.360]  so emboldened to say they're coming for our guns what's the after all these years of sneaking around
[2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:11.520]  secretly wanting to do it their own documents admitting it now why are they out in the open
[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:19.120]  what's your spidey sense tell you they got elected they got elected and i was talking to somebody
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:26.400]  and they said that uh 30 percent of virginians weren't born in virginia anymore instead they're
[2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:35.280]  migrating down from uh dc and maryland and other states you know they they cause a problem you know
[2:51:35.280 --> 2:51:43.920]  they vote and they swing liberal in their state and then when it's hard to do business and stuff
[2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:49.600]  then they move to another state they're coming to texas right after they've crapped their nest they go
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:56.880]  to the next nest and start pulling their paths down yeah don't come to my bed and mess in my bed
[2:51:56.880 --> 2:52:02.400]  and do what you did in yours your bed's uncomfortable to sleep in anymore because what you did you want
[2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:09.440]  to bring your business to texas because we have lower tax rates and and you want to employ people
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:15.840]  in texas that's great but don't bring your attitudes that you have that destroyed your state
[2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:22.560]  and bring them into my state and expect the same thing by the way you're politely gentilly saying
[2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:28.480]  that on the air i'm in austin so you're lucky where you're at these i drive a big four truck
[2:52:28.480 --> 2:52:33.280]  they walk over and literally say why do you have four children why do you drive a truck they get in
[2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:41.200]  my face and i mean these people are crazy i mean they're crazy so tell them it's none of their
[2:52:41.200 --> 2:52:45.760]  business why that's what i tell them yeah but i mean you wait until you're in the libtards where
[2:52:45.760 --> 2:52:51.920]  you're at man it's serious i mean they are bossy they they think they own your brain brother it's
[2:52:51.920 --> 2:52:55.920]  like you know the university's ban free speech and stuff right well that's what it's like in austin
[2:52:55.920 --> 2:53:01.280]  now and i'm not you know i'm not the old statement's not bragging but i mean my family on both sides
[2:53:01.280 --> 2:53:06.720]  fat was involved the founding of say texas people ask why am i in austin well because my family was
[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:14.880]  here when it was waterloo but i mean it's california now bro it's bad oh austin's just far east l a
[2:53:16.560 --> 2:53:24.880]  that's a good way to put it austin is east l a so what do we do about that um we have to start
[2:53:24.880 --> 2:53:31.120]  taking our state back we have to start voting these guys out we have to start taking our state
[2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:37.040]  back we've got a san antonio city council and stuff that thinks that they can change the alamo
[2:53:37.920 --> 2:53:43.360]  and and they want to get rid of it and say it sucks and santa anna dick teddy was a great guy
[2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:47.840]  and turned into a racist monument when a third of the folks there were were mexican exactly
[2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:53.360]  they want to take down the senate top they want to they want to change a hundred and some people
[2:53:53.360 --> 2:53:56.800]  taking on three thousand people and fighting to the death and killing over a thousand is pretty
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:54:04.960]  pretty tough i mean nobody can piss on that i mean nobody well and and and i what i think is the
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:10.400]  the point is here is i don't think that a city council should be able to go in and change
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:16.160]  the alamo the alamo should belong to texas and the question is why do they want to go
[2:54:16.800 --> 2:54:22.160]  it's not even mexicans or hispanics that want it it's leftists that hate that symbol and want to
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:32.320]  wipe their ass with it the problem is is is uh they try to make it looking like the texas-mexican
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:40.640]  war was a hispanic versus white war and it wasn't what about once again once again the constitution
[2:54:40.640 --> 2:54:44.480]  no it was about being able to own land and not being a peon and again that's what they call it
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:53.280]  mexico you're a serf you're a peon peon it just means like once again was a hispanic uh general
[2:54:53.840 --> 2:55:00.800]  that fought for the texican side if you know what what the alamo was about what what the
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:09.760]  revolution was about is the mexicans wanted to settle texas and so they gave you a plot of land
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:15.440]  and said make it into a farm and clear it out and and we'll give it to you and and you can
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:21.200]  settle texas and then at the some point he said they said uh you know what we're going to take
[2:55:21.200 --> 2:55:28.080]  your land back you know after you put blood sweat and tears in it and maybe your father died helping
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:34.000]  to build that that farm and stuff and and you've made your life there and then they said we want
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:39.840]  the land back no that's true but the texican said you're not getting it back i agree but andrew
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:46.320]  jackson did see it was coming 15 years before and it was uh it was i mean because the there was a
[2:55:46.320 --> 2:55:52.000]  few missions then and then that wasn't being held it was just let's just say it people are brought
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:57.760]  in from tennessee and alabama to wipe out because because the commandees were killing all the mexicans
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:01.840]  and they said well these guys will kill the commandees so that's what happened and that's it we
[2:56:01.840 --> 2:56:05.920]  killed everybody we got the land so that's how it works and all the commandees were these little
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:10.400]  sweethearts they were feared by all the all the other tribes they wiped everybody out they killed
[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:16.720]  men women children you name it we came in we wiped them out that's how texas got born did you know
[2:56:16.720 --> 2:56:25.680]  that there were 12 virginia or sorry 14 virginians that died in the alamo i did that yeah that they
[2:56:25.680 --> 2:56:33.360]  sacrificed their life for the fight for freedom for texas it's actually beautiful there's a big
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:40.800]  japanese memorial there too because japanese had a deal where like 30 samurais held off like 500 dudes
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:45.600]  and all died but held them off the next time it's the same story it's 300 it's Gallipoli i mean it's
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:52.720]  this is the stuff and uh that that's why and texas is that perfect melting pot it's why it's the six
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:57.920]  flags over it and then everybody tries to put that down because people are scared of that let's do

[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:22.720]  you could feel the energy is you know i've not really talked about virginia a lot today because
[3:00:23.760 --> 3:00:31.120]  i'm about to be there and the democrats are planning something really nasty you could feel it
[3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:36.800]  but when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord lifts up standard against it
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:45.440]  and that standard when a satanic killer came to kill people was steven wilford and of course
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:51.520]  johnny lagendorf we really appreciate him joining us let's talk about what happened
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:56.320]  that attempted massacre and sulfur springs would have been 50 60 people are morally
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:00.960]  estimated but not just the five they would have stopped them what do you want to see in closing and
[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:08.560]  i really appreciate you joining us today brother i guess i want to say stay vigilant get out there
[3:01:08.560 --> 3:01:17.760]  get trained be ready you never know when you might be needed you know the left things are going to
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:24.560]  have gun confiscation but almost every police officer i talked to is awake and almost everybody
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:29.040]  i talked to in the military is totally awake that's why the deep state can keep trying their
[3:01:29.040 --> 3:01:37.440]  tricks all day but they just don't have any juice anymore again i want to i want to wrap this up
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:48.080]  i guess by uh mentioning uh second amendment foundation and sa f dot org and uh and steven
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:55.680]  wilford dot com if i speak to churches and help them set up oh that's invaluable talk about that
[3:01:56.560 --> 3:02:05.200]  talk about how it's dirty to have guys with guns no christ said sell your cloaks and buy a sword
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:13.040]  that's the answer good people with guns tell us about that i i go and i help churches and religious
[3:02:13.040 --> 3:02:22.320]  organizations set up uh safety response teams and i speak with them i fly all over the country to do
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:33.760]  it to come you can book me to speak um and i just i guess this is my calling now i and make people
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:40.480]  aware that if southern springs with a population of 600 people if it could happen there it could
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:49.200]  happen anywhere uh and and if you think you're going to just shoot at flat targets uh you're
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:55.360]  not going to confront a uh active shooter you need to be a little bit more trained than that
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:03:02.400]  you need to have a team together that will work together that uh sees these threats just like
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:10.720]  jack wilson did and uh he was able to stop threats so quick quickly him and his team and i can't
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:17.680]  say enough good about them and what that's because spiritually having men and women armed and ready
[3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:22.800]  is literally a deterrent to the civil they target things they think are disarmed like the state
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:30.560]  police report they target unarmed crowds the answer is arm the crowd just just remember that
[3:03:30.560 --> 3:03:38.720]  that jesus said that he will leave the 99 and go out and look for the one sheep to bring him back
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:48.000]  the sheep or jesus christ he loves the sheep and when he leaves the 99 to go look for the one
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:54.560]  it's the sheep dog i agree you probably weren't listening to the show but i started the broadcast
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:04:01.360]  with that is that the product the same story the prodigal son what no i'm talking about when
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:06.560]  jesus said no no no no i know but i'm i'm saying the the the lost sheep parable i'm saying the
[3:04:06.560 --> 3:04:14.560]  prodigal son it's the same things what i'm saying but when he leaves the 99 to go look for the one
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:22.240]  just remember be the sheepdog that takes care of the 99 while he's gone
[3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:30.480]  because when he comes back he loves his sheep and he wants them to be all all together when he comes
[3:04:30.480 --> 3:04:34.960]  back i totally agree all right steven wilford look forward to shaking your hand in virginia

[3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:33.360]  but let's hear a little bit of deba stain
[3:07:33.360 --> 3:07:49.920]  you must choose your fate yes yes you've been dying since the day you were born you know it's all
[3:07:49.920 --> 3:08:02.160]  been planned a center once a center twice you need no confessions now because now you've got some
[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:11.920]  company lock up your wife and children now it's time to wield the blade all the jokes all the games
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:20.160]  are almost over now reality begins to set in a great animating contest and america who they
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:31.680]  believe was asleep is awake is awake is now drawing his blade not to attack but to defend you can feel
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:42.160]  the spirit as never before rising it's unstoppable but if the public can be deceived by stage false
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:47.440]  flag attacks and they can stage a mass shooting and have us buy into it and have us cower and not
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:54.800]  challenge the event when it happens they could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat let's hear
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:10.880]  within every way like palosary that's the last evil decays not god it's regenerative
[3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:22.160]  and now there's nothing you can't do we've been planning a long time for this a man's
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:28.240]  got to have a code agreed to live by i wonder who said that
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:38.080]  you gotta have something you gotta serve something like bob delin said and i don't serve satan
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:44.640]  in fact satan is a joke a lot of people are scared to take on satan
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:51.920]  i want to hide behind god through this god to fight satan through us we're the fingers
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:56.640]  we're the hand we're the will and we're meant to get chewed up in that fight and when you take
[3:09:56.640 --> 3:10:10.480]  that on and stop caring anymore that's when truly
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:20.240]  all right i'm gonna leave it at this format back and takes over i could sit here and i could worry
[3:10:20.240 --> 3:10:25.280]  all day about what's gonna happen in virginia and i could sit there and beat my brains out and i could
[3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:29.600]  sit there and get upset and yell at the crew the crew's like man you're as happy as pumpkin pie
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:38.400]  today what's going on because i woke up at about 3 10 a.m last night i worked till about 1 a.m
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:42.480]  so i'm gonna sleep about two hours and i just woke up and i never felt the spirit of god so
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:47.520]  strong and books isn't some fake bible thumping crap here or some fake preacher tries to tell you
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:52.800]  about what they saw down a row and they saw a real preacher this is the real deal okay this is
[3:10:52.800 --> 3:10:58.400]  this isn't something in some seminary or taught by some glitter bug this is the real deal so i
[3:10:58.400 --> 3:11:03.040]  can't stop spouting god and jesus christ because that's all i'm thinking right now i mean i got all
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:06.880]  these articles all these videos all this incredible stuff to cover not just keep getting closer to
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:12.080]  jesus every five seconds i mean it's just closer and closer and closer and let me tell you that
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:18.320]  doesn't happen unless we're about to face the crucible they're trying to impeach the president
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:25.200]  with this trial they're trying to remove him from office they're trying to create this illusion
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:30.400]  that america is discredited and we're broken during this critical fight so they've got their
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:37.360]  indictment now they want to have the conviction and they've got lined up virginia and dc and other
[3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:42.640]  events for false flags we're going to be there on the ground but they can strike other places
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:48.560]  and it's the awareness of how the media is all lined up and now joe biden
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:56.320]  says charlesville 2.0 is what he's running on tells you they're locked and loaded
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:12:01.680]  they're gonna have foreign assets they're gonna be using cutout groups you name it but
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:08.080]  they are badly coordinated and they are confused and they are scared you read those
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:13.760]  stock emails and text messages well he didn't do anything we're gonna get in trouble they are
[3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:19.280]  they've got the dumbest of their dumb and wants this attack and if we pray and if we're vigilant and
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:23.600]  we're informed and if we're involved if we're on the ground that we put the skin in the game
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:29.200]  get that road ration or it's all comes down to that put the skin of the game that's where the
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:34.560]  rubber meets the road we're gonna win this thing but you've got to pray today you've got to pray
[3:12:34.560 --> 3:12:38.000]  right now you gotta pray tonight you gotta pray tomorrow morning you gotta pray this weekend you
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:41.920]  gotta pray on monday you gotta pray on tuesday because the planets have aligned for the trial
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:46.240]  of our president in the senate and their false flags to say we're all white supremacists all this
[3:12:46.240 --> 3:12:51.040]  stupid ass crap when they do a full damn well christianity is the unifying force even if you
[3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:55.440]  look at it politically to not destroy the planet and kill each other come together under christ
[3:12:55.440 --> 3:12:59.440]  come together under love come together under justice come together for the children come together
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:06.320]  for that ethos and anyone opposing that is a piece of trash and like that poor woman i had on
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:13.440]  earlier two hours ago fired from her job as a dental assistant for saying make america great again
[3:13:14.400 --> 3:13:22.800]  2020 that's what we're facing is intimidators like that and so george arwell said freedom
[3:13:22.800 --> 3:13:28.560]  is the ability to say two plus two equals four that's right is to say men don't have babies
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:34.880]  and everybody tries to come to america because they had an idea to empower people
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:39.680]  not that we're the place that oppresses people and they use our strength against us and i'll just
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:46.560]  say this in closing because i didn't do it already for three hours our products are kick-ass i mean

[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:07.520]  formerly 95 percent we tested it outside firm listen on the what the fda does it on the label
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:12.880]  is as as as turmeric but it's a turmeric extra same thing vaso beads we go around we do our testing
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:18.800]  we study because man i cannot give you anything that i mean if i'm not going to sell out to the

[3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:32.400]  and say we want you to lie to somebody i'd say pull the freaking trigger because i am not for sale
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:40.320]  already sold out to jesus it's done so it's simple if we had twice as much money we could do a hundred

[3:19:02.080 --> 3:19:07.520]  have noticed that i really don't ever get sick now again i might get sick tomorrow because i
[3:19:07.520 --> 3:19:12.080]  just made that statement i'm not tempting fate i'll say that again because i am superstitious
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:16.640]  when it comes down to that i'm very thankful the good lord for the constitution i've been given
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:20.880]  but up until about eight nine years ago when i started taking
[3:19:20.880 --> 3:19:28.560]  x2 and the products in force life i i still got sick every couple years and you know i still get
[3:19:28.560 --> 3:19:35.200]  sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that but now that i religiously take the
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:38.960]  products to them for worse life one of the highest quality supplements you're gonna find out there
[3:19:39.680 --> 3:19:47.440]  i just never get a fever anymore it's probably been three four years since i've had a fever

[3:19:56.160 --> 3:19:58.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:22.720]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[3:20:22.720 --> 3:20:32.560]  okay i'm on for the rest of the hour and if you're wondering what i'm gonna be mainly talking
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:43.040]  about today let me give you a clue uh virginia that's where i went to school in charlottesville at
[3:20:43.040 --> 3:20:51.840]  uva and uh i wasn't there for the 2017 charlottesville festivities and i'm not planning on being
[3:20:51.840 --> 3:20:59.600]  enrichment this monday either i have a pre-existing major social obligation that's been scheduled
[3:20:59.600 --> 3:21:06.320]  for many months involving a lot of people and frankly you know i don't think that uh i don't
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:12.800]  think it would benefit anybody by my being enrichment i think i'll be better off watching
[3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:20.080]  from afar and staying out of the uh what some people are calling the kill box you know the kill
[3:21:20.080 --> 3:21:28.800]  zone the the l-shaped ambush the buffalo jump sort of like a purple bug zapper light for
[3:21:28.800 --> 3:21:36.240]  moths that just can't help it um frankly uh you know i i don't want to reign on anybody's
[3:21:36.240 --> 3:21:42.560]  parade at this point if you're going you're going right and over the rest of the hour i'd like to
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:49.680]  talk about some of the ideas that i have for making it as successful as it can be or as it
[3:21:49.680 --> 3:21:55.200]  as it might be or as that as we hope it will be because certainly there are a lot of things that
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:22:02.720]  can go seriously haywire there on many levels and i'm going to talk about some of these risks but
[3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:09.280]  i'm also going to talk about some ideas some uh backup plans some alternate plans sort of like
[3:22:09.280 --> 3:22:16.240]  a quarterback calling an audible you know in a football game the way that defenses are so good
[3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:22.160]  and adaptable today no no offense can go up to the line of scrimmage and just say this is the play
[3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:27.280]  we're running this play if you see that that they're reading you and they've got they're lined up to
[3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:34.000]  just nuke that play you don't go with that play the quarterback calls an audible and changes the
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:39.440]  play to adapt to the defense that he's seeing right then and that's the attitude to take to
[3:22:39.440 --> 3:22:46.320]  richmond if you're going to richmond for example um you know if you think i'm getting into capital
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:53.440]  square for sure well they've already they've already stated that the capital square that's like the
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:59.280]  about six block area right right immediately around the capital that's going to be a gun
[3:22:59.280 --> 3:23:06.160]  free zone a weapon free zone and that means they're going to go through like one gate a very long line
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:13.200]  and a magnetometer and you know like a football game table for your bag check that's only if you're
[3:23:13.200 --> 3:23:19.600]  trying to get into that small capital square now that capital square i it could hold a few
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:25.840]  thousand people if they let everybody walk all over the grass at the most but i've seen estimates
[3:23:25.840 --> 3:23:33.360]  of anything from 10 000 to 100 000 people showing up let's say it's 30 000 that leaves probably you
[3:23:33.360 --> 3:23:40.400]  know 25 000 people who don't really have a realistic chance of getting into the capital square for
[3:23:40.400 --> 3:23:46.560]  lobbying purposes because that's going to be like the mother of all cattle call lines to go through
[3:23:46.560 --> 3:23:53.920]  the the baggage and the uh metal detectors so don't necessarily plan that you're going to get into
[3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:59.840]  capital square that's and that's the only place right now that's gun free so if you're playing
[3:23:59.840 --> 3:24:06.240]  if you adapt your plan and you say you know i'll be satisfied just being on the outside periphery
[3:24:06.240 --> 3:24:12.800]  of the of the capital square with you know 30 000 or 50 000 other second amendment supporters
[3:24:13.760 --> 3:24:18.240]  in that case you don't necessarily have to be disarmed but you have to know in advance
[3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:23.360]  i'm not going to get through any magnet a metal detector i'm not get i'm not planning to get into
[3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:28.480]  the capital square there's that would be like trying to put wood stock you know inside of a
[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:33.920]  tennis court it's impossible it can't work the numbers wouldn't allow it to work now
[3:24:34.880 --> 3:24:41.760]  folks should should plan also that there will be major street blockages and then they may not be
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:48.080]  announced in advance partly because of just the confusion of the events the police reacting on
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:55.680]  the fly as as they see the numbers building or it could it could be more for nefarious reasons to try
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:25:04.400]  to you know steer second amendment people toward the the mayor bloomberg every town gun gun grabber
[3:25:04.400 --> 3:25:11.200]  groups or a clash which is what they did in charlottesville so you don't plan that you're
[3:25:11.200 --> 3:25:17.280]  absolutely going to have a certain route from your car to the event because you might get to a
[3:25:17.280 --> 3:25:22.800]  street and there's a line of police barricades and you got to go many blocks around so up on
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:29.040]  the screen right now i put up an example of a printed map and i would recommend everybody
[3:25:29.680 --> 3:25:35.200]  print your own maps at different scales and mark other routes on them if you'll notice that downtown
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:41.680]  richmond area it's primarily surrounded by highways that's an impassable barrier for a pedestrian
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:48.800]  if you're driving into richmond all of the highway exits are going to be primary i you know if they
[3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:54.000]  are up for this they're going to do the checkpoints right there and i don't mean necessarily pulling
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:26:00.480]  every car over but they are going to have them slowed down and under close close observation
[3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:06.080]  they have been putting up cameras all around downtown richmond like crazy over the past week
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:13.280]  so if your if your goal is to get to the capital square area and you don't want to be hassled
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:17.440]  think about a route that takes you through surface streets you know but you're you're
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:22.000]  going to need to print out your own maps don't plan that you're going to be running around looking at
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:29.360]  your four inch smartphone trying to navigate you know uh under these confusing and potentially uh
[3:26:30.160 --> 3:26:36.720]  dangerous situations if there are antifuzz or if somebody shows up to do something terrible there
[3:26:36.720 --> 3:26:43.760]  and causes a stampede so i would recommend everybody actually you know physically print out
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:50.320]  some of your own maps at different scales have extras for other people you know it's going to be
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:58.480]  pretty crazy especially if any of the worst outcomes happen is i i read a link to an article
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:04.640]  today in the hill it says that the fbi already arrested a couple of neo-nazis planning on going
[3:27:04.640 --> 3:27:10.880]  to richmond uh for you know dangerous violent reasons now i don't trust the fbi i don't know
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:18.560]  what the story is legit but certainly the fbi is very much on the ball the sack the special agent
[3:27:18.560 --> 3:27:26.560]  in charge of richmond is a domestic counterintelligence expert the the guy david archie he has been
[3:27:26.560 --> 3:27:31.840]  studying this he is on the lookout for any you know dangerous actors coming from out of state
[3:27:31.840 --> 3:27:37.920]  hence federal from out of state into richmond so so you're going to want to be very careful
[3:27:37.920 --> 3:27:45.440]  as well as you know the what they're talking all about the alt alt right dangerous neo-nazi white
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:51.440]  nationalist militias but this is also like blood in the water for other types of sharks
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:57.200]  if you think about somebody like james hodgekissen who is motivated to go from the midwest
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:05.120]  to attack the uh the republican uh baseball practice imagine people like him you know losers
[3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:09.680]  that are trying to give their life meaning and do something in service of the revolution
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:15.840]  what would be better than coming to richmond to cause trouble and they might not be very well
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:20.480]  thought out it you know it might be a clever false flag but it might just be some loser
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:26.480]  ganking out a pistol anything can happen in a highly charged atmosphere like this because
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:31.360]  this is going to be getting massive national exposure and people are coming from all over
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:37.120]  the country and we're going to talk some more about uh about richmond on monday when we come
[3:28:37.120 --> 3:28:42.800]  back from the break because there's a lot to talk about and i have some more ideas about things to
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:56.400]  do not just things not to do we can all agree these are troubled times right so do you know who's on

[3:31:10.160 --> 3:31:18.640]  case of the flu of their life but still by concentration camp victims they line up at
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:24.000]  the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections it doesn't matter that studies
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:29.200]  mainline government studies in canada in europe show that when you take the flu vaccine it doubles
[3:31:29.200 --> 3:31:34.880]  your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity it goes on and on
[3:31:34.880 --> 3:31:40.720]  or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine

[3:33:03.600 --> 3:33:25.040]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:25.040 --> 3:33:34.560]  all right now i mentioned that um if you don't think you're going to be able to get inside of
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:40.320]  the of the capital square itself which is all you know fenced off with uh temporary cyclone
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:49.360]  fencing now and and trust me every inch down there is is uh on cameras um if you if you aren't sure
[3:33:49.360 --> 3:33:54.480]  you'll be wanting to talk to people have communication with folks that are ahead of you in line
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:33:59.520]  but if it looks like you're not going to get in and you do decide to carry a concealed weapon
[3:33:59.520 --> 3:34:05.040]  which i know some people are considering that this considering this to be a big part of the issue
[3:34:05.040 --> 3:34:10.800]  is just the fact that northern made this a gun free zone on his own say so by declaring a state
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:17.760]  of emergency and there's a debate raging right now whether that's legal or not but trust me between
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:23.680]  now and monday that's not going to be hashed out and you're not going to win a debate on the sidewalk
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:29.440]  you know with a cop and riot here about whether or not it was a legal order for you to carry or
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:37.280]  not carry a pistol but that's up to you but i will say and this is a lesson from the the twin peaks
[3:34:37.280 --> 3:34:45.680]  waco texas twin peaks disaster if for any reason i mean a truck backfires if people start pulling
[3:34:45.680 --> 3:34:52.000]  out pistols you have to be aware that on top of the buildings all around this area these are like
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:59.440]  six eight tens floor buildings with flat roofs and parapets in other words you know perfect sniper
[3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:06.080]  headquarters not just hides but like sniper jamborees they're going to have every inch of every
[3:35:06.080 --> 3:35:13.680]  downstown downtown street covered with spotters and snipers so if for any reason somebody starts
[3:35:13.680 --> 3:35:20.000]  pulling out pistols think about what happened in waco at twin peaks as soon as the bikers pulled
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  out the pistols the sniper is unloaded so really that's a very bad idea if you if you think you're
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:33.840]  going to get hit by some antifa or something and you need your pistol think about the fact that if
[3:35:33.840 --> 3:35:39.680]  you pull a pistol you are you are going to be in the crosshairs and somebody's going to have about
[3:35:39.680 --> 3:35:46.480]  two pounds of pressure on a trigger ready to go so think long and hard about that i said people
[3:35:46.480 --> 3:35:51.920]  would say well and why in the hell would you want to go to a situation like this well for a lot of
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:59.920]  reasons there are many patriots that consider this a necessary evolution a necessary event
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:06.160]  good bad or ugly they've got to go there to show the flag that not to go to richmond would be a
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:15.840]  form of surrender another point of view is that you know uh paul revere did not lead a march into
[3:36:15.840 --> 3:36:24.080]  boston to protest british gun control he waited and then at lexington and concord when the british
[3:36:24.080 --> 3:36:29.360]  were strung out when they were far from their power base that's when they had to battle and then
[3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:34.400]  they you know attacked the british all the way back to boston so they waited for the enemy to come
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:40.080]  onto their territory and into their favorable circumstances but then people will say what
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:47.040]  net before that there was the boston massacre that's when some bostonians started throwing
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:53.440]  snowballs at the redcoats to rile them up and for that they were shot so some people would
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:59.360]  say well before you have concord in lexington you have to have the boston massacre there are if you
[3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:05.600]  can believe it even people and some call them accelerationists there are people that think
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:13.760]  for example that charlottesville was quote unquote a necessary first step that in order to
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:20.400]  get our country to the boiling point to where the so-called boogaloo starts when it's a free fire
[3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:26.880]  zone and you know we're taking score and taking out our enemies to reestablish liberty in this
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:32.880]  country or whatever form of government people prefer they think we need to throw you know we
[3:37:32.880 --> 3:37:39.760]  need to throw a brick into this boiling pot and just make it overflow so if you're going to richmond
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:47.600]  for perfectly legitimate peaceful reasons to assemble and defend your second amendment rights
[3:37:47.600 --> 3:37:53.440]  you need to be aware that there are lunatics or maybe they're not lunatics they just have that
[3:37:53.440 --> 3:38:00.640]  point of view they say there's a there's a acronym there is no voting our way out of this
[3:38:00.640 --> 3:38:07.120]  that we're past that point you know look at virginia it was it was the key the keystone state of the
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:14.080]  confederacy the army of northern virginia and in the last decade it's gone blue how did that happen
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:21.760]  a demographic shift brought on by open borders and illegal and illegal immigration where both of
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:29.040]  those groups of immigrants vote 70 for democrats so as the as this mass immigration continues
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:35.680]  state after state is going to turn like virginia so the accelerationists believe we're better to get
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:42.720]  this fight going sooner rather than later and so if you're going to richmond for perfectly peaceful
[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:49.920]  reasons please understand that there are people that would like to see richmond turn into charlotte's
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:59.280]  vill times twin peaks at weco that is you know the the clashes on the street as well as shooting which
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:05.200]  would all be blamed on the second amendment crowd the the national narrative in the mainstream
[3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:11.360]  media will be that gun owners who support the second amendment are dangerous lunatics and the
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:18.320]  smartest thing to do is pass gun control like governor nor the once and disarm those crazy
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:25.440]  dangerous lunatics those rednecks those white nationalist rednecks if you look at uh liberal
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:30.880]  media uh media matters has a couple stories up today one is about infowars mentions of course
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:36.960]  alex and also myself um and they have they have a couple of stories on the richmond if you read
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:44.960]  the comments their perception of second amendment supporters is white racist rednecks so whether
[3:39:44.960 --> 3:39:49.680]  or not you think that uh well this will be different from charlotte's vill because that was
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:55.680]  about the roberty lee statue and this is about the second amendment to our enemies it's the same
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:40:04.080]  thing they're going to portray it as white racist crazy gun nuts who came to richmond and then there
[3:40:04.080 --> 3:40:09.840]  was a massacre it won't matter if it's a false flag it won't matter if it's some james hoskess
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:17.440]  and loser that shows up with an sks it won't matter if a truck backfires and and a sniper who
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:24.880]  already has three pounds on the trigger lets one off by accident and something out of twin peaks
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:30.320]  that you you should ponder and consider is when you're dealing with with a common police law
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:37.760]  enforcement uh not just 308 sniper rifles but also many cops would just have their tactical
[3:40:37.760 --> 3:40:45.200]  car being in 556 with a scope on it you can't tell who fired what because it's not like csi
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:50.080]  where they're going to pull a pristine little magic bullet out of somebody and match it to a
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:57.040]  particular law enforcement rifle forget that that's out the window if there's a number of police
[3:40:57.040 --> 3:41:04.080]  like in waco at twin peaks if there are a number of police sharpshooters snipers um firing 5.56
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:10.640]  high high velocity rounds they're either going to go through the person or be in fragments and
[3:41:10.640 --> 3:41:15.440]  there won't be enough to determine which rifle it came out of what does this mean it means that
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:21.280]  it makes it kind of easy for the cops once the shooting starts to just participate it's called
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:27.360]  sympathetic shooting it's what happens when you know three or four cops all approach a suspect
[3:41:27.360 --> 3:41:33.760]  if anybody shoots it's very likely that all of the cops will empty a magazine period as
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:38.000]  they're shooting going on and you just keep shooting while the shooting is going on and if
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:46.560]  it's 556 or if it's uh even 308 hollow points you can't tie a particular casualty to a particular
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:54.160]  police rifle so it'll just be swept under the rug like waco twin peaks oh well it was not our fault
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:42:00.240]  we were trying to save lives it was those crazy gun nuts down there and if somebody hadn't pulled
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:04.080]  out a pistol then he wouldn't have shot him and then all these other people shot everybody else
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:10.320]  i'm telling you richmond has the potential to be a highly dangerous area not saying don't go
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:17.440]  but i'm saying know what you're getting into please know what you're getting into now there are

[3:44:37.840 --> 3:44:44.400]  that's not just words that's reality you have made history we have made history together info
[3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:53.680]  wars dot com only has power because of you and i suggest you use it i've got to really hand it to
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:59.760]  the listeners and viewers who enforce your support and your help in rebooting americana
[3:44:59.760 --> 3:45:05.280]  is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:12.000]  the us worldwide and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:18.000]  liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:22.320]  that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against
[3:45:22.320 --> 3:45:28.560]  communist china trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[3:45:29.280 --> 3:45:35.120]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[3:45:35.840 --> 3:45:39.760]  against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[3:45:39.760 --> 3:45:45.600]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[3:45:45.600 --> 3:45:50.800]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:45:52.160 --> 3:45:57.600]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[3:45:57.600 --> 3:46:04.960]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical
[3:46:04.960 --> 3:46:11.120]  for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they
[3:46:11.120 --> 3:46:17.920]  persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[3:46:17.920 --> 3:46:22.640]  the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because
[3:46:22.640 --> 3:46:28.640]  they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the
[3:46:28.640 --> 3:46:35.520]  innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheepdogs to
[3:46:35.520 --> 3:46:42.800]  stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the
[3:46:42.800 --> 3:46:49.920]  fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know
[3:46:49.920 --> 3:47:03.760]  is that god is in charge you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:21.200]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with matt bracken
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:33.440]  okay last segment and this is uh where i give you some of my ideas some some tricks and tools
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:41.040]  for a successful richman i already talked about maps and the value of printing some of your own
[3:47:41.040 --> 3:47:47.440]  maps because when you do that it won't be subject to you goofing up with your your uh you know your
[3:47:47.440 --> 3:47:54.560]  slippery fingers and suddenly losing what you're trying to find on on uh on you know your street
[3:47:54.560 --> 3:48:00.960]  view and uh the next thing you know you you you've lost your situational awareness a big
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:06.960]  printed map where you've already lined out your access routes um that's going to be doing you a
[3:48:06.960 --> 3:48:11.840]  good job if you put it inside of a ziploc baggie it wouldn't matter if it's against your sweaty body
[3:48:11.840 --> 3:48:18.480]  or if it's raining you can have you know four or five maps different scales fold them in half put
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:25.680]  them inside a ziploc ziploc it'll really help that you to to avoid getting hurted into a cul-de-sac
[3:48:26.240 --> 3:48:32.880]  or or getting you know trapped against by a police line against some obstacle now while we're talking
[3:48:32.880 --> 3:48:39.360]  about police lines and obstacles a handy thing to bring along that is completely legit to to own
[3:48:39.360 --> 3:48:47.440]  and possess anywhere is a pair of wire cutters or um even like line the lineman tool which has like a
[3:48:47.440 --> 3:48:53.840]  square pliers at the end and then a nice big side cutter because with them you can you can get through
[3:48:54.720 --> 3:49:00.640]  the temporary fencing very easily i'm not saying cut an entire line a chain link but where they're
[3:49:00.640 --> 3:49:05.920]  just joined with like coat hanger wire you know where these sections are just it's very easy in
[3:49:05.920 --> 3:49:12.480]  flimsy you cut two or piece two or three pieces of tie wire open the fences pull the fences apart
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:19.280]  and you're through as opposed to just being hurted up against in a pile think about las vegas most of
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:24.240]  the casualties occurred where people were being just smashed up against those temporary fences
[3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:29.280]  so if you can if you have the ability to make your own exit by going to a place where the people
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:35.280]  are not and just opening a gap in the fences with your wire cutters you're golden another thing you
[3:49:35.280 --> 3:49:41.680]  can do with wire cutters especially little dykes the nippers small ones you can practice cutting
[3:49:42.560 --> 3:49:49.120]  zip ties so if you happen to find yourself with a pair of nylon zip ties but then you can run away
[3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  if you have a little pair of wire cutters in your back pocket you can practice at home
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:49:58.880]  cutting your cutting yourself out of zip ties and then of course you can you can then cut a
[3:49:58.880 --> 3:50:05.680]  bunch of other people loose if you under any conditions for something like this bring a
[3:50:05.680 --> 3:50:10.400]  little pair of binoculars little eight by twenties they don't take up much room they weigh almost
[3:50:10.400 --> 3:50:16.960]  nothing but they allow you to see several blocks away with great clarity so instead of walking
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:22.240]  into some kind of a trap whether antifa or law enforcement you can study it from three or four
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:27.120]  hundred yards away and decide now i ain't going up there you know they're searching everybody
[3:50:27.120 --> 3:50:32.560]  and putting them on a van down there but the binoculars will help you get that situational
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:39.920]  awareness way in advance along with the optics is thermal optics and i know a lot of hunters
[3:50:39.920 --> 3:50:46.160]  and preppers do have thermal optics today day or night they work they work and if it's cold out
[3:50:46.160 --> 3:50:51.840]  they work even better because the bodies are you know people are much warmer than a richman winter
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:58.240]  day you can actually depending on what people are wearing you can see if somebody is is carrying a
[3:50:58.240 --> 3:51:04.880]  weapon uh by the black blob or what depending on whether you have white or black hot but you can
[3:51:04.880 --> 3:51:10.080]  often tell if somebody's got a weapon underneath their clothing with the thermal you can you can
[3:51:10.080 --> 3:51:15.760]  tell a lot it's almost like x-ray vision to a certain extent when you're scanning people with
[3:51:15.760 --> 3:51:22.080]  with your thermal so if you got a little if you got a thermal scope maybe pull your qd your quick
[3:51:22.080 --> 3:51:27.600]  your quick detach bring it off your carbine bring it down they can't fault you for having a a thermal
[3:51:27.600 --> 3:51:35.120]  optic uh let's see of course you know your your smartphone your cameras record everything that
[3:51:35.120 --> 3:51:41.840]  you can and consider having a means to upload it immediately so that even if let's say something
[3:51:41.840 --> 3:51:47.360]  bad happens and you wind up being herded into detention along with an entire mob of people
[3:51:47.360 --> 3:51:51.600]  that's what happened to twin peaks they just arrested every biker there a million dollar
[3:51:51.600 --> 3:51:56.480]  bail well they're going to take your smartphone so it won't do you much good all the proof you had
[3:51:56.480 --> 3:52:02.160]  on it when you get it back it might have been hammered so so if you can upload images as you're
[3:52:02.160 --> 3:52:08.480]  going as you're streaming like periscope something like that get the images out live or store them
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:14.880]  off you out of your camera so that even if your camera is taken from you the evidence will still
[3:52:14.880 --> 3:52:21.600]  be out in the in the internet available if you're depending on where you're parking obviously the
[3:52:21.600 --> 3:52:26.800]  bus thing is a whole different whole different story but depending where you're parking consider
[3:52:26.800 --> 3:52:32.960]  leaving security at the parking lot even the cavalry dismounted cavalry they left horseholders
[3:52:32.960 --> 3:52:41.600]  you know usually an old guy but we're a you know a wounded guy but you can't just leave 20 cars parked
[3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:47.520]  somewhere with with second amendment stickers on them and not expect them to be vandalized or have
[3:52:47.520 --> 3:52:53.600]  cut tires you know especially if people think wow all these cars are probably fully guns today
[3:52:54.320 --> 3:53:01.280]  so consider leaving security back at your parking lot i would absolutely if you have a lawyer or
[3:53:01.280 --> 3:53:08.400]  some some legal preparation the potential exists for large scale arrests and it won't matter what
[3:53:08.400 --> 3:53:14.400]  you did or didn't do if you're in a crowd between this corner and that corner and everybody is
[3:53:14.400 --> 3:53:19.760]  herded herded down there to be arrested because they said it's an unlawful assembly and they gave
[3:53:19.760 --> 3:53:25.600]  you five minutes and in four minutes they said you're all under arrest things like this can happen
[3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:31.280]  like in charlottesville or in twin peaks so what do you do if you're arrested do you have a lawyer
[3:53:31.280 --> 3:53:37.600]  do you have a lawyer's card maybe have some stuff in your wallet and some stuff not in your wallet
[3:53:37.600 --> 3:53:43.840]  in case your wallet happens to be taken when you're arrested you can't rule out things like
[3:53:43.840 --> 3:53:52.960]  pepper spray being employed so i would absolutely you know bring some kind of of mask and eye protection
[3:53:52.960 --> 3:53:59.120]  they can't fault you for masks and eye protection and water which you'll be drinking anyway but if
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:04.160]  you have to do an eyewash or if you have to do any eyewash for anybody else you know you'll need
[3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:10.000]  the water and other preparations for that i'm not saying anything bad is going to happen here
[3:54:10.800 --> 3:54:16.160]  you know maybe everything will work out just beautifully i'm just saying that there's a
[3:54:16.160 --> 3:54:24.000]  lot of really nasty potential and and you know i know that the virginia citizens defense league
[3:54:25.200 --> 3:54:29.680]  their heart is in the right place i do not fault them for this they want to stand up for their
[3:54:29.680 --> 3:54:34.480]  rights i get it you know everybody wants to protect our second amendment rights but
[3:54:35.440 --> 3:54:42.320]  some ideas that are good ideas they just don't scale up you know you can't take a kids lemonade
[3:54:42.320 --> 3:54:48.640]  stand and say i'm going to be like uh mcdonald's and and make it a national franchise some ideas
[3:54:48.640 --> 3:54:56.240]  do not scale and the virginia's the vcdl annual lobby day where they have maybe a hundred guys
[3:54:56.240 --> 3:55:04.160]  you know wearing jackets and ties assigned to bird dog the legislators that worked great and what i've
[3:55:04.160 --> 3:55:10.480]  seen is well it always worked in the past so it should work fine on monday that concept is not
[3:55:10.480 --> 3:55:19.040]  going to scale if you've got 30 or 40 000 people or more or less nobody knows it's all wild cards
[3:55:19.040 --> 3:55:24.720]  at this point if you have that many people flooding downtown richmond in this high security
[3:55:24.720 --> 3:55:31.040]  environment you know where the governor's already talking about these uh credible threats of of
[3:55:31.040 --> 3:55:38.640]  violence and armed drones and all kind of crazy stuff in that environment you can't nobody can
[3:55:38.640 --> 3:55:43.920]  tell that it's going to turn out all right because the last times with a hundred guys it turned out
[3:55:43.920 --> 3:55:49.680]  all right you just can't scale this and proof it out you have to look at better examples that
[3:55:49.680 --> 3:55:55.440]  would be like you know things that happened in portland oregon um where they attacked the buses
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:01.680]  you know the bus is a very vulnerable target in a downtown city and and you cannot even rule out
[3:56:01.680 --> 3:56:07.040]  that there are bad actors on the law enforcement side the peter strock types and i'm not saying
[3:56:07.040 --> 3:56:11.840]  that the superintendent of the virginia state police or anybody like that has bad intentions
[3:56:11.840 --> 3:56:19.280]  but think of how many levels a bad actor can be a can do terrible things just by at the last minute
[3:56:19.280 --> 3:56:25.280]  changing where the buses have to go to put them into a dangerous area or leaving the buses in a
[3:56:25.280 --> 3:56:30.240]  vulnerable position or making it so that it's so it's too far for people to safely walk they've got
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:36.960]  to go through a area full of their enemies it's there's just so much room for mischief in this whole
[3:56:36.960 --> 3:56:43.760]  environment that i would um i'd be very cautious going there not saying don't go there but you
[3:56:43.760 --> 3:56:49.120]  know take some of the stuff that i've suggested the binos the wire cutters you know take them
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:52.960]  if you have a pair of you know if you have some walkie talkies of group that you're not relying
[3:56:52.960 --> 3:56:58.640]  on cell phone which could be jammed some walkie talkies can be helpful you know and in just in
[3:56:58.640 --> 3:57:05.120]  case they do jam the cell phone signals because nothing can be rolled out and i look forward
[3:57:05.120 --> 3:57:11.840]  next week to talking to you about how um nothing happened it was completely peaceful and the
[3:57:11.840 --> 3:57:16.880]  legislatures all changed their mind and there's not going to be any gun control no more confiscation
[3:57:16.880 --> 3:57:23.360]  talk in virginia i look forward to talking about that next thursday and i i hope we're not talking
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:29.520]  about you know anything really rotten that happened there but i'll see you next week and
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:35.520]  we'll do an after-action report and discuss what actually happened until then we're all just guessing
[3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:53.280]  and this is matt fracken and see you next week
