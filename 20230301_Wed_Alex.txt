[00:00.000 --> 00:26.480]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the air raid sirens are going off, not the fake air raid
[00:26.480 --> 00:34.400]  sirens like they did as war propaganda when Joe Biden was in Ukraine, but actual raid
[00:34.400 --> 00:43.960]  sirens because Russia is now under attack under drone attack at an oil plant.
[00:43.960 --> 00:48.560]  And so who's the leading candidate?
[00:48.560 --> 00:55.600]  Well we know it was the West that blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and so if there's
[00:55.600 --> 01:02.600]  any circumstantial evidence there, it points to the West amplifying the war.
[01:02.600 --> 01:08.480]  But I want to just play two clips to kind of set the tone for what is going to be an
[01:08.480 --> 01:12.920]  epic and busy news transmission today.
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.160]  And we'll start with this Zelensky clip that's going viral and while claims are being made
[01:18.160 --> 01:25.240]  that it's taken out of context, I'll tell you the full context, but no, this is what
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.960]  Zelensky said, either fund Ukraine and give Ukraine weapons and go to war with Russia
[01:31.960 --> 01:36.940]  or Americans are going to have to fight and die is what Zelensky is saying here in clip
[01:36.940 --> 01:39.220]  5.
[01:39.220 --> 01:46.800]  The US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending their
[01:46.800 --> 01:52.120]  sons and daughters to war and they will have to fight because it's a nature that we're
[01:52.120 --> 01:53.120]  talking about.
[01:53.120 --> 01:58.400]  They will be dying, God forbid, because it's a horrible thing.
[01:58.400 --> 02:07.280]  Now I'll admit I'm probably on the far end of being a contrarian where you tell me to
[02:07.280 --> 02:10.960]  do something I'm most likely not going to do it or you tell me not to do something you
[02:10.960 --> 02:17.040]  know I'm going to do it as with as much knowledge as you have regarding the situation to not
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.040]  make a dumb decision.
[02:18.040 --> 02:24.920]  So how do we respond to Zelensky saying American blood, American treasure needs to be spilled
[02:24.920 --> 02:26.440]  in defense of Ukraine?
[02:26.440 --> 02:34.880]  I'll tell you at this point, honestly, my politics aside, whatever politics or worldviews
[02:34.880 --> 02:42.000]  I have if I'm looking at this neutrally and I've got this little punk in a sweatshirt
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.840]  made by a Balenciaga creative designer telling me that American blood and treasure needs
[02:47.840 --> 02:54.360]  to be spilled in defense of Ukraine, how about no buddy, how about no, how about now I kind
[02:54.360 --> 02:56.600]  of want you to fail.
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.560]  Now the people of Ukraine don't deserve that, the good people of Ukraine want nothing to
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.760]  do with this war and the ones that do will go and fight Russians and they will fight
[03:05.760 --> 03:11.840]  and many have died and many innocent Ukrainians have died because of this war, many because
[03:11.840 --> 03:19.280]  of Zelensky's attacks and the different proxy groups that are just out of control in the
[03:19.280 --> 03:22.120]  region.
[03:22.120 --> 03:33.200]  But after we've done so much for Ukraine, that little punk in a Balenciaga sweatshirt
[03:33.200 --> 03:39.200]  that they use to raise money is going to tell me American blood and treasure is going to
[03:39.200 --> 03:49.200]  be needed for Ukraine, I'd say get steppin' buddy, good luck, good luck, oh because I'm
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.960]  sure that Ukraine will defend us if we got attacked by China, I'm sure that Ukraine will
[03:54.960 --> 04:01.120]  give us all the money back that we've given them too, right, of course not, it's a one
[04:01.120 --> 04:08.800]  way street isn't it and I'm sick and tired of being on it, but then you have and I've
[04:08.800 --> 04:13.440]  gone along here in this opening segment and this is going to be the main thrust today,
[04:13.440 --> 04:21.200]  I'm assuming with a guest coming on covering this, now they're saying okay, it came out
[04:21.200 --> 04:28.960]  of a Chinese lab, it came out of the Wuhan lab, why are they telling us this now?
[04:28.960 --> 04:36.120]  Why are they telling this to us three years after Info Wars broke the story and it's not
[04:36.120 --> 04:41.680]  even, I mean we've already done, we don't need to sit here and do victory laughs, we
[04:41.680 --> 04:48.400]  know we're next year's news today, next decade's news today, so now the question is why are
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.120]  they admitting it came out of a Wuhan lab or why do they want us now to think it came
[04:52.120 --> 05:01.600]  out of a Wuhan lab?
[05:01.600 --> 05:05.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic
[05:05.560 --> 05:09.880]  book that documents the global to their own words, planned for our future, that is the
[05:09.880 --> 05:10.880]  hellish future.
[05:10.880 --> 05:14.680]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[05:14.680 --> 05:18.680]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[05:18.680 --> 05:22.840]  amazon, or infowarscore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[05:22.840 --> 05:27.600]  the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[05:27.600 --> 05:32.880]  right now, so get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at
[05:32.880 --> 05:37.360]  infowarscore.com, and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on
[05:37.360 --> 05:41.440]  the air, so you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also
[05:41.440 --> 05:45.080]  know that you help keep infowars on the air, I'm gonna thank those of you that have gotten
[05:45.080 --> 05:50.200]  signed copies of the book or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't
[05:50.200 --> 05:55.040]  yet to go to infowarscore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and
[05:55.040 --> 05:59.600]  donate to the library or give them to the local school. This is an info war, I'm counting
[05:59.600 --> 06:25.600]  on you and thank you for your support.
[06:25.600 --> 06:36.280]  Am I in, am I in 30, 23? What level of this dystopian future am I in right now? Ladies
[06:36.280 --> 06:41.340]  and gentlemen, Owen Stroyer here, filling in on the Alex Jones show in honor and a privilege
[06:41.340 --> 06:47.480]  always to be with you, the crew of the audience here on this Wednesday, March 1st, 2023 and
[06:47.480 --> 06:56.640]  now we're into the new phase, year two of the war in Ukraine and most expert opinions
[06:56.640 --> 07:03.720]  and analysts are kind of seeing the same thing, not the war propagandists, not your lying
[07:03.720 --> 07:11.440]  media, your lying politicians, but true analysis of this, looking at it for what it is. The
[07:11.440 --> 07:16.040]  war is gonna go on, it looks like for years now and that's kind of how it's all being
[07:16.040 --> 07:23.800]  prepped and for Russia they actually have a serious fight and they actually have the
[07:23.800 --> 07:30.440]  backing of the Russian people, I mean imagine after 9-11 all the support, George Bush got,
[07:30.440 --> 07:35.080]  all the support the military got, the patriotism, all of it, that's basically what's going
[07:35.080 --> 07:44.600]  on in Russia right now, the parameters obviously different but maybe not anymore as Russia's
[07:44.600 --> 07:51.680]  now getting attacked, drone attacks inside Russian territory, so you don't really have
[07:51.680 --> 07:56.760]  support for this war anywhere else, I mean you've seen the Polish people hopping up and
[07:56.760 --> 08:04.520]  down for war very oddly but okay, but where else are you getting that support? Ukraine,
[08:04.520 --> 08:10.720]  not so much, not really and sadly the people of Kiev and some of these other major Ukrainian
[08:10.720 --> 08:17.200]  cities that have mostly been able to live their lives normally in the last year, I think
[08:17.200 --> 08:21.720]  in this next phase of the war that's going to change and so for the next year Russia
[08:21.720 --> 08:27.440]  is going to be moving forward towards the Nipro River and they're gonna secure all the land
[08:27.440 --> 08:32.640]  and you're probably gonna see at least 500,000 dead in the process and they're not really
[08:32.640 --> 08:36.520]  showing much of the footage coming from these actual war zones and I think that's because
[08:36.520 --> 08:41.280]  they don't want the American people to see how bad it actually is, they want the made
[08:41.280 --> 08:47.760]  for TV moments, they want the TV heroes Zelensky running around in a Balenciaga sweatshirt,
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.040]  they want the glad handing of the American media, the American politicians, the celebrities
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.240]  going over there with Zelensky, they want to feel good about the money and the weapons
[08:57.240 --> 09:10.640]  but they don't want to actually show you entire regions of Ukraine turned into rubble because
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.040]  you might not want to support this, you might not believe that Ukraine is winning the war
[09:15.040 --> 09:22.160]  as they continue to tell you which of course any buddy who's observing this can pretty
[09:22.160 --> 09:27.080]  much do the math, you keep telling us Ukraine's winning but you keep telling us how much they
[09:27.080 --> 09:33.480]  need weapons and ammunition and money, well that doesn't sound like winning does it, no
[09:33.480 --> 09:35.920]  quite the opposite.
[09:35.920 --> 09:44.320]  Now does China's involvement in the war in Ukraine which is really just China deciding
[09:44.320 --> 09:51.520]  to back Russia in the larger geopolitical face off of the corrupt globalists in the
[09:51.520 --> 10:02.040]  West facing off with the, you could say corrupt globalists of the East in kind of this power
[10:02.040 --> 10:07.600]  struggle for who's going to dictate, who's going to be on top of the pyramid when the
[10:07.600 --> 10:13.280]  global government comes into fruition, now of course the American people and everybody
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.960]  on the planet should be against the concept of global government but they're not getting
[10:17.960 --> 10:18.960]  the full story.
[10:18.960 --> 10:31.320]  We will talk about that today but you have to wonder why, why is the US government and
[10:31.320 --> 10:43.680]  the American media telling you today that the Wuhan lab was indeed the origin of COVID-19
[10:43.680 --> 10:49.080]  and there's a whole list of questions that follow that and surround that and we're going
[10:49.080 --> 10:54.080]  to get into that with Dr. Andrew Hough who was an original whistleblower on the virus
[10:54.080 --> 11:04.920]  origins in the third hour today but getting back to the situation in Ukraine now that's
[11:04.920 --> 11:12.520]  being escalated with Russia getting attacked, folks there's just not much support for Ukraine
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.480]  out there I'm sorry to say and you've got of course the mainstream media propaganda
[11:17.480 --> 11:22.720]  but they tell you Joe Biden is popular too, I mean you know that's a lie.
[11:22.720 --> 11:28.160]  So this is what they do, they push out their propaganda, they get all their brainwashed
[11:28.160 --> 11:35.160]  minions to put a Ukraine flag on their internet profile or put a Ukraine flag up by their
[11:35.160 --> 11:42.600]  business or wave a Ukraine flag during their political events and it's just all propaganda
[11:42.600 --> 11:46.080]  and you know what I kind of like what you guys are doing here putting all those Alinsky
[11:46.080 --> 11:51.680]  crap on the screen let's just keep doing that, just show all the gay Alinsky stuff and hey
[11:51.680 --> 11:56.800]  that's fine if he wants to make jokes about his penis and play with his penis on television
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.000]  and rub his penis on other men and dance for other men and gimp suits and hump them and
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.160]  gyrate them in a homoerotic display then that's good for Zelensky.
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.800]  But this is who you're supposed to back, this is who's telling you you need to die and pay
[12:11.800 --> 12:18.560]  for Ukraine to survive as he's going to be the one in charge when Ukraine falls stealing
[12:18.560 --> 12:26.280]  all of our money in the process, I mean imagine Zelensky you know this gay twink in a gimp
[12:26.280 --> 12:34.360]  outfit leather daddy just mounting the United States of America and just having it, that's
[12:34.360 --> 12:37.040]  what he wants to do that's what he's doing and we're supposed to sit here and take it
[12:37.040 --> 12:43.360]  but no, no no no no no, see there's not that support for Ukraine, you've got the propaganda
[12:43.360 --> 12:49.280]  overwhelming you thinking the support is there it's not, anti-war protests in America, anti-war
[12:49.280 --> 12:59.600]  protests in Germany, anti-war protests in France, anti-nato protests, so no they don't
[12:59.600 --> 13:05.920]  have the support, they're feigning the support, they're faking it all, they want you to think
[13:05.920 --> 13:13.120]  you're on the winning team, it's like Tokyo Rose, Baghdad Bob or if I decided to run a
[13:13.120 --> 13:20.600]  commercial because I wanted to sell merchandise and you just had the Kansas City Chiefs beat
[13:20.600 --> 13:24.000]  the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl but I just said you know what I want to sell
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.600]  some Eagles merchandise so I'm just going to say the Eagles won the Super Bowl and we're
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.120]  going to sell Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl hats and t-shirts and somebody that doesn't
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.480]  know any better would say oh oh the Eagles won the Super Bowl I want a hat I want a t-shirt
[13:38.480 --> 13:42.400]  and then they go out and they buy the Super Bowl hat and t-shirt thinking oh look I'm
[13:42.400 --> 13:46.040]  on the winning team I'm winning I'm a Super Bowl winner with the Eagles but no the Eagles
[13:46.040 --> 13:53.320]  didn't win the Super Bowl you got tricked and so that's now what's going on in Ukraine
[13:53.320 --> 14:01.160]  but the situation has escalated and again folks you need to understand the the the support
[14:01.160 --> 14:07.200]  for the Ukrainian Army the support publicly all of this it's just not there and as far
[14:07.200 --> 14:16.600]  as the Linsky's side is concerned with Joe Biden and and and Duda in Poland there is
[14:16.600 --> 14:26.000]  no real cause there is no real momentum it's all synthetic it's all fake it's all propaganda
[14:26.000 --> 14:35.360]  and of course you can always go back to the question of why and say well money 150 billion
[14:35.360 --> 14:41.240]  dollars to Ukraine I mean that's a hell of a lot of money but then you look at their
[14:41.240 --> 14:50.160]  side from Russia and this is where your media is not telling you what's going on folks.
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.200]  Russian patriotism support for Vladimir Putin is basically I would say the comparison is
[14:55.200 --> 15:01.560]  like after 9-11 in the United States of America where you saw American flags everywhere patriotism
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.720]  everywhere people joining the military everywhere now I'm not saying it's a hundred percent
[15:06.720 --> 15:13.040]  for that in Russia obviously I'm just saying if you want to have kind of an idea a flavor
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.840]  a moment of what this is like in Russia think post 9-11 America with the patriotism and
[15:18.840 --> 15:25.760]  the support and the unity that's happening in Russia and that is legitimate you don't
[15:25.760 --> 15:30.160]  have that anywhere else right now you don't have that in Ukraine for Ukraine you don't
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.840]  have that in any NATO countries for Ukraine you don't really have that in America outside
[15:34.840 --> 15:39.920]  of just the propaganda so when you realize that Zelensky and Ukraine are basically an
[15:39.920 --> 15:47.120]  empty an empty shell of a tank moving in against the Russians that are actually there want
[15:47.120 --> 15:53.640]  to be there and have a real agenda and a real cause you realize the whole Ukraine war was
[15:53.640 --> 15:58.280]  always meant to fail but there's a bigger problem and we'll talk about that on the other
[15:58.280 --> 16:00.280]  side.
[16:00.280 --> 16:04.760]  Ladies and gentlemen this book The Great Reset in the War for the World is a historic book

[19:15.160 --> 19:20.400]  that for a second now I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans I'm addicted to spreading
[19:20.400 --> 19:24.320]  the truth and again I you know I have info words to thank for that looking back on the
[19:24.320 --> 19:29.520]  day I was able to ask president Donald Trump two questions I was so grateful because you
[19:29.520 --> 19:33.600]  know I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info wars team I
[19:33.600 --> 19:39.160]  really do credit that as to why I'm able to you know get these types of clips because
[19:39.160 --> 19:43.880]  Alex's whole mentality was you know go where the story is go where the mainstream media
[19:43.880 --> 19:48.600]  refuses to so it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity I'm just addicted to telling
[19:48.600 --> 19:53.040]  the truth and helping the American people and I really do credit Alex for you know really
[19:53.040 --> 20:04.520]  instilling that within me early on in my career leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[20:04.520 --> 20:11.520]  new world order it's Alex Jones
[20:34.520 --> 20:51.960]  so it's sad that you have world leaders that will gladly profit and gain more influence
[20:51.960 --> 20:58.560]  and power off of a war that is going to devastate an entire country see probably at least half
[20:58.560 --> 21:05.360]  a million killed overall and they just don't care they just don't care they launder their
[21:05.360 --> 21:10.400]  money they launder their weapons and they just do not care at all the bloodshed and
[21:10.400 --> 21:21.160]  destruction going on in Ukraine all over power all over influence and it's it's truly sick
[21:21.160 --> 21:26.800]  how evil military industrial complex and its representatives in the US media and the US
[21:26.800 --> 21:40.720]  government have become and it's really an odd phenomenon that we're witnessing here
[21:40.720 --> 21:48.160]  that the anti-war American left that voted for Obama and that was probably the reason
[21:48.160 --> 21:55.840]  why many centrists libertarians vote voted for Obama was his anti-war stance and campaigning
[21:55.840 --> 22:01.160]  on ending the wars in the Middle East now of course he lied he bombed more countries
[22:01.160 --> 22:12.000]  than Bush did but aside from that now those same anti-war liberals are pro-war just blood
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.280]  dripping from their foaming mouths against Vladimir Putin against Russia for this war
[22:19.280 --> 22:27.200]  in Ukraine it's really sick it's really disgusting and I'm telling you they're not really reporting
[22:27.200 --> 22:31.600]  how bad it actually is in Ukraine they're not really showing you the destruction the
[22:31.600 --> 22:41.440]  devastation and the death numbers because they don't want it humanized they just want
[22:41.440 --> 22:45.600]  you to they just want to be able to click their heels say give Ukraine money and then
[22:45.600 --> 22:55.000]  you put the Ukraine flag in your internet profile or at your house or place of business
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.720]  this thing you're doing the right thing you're supporting Ukraine you're doing a good thing
[23:01.720 --> 23:09.600]  when really it's just a bunch of money laundering war mongering and regime change efforts in
[23:09.600 --> 23:15.880]  a struggle that quite frankly we should not even be involved in you can pick and choose
[23:15.880 --> 23:19.760]  what struggles you want to be involved in you can pick and choose which struggles which
[23:19.760 --> 23:25.760]  country struggles you want to amplify and make the American people aware of but you
[23:25.760 --> 23:33.280]  see they don't talk about what goes on in Yemen do they they don't talk about Syria
[23:33.280 --> 23:39.840]  that gets attacked no they want you focusing on Ukraine because that's where the big power
[23:39.840 --> 23:47.240]  struggle is going on that's where the West has been influencing and rigging and meddling
[23:47.240 --> 23:57.840]  in elections and foreign affairs to a point of no return and even doing deeper analysis
[23:57.840 --> 24:03.680]  into this I wonder and we don't really hear about this angle discussed much but but I
[24:03.680 --> 24:17.120]  wonder how much of this invasion of Ukraine is directly Joe Biden's fault now is that
[24:17.120 --> 24:21.520]  because Russia knows that Joe Biden is just going to be laundering money and not actually
[24:21.520 --> 24:32.120]  going to fight a war why is it the last two times Russia has gone into Ukraine is when
[24:32.120 --> 24:44.600]  Joe Biden is in the White House now my analytical response to this is that well Russia we know
[24:44.600 --> 24:49.600]  Putin's problem is he doesn't like NATO's expansion he doesn't like NATO's aggression
[24:49.600 --> 24:56.920]  and he doesn't like Western backed coups in Ukraine going against the will of the people
[24:56.920 --> 25:04.360]  to be more aligned with Russia than the West but why does he always invade and make moves
[25:04.360 --> 25:08.960]  when Joe Biden is in the White House is that because he knows Joe Biden is weak and is
[25:08.960 --> 25:16.040]  not going to do anything or is something else going on with that but see you never really
[25:16.040 --> 25:23.480]  hear that aspect of it do you know because Joe Biden is the good guy and he's the he's
[25:23.480 --> 25:29.320]  the strong man standing up to Putin really because every time Joe Biden's in the White
[25:29.320 --> 25:34.560]  House Putin walks right into Ukraine with Russia but that's Joe Biden your tough guy
[25:34.560 --> 25:43.520]  he's standing up yeah no actually no actually Ukrainians are suffering greatly because of
[25:43.520 --> 25:50.160]  Joe Biden and Zelensky and there's been mixed numbers that that come out of Ukraine and
[25:50.160 --> 25:55.520]  how many Russians have died and how many Ukrainians have died but I mean high estimates are it's
[25:55.520 --> 26:00.400]  looking like about a quarter million people have died in the war so far one year in probably
[26:00.400 --> 26:08.520]  mostly Ukrainians but Joe Biden's the strong man he's the good guy he's standing up to
[26:08.520 --> 26:17.320]  Putin or is it that Putin realizes that Donald Trump had the same disposition generally speaking
[26:17.320 --> 26:25.280]  towards NATO as Putin did and if you want to really get down to the brass tax here ladies
[26:25.280 --> 26:33.920]  and gentlemen NATO needs to be shut down there is no use for NATO anymore and Donald Trump
[26:33.920 --> 26:43.680]  understood that and he said look why is the United States spending all of this money on
[26:43.680 --> 26:51.680]  NATO and we get nothing in return nothing and if you look at what's happened in the
[26:51.680 --> 27:00.000]  last year in Ukraine ask yourself this what has NATO done what is NATO's purpose now of
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.320]  course Ukraine is not a NATO nation so it shouldn't even matter but that's what this
[27:04.320 --> 27:11.440]  whole struggle is over so how much money has the United States spent into NATO in the last
[27:11.440 --> 27:18.760]  10 years and what have we got to show for it a big fat nothing except a bill for hundreds
[27:18.760 --> 27:27.040]  of millions probably billions of dollars and now because of this obsession with NATO and
[27:27.040 --> 27:39.520]  whatever Victorian Newland and Hunter Biden were doing with 46 bio weapons labs in Ukraine
[27:39.520 --> 27:47.320]  and so again Putin didn't feel the need to counter NATO aggression Putin didn't feel
[27:47.320 --> 27:54.480]  the need to counter Western aggression in Ukraine when Trump was president because Trump
[27:54.480 --> 28:02.200]  wanted to ratchet it down Trump wanted to stop funding it that's not Trump and Putin
[28:02.200 --> 28:07.880]  colluding that's Donald Trump being an American president saying why am I funding NATO it
[28:07.880 --> 28:15.080]  does nothing for me and all these NATO countries of ours these allies that don't pay anywhere
[28:15.080 --> 28:26.880]  near the amount we pay give us nothing in return nothing oh what about strategic this
[28:26.880 --> 28:37.560]  what about military that for what do we really want a war with Russia over Ukraine do we
[28:37.560 --> 28:54.000]  really want the fate of the planet potentially to hinge on Vladimir Zelensky a puppet a leather

[33:32.240 --> 33:42.040]  the american blood and treasure to be spilled and lost in Ukraine truly disgusting and I
[33:42.040 --> 33:47.520]  just feel bad for the people of Ukraine that are really going to suffer the most from this
[33:47.520 --> 33:53.480]  and that's perhaps the biggest lie of this whole thing that somehow supporting Zelensky
[33:53.480 --> 33:57.200]  and fighting a war against Russia is going to help the people of Ukraine no ladies and
[33:57.200 --> 34:02.520]  gentlemen the country is going to be completely devastated and destroyed in many places and
[34:02.520 --> 34:11.280]  and probably half a million will die when this thing is said and done years from now
[34:11.280 --> 34:19.800]  so I want to stop waxing here and start getting into the headlines and tying it into does
[34:19.800 --> 34:28.040]  the situation the latest developments with Ukraine and the and the and the leaning potential
[34:28.040 --> 34:33.440]  towards world war three with China getting involved is this why we're now hearing about
[34:33.440 --> 34:44.120]  the Wuhan lab leak for the origin of COVID-19 well why are they telling you it now we'll
[34:44.120 --> 34:49.600]  be discussing that in the third hour with dr. Andrew Huff now before I move on and get

[35:59.800 --> 36:06.720]  and of course I've I'd trank I basically chugged from a bottle of rainforest ultra before going
[36:06.720 --> 36:14.040]  on air it's true I chugged from it a little bit more than the recommended two droppers
[36:14.040 --> 36:20.960]  I did a little bit of a chug but that's okay it's okay I'm able to do that all right not
[36:20.960 --> 36:25.680]  recommending that but hey you know what maybe like doing that too but I don't go on air without
[36:25.680 --> 36:33.040]  brain force plus and or brain force ultra brain force ultra the liquid tincture brain
[36:33.040 --> 36:41.280]  force plus in the capsule whichever one works for you but I gotta say if you're a student
[36:41.280 --> 36:46.960]  listening to this or you're a parent of a student and you're hearing about you need
[36:46.960 --> 36:52.920]  drugs for your ADD or your ADHD or this or that folks don't don't go down that route
[36:52.920 --> 36:58.160]  don't go down the prescription drug route I would say at least give brain force ultra
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.720]  or brain force plus a try before you go down that route because it's all natural organic
[37:03.720 --> 37:09.320]  ingredients not going to give you the jitters not going to get you hooked but is going to
[37:09.320 --> 37:16.080]  give you the mental energy focus clarity to to study for a big exam prepare for a big
[37:16.080 --> 37:21.880]  presentation whatever the case may be and that's basically what I do I mean you talk
[37:21.880 --> 37:25.680]  about a three-hour radio show or if you do two in a day like I'm going to today well
[37:25.680 --> 37:32.880]  that's basically a six-hour presentation so yeah brain force ultra is my go-to exclusively
[37:32.880 --> 37:37.720]  available at infowarestore.com and we are listener supported and because of that we're
[37:37.720 --> 37:42.800]  able to tell you the truth about the origins of COVID-19 and tell you the truth about
[37:42.800 --> 37:52.600]  the vaccines because we don't get big pharmaceutical billions so they can control our content
[37:52.600 --> 38:03.480]  that's not how we roll here now I just when I look at the immediate landscape in the last
[38:03.480 --> 38:15.960]  24 hours or really since Monday actually I would say I turn on CNN Monday night they're
[38:15.960 --> 38:24.000]  reporting that COVID-19 came out of a Wuhan lab I turn on MSNBC Monday night they're reporting
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  that COVID-19 came out of a Wuhan lab folks we're talking three years three years after
[38:32.000 --> 38:40.320]  the story now they're reporting on it telling you it came out of a lab in China now clearly
[38:40.320 --> 38:46.480]  there's an agenda afoot clearly a message has gone out to all the mainstream news and
[38:46.480 --> 38:53.600]  this is when you'll know you're getting hit with a massive propaganda campaign is if
[38:53.600 --> 38:59.600]  this weekend during their weekend news specials you know ABC CBS and all this other stuff
[38:59.600 --> 39:05.720]  if they do all their weekend news specials on COVID-19 coming out of Wuhan then you know
[39:05.720 --> 39:13.960]  there is a massive propaganda campaign afoot that there is a agenda behind and my best rational
[39:13.960 --> 39:20.920]  thinking is that China's involvement in the war in Ukraine and backing Russia and geopolitically
[39:20.920 --> 39:28.080]  aligning with Russia now is the reason why the US media and the US government wants to
[39:28.080 --> 39:36.960]  blame China for the lab leak now think about how disgusting this is they knew at the time
[39:36.960 --> 39:43.160]  it came out of Wuhan and they covered it up because Fauci's involvement the NIH is involvement
[39:43.160 --> 39:46.520]  which we have all the proof of by the way I'll get into it with the news stories we have
[39:46.520 --> 39:52.760]  today they knew it for three years now they want to report on it why because they're in
[39:52.760 --> 39:57.800]  a geopolitical standoff with China over the war in Ukraine not because they actually care
[39:57.800 --> 40:03.000]  about the origins not because they actually want China to have to pay for it but because
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.440]  they're in a geopolitical face off with China in Ukraine now and so now they're gonna tell
[40:08.440 --> 40:16.800]  you about the Wuhan lab leak now they're gonna tell you about COVID-19 and these Democrats
[40:16.800 --> 40:26.920]  and the American media are so corrupt I don't even know how you can possibly analyze this
[40:26.920 --> 40:32.680]  any better than Tucker Carlson did I mean he could do a three hour presentation on I mean
[40:32.680 --> 40:42.680]  seriously three hours six hours 10 hours 24 hours how much content could you compile
[40:42.680 --> 40:50.220]  and put together of the mainstream media and the US government telling you it did not come
[40:50.220 --> 40:57.840]  out of Wuhan lab they scolded Donald Trump for suggesting it came out of Wuhan they sit
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.240]  their members to press conferences saying don't say it came out of Wuhan it didn't come out
[41:02.240 --> 41:08.800]  of Wuhan the American media scolding you big tech censoring you you're not allowed to
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.720]  say it came out of China you're not allowed to talk about the Wuhan lab leak theory it's
[41:13.720 --> 41:20.600]  fake news it's false your band you're censored you're bad oh now three years later they're
[41:20.600 --> 41:25.640]  all telling you it came out of Wuhan the same people that censored you for saying it came
[41:25.640 --> 41:30.600]  out of Wuhan the same people that called you a liar for saying it came out of Wuhan for
[41:30.600 --> 41:37.840]  years and they have no shame they have no shame at all they have no spine they have
[41:37.840 --> 41:44.760]  no soul they are completely corrupted that they can now tell you with a straight face
[41:44.760 --> 41:49.840]  that COVID-19 came out of a Wuhan lab when for three years they said it didn't and that
[41:49.840 --> 41:54.680]  was a lie and you should be censored if you say that and if you're a doctor you should
[41:54.680 --> 42:02.240]  have your license removed and with no shame they go up with a straight face now and tell
[42:02.240 --> 42:10.800]  you that it came out of a Wuhan lab now there's all kinds of different angles to this because
[42:10.800 --> 42:18.400]  how can they walk this tightrope without burning their own how can they report on the Wuhan
[42:18.400 --> 42:22.560]  lab now without burning Anthony Fauci how can they report on the Wuhan lab now without
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.960]  burning the NIH how can they report on the Wuhan lab now without burning the eco health
[42:26.960 --> 42:34.360]  alliance Peter Dossick Bill Gates Barack Obama and everybody else that was involved
[42:34.360 --> 42:45.920]  with the Wuhan Institute of Virology doing gain of function research that now they say
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.200]  led to the largest pandemic in world history how are they going to walk that tightrope
[42:50.200 --> 43:00.320]  of not taking the blame and the punishment themselves while they're admitting it now
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.760]  ladies and gentlemen this book the great reset and worth the world is a historic book that
[43:04.760 --> 43:09.920]  documents the global to their own words plan for our future that is a hellish future now

[44:06.400 --> 44:11.520]  you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States he doesn't care that's
[44:11.520 --> 44:16.280]  not his job he's not the president of the United States he's a puppet operating for
[44:16.280 --> 44:18.800]  the globalist.
[44:18.800 --> 44:25.440]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased they must be opposed and that's who he works
[44:25.440 --> 44:26.440]  with.
[44:26.440 --> 44:31.200]  Autocrats only understand one word no no no.
[44:31.200 --> 44:37.280]  Exactly and that's why we say no to your vaccines we say no to you shutting down our
[44:37.280 --> 44:43.120]  businesses we say no to you taking our firearms we say no to you censoring our free speech
[44:43.120 --> 44:48.080]  we say no to you selling us out to the world health organization we say no to you getting
[44:48.080 --> 44:53.200]  us into world war three you're right we stand against autocrats like you Joe Biden and we
[44:53.200 --> 44:59.800]  say no and we say no to your war.
[44:59.800 --> 45:04.240]  Every time I talk to you you're either like on the border exposing the cartels in like
[45:04.240 --> 45:08.040]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[45:08.040 --> 45:12.320]  addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.120]  are you addicted to the danger Savannah have you ever considered that for a second?
[45:16.120 --> 45:21.160]  No I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans I'm addicted to spreading the truth and again
[45:21.160 --> 45:25.720]  I have info wars to thank for that looking back on the day I was able to ask President
[45:25.720 --> 45:31.040]  Donald Trump two questions I was so grateful because you know I truly was classically trained
[45:31.040 --> 45:35.600]  under Alex Jones and under the info wars team and I really do credit that as to why I'm
[45:35.600 --> 45:41.080]  able to you know get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality was you know
[45:41.080 --> 45:46.280]  go where the story is go where the mainstream media refuses to so it's not that I'm addicted
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.640]  to the insanity I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people
[45:50.640 --> 45:54.680]  and I really do credit Alex for you know living and selling that within me early on in my
[45:54.680 --> 45:59.680]  career.

[47:16.400 --> 47:26.760]  no it didn't come out of a wuhan lab no no how dare you you're silenced you're censored
[47:26.760 --> 47:35.440]  you're a racist to it came out of wuhan lab in china china bad now this is breaking right
[47:35.440 --> 47:45.120]  now before I get into these headlines a massive fire yes the domestic disasters continue the
[47:45.120 --> 47:51.760]  infrastructure collapse continues we told you this would be the story for the year we
[47:51.760 --> 47:55.560]  told you this would be the trend for the year and now it's every day what new domestic
[47:55.560 --> 48:03.560]  disaster is going to come across the news feed massive fire at a metal processing plant
[48:03.560 --> 48:14.320]  in Ohio and it's actually a giant silly that supplier of metals or the entire planet so
[48:14.320 --> 48:20.480]  it's just every day a new fire every day infrastructure collapsing and so that story is breaking right
[48:20.480 --> 48:26.640]  now I we have the footage but it's not on the screen but you can see it there it is
[48:26.640 --> 48:34.480]  right there this is just outside of Cleveland many different angles of this metal plant
[48:34.480 --> 48:40.600]  on fire so there you go it's a new domestic disaster every day you're in the dystopian
[48:40.600 --> 48:48.200]  future you're in the new world order you're in democrat run america this is just the
[48:48.200 --> 48:56.600]  new normal this is just the new normal for you and they think that the people are so
[48:56.600 --> 49:03.320]  stupid that they can say nope didn't come out of china you're a racist if you say that
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.880]  that's fake news to them telling you it came out of china and acting like it wasn't them
[49:07.880 --> 49:16.280]  telling you it didn't now here's some of the headlines where are the anti-big pharmaceutical
[49:16.280 --> 49:22.080]  liberals out there it's funny they just as soon as they realized their hypocrite they
[49:22.080 --> 49:28.920]  just act like they were never something so I remember going around in 2015 and interviewing
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.880]  liberals that were anti-big pharma because one of their big reasons they supported bernie
[49:33.880 --> 49:38.360]  sanders was he didn't take money from big pharma now actually that wasn't true bernie sanders
[49:38.360 --> 49:43.160]  did take millions of dollars from big pharma but they believed he didn't and when I brought
[49:43.160 --> 49:46.760]  it up and I showed them hey actually bernie sanders did take money from big pharma they
[49:46.760 --> 49:52.000]  got really sour because being anti-big pharma used to be a big leftist progressive democrat
[49:52.000 --> 49:59.560]  stance but now big pharma owns them and so they love that the big pharma so I'm guessing
[49:59.560 --> 50:08.440]  they won't be complaining about this dr anthony fauci increased personal wealth from 7.6 million
[50:08.440 --> 50:15.800]  to 12.6 million during the pandemic a 65 increase in wealth and this is mainstream news folks
[50:17.080 --> 50:24.760]  and an investigator adam as drew juski who's been investigating fauci's finances
[50:24.760 --> 50:33.960]  was breaking this down on fox business where are the audits into anthony fauci's riches
[50:35.240 --> 50:44.440]  remember it was rand paul that asked fauci and this story broke last week actually that
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.640]  and I don't think I have it on my stack today but last week
[50:47.640 --> 50:56.200]  fizer and other big pharmaceutical companies were giving hundreds of millions of dollars
[50:56.200 --> 51:05.000]  in kickbacks to fauci's programs inside the nih or whatever government bureaucracies he was running
[51:05.640 --> 51:09.400]  hundreds of millions of dollars from big pharma in kickbacks
[51:09.400 --> 51:22.120]  wow wow what an amazing what an amazing feat fauci helps fund and operate a lab
[51:22.760 --> 51:28.440]  that designs a virus that is extremely contagious that comes out of the lab
[51:29.880 --> 51:34.920]  and then fauci assumes more power he's ever had in his life once his virus gets released
[51:34.920 --> 51:42.840]  and then fauci gets to tell you what protocols to follow which he tells you to take his drug
[51:44.440 --> 51:48.520]  and then he tells you you got to take a vaccine if you want to go back to having your life
[51:48.520 --> 51:54.200]  and opening your business which he gets kickbacks from the companies that make the vaccine I mean
[51:54.200 --> 52:00.520]  this is as criminal as it gets as cut and dry criminally obvious as it can possibly get but
[52:00.520 --> 52:06.760]  but he gets protected by the mainstream media and the government's not interested in auditing his
[52:06.760 --> 52:12.520]  wealth they're going to come for your bartender your waitress down the street because they're
[52:12.520 --> 52:18.920]  getting paid in tips and cash in the irs well they got to get there cut see government's got to get
[52:18.920 --> 52:33.000]  there cut fda advisors recommend world's first rsv vaccine from phizer so don't you see phizer pays
[52:33.000 --> 52:39.160]  off the government and then the government makes you take a phizer product that fascism is that
[52:39.160 --> 52:48.840]  collusion or that just liberal six-time vaccinated mask obsessed doctor confused by being reinfected
[52:48.840 --> 52:56.520]  with covid every time she gets a vaccine i shouldn't laugh it's sad but i mean at a certain level
[52:56.520 --> 53:04.200]  it's like if you can't figure it out well you know nothing i can do for you mrna vaccines contain
[53:04.200 --> 53:10.040]  dna that can turn human cells into permanent spike protein factories according to a new study
[53:11.080 --> 53:16.600]  the mrna covid vaccines from phizer and maderna contain billions of particles of self-replicating
[53:16.600 --> 53:23.000]  dna that can turn human cells into permanent factories for the covid-19 spike protein ah yes
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.360]  also reported by info wars three years ago with our great doctor guests telling us exactly this
[53:28.360 --> 53:35.880]  would happen take that vaccine though safe and effective take that vaccine it's mandatory and
[53:35.880 --> 53:39.480]  they gave you that little card remember that little card i mean they really wanted you to
[53:39.480 --> 53:43.400]  they wanted to kill you with that thing they wanted you to take six seven eight nine ten
[53:43.400 --> 53:47.800]  of these things until your heart blows up until you become a spike protein virus factory
[53:49.400 --> 53:56.680]  and uh well they didn't get what they wanted but they're going to come back for sure they're
[53:56.680 --> 54:02.760]  going to come back and maybe that's why they want you to think that the virus came out of a lab now
[54:02.760 --> 54:13.240]  maybe it's like a fear tactic is it a scarier virus if it's made as a weapon as a biological weapon
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.040]  in a lab is that scarier than if it came from a bat in a soup in a bowl of soup like they wanted
[54:18.040 --> 54:23.240]  you to think is it scarier to think it was made in a lab as a weapon maybe that's why they're
[54:23.240 --> 54:28.520]  doing it why is the previously dismissed claim that covid originated in china now being accepted
[54:28.520 --> 54:35.560]  as fact three years later fbi director chris ray nonchalantly admits covid 19 virus likely came
[54:35.560 --> 54:46.280]  from a lab leak in china and so china is trying to to to squelch this ccp threatens elon musk
[54:46.280 --> 54:52.440]  warns him against promoting wuhan lab leak the ccp doesn't really like elon musk by the way
[54:52.440 --> 55:02.760]  they're not a big fan so okay now the world health organization releases this report
[55:04.600 --> 55:11.800]  the world health organization moves forward with plans to target misinformation and disinformation
[55:11.800 --> 55:17.160]  under international law and and this is what joe biden just signed us on to by the way
[55:17.160 --> 55:20.760]  and then mitch mcconnell the other day said we don't we're not a sovereign nation anymore
[55:20.760 --> 55:25.080]  i we should probably repoll that clip i believe it was from sunday night or monday
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.640]  mitch mcconnell saying the u.s. is no longer a sovereign nation and that's a good thing wow
[55:31.640 --> 55:35.000]  no it was like it barely even made a ripple and that's just because mitch mcconnell is such a
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.040]  non-factor mitch mcconnell is such a zero he's a democrat so i mean he says stuff no republicans
[55:40.040 --> 55:46.600]  listen we know what he is but yeah i mean that's kind of a big statement the leader of the republicans
[55:46.600 --> 55:50.280]  in the senate mitch mcconnell saying we're no longer a sovereign nation we're sold out to the
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.680]  globalist oh well at least mitch mcconnell is being honest but oh it's the world health organization
[55:55.400 --> 56:01.240]  that joe biden just signed us on to that mitch mcconnell confirmed the global
[56:01.240 --> 56:05.400]  unelected health agency the world health organization is marching forward with its plans
[56:05.400 --> 56:10.120]  to make amendments to the international health regulations which would give it a new far-reaching
[56:10.120 --> 56:14.920]  powers to counter misinformation and disinformation folks this is what's so dangerous now and i i
[56:14.920 --> 56:22.360]  they could be ramping up another iris any day now with biden just signing us over to the who
[56:22.360 --> 56:27.240]  the who saying oh we're gonna have misinformation disinformation and now they're gonna have
[56:27.240 --> 56:34.680]  dictatorial power in the united states and they'll pull doctors licenses and they'll shut down clinics
[56:34.680 --> 56:38.520]  and they'll censor people that say what they're not allowed to according to the new
[56:38.520 --> 56:46.200]  unelected world health organization but wait a second but wait a second we've done this before
[56:47.080 --> 56:57.880]  this is not new i'm i'm having a deja vu moment right now the world health organization already
[56:57.880 --> 57:04.360]  targeted misinformation and disinformation and you know what it was that covet 19 came out of a
[57:04.360 --> 57:15.720]  wuhan lab ah ah so were they wrong about that or is this just full 1984 where on tuesday one
[57:15.720 --> 57:22.040]  plus one equals two on wednesday one plus one equals three on thursday one plus one equals four
[57:22.040 --> 57:27.160]  and on friday one plus one equals one in other words the truth is whatever the state and the
[57:27.160 --> 57:33.000]  government say it is so it was misinformation and disinformation to say covet 19 came out of
[57:33.000 --> 57:45.640]  wuhan lab now three years later it's mainstream news make four well fiction again i am in 1984

[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:23.720]  eyes every day and it's really so bad you wonder how we recover from this outside of just complete
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:30.040]  collapse or annihilation quite frankly because turning this thing around at this point is is
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:38.200]  such a difficult enterprise such a difficult adventure i mean you've got political prisoners
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.400]  i mean hell i could talk about the Uighurs in china you could talk about all the injustices
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.240]  around the world but just looking here in america the leader of the free world where we're supposed
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:57.960]  to be a land of justice and yet you have political prisoners being held nonviolent most of them just
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:04.920]  innocent completely being held in jail cells for years veterans doctors mothers fathers
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:12.360]  grandmothers grandparents teachers being held in jail for years as if they're somehow criminals
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.920]  nonviolent offenders most of them completely innocent of anything
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:25.400]  and yet the people that make viruses in labs that get released and kill millions of people
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.200]  according to their own data they're above them they don't have to worry about that
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.120]  and the people that lied to all of you about it they don't have to worry about that either
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:43.240]  that is such a grave injustice that it is truly scary if injustice is that
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:53.080]  bold can exist it just it just shows where we're going and how how close everything is to becoming
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:02:04.680]  total dystopian tyranny now here's dr marty makari talking about how you weren't allowed to talk about
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:10.040]  the lab league theory three years ago oh but now they want you to accept it as fact and hear that
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:17.960]  is in clip one thank you congresswoman the reason this is even an issue is that it's embarrassing
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.240]  we funded the lab if we had not funded the lab a hundred percent of americans would say this is
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:28.680]  obvious this is a no-brainer the epicenter of the world is five miles from one of the only
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:34.920]  high-level virology labs in china the doctors initially were arrested and forced to sign
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:42.760]  non-disclosure gag documents the lab reports have been destroyed they've not been turned over the
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:49.080]  sequences reported from the lab to the NIH database were deleted by a request from chinese
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:54.600]  scientists that called over early on and said delete those sequences we put in the database
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:02.360]  and two leading virologists maybe the two top virologists in the united states
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:09.960]  dr michael farzon from scripts and dr robert gary from tulane told dr fouchy on his emergency
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:16.600]  call in january of 2020 when he was scrambling soon after learning that the NIH was funding the lab
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:24.520]  they both said that it was likely from the lab both scientists changed their tunes days later
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:30.040]  in the media and then both scientists received nine million dollars subsequent in funding from
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.840]  the NIH it's a no-brainer that it came from the lab i mean at this point it's impossible to acquire
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:43.240]  any more information and if you did it would only be affirmative that's just incredible to think
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.560]  and there's more out there about this as well fouchy needs to be arrested and this is just out of
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:55.400]  control the libertarian party also reporting on this you don't really get much nothing from the
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:01.400]  democrat some republicans the man on the left is christian anderson a british scientist who emailed
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:09.320]  fouchy on january 31st 2020 saying the virus looks lab made the man on the right is christian anderson
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:16.120]  the guy who fouchy called on february 1st 2020 and ordered to publicly say it wasn't lab made which
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:22.040]  he did fouchy then gave him a 1.8 million dollar grant plus 16 and a half million in funding fouchy
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:31.400]  buying off scientists buying off their silence criminal arrest him now right now where is anthony
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:38.040]  fouchy if the answer is not in jail then it's the wrong answer oh but john stewart's complaining
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.840]  john stewart reflects on being canceled by left after promoting covet lab leak on steven colbert's
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:48.760]  show oh that's funny john imagine being alex jones imagine being oan schreuer dr francis
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.960]  voil in our all of our guests that said this in 2020 before you years before you and we got
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:02.360]  canceled and slandered and attacked and lied about ladies and gentlemen this book the great
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.000]  reset in the world is a historic book that documents the globals and their own words
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.200]  planned for our future that is a hellish future now you'll be always while they still allow books
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.640]  i guess they're starting to ban them be able to get an unsigned copy of the great reset in the

[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:08.120]  and thank you for your support from the front lines of the information war it's owin shroyer
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:20.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show okay why why is the corrupt american media and our corrupt
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:30.360]  politicians and bureaucrats now telling us that covet 19 came out of a wuhan lab now i'm not claiming
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:36.840]  to have the answer i my best guess the only logical analysis that i can have is that
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:43.080]  that because china is backing russia and because china is aligning itself geopolitically with russia
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.160]  now which is by the way thanks to the west that that's all thanks to nato that's all thanks to joe
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:52.360]  biden it didn't have to be that way it's like you know i made the analogy earlier i think it
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:07:01.160]  still stands this is like if you had the prom queen and she actually likes you the prom queen
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:06.520]  actually wants to dance with you the prom queen actually wants to go home with you but instead
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.800]  you decide to be a jerk to the prom queen and she goes home with with the other guy she dances
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.280]  with the other guy even though she wanted to be with you but but you you were rude you were a
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.080]  jerk and so you shoved her into the other guy's arms and that's basically what we did with russia
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.440]  and and now they're going into the arms of china they didn't want to really go into the arms of
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.840]  china they would rather be dancing with us but we were rude we were mean and after all they do
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:38.440]  want to dance at their prom so they're going to dance with china so my only logical conclusion is
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:46.680]  they're now blaming the covet 19 pandemic on china as a response to china backing russia
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:54.280]  in ukraine and just in larger geopolitical issues i can't figure any other reason why they would be
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.200]  doing this now it's not like they want to burn fouchy it's not like they want to burn eco health
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.920]  alliance it's not like they want to burn themselves with the hundreds of millions spent to silence
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:10.840]  doctors and do gain a function research that was illegal by the way now if you think about that
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:20.280]  that tells you how serious this situation is with russia that they're willing to potentially burn
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.840]  some of their highest operatives and agents i mean folks we're talking about anthony fouchy
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:30.200]  this guy ran the age pandemic response that killed tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:36.360]  people that they made a whole movie about dallas buyer's club anthony fouchy the bad guy in the
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:42.840]  movie where the characters view the government as mass murderers that was anthony fouchy and now
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.640]  he's back again with the covet 19 and making the virus in the lab and telling you to mask and telling
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.480]  you to take a deadly vaccine so i mean this is a top agent anthony fouchy is a true top globalist
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:03.080]  agent a true top globalist criminal i mean he is he is at the table with specter he is he is running
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:10.200]  their programs they don't want to burn him they don't want to get into a a standoff with him think
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:17.560]  about all the dirt and blackmail and skeletons he can expose so that just shows you how serious
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:24.760]  this situation in russia and ukraine is and and how much of a threat it is that china is aligning
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:31.320]  itself with russia folks that's serious stuff that they're willing to potentially burn their own
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:39.480]  top agents and their own top criminal enterprises of biological weapons being made in order to have
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:48.120]  a geopolitical standoff against china supporting russia i mean that's that's big and they're still
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.840]  giving china an out because they're they're playing this a little back and forth game
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:59.000]  the biden administration saying well we're not so sure it actually came out of wuhan so so they're
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:06.200]  basically like hey look china we can change the narrative and blame this on you and and who knows
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.280]  if there's any real pressure there china probably doesn't care less quite frankly they could blame
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.600]  it on china they could expose the whole thing and china's like we don't care china the the chinese
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.760]  communists already have complete control of china they don't need to play these stupid little games
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:24.680]  with our corrupt media and our corrupt politicians they don't care so i don't think it's really
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:30.280]  gonna matter to china you could blame china tomorrow and they'll say so what the biden
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:35.160]  administration could come out and blame china they'll say so what the world health organization
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:42.040]  is not going to blame china bill gates is not going to blame china so this is all a biden
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:50.040]  democrat geopolitical standoff against china threatening china will blame you for the pandemic
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.600]  and and and you know what china is going to do nothing they're going to balk and say go ahead
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.000]  and then you're going to have biden and the democrats and the mainstream media sitting
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.360]  with egg on their face yet again because we don't have serious leaders
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.240]  i don't like jijin ping i don't like the chinese communists but they're serious leaders
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:20.120]  they're not a joke joe biden is a joke he's not a serious leader what do they tell you
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:27.800]  we've got the gayest white house ever oh it's so gay oh it's so black it's so diverse it's so
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:36.360]  immigrant it's so gay oh whoops whoo congratulations whoops whoop whoop do you guys are gay
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:46.760]  whoo yay the white house is gay all right congratulations you like to you like to put
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:55.240]  things in and other guys uh you know cavities yay let's celebrate how gay we are yay green gene
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:02.760]  pier likes to scissor whoo korean gene pier likes to scissor and pete bootage edge likes sodomy
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:13.160]  yay whoo it's so much fun yeah yeah you can say putin is corrupt he's a serious leader
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:19.240]  you can say the chinese communists are corrupt they're serious people they don't run around
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.240]  playing tiddlywinks they don't run around sticking their fingers in their in in each other's orifices
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:31.800]  and then telling you how great they are for doing it so
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.040]  the whole thing is collapsing really the the the entire western power structure is collapsing
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:45.400]  which is sad i mean it's totally corrupt but folks are are standing in the world is going away
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:53.720]  it's it is depleting quickly geopolitically we are sliding down the totem pole
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.400]  faster than pete bootage edge on a on a on a greased pole
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:07.240]  and the leaders of the world outside of the west outside of the united states have no
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:12.600]  respect they don't care how gay korean gene pier is they don't care how gay pete butt plug is
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:19.720]  they don't care nobody cares but they just think it's all oh let's dance around in gay flags and
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:25.160]  let's talk about how diverse we are we're so great and they're getting laps run around them
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:32.600]  geopolitically and they can't even it's like a blur they can't even keep up these are not serious
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:41.960]  people so this standoff of oh we're going to make sure you get the blame china we're going to make
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:50.040]  sure that china gets the blame for the pandemic will not matter it will not matter it is not
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:56.840]  going to make a difference anywhere now they might burn their own in the process i mean seriously
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.040]  if they really want to push this fauchy's going to go to jail if they really want to take this to
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:08.280]  the limit if they really want to get down to the origins of cobit 19 uh their players are going to
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:16.440]  go to jail the chinese will have no problem now the chinese communists are denying that it came
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.000]  out of the lab so that hasn't changed but there could be a day where it changes and they would say
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.160]  you know what yeah we we have biological weapons labs you guys funded it thank you oops how's that
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:38.360]  going to play so the only reason i can see as to why they're telling you cobit 19 came out of a lab
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:49.320]  is basically a a threat against china that china is going to laugh at that china is going to piss
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.600]  on and and wipe their butts with and the the escalation is on major escalation drone attacks
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.960]  strike deep inside russia targeting nation's oil industry oh who blew up the pipeline who's
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:10.600]  attacking them now zalinsky says that americans are going to have to spend their blood and
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:16.360]  treasure in ukraine to protect ukraine really zalinsky what would you do for us iran can make
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.560]  fissile material for a bomb in about 12 days so i ran getting a little more serious in this
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:29.080]  but folks there is a back and forth going on inside the government and i pulled this story up
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:35.400]  just as an example showdown before the fbi raid at mara lago agents and prosecutors argued over
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.200]  trump folks it's going back and forth with the war and and some of the generals it's going back
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.600]  and forth with the political persecution of trump supporters and some of the agents and prosecutors so
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:50.680]  so the the answer all this is good americans need to stand up rise up and do the right thing
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.800]  in the face of of all of this otherwise we're going to lose everything
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.960]  right now i'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com

[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:08.040]  us off the air but we're still here every day kicking and screaming and fighting the globalist
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:15.480]  new world order tyrants every day and we intend to as long as we are right here on the air so
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:23.480]  shopping at infowarstore.com is what makes it all possible now i gotta tell you
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:30.760]  whenever i'm out and about and i get recognized a lot of times people want to tell me about the
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:36.680]  products and which ones were great for them and the the impacts they had on their lives or their
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:44.280]  families and recently for whatever reason i'm getting people talking about the cbd the full
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:51.400]  spectrum cbd just being the best out there and i am somebody that has been using supplements for a
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:57.960]  long time i use a lot of the info wars supplements and products but i'm not i don't i've never done
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:03.480]  the cbd full spectrum stuff so i'm not really commenting on this because of personal experience
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:12.920]  but i can tell you this is the product i hear about more than any other product now and it's
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:18.040]  coming from people who have been using different cbd products for years now they've been popular for
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:23.320]  years now and it's from people that have been using cbd products some people even selling them
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:29.640]  themselves and they come up in this and they tell me they say oh and the cbd spectrum you guys
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:34.440]  sell at infowarstore.com is the best on the market i sell them i'm telling you it's the best or i've
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:41.000]  used them all i'm telling you it's the best so usually i like to talk about the products that
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.200]  i use that i like because it's easy for me to do that but i can't ignore the fact that i hear about
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:54.040]  the cbd full spectrum at infowarstore.com now more than any other product when people recognize me
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:59.880]  and they want to talk about the supplements so it's the real deal and of course we've had
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.680]  mike adams and others that have analyzed it in labs saying no yeah this is the most powerful on
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:10.760]  the market by the way it's at the lowest price so that's what we do at infowarstore.com with all

[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:33.160]  i couldn't believe it i couldn't believe it we played it in the fourth hour yesterday i thought
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:40.440]  there's no way this is real this has to be deep fake but it was real joe biden talking about a nurse
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:46.280]  whispering sweet nothings into his ear i'm not even kidding you maybe we should play it again joe
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:52.600]  biden slurs invents a new language in virginia speech it's getting worse it's getting worse
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:01.000]  and uh he keeps telling me how great the economy is by the way which is just not true i've got the
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.480]  evidence is this the clip guys do we have it ready biden repeats bizarre story about nurse who rubbed
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:13.160]  his face and whispered sweet nothings into his ear this is real this is this is your president joe
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:20.520]  biden who's gonna who's gonna lead us through a war with russia here's joe biden yesterday you
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:26.600]  can't even believe this but it's real and pearl melson military she'd come in and do things that i
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.960]  don't think you learn the medical school nursing school what she whispered in my ear like then
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.760]  couldn't understand him she whispered she'd lean down he'd actually breathe on me to make sure that
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:43.560]  i was there was a connection the human connection she went home and brought back her pillow joe
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:55.400]  that's not a nurse joe that wasn't a nurse joe that wasn't a doctor joe joe that was a hooker joe
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:03.160]  that was hunter stripper that was hunter's escort but imagine now this this this doctor this nurse
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:08.520]  he's talking about i don't know maybe she likes it but apparently she's whispering sweet nothings
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:19.640]  into his ear joe let's go brandon oh that gets me off baby i'm joe biden i wonder how joe
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:25.640]  dr jill feels about that she's in africa what about that student loan though what about that
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:33.960]  student loan promise joe biden student loan bailout plan in danger in danger it was never
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:43.720]  it was never real he lied to you that dirt bag and he knew it you know i feel bad for those suckers
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.360]  i don't know part of me part of me feels bad another part of me just says screw them the suckers
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.960]  that fall for the lives of joe biden it's you know it's kind of like the devil on your shoulder
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:56.760]  the angel on your shoulder it's like the angel says hey they've been fooled they've been deceived
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.800]  they're victims of propaganda and then the devil on my shoulders like screw them they're so stupid
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.160]  they don't know he's a liar forget them let them let them burn intellectually
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:15.720]  oh you mean oh you mean joe biden can't just pay off your student debt wow who would who would have
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:21.320]  thought i guess he can't pay off my mortgage either i guess he can't pay off my credit card bill
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:26.840]  either i mean i guess we can't even pay off our nation's debt oh oh yeah we're what what are we
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.400]  50 trillion dollars in debt but he's gonna pay your student loans no he's not he just wanted
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:40.760]  you to vote for him he lied to you greatest economy ever jack 60 of americans live paycheck to
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:47.560]  paycheck inflation is part of their everyday laws and this is c n b c financial analysis here
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:55.000]  and and by the way folks the the numbers are not i mean it used to be kind of the the demarcation
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  line financially it's like if you're making 50 000 a year you're you're probably gonna be okay
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.680]  if you're making 50 000 a year you're gonna be able to have a roof over your head a car that's
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:12.520]  gonna start and you know be able to live a pretty comfortable life about 50 000 a year well now it's
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:18.360]  like 100 000 a year is where you gotta be and and this has happened in such a short span really it's
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:25.560]  happened in such a short short span just like that and and now if you're making six figures you're
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:30.280]  still living paycheck to paycheck that's biden's america but this is globalism that's the that's
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:35.800]  the larger issue because our politicians don't think americans should have the highest standard
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:39.800]  of living they think we should be brought back down to the standards of oh i don't know africa
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:45.400]  yeah mexican president says that mexico has more democracy than the united states
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.560]  well yeah i mean you know russians apparently steal our elections and biden apparently gets
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.800]  81 million votes but you can't find a single voter you can't have a rally you can't fill
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:02.440]  a high school broom closet and now here's the realization this is south park becoming true
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.480]  it just happens every day i can't even believe it i was watching this south park episode 10 years ago
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:12.920]  and now it's the reality many undocumented immigrants are departing after decades in the
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:18.920]  united states and so they're realizing that the whole the whole con of them coming here was just a
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:26.920]  trick and a trap and america is not the once great prosperous free nation that it once was
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:33.000]  and all the little handouts and the things they were told we're going to work out for them when
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:38.920]  they got here aren't happening and so they're going back to their home countries like mexico
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.480]  literally right out of a south park episode actually one of my favorite south park episodes
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:53.080]  of all time i think it's called um ontakia oh man what was that one called where all the
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.800]  mexicans go back home because they realize it's better there than america
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:05.960]  right now i'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com

[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:31.720]  interesting life choice but you've made it and so here we are now the mexican president
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:40.760]  as we just covered says that mexico has more democracy than the united states of america
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.560]  do you agree with him here's some of the headlines on that today
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:51.960]  leftist group caught running massive election bribery scheme in wisconsin supreme court race
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.880]  an alleged felony punishable by up to three years in prison this is an incredible story
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:03.560]  dan o'Donnell from news talk 1130 in wisconsin broke a huge report on a leftist bribery scandal
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:09.400]  operating in wisconsin before the upcoming state supreme court race this is where it gets wild
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:14.600]  and by the way you know if you've caught them doing this once they've been doing it forever
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:22.200]  liberal groups are paying voters $250 to sway their friends to vote for the leftist supreme
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:28.520]  court candidate janet prostitutes you try to pronounce that last name
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:35.320]  this amounts to election bribery a felony in wisconsin punishable by up to three years in
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:40.600]  prison but don't you know this is how the democrats operate they pay you but see they have their little
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:47.080]  they have their little loopholes and in around operations where they'll just pay you to promote
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:53.080]  democrat party propaganda on twitter they'll just pay you to promote vaccine propaganda on your social
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:59.240]  media and then people watching it think oh this is my friend oh this is a this is a neutral observer
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.680]  saying that this vaccine is good or saying this candidate is good and you just think oh that's
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.360]  just that's just neutral that's just a friend that's just somebody doing it oh no that's paid
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:18.680]  propaganda ah ah yes stacey abrams this is just what is going on here stacey abrams goes to
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:26.760]  nigeria as an election observer and then both major parties call for a do-over
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.400]  you got to learn the hard way not to trust a democrat with counting an election huh
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:38.520]  they learned that in nigeria real quickly by the way what happened to a jill biden's trip to africa
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:43.400]  remember she was the biden's secret weapon to go to africa and convince them not to support china
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:49.960]  let me tell you something uh if jill biden shows up to africa saying please don't support china
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.040]  guess what the african countries are going to do the next day after she leaves they're
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.960]  going to call china and say hey how you doing want to have a good relationship want to go out for dinner
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:06.200]  new database launched to help pressure states to clean up voter rolls now remember it's been
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:13.400]  discovered millions of illegal voters on the california voter rolls same thing in texas and these other
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.720]  states now they removed them in florida and now what do you know florida had a bunch of republicans
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.840]  win including a mayor of miami oh you clean up the voter rolls democrats don't win elections anymore
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:32.840]  so is this why the mexican president says that mexico has more democracy than the united states
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:44.760]  of america but hey we voted for john fetterman we got john fetterman who is not doing so well
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.320]  in fact we don't even know what his current condition is
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:54.840]  is pennsylvania republicans call on fetterman to appear on camera to prove he's alive and well
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:02.520]  or resign now again this is just more of the leftist lies the mainstream media propaganda
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:08.040]  fetterman's healthy fetterman's fine nothing to see here nothing to worry about look he wanted
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.120]  to bait he couldn't even talk when he was doing tv interviews he had to have an earpiece in and a
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.720]  teleprompter in front of him because he can't talk and he can't hear hey that's sad he's suffering
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:25.320]  from a major stroke i'm not celebrating that that's really a shame uh but it's his wife and the
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:31.320]  democrats that put him up to running for god knows what reason but i think we're figuring it out now
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.800]  by the way his wife dropped him off at the hospital and then left the country she's really nice she's
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:43.000]  really caring and concerning i mean what what a bitch but who's surprised now so why is john
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.160]  fetterman the ideal candidate for the democrat party now i told you this is their big new push
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:59.080]  is they want to promote candidates that are mentally ill so that they can have this new
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:06.760]  victim class of mentally ill just like a victim class of your gay or victim class of your black
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.520]  or victim class whatever it is you're a victim and so you should vote for this person they're a
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.000]  victim they deserve it they're a victim well now the new one is going to be this person's
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.800]  mentally ill they're a victim or in fetterman's case this person is mentally incapacitated
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:30.360]  vote for him but this is the ideal democrat candidate now because they can just control
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:37.480]  the entire party apparatus with a bunch of mentally ill or mentally incapacitated
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:43.880]  representatives and then they don't have to worry about people getting uppity like an aoc
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:50.840]  they don't have to worry about people leaving the democrat party like tulsi gabard or maybe even
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:57.880]  soon joe mansion they want the mentally incapacitated to represent them because then they can just
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:04.360]  control the party from the top down which is what they do that's why they rig all their primaries
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:08.280]  that's why hillary clinton won the primary that's why joe biden won the primary despite
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.240]  bernie sanders tulsi gabard andrew yang all these other candidates having much more support
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:21.720]  i went to the debates folks i saw it i mean even andrew yang had hundreds of people in the streets
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:31.560]  joe biden didn't have one i went to the democrat debates joe biden had no support none big crowds
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.960]  for gabard huge crowds for bernie sanders big crowds for yang even marian wiliamson had some
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:43.160]  people out there waving around crystal balls and crystal shards but not biden but somehow he wins
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:49.080]  every time somehow killery clinton wins every time not bernie sanders getting the actual numbers
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:53.720]  getting the actual rallies but the truth is bernie sanders doesn't want to win he wants to take your
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:41:01.080]  millions of dollars and then never work he's a bum but this is john fetterman the new ideal
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:07.160]  candidate for the democrats mentally incapacitated sitting in a hospital bed on life support and
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:13.080]  somehow still voting for all the democrat party policies when he can't talk he can't think he
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:18.760]  can't hear this is your new this is the new face of the democrat party you know he ran around
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.160]  chasing black people with a shotgun in his neighborhood just good old-fashioned democrat
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:29.480]  racism jim jordan asks why the department of justice hasn't appointed a special counsel for
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:38.280]  hunter biden well i mean we all know the answer to that right obviously white privilege oh
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:47.880]  oh is it white privilege or is it democrat privilege
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.200]  hmm i wonder what the good liberals out there are thinking why
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:42:00.280]  why has the department of justice not appointed a special counsel for hunter biden
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.760]  it must be his white privilege it must be hunter biden's affluence and white privilege
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:12.120]  that's keeping him from being above law i mean after all we've seen the laptop we've seen the
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:19.080]  images we've seen the emails we've seen the text 10 for pito joe 10 for the big guy pito joe
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:28.600]  why isn't there a special counsel to investigate hunter biden is it white privilege maybe hunter
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:34.760]  biden is like the drug dealer for dc i mean i'm just trying to make it make sense here
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:39.960]  white privilege democrat party privilege hunter biden the drug dealer maybe he's the pimp too
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:47.400]  i don't know i mean man just look at him there flaunting stuff how old are those girls in that
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:52.600]  video by the way did we ever get an age verification there how's hunter biden's um how's hunter biden's
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.160]  son doing that he doesn't invite to the christmas dinners or the white house how's that son does joe
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:03.880]  biden know about that ladies and gentlemen info wars has proven itself the last 28 years to be over

[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:37.000]  and it may be deadly at this point massive fire in buffalo new york could potentially be deadly
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.720]  it's just every day the new domestic disasters this is exactly what we warned would happen
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:49.000]  under biden's leadership but it's not just about that i mean that's just that's just a moment that's
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.800]  just an example it's just this is the collapse of the west this is the designed collapse and
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:48:00.280]  destruction of america and this is what's happened because people have been so dumbed down and

[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:13.640]  and it's sad it's sad to watch america collapse like this it's sad to watch our cities go to
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:19.720]  hell like this and these issues are just going to come to a head and get even more obvious and worse
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:27.400]  but my goodness you want to talk about brainwashing you want to talk about propaganda

[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:59.880]  are working on tracking where you shop what you eat where you travel and how you travel
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:08.760]  let me just break this down for you and i hope that this video 10 years from now
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:16.760]  now is not seen as prophetic but unless we change the course of human history this is
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:22.360]  exactly what life on planet earth in america is going to be like in 10 years and i got a
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.720]  little taste of this and something i'd never seen before apparently this already existed
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:31.720]  i guess at some amazon stores or maybe whole food stores i'd never seen this before and i
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:37.240]  talked about it the other day at a at a soccer game here where you walk into this market it's
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:41.720]  like a little market with a bunch of refrigerators for drinks and stands for popcorn and chips and
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:48.840]  such and and there's a little doorway a little arm like a subway and you put your chip your your
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:54.920]  debit card chip on the chip reader and the doorway opens and then there's a bunch of facial recognition
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:52:02.120]  and scanning going on that follows your movements and traits traces and tracks you that just put
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:07.800]  your card in and then whatever you grab whatever beverage you grab you grab a water a soda a beer
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:14.280]  a bag of popcorn the the ai with your facial recognition sees what you grabbed and charges
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:22.040]  your card now in the future this is what every storefront is going to look like and you'll have
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.240]  a micro chip in planet probably in your wrist or in your hand or something and you'll flash your
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:33.000]  little micro chip and if you've got good social credit then it'll let you in the store if you've
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.760]  been if you've taken your most recent death jab if you've taken your most recent shot of poison and
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:44.440]  and you know pharmaceutical poison as long as you're in good social standing okay you flash
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:51.400]  your micro chip and then the door opens up for you and then you get to go about your shopping
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:55.240]  you know you're getting shopping oh it's so convenient it's so great and hey by the way
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:53:02.040]  i'm all about convenience let me let me be clear here i'm not a luddite i'm okay with technological
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:08.440]  advancements making our lives easier i am perfectly fine with technological advancements making our
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:15.720]  lives easier absolutely but see it's not about making our lives easier it's about making us
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:24.120]  controllable that's what it's about and so you flash your micro chip you get access to the store
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:29.640]  you flash your micro chip you can turn your car on you flash your micro chip you can go to the doctor
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:35.560]  but oh if you're not in good social standing if you didn't take your most recent injection if you
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:41.800]  didn't take your most recent pharmaceutical pill if you didn't go to your gay sensitivity training
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:50.520]  class if you said fag well see now your social credit is is bad and you've been dinged and now
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:55.080]  you go to the grocery store and you you slide your wrist and your micro chip over the scanner
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:01.480]  it says and it gives you a little red mark and it says sorry no food for you today you you said a
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:08.840]  bad word sorry no access for you today you didn't take your vaccine you need to go get a booster
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:15.080]  oh you want to fill your car up with gas oops sorry you need to take a shot you want to start
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:21.320]  your car boop boop boop oh sorry you can't start your car today you've got a bad social credit score
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.240]  what's the name of that episode in black mirror that's all about this
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:39.240]  with um ron howard's daughter forget her name black mirror like season three episode one i think
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:49.960]  called nosedive thank you and it's all about this woman who has a bad day and her social credit
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:54.440]  score which was pretty good she really takes her social credit score seriously she's always nice
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  to everybody always doing exactly what she's told to do and walking between the lines and
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:02.360]  smiling even if she's bad because gotta get that digital credit score up so i can get access and
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:07.320]  live my life and then she has one bad day and her social credit score goes to zero and she can't
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:13.560]  drive a car she can't rent a car she can't buy food her whole life gets destroyed yeah that's the future
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:21.800]  and that's why it's all it's all synthetic you get forced to pretend like you're happy
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.720]  you get forced to pretend like you're satisfied you get forced to pretend
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:31.240]  like everything is fine and dandy and it's all of a sod it's all an act
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:41.720]  act who would ever want to live like that a total fraudulent world everybody faking it
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:49.640]  i'm good thanks but that's what it's all about that's where it all really goes
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.120]  and then the threat becomes well what happens when the grid goes down
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.920]  and what happens when all the things that made it possible to operate shut down
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.400]  like what's going on in south africa red alert south africa on verge of total
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:11.000]  civilizational breakdown as electric grid collapses
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:21.880]  and uh oh the electric grid collapses and now you can't even survive
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:31.160]  that is unless of course you're prepared for that if you catch my drift but that's just
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:40.280]  one aspect but this is the digital slavery that they want to put us into now i haven't even had
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:48.360]  a minute to check but we'll see if i can take alex to the local austin fc soccer game here for him
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:54.520]  to see this and we'll do a little video and i'll do a little report and see the trick is to the
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:57:01.080]  trick is to actually and and you know info wars may not be the best at this at times we're a
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:06.200]  little abrasive we're a little aggressive uh you know but the trick is to go in there and say wow
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:13.800]  this is so great i can't wait to get a microchip in the digital age so i can be a digital slave
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:19.160]  and smiling and acting like it's good because getting abrasive and confronting it like that
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:23.560]  will just turn off a lot of people but if you're like oh yeah you're smiling like oh look at this
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:28.920]  this is so cool a microchip gives me access to food and water i can't wait till that becomes the norm
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:36.040]  i can't wait to be a 21st century digital slave and people will kind of pick up on that subtle
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.120]  sarcasm and it'll make them think like well wait a second what is he talking about digital slave
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:45.560]  microchip implants yeah that's where the future's going they're just introducing it to you now making

[02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:13.800]  we americans are under attack by our own government we the people have no choice but to once again
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:20.200]  defend our freedom this has all happened before and we can learn much from the american revolution
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:28.040]  starting in 1763 to pay for debts incurred from a war with france the british began enforcing
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:34.600]  new taxes on the american colonies in response to this the colonies set up their own parallel
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:40.920]  government based on a simple structure of three committees delegated to voice the will of the
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:47.880]  people a committee of correspondence to disseminate information a committee of inspection to enforce
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:53.800]  continental congress decisions and the most important of the three a committee of safety
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:01:00.760]  to act as general executive in the absence of legal authority these committees stemmed from
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:07.320]  each community of all the colonies and each and every local committee of safety had two missions
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:14.680]  to provide military support and monitor political affairs each community delegated its own
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:21.400]  representatives to speak on their behalf at the county level and then at the state level where
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:28.520]  state legislatures are thereby formed and senators are elected to represent the overall interests
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:35.800]  of the people in that state with these committees the 13 colonies honorably created a parallel
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:42.440]  government that lawfully nullified british rule this compelled the crown to take it back by force
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:48.920]  which was met by an honorable and lawful defense of the colonies known as the american revolution
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:55.800]  the three committee structure that made up this parallel government inspired our us constitution
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:02.120]  a concept of government based upon delegation individuals were not elected to rule their
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:08.600]  only purpose was to facilitate and implement the will of the people it was a government of the people
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:15.240]  by the people and for the people each state was considered to be its own country which was freely
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:21.800]  subordinating aspects of its own authority to a federal government lawfully speaking this has
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:28.120]  never changed but the federal government of the united states has become bloated with loyalists
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:34.840]  to the city of london and enemies of we the people for well over a century we the people
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:41.160]  have been coerced into becoming voluntary slaves to a multinational corporate power structure
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:47.560]  which has increasingly dumbed us down more and more with each generation unconstitutional
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:53.640]  amendments have been enacted constitutional limits of representation have been ignored
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:59.800]  and by accepting federal reserve bank notes we have made ourselves a dishonorable nation of debtors
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:08.840]  by continually contracting with the corporate us being operated out of the washington dc city state
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:15.240]  americans are perpetually surrendering their constitutional sovereignty in return for corporate
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:23.320]  benefits we share a common enemy with our founding fathers today we call them globalists back then
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:30.760]  they called them british a foreign power exploiting the will and destiny of americans and back then
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:37.000]  their remedy was the committee of safety this is happening again today communities are forming
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:44.280]  their own committees of safety an excellent example is santa rosa county florida where the recall
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:51.400]  florida movement sprang from which seeks to empower the citizens of florida with the ability to recall
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:59.240]  county commissioners for corruption malfeasance and neglect of duty the county sheriff is charged
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:05.320]  with upholding the supreme law of the constitution and with your county government in line with
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:11.240]  your county sheriff citizens of that county will have the lawful parallel government they need
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:17.400]  to liberate themselves from contracts made with the corporate us because the powers held by the
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:24.920]  sheriff supersede those of any government official when in the jurisdiction of that county the scyop
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:31.160]  today is meant to make you feel dependent upon the federal government but that has always been
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:37.800]  your choice and it's not the only choice you can contact your local sheriff and ask him about his
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:44.680]  oath to uphold the constitution you can form committees of safety and you can lawfully purge
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:50.360]  your local government of corruption but it requires action and time is quickly running out
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:53.800]  reporting for info wars this is greg reese

[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:56.920]  liar and now three years since now they're telling us yes it was the wuhan lab yes it came from china
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:01.640]  yes it was made in a lab this is the truth now without any shame by the way they changed their
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:09.160]  story as if you won't remember so andrew how do you respond to this how do you analyze this and
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:14.120]  and what do you think is really going on here well the number of things so the first thing is
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:19.560]  the so-called experts that have been on tv been put out in front of the media hey these are experts
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:25.080]  they never go ahead they weren't experts and the people that were censored were smeared the fringe
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:30.120]  epidemiologists like myself we're the real experts and you know it's it's sort of humbling now that
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:35.080]  this is all coming to the surface but what's really going on here is that the u.s. government is
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:38.600]  doing two things they're trying to get ahead of a lot of bad news that's likely to make it into the
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:44.600]  mainstream and they're also trying to change the narrative so the first part of this is that the
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:51.080]  national laboratory system is run by the department of energy this is actually the second report
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:57.080]  related to covid origins that has been put out the first one came out from lords livermore
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:02.600]  laboratory the intelligence division there in june of 2021 the second one is actually from los
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:06.200]  elmos national laboratory it was our sister laboratory when i worked at sandia national
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:11.160]  laboratories in this very area they're great scientists they're top-notch people a lot of
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:15.240]  them have top-secret clearances and access to intelligence and technology that the rest of the
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:21.800]  science scientific community does not so with pushing out this new report you know there's
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:25.720]  a couple interesting things it's i think i've been one pushing the narrative pushing the envelope
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:31.640]  here so this past week if there's still been eavesdropping on my communications i had met with a
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:37.880]  number of producers and filmmakers in hollywood and i got a big picture full feature movie deal
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:41.240]  for my book so they're going to try to get ahead of that the other thing that's happening here is
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:47.560]  that congress asked a number of different people involved in this conspiracy to come in and testify
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:52.760]  politely first and now i don't believe that they've responded that be dr peter dasik dr fauci
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:58.280]  these type of people and they're going to have to now subpoena these individuals to have them
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:02.760]  come in because i don't think they've responded and i've been asked to testify in front of the
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:07.560]  covid permanent select committee in the house and i haven't received a formal letter yet it was an
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:12.920]  informal ask but all this is coming to a head in a hurry uh on top of it you know something's
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:17.640]  going to have to answer for the classified data set um well technically not classified the one
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:23.080]  that i possessed because it was classified after the fact but i made this in an open source environment
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:27.400]  which is stolen from my house likely by the fbi the michigan state police and let the defense
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:30.680]  intelligence agency or the cia i think those are the characters involved and they could have been
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:34.920]  working with potentially the chinese government to smear me and make my life miserable so all
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:39.880]  these terrible stories are bubbling to the surface they can't get away from it and what's
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.680]  happening is now they want to pivot the narratives so that they can pin this all on china they're
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:50.120]  not talking in the news in the mainstream media too much about you know the terrible response the
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:56.440]  fact that a numerous u.s government agencies really screwed this up by giving this advanced
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:01.480]  gana function technology from ralph barracks laboratory to the wuhan institute of virology
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.680]  the intelligence community dropped the ball here with exporting this technology to the chinese to
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:13.560]  snoop on their lab um and then this is just one one government screw up on top of another which
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:18.440]  results in this laboratory leak or potentially uh intentional release by the chinese but the
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.080]  u.s government wants to pin this all on china china is bad and they certainly have a lot of
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.560]  a blame here but the thing that's important for you and the audience to understand there would
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:30.600]  have been no laboratory leak or intentional release unless we would have delivered our
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:36.600]  advanced biotechnology to the wuhan institute of virology via my former employer equal health
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:40.520]  alliance these are all hard facts these are the real grifters in the world that you know they
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:45.320]  haven't accused uh the fringe epidemiologists of being grifters these people are the grifters
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:50.520]  they're taking the money they sold their country out we had our rights rights restricted and then
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:57.400]  they uh foisted off a patent medicine basically snake oil these mrna jabs to the population
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:01.800]  as all part of the cover up and the other reason why i think they're sort of wagging the dog here
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:06.440]  with china is that you know if you look at how the what i refer to as the uniparty in the congress
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:11.960]  in the senate it doesn't seem like too many people are opposed to kicking off world war three everyone's
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:19.000]  trying to to increase the amount of funding in foreign aid going to ukraine um and now we have
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:26.520]  russia and china china forming an alliance which really it isn't surprising in my mind so you know
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:31.080]  what's really going on here well i think you know it's my belief that the entire ukraine conflict
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:36.840]  is a big cover up for this failed um covid operation the us government now it's interesting
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:41.720]  because you're adding some perspectives here that i i wasn't really considering i i kind of looked at
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:47.400]  more of your your latter take of this is more to do with the situation in ukraine china backing
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:53.080]  russia china aligning with russia geopolitically in the in the larger issues and so now the us
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:57.880]  kind of like hey china be careful we'll blame you for covid 19 but you think maybe there's
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:03.400]  something domestically going on here and by the way these aren't just grifters i mean we're talking
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:09.160]  about these are full-blown fascist authoritarians i mean a grifter maybe shows up in trick shed to
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:14.760]  giving him money these people force you into their tyranny but so you think maybe this whole thing is
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:19.560]  about to blow wide open and and what are they trying to get out ahead of it to maybe soften the blow
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:25.800]  a little bit or say oh it was an accident i mean why why this domestic strategy of accepting that
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.480]  it came from china and trying to convince the american people it came from china ahead of these
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:34.680]  potential testimonies from fauci dosik and others well it's really in response to the
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:38.760]  psychological operation that myself and a few other individual scientists lawyers have been
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:44.760]  waging back against the government and our strategy from day one is to pin these people
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:49.240]  against each other and it's a divide and conquer strategy just like they've been waging against
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:52.680]  the american people we've been doing it back against them through lawsuits and another
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:58.840]  number of other means or books social media and it's been effective and now what it's looking
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:03.000]  like is nobody wants to be left holding the bag or be held accountable in the government so they're
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.840]  all starting to point the finger at the people responsible so i think fbi director christopher
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:11.800]  ray is now trying to pin the director of national intelligence saying well you know don't talk to
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:17.320]  me about this go talk to her and that's where i believe i believe i actually i agree with the
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:23.880]  director um ray that that's where a lot of the blame here probably lies um you know this is
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:29.160]  just an insane story i wish that these people would stop trying to um voice the blame off
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:33.080]  on each other and you know playing politics and trying to preserve themselves it would just stand
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:38.680]  up and address this issue um face on so or head on so we can get on with our lives and resolve
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:43.720]  this problem and what it really calls for is a domestic ban on gata function we need to ban these
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.200]  poisonous m r and a jabs like they're doing uh in europe every every day there's another announcement
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:52.360]  in from a european country it seems like where they're banning the boosters and not recommending
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:56.840]  them for another segment of the population so take a look at what's happening in the united
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.600]  states i mean they're still recommending boosters for for people and that's all part of the the
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:05.000]  covet cover-up well it sounds like they're going to be victims of their own propaganda because it
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.600]  was the american media mostly i mean it was it was all around the world but they were the ones
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:15.320]  telling us oh covet is so deadly we need to close our businesses we need to close our schools we
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:19.480]  need to lock down we need to devastate the economy we need to wear masks we need to take all these
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:26.920]  vaccines they were the ones that built it up as the worst pandemic in human history and and now
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:30.680]  they're they're gonna have to deal with that they created that narrative if they would have been
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:35.240]  honest from the beginning you know maybe they could have lightened the blow to them but since
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:39.480]  they the ones that sold this is the worst pandemic in us history now they're gonna have to face it
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:45.000]  as the worst pandemic in us kittry that that they potentially caused so i look at this as their own
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.440]  propaganda is what's haunting them now yeah i agree with that assessment and the interesting
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.440]  thing here that you have to remember is that it was with in part by partnership with the department
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:59.400]  defense through the national institute of allergen infectious diseases that's doctor phylogy for these
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:06.120]  bioweapon countermeasures and medical countermeasure uh platforms like mrna and that you know
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:10.040]  department of homeland security actually has their their finger in that pie as well because they all
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:17.640]  want a rapid response platform for bio warfare bio tear and pandemics so you know never let a good
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:22.600]  opportunity go to waste the pharmaceutical industry is all too happy to produce this dangerous product
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:28.840]  with no liability and if you know the one thing i like to point out to people this had been in
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:36.360]  plan for a long time the mrna um sequence used genetic sequence that was used in the actual
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:43.880]  vaccine um was patented in 2016 and there might be other couple pet patents from 2015 2014 by maderna
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:48.600]  and there's a material transfer agreement from dr wealth barracks laboratory in partnership with
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:55.080]  nih to maderna in december this is big we're hitting a break right now dr andrew hoff hold that thought
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:03.640]  i've got some good news our high quality supplements really work and we have about an

[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:24.360]  dr andrew huff with us here on the alex joneshow owen schroyer filling in for alex and i wanted
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:37.560]  to get back into the m r and a story about this being years in advance from 2014 1516 documents
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:43.880]  and then i want to play the chris ray clip from with brett bear but uh i don't want what you were
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:48.280]  saying before the break to go forgotten so so let's just repeat this for folks to understand
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:56.120]  and it wasn't just that they ran the pandemic exercise just before the covid pandemic which
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:02.600]  was beyond suspicious how that went down but no they had the m r and a technology ready to go
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:08.040]  for years and they couldn't get the excuse to put it into your body because every time they tested
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:13.240]  it it killed all the animals in the lab testing so with the emergency use authorization during
[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:18.920]  the pandemic perfect opportunity put that m r and a in your arm the rest is now history so
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:23.240]  dr andrew huff talk about what you got into before you were cut off by the break and just lay it all
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:28.040]  out again yeah sure so how this functionally works at e-cloth alliance there's a program
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:32.600]  called us a ad predict and this is what forms the relationships with the wuhan institute of
[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:37.480]  virology uh the university north carolina wealth barracks laboratory and the university of columbia
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:43.400]  uh dr ian lippkins so the viral isolation work happens at columbia university they're collecting
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:48.520]  the bats in the caves that's been done between equal alliance and different members of chinese
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:53.240]  government agencies in china and other places around the world to get the genetic material
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:58.120]  then that genetic material goes into different databases either owned by equal alliance or the
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:02.920]  u.s government and then some of those sequences become patented well they're well they're
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:07.880]  worked out worked on in wealth barracks laboratory and also by maderna which was a startup company
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:14.280]  to develop our m r and a technology so when the pandemic happens when kicks off in the fall
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:20.440]  early late summer early fall of 2019 they get to work they know exactly what they have to do and
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:25.800]  one of the things that they they have to do is they have to sign a material transfer agreement
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:32.280]  to transfer the biotechnology from dr wealth barracks laboratory um to maderna in partnership
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:37.160]  with nih and that signed off by all these individuals i think it was in mid to late december in 2019
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:41.160]  and that's think about that that's before they're telling anyone around the world um that there's
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:45.640]  a pandemic going on and the only people that were talking about this um pneumonia like illness
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:52.440]  where people like me um infectious disease epidemiologists and detectives so to say and so
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:23:01.880]  at what point did we know this virus was going around do you think oh without a doubt i believe
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:07.560]  the u.s government finds out about it in probably september or october of 2019 i think all the the
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:15.240]  globalist types so the gates the soros of the world um large corporations they find out about
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:21.960]  the pandemic in that same time frame because they have intelligence uh units or operations which are
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:26.200]  very similar to the u.s government and a lot of these people are ex-military or ex-intelligence
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:31.080]  who are working in these private intelligence centers for corporations or high wealth individuals
[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:35.800]  and they use the same types of methods to collect information and the other thing that happens here
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:40.760]  is these these politicians these high wealth individuals the globalists um multinational
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:46.360]  corporations they share information they talk and everyone gets on the same page or the same um
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:51.320]  i guess the same plate they start operating the same playbook together i think they had different
[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:55.640]  incentives to why they wanted to do that i think some people want to get rich some people want to
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:00.600]  some organizations want to consolidate power or attain power but they all get on the same
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:06.760]  playbook together and that's probably by early october 2019 so even when they were running the
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:12.200]  pandemic exercise event 201 is what it's called even when they were running that the virus was
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:18.040]  already spreading it was already going on they knew it yeah and that's a fact and so from a
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:23.960]  number of epidemiologists that went and analyzed blood bank donations so blood bank donations
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:30.440]  serve as a historical record and you know if someone donated blood in october of 2019 and you
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:35.240]  go analyze the serology of that blood and you find a positive hit for coven you find it among
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:39.800]  among a bunch of other people then you can go ask those people well who you contact with and a lot
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:44.680]  of those cases um when they did that analysis they found coven in the cases traced back to
[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:49.560]  wuhan china and a number of different scientists replicated that work around the planet um it's
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:53.400]  funny that we haven't done too much of that in the united states and then if as you recall there's
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:58.040]  a number of people on the west coast of the united states who reported pneumonia like illness in
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:02.680]  november and december of 2019 and i was actually living in the bay area at the time and i came down
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:07.160]  with something strange i thought it was the flu knocked me flat on my back for a few days but i
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:15.480]  recovered yeah same thing with me in december i uh spent about 30 hours in a dc jail and uh i came
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:20.360]  out of there sick as a dog i mean sicker than i've ever been and like you i was like oh i just got a
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:24.600]  bad flu or whatever knocked out on my ass for about a week and i never get sick so i mean i knew it was
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:29.400]  bad i'd obviously assumed it was from jail but then we realized later well maybe it was coven i
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:33.960]  don't know i never got the the test really didn't make a difference to me but i want to play this
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:41.000]  clip of the fbi director chris ray with brett bayer talking about the lab origins and get your
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.200]  response to it here was over the weekend chris ray and brett bayer on fox news what is the
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:54.440]  determination by the fbi so as you know brett the fbi has for quite some time now assessed
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:02.040]  that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in wuhan we step back
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:10.360]  for a second you know the fbi has folks agents professionals analysts virologists microbiologists
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:16.840]  etc who focus specifically on the dangers of biological threats which include things like
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:24.520]  novel viruses like covid uh and the concerns that in the wrong hands some bad guys a hostile nation
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:30.040]  state a terrorist a criminal the threats that those could pose so here you're talking about a
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:37.480]  potential leak from a chinese government controlled lab that killed millions of americans and that's
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:45.160]  precisely what that capability uh was designed for i should add that that our work related to
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:51.640]  this continues and there are not a whole lot of details i can share that aren't aren't classified
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:56.360]  i will just make the observation that the chinese government seems to me has been doing its best
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:04.360]  to try to thwart and obfuscate uh the work here the work that we're doing the work that
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:10.920]  our u.s. government and close foreign partners are doing um and that's unfortunate for everybody
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:16.120]  pretty aggressive rhetoric from chris ray considering we were told not to talk about it three years ago
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:21.960]  uh andrew your response yes he seems quite nervous when he first states when he's responding to
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:27.000]  that the line of questioning and the the thing that you have to look at he's trying to pin all the
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.120]  blame on china and only if the chinese are more forthcoming well a bunch of smart people around
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:38.360]  the planet all working independently has figured out exactly what happened i mean of course the
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:43.320]  chinese lied in the the data that they released and the information that they released you know
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:47.640]  what might be classified here is that likely the department defense the the defense intelligence
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:54.440]  agency um and a number of other intelligence organizations within the u.s. government likely
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:00.680]  learned about this in september october of 2019 and you know here's just a personal fact from my
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:06.600]  story is that darpa tried to recruit me as the program officer in the biologics division
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:12.440]  for these programs and they tried to do that in 2019 uh october or september 2019 i believe that
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:18.200]  they did that to silence me so i wouldn't be doing exactly what i'm doing now um the the strangest
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:21.640]  thing and you know some more evidence for this is that they called me on a brand new cell phone
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:26.360]  number which none of my past contacts had in the classified space i was contacted by a woman that
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:31.240]  i used to work with dr amy jenkins and it's just you know you start to look at all the
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:35.400]  circumstantial evidence here and i know what the capabilities that the u.s. government has
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:39.480]  to to detect these emerging infectious disease outbreaks he's being less than fourth right
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:45.400]  and he's trying to pin all the blame to china when much of the blame uh lands on the intelligence
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:49.800]  community the department defense and our health agencies here in the united states all right
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:58.760]  we're up against a break i got follow-up questions for you on the other side don't go anywhere folks

[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:49.720]  what we want to do in davos is to reset but as soon as we start exposing the great reset the
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:33:02.200]  soon as these globalists are going to prison leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.840]  world order it's alex jones
[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:25.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:34.680]  host owin shroyer you were just breaking down some pretty amazing stuff there ahead of the
[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:41.320]  break and i wanted to just see if i understood this correctly you were getting calls from
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:48.040]  government officials on a phone number that they had no way of having access to is that what i was
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:55.640]  hearing that's correct so i had taken a new job at jewel labs out in san francisco and when i
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:34:00.680]  moved i changed my phone number the first time i'd done it in my adult life and there's no way
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:05.720]  that any of these officials would have had this phone number unless they had used law enforcement
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:11.960]  or intelligence techniques to to get it so why what what is the significance of that why were
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:15.880]  they so desperate to track you down you think it was because they were afraid you'd eventually become
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:22.840]  we'll say a whistleblower exactly i mean so i had worked in the national laboratories with the
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:27.560]  department of home and security and department defense and other three letter agencies in this
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:31.960]  area so i knew you know i know things on the classified side and i know the open source side
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:37.720]  i know the intelligence collection methods for health and bio surveillance and i had worked at
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:42.200]  eco health alliance and they probably were scared that i was going to come out and do exactly what
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:50.040]  i'm doing now well and i guess it's too bad that others didn't have your foresight and others didn't
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:56.040]  see where this was going like you did because there's no doubt to me part of this operation of
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:00.440]  getting all the members the media involved getting all these politicians involved getting all these
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:06.040]  doctors involved is so that when it comes out you know whatever the truth is about covid or the
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:11.000]  vaccines when it comes out they're now going to be liable they're now going to be culpable so they're
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:14.600]  not going to want to call it out they're not going to want there to be justice served because that
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:20.600]  means it's coming for them too how much of that do you think is going on oh i think that's i think
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.120]  you nailed it i think that's exactly what's happening this is why you're seeing the pivot
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:28.680]  right now by the the u.s. government to to blame china everything i think over the next week to
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:32.600]  two weeks and until this narrative falls apart it's going to be blame china because event people
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:39.080]  eventually catch on these were us programs that gave the this biotechnology the biological materials
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:44.840]  to china now i think what's going to be more interesting here is how china decides to shape
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:49.480]  the narrative in response to this so if i were china what i would do is i'd simply point back at the
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:54.520]  united states and say well these were your programs and we did this in partnership with you you know
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:59.480]  exactly what you were doing here you gave all this to us and you know yeah accidents happen i think
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:05.400]  that would be a smart response from the chinese because that that sort of shows them taking the
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:10.440]  higher ground here and then makes the united states look like a bunch of idiots yeah and i would even
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:15.400]  go as far to say i don't even think china would care enough to apologize they don't have to the
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:18.600]  chinese communists don't have to answer to the chinese people they could they could do whatever
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:24.360]  the hell they want they can lock them up kill them take their kids so they don't giving an excuse to
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:30.200]  what they were doing to the chinese people is not an issue for them now the disconnect is going to be
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:36.200]  how the us media covers it or if the us media covers it at all because what i see the phenomenon
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:40.840]  here is that the chinese really don't care they don't care what the us media reports they don't
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:45.320]  have to care what the us media reports and they don't have to do narrative control like the us
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:55.000]  media has to do my fear is that this really is going to be used as justification for china to get
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:02.600]  further involved in whatever type of a war against america just like russia says hey you guys are the
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:06.920]  ones expanding you guys are the ones putting bilabs in ukraine you guys are the ones putting
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.480]  missiles on our doorstep now china is going to say well wait a second you guys are the ones
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:15.960]  funding the research you guys are the ones wanting us to do this gain of function research
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:20.760]  you're not going to blame us for the pandemic you're going to be the ones held to account
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:26.520]  i mean to me this is like a big a big punch to the back side the blind side of your head
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:31.000]  a quarterback getting sacked from the blind side i don't think the american people realize what's
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:36.280]  about to happen here well i don't know what's really going to happen either after all this comes
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:43.160]  to light the and this is exactly why the politicians united states specifically in the house the senate
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.160]  and the bureaucrats have been all been trying to kick the can down the road for as long as he can
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:51.400]  because i don't think anybody quite understands how this is going to play out and this is why it's
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:55.880]  so important for the united states to take the lead right now admit that there's a problem admit
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:02.040]  that they screwed up and take care of the our issues in clean house a simple way to solve these
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:08.040]  issues would be for the fbi to go and arrest dr anthony fouchy dr peter dasik dr ian lipkin
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:12.040]  start there and bring charges against these people through the department of justice
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:16.760]  for negligent homicide i think they'd be very easy to prove now the problem is why they don't
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:20.760]  want to do that well dr dasik will probably go back and say well i was working with the cia and
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:25.000]  the intelligence community and the department of defense and you guys asked me to do all this stuff
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.760]  but here's the thing that doesn't absolve him from anything just because the government the
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:34.520]  u.s. government asked him to do something that was nefarious bad judgment violate u.s paul's norms
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.480]  policy norms and best practices it doesn't absolve him because the government has every
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:43.720]  legal right to come ask you to do something stupid or illegal it doesn't mean that you have to agree
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:50.040]  with it and at the end of the day all roads lead back to the department defense so the emergency
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:56.440]  use authorization for the mrna jabs was initiated through wartime procurement acts at the department
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.480]  defense so it's a wartime procurement act that basically gives the department defense the ability
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:05.560]  to go to phaser to go to major and say we need this product we're going to grant you immunity
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:10.760]  and that's when production begins and that's how they get the emergency use authorization it wasn't
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:15.800]  through nih it wasn't through niade even though they're the ones who execute it why do you think
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:21.960]  we see all the bureaucracy and the mainstream media now telling us that it came out of china
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:26.360]  but the biden white house is saying no we don't think it came out of china do you think that's
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:31.160]  them kind of leaving china and out that they can still change the narrative or do you think the
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:37.400]  white house is now not really operating in lockstep with the rest of the corrupt bureaucracy well i
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:41.400]  think our strategy and the psychological operation that we've been waging back against the us government
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.200]  is working um all the agencies and it's going further up the food chain they're they're turning
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:50.680]  against the white house i think that's what we're seeing here because nobody wants to be held accountable
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.760]  and the white house wants to continue the psychological operation from their perspective
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:01.400]  which is to cast uncertainty doubt and fear into the situation the problem is nobody's buying it so
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:06.680]  they're running out of maneuvers or chess moves so to speak uh the longer that this continues so
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:11.800]  more and more the truth keeps to come out the mainstream media is increasingly reporting the
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:15.640]  truth and you know i don't know when when this is going to end but i think this is all going to
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:21.000]  blow up within the next three or four months or so well at this rate i mean the story is not going
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:28.040]  to go away and now that the narrative is back in play and being promoted that it came out of china
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:34.200]  i mean the american people again we were censored we were demonized doctors had their careers ruined
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:38.840]  you know i mean all the stuff that went down and then they get proven right this is just going to
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:44.520]  reflare up uh these issues these scars specifically i think in the medical community from the doctors
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:50.040]  that got punished with this for calling out the truth so i mean this is basically just like
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:55.320]  you know trying to trying to ride the bull now that's bucking up and down and i guess yeah the
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:59.080]  reason why the white house and the bureaucracies are kind of not in lockstep is because everybody's
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:03.080]  kind of looking around their shoulder like okay who's going to get the blame for this i hope it's
[02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:09.080]  not us final comments dr andrew huff it'd be real simple for the president to stand up president
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:12.920]  biden stand up and say we made a mistake and correct all these issues instruct the department
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:17.400]  justice and the fbi to go prosecute these individuals and through those prosecutions i think the
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:23.480]  truth would all come out boy oh boy do you really think they would burn one of their greatest agents
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:27.880]  anthony fouchy of all time i mean imagine the skeletons and imagine the bodies that he knows
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:32.520]  where they're buried well is anybody gonna listen to him i mean you think about so once
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:38.120]  that there's criminal charges brought against him um the u.s. government's ability to censor
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:45.000]  him and restrict what he can do you know if he's actually even released uh you know on bail they
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.560]  can bar him from speaking with the media or a number of other there's a number of other things
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:52.920]  that the u.s. government can do and you know if they want to be sneaky about like they did with
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:57.320]  everybody else they can just do it through uh you know back channels with the tech industry i mean
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:02.680]  there's ways to restrict his ability to have a voice so wow so now you may have a situation where
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:07.800]  fouchy and dosik may have to start operating on their own terms to try to protect themselves
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:15.080]  i think that's what that's where this is headed wow amazing stuff uh great segments here with

[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:16.760]  have a problem with anti-catholic bias our department is uh protects all religions um
[02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:23.160]  and all ideologies it does not have any bias against any religion of any kind well you could
[02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:29.800]  have surprised me because given the resources that you are expending and the apparently
[02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:35.880]  intelligence assets that you are deploying against catholics it appears and other people of faith
[02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:41.000]  while simultaneously turning a blind eye while people are executed gang style in the streets
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:45.800]  of our cities including in my home state your answer frankly surprises me let's talk
[02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:50.040]  about the mark out case for example you've been asked about this already today and frankly your
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:59.400]  answers really astound me this is a case where a catholic pro-life demonstrator father was accused
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:05.160]  of disorderly conduct in front of an abortion center the local prosecutor the philadelphia
[02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:11.000]  district attorney who is a democrat a liberal very progressive declined to prosecute there
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:17.800]  was a private suit that got dismissed and then after all of that your justice department sent
[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:24.920]  between 20 and 30 armed agents in the early morning hours to the house private residents
[02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:32.920]  to arrest this guy after he had offered to turn himself in voluntarily here's the photo once
[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:38.280]  again you can see the long guns you can see the ballistic shields you can see that they're wearing
[02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:44.920]  bulletproof vests why did the justice department do this why did you send 20 to 30
[02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:52.600]  SWAT style agents in a SWAT style team to this guy's house when everybody else had declined
[02:52:52.600 --> 02:52:59.000]  to prosecute and he'd offered to turn himself in determinations of how to make arrests under arrest
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:06.680]  warrants are made based by the tactical operators in the district they are not but you surely looked
[02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:14.200]  into it by this point right they you know the answer surely they all I know is what the FBI has
[02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:19.160]  said which is that they made decisions on the ground as to what was safest and easiest so you
[02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:24.680]  do not agree with your description of what happened on this you don't agree with my description I'm
[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:31.960]  pointing out what the photo is there are agents here who have long guns and this merit garland
[02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:40.120]  what an absolute piece of trash and by the way more josh howly please oh i'm eric garland uh here
[02:53:40.120 --> 02:53:46.280]  here's a video of the incident we're talking about well i don't disagree i disagree with what i'm
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:52.440]  saying in the video i i don't i don't think that's what's going on oh like oh here's the video here's
[02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:56.920]  the raid here's the guns here's the shields here's the department of justice doing it you're the head
[02:53:56.920 --> 02:54:02.360]  of it uh what is your what what is your response well i just disagree with what i'm seeing in that
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:09.720]  video i i don't think that's happening oh we're being dominated by lesser men we're being dominated
[02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:20.920]  and and and looked down upon by absolute scumbag nitwit punks and pricks like merit garland who
[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:24.680]  who was gonna they thought he was gonna be a supreme court justice yeah i think your career's
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:31.080]  done now buddy howley's putting you to rest here continue of what happened on this you don't agree
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:36.520]  with your description i'm pointing out what the photo is there are agents here who have long guns
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:40.920]  and ballistic shields let's take a look at the hardened criminals that your justice department
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:46.200]  sent these armed agents to go terrorize on that morning here they are here they are at mass
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:55.080]  here's the seven children with mr. hawk and his wife in this early morning they were all at home
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:01.960]  mrs. hawk has said repeatedly the children were screaming they feared for their lives you got these
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:07.160]  agents demanding that he come out they've got the gun she said pointing at the house and at them
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:16.120]  he has offered to turn himself in and this is who you go to terrorize what's really interesting
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:20.840]  to me is this seems to directly contradict your own memorandum i want to pull this down for a
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:25.240]  second because i want to play the mike lee clip that's apparently gotten in band uh merit garland
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:32.760]  not honorable merit garland a small little it's a punk ass bitch well now let's go to mike lee
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:36.040]  giving him the what for that he's now been suspended from twitter for doing here it is
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:44.200]  doj's announced charges against 34 individuals for blocking access to or vandalizing abortion clinics
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:52.520]  and there have been over 81 per reported attacks on pregnancy centers 130 attacks on catholic
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:58.360]  churches since the leak of the dobs decision and only two individuals have been charged so how do
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:05.960]  you explain this disparity uh by reference to anything other than politicization of what's
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:18.600]  happening there the face act applies equally to efforts to damage blockade clinics whether
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:24.440]  pregnant resource whether they are pregnancy resource center or whether they are an abortion
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:30.600]  center it applies equally in both cases and we apply the law equally i will say you're quite
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:38.680]  right there are many more prosecutions with respect to the blocking of the of the abortion
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:45.240]  centers but that is generally because they are those actions are taken in with photography at the
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:53.720]  time during the daylight and seeing the person who did it is quite easy the those who are attacking
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:57:01.400]  the pregnancy resources centers which is a hard thing to do are doing this at night in the dark
[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:10.280]  we have put full resources on this we have a whole crap put rewards out for this the justice
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:18.120]  department the fbi have made outreach to catholic all right we're out of time here k dally hosting

[03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:12.360]  dot com the cate dally show nice to be with you i have a tremendous guest for you today that you
[03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:18.360]  must hear from he grew up in east germany was a communist and will address what changed him
[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:23.640]  how the people expose the infiltrators over here we call them the cia and the fbi
[03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:31.080]  and how the people overturned tyrannical rule in east germany this is a story everybody needs to
[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:37.000]  hear because in our situation right now and the freedom loss that we're getting daily we need to
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:42.760]  understand how to overturn this with the population that we have we can learn so much from this story
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:49.080]  but before i go there before i bring on herald ziger who is amazing he's amazing i want to
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:54.040]  give you three truth bombs to start out i wasn't here last week i'm going to talk about that in
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:01:00.440]  just a moment the news wants you to focus on derailments i noticed this as fox news and cnn
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:05.320]  we're constantly now reporting every derailment we have had derailments in this country usually
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:10.360]  two to four a day but now they're focusing on them because they want to focus on them which tells you
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:16.600]  what the news the media the mainstream it's always opposite if they're saying focus on the
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:21.800]  trained derailments don't focus on them then they become a distraction and i'm not talking about the
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:26.680]  chemical spill in ohio i'm talking about all the other trained derailments and that's really
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:31.400]  important to know that's when you know it becomes a distraction when fox news is like oops another one
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:38.120]  yeah it's a distraction also i'm wondering what the ingredients with that the ingredients that
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:42.920]  spilled in ohio would that cause a black cloud or a white cloud just something to think about
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:49.800]  you know and then also right now the big news this week is the left is finally embracing china
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:56.280]  they're they're finally saying the chinese virus and this is absolutely a story that
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:02:03.000]  is there to cement the narrative okay not to highlight the stupidity of the left that's easy
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.240]  to do you can highlight that every day they don't know their history they don't know context
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:12.520]  that's easy but don't go and don't fall for the low hanging fruit that they're finally embracing it
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:17.480]  they're finally talking about it all they're doing is cementing a narrative it did not come from china
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:23.160]  it came from here they just don't want us to focus on that in fact if we were blaming china for the
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:30.840]  99.9 percent sniffle okay wouldn't they have retaliated and black rock in august of 2020
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:37.800]  was very very sneaky in going in and receiving approval approval from who yeah from the chinese
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:43.880]  securities regulatory commission to set up mutual fund business in the country this made black rock
[03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:48.440]  the first global asset manager to get consent from the chinese government to start operations in
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:55.000]  the country august of 2020 if we were blaming them or we knew or the whole story was staged to come
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:00.760]  out of china why would they be able to do that in 2020 when no one was looking okay the other thing
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:05.000]  i wanted to mention before i bring on my great guest because actually this is why i want to
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:10.360]  bring on my great guest i was at an airport i the the new harry reid little treasonous harry
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:15.800]  reid airport okay harry reid airport um really they should have just named the commode harry
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:19.880]  reid the bathrooms the harry reid bathrooms at the airport but they named the whole airport after
[03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:26.200]  him i was standing in line and as i was standing in line to get accosted by the tsa and felt up by
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:33.000]  the tsa i got to i got to have this moment with with dogs um halfway through the line they make
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:37.480]  you stand on these appropriated gold painted feet and you have to stand on them perfectly you can't
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:42.280]  go outside the line uh or you're told by the tsa agent to then put your feet on the gold
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:50.040]  painted uh you know shoe lines then i was told to have this correct pace as i walked forward
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:54.200]  and i had to have a correct cadence while dogs sniffed my private parts it was super fun and
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:58.840]  exhilarating i don't know what's more exhilarating dog sniffing me or the tsa agent filling me up
[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:03.960]  but anyway i just want to mention this because as i was going through as i was thinking why
[03:04:03.960 --> 03:04:08.520]  why are they doing this and i know the reason because i'm asking you a question i know the
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:15.320]  answer to and that is to create another fear factor a bomb a bomb dog a a drug dog it doesn't
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:23.000]  even matter at this point but i had to go through this very very fierce um 10 feet dogs surrounding
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:28.360]  me sniffing me with four agents staring at me making sure i had the right cadence walk until
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:34.280]  i got to the actual tsa is this program being piloted now is las vegas airport one of those
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:41.000]  pilot programs i don't know but we certainly don't live in america we said the tsa was bad enough
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:45.320]  now we got dogs we got bomb dogs did a bunch of planes go down that i didn't know about
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:51.000]  why is this happening we'll come right back with herald ziger from freedoms nightmare you're

[03:06:20.120 --> 03:06:26.280]  escaped uh well not really how he escaped how how everything changed in east germany and why
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:31.000]  what did the people actually do to get out from under their tyranny when i was on a week and a
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:34.680]  half ago before his travel i was traveling last week but when i was on the week before i talked
[03:06:34.680 --> 03:06:39.320]  about the fact that hey the good news is they still have to pull a bunch of false flags in order for
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:44.600]  us um to to come under their control because they still don't have full control of the country but
[03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:49.480]  they're getting close and that's why i wanted herald to come on with me today he's a very
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:53.800]  inspirational speaker he speaks all over the country and let me tell you this book we'll talk
[03:06:53.800 --> 03:06:58.920]  about why how they exposed how did the patriot groups expose the infiltrators i bet you want to
[03:06:58.920 --> 03:07:05.960]  know that and how the people did this welcome to the show herald how are you hi i'm fine thank you

[03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:18.440]  don't show because i'm telling you people need to hear your story um you grew up in east germany
[03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:23.320]  you were communist you were brainwashed into thinking that this was for the good of all
[03:07:23.880 --> 03:07:28.040]  what changed that herald because i think this is so inspirational when you talk about what
[03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:37.160]  changed you yeah what what changed me was a it was not an overnight experience it happened over a
[03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:46.040]  period of time um i collided with the with the system first uh when i was instructed to guide a
[03:07:46.680 --> 03:07:53.960]  what they call youth brigade um to adhere to the rules and regulations for these youth brigades
[03:07:53.960 --> 03:08:01.320]  and um one of the rules was that the members of the youth brigades were not allowed to date
[03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:09.320]  um non-communist members not non-party members or members who were in disagreement
[03:08:09.880 --> 03:08:18.280]  with the uh east german communist philosophy and if they did then i was required to report
[03:08:18.280 --> 03:08:27.400]  those people to the stasi stasi as the state security police which was the power tool for the
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:35.160]  communist party the socialist united party scp in east germany and then the stasi would track
[03:08:35.160 --> 03:08:41.720]  these people down and would harass them or whatever so i i started not to do that anymore i
[03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:49.320]  i refused to do it and then actually in a in a direct confrontation i said i disagree with
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:56.280]  this kind of policy i disagree with uh we what do you have to do with the people's private life
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:09:04.280]  right and uh i was corrected i was reprimanded i was removed from a number of positions at this time
[03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:12.680]  i was um if you want to say an upcoming star uh in the east german youth movement in our region
[03:09:12.680 --> 03:09:21.560]  i was a leader in uh youth agitation agitation and propaganda training um i had learned all the
[03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:29.160]  tools and how to organize meetings how to organize groups and all these things and uh but i was removed
[03:09:29.160 --> 03:09:35.480]  from all these positions because of my resistance to do that um and that was the first shock
[03:09:37.560 --> 03:09:42.120]  and then i went to the army i we had mandatory army service in east germany
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:52.280]  and that was another eye opener you are not a human being in a communist army now it wasn't
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:58.360]  that bad as in in a soviet union soviet union soldiers were actually still beaten by their
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:10:07.400]  officers they had the right to beat a soldier if he did not do exactly what he should do
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:12.600]  now that was not that bad in the east german army but there were other things which were
[03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:21.800]  absolutely contrary to that what i had learned over so many years for our great communist
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:27.720]  development and then the real shocker which really disconnected me from everything what was
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:36.600]  communism was a instruction meeting where once in a month a high up high ranking officer would come
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:45.320]  in it would instruct the groups about the military politics the politics behind our military uh while
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:52.760]  we have to fight the rotten capitalist west and uh and all these these stuffs and uh this guy was
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:11:02.360]  actually explaining that east germany had a number of spies uh in high ranking positions in nato
[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:09.240]  i don't know if anybody remembers the yulm affair uh one of the consulates was consular brand
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:19.880]  his personal private secretary was actually a spy for the stasi so everything what consular brand
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:27.720]  get in his hands was written before or read before by his spy of the stasi so based on that the uh
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:32.600]  and then there were several in the in nato headquarters women which were used as honey
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:41.640]  honey traps right um right and he he explained we will know at least two days before nato attacks
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:49.960]  the wash are packed we will know that and we will attack before and our main objective is to get to
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:58.440]  the fulda gap which is a low level area between two hill sites uh near the city of fulda in west
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:04.280]  germany and we have to go through there and have to keep that fulda gap open so that the
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:11.400]  soviet army forces which come after us can rush through and go to the uh big
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:21.800]  and the main point for that was to capture those harbors to avoid resupply to nato forces from america
[03:12:22.760 --> 03:12:32.360]  and so one of our soldiers said hey sir but i i don't think we can do that because i'm working at the
[03:12:32.360 --> 03:12:40.040]  fleet here right all our tracks and tanks and all of we have are breaking down every time
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:45.560]  we have more defect uh equipment than we have equipment which works so how do you think we
[03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:55.400]  can get there and do that if and may i answer if we are not able to open and keep open that fulda
[03:12:55.400 --> 03:13:03.240]  gap we'll just get nuked and there was silence in that room i mean it was just unbelievable
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:12.920]  so that was that was actually official communist strategy military uh what do you call it policy
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:19.080]  or whatever that was in their doctrine in their military doctrine if we cannot reach that goal
[03:13:19.080 --> 03:13:24.440]  that would be nuked and then the russian troops with their or soviet troops with their um
[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:29.320]  nuclear safety equipment they could go through we didn't have that stuff but they had
[03:13:30.200 --> 03:13:36.760]  so that was still using we're still using the nuke threat right now everything's always ramping
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:41.320]  up to nukes i i looked at a news clip from six years ago that i played on my show and it was
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:45.880]  we're about to get nuked it's about to be world war three there's always the threat there it's a
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:51.880]  very communistic globalist threat and everybody everybody freaks out over it every five seconds
[03:13:51.880 --> 03:13:55.880]  like we're like it like like nukes our biggest problem at this point i think we have bigger
[03:13:55.880 --> 03:14:01.720]  fish to fry i almost welcome a nuke at this point and so when we when we talk about your story when
[03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:06.360]  they finally hit your personal life when they were telling you what kind of girl you could marry
[03:14:06.360 --> 03:14:10.840]  you know what goes on in the bedroom what what every single facet of your personal life that's
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:15.480]  when you begin to question that's when you begin to say i'm sorry am i involved in something here
[03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:22.360]  and because at that point you had been pretty successfully brainwashed into the saucy way right
[03:14:22.360 --> 03:14:27.080]  we call them karen's over here but a lot of people telling on everybody and uh and you
[03:14:27.080 --> 03:14:31.080]  started realizing they were in your private life that's when it kind of hit you didn't it
[03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:38.200]  yes and then i mean there were a number of issues and i we don't have the time to explain that also
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:46.120]  that's the reason why people should buy the book right um that that new king that new king and he
[03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:53.400]  expressed it like he is going to buy a cup of coffee right that was enough for me that was the
[03:14:53.400 --> 03:15:00.840]  breaking point and then i run into that girl uh my mom was in a in a hospital and next to her in
[03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:06.520]  in the vet there was uh somebody laying there which i couldn't see anything but just a long
[03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:13.000]  blonde braid right down on the on the blanket and i asked my mom who said oh she said that's a girl
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:19.560]  she had an accident and uh she had a concussion and she needs to lay for 10 days or so and then
[03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:25.720]  a couple weeks later or so uh i was at home again and was sitting in our living room reading my mom
[03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:31.320]  was in the kitchen and cooking and suddenly she yells her out come in here christiana is here

[03:20:11.320 --> 03:20:15.560]  back here with you on the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host from the kate dally show
[03:20:15.560 --> 03:20:21.320]  kate dally radio dot com my guest is herald zeager he wrote the book freedoms nightmare
[03:20:21.320 --> 03:20:25.880]  and let me tell you it really it really changed the way i looked at the populace and what we could
[03:20:25.880 --> 03:20:32.200]  do as they eradicated east germany how the populace did that how they exposed the infiltrators
[03:20:32.200 --> 03:20:37.160]  within their own groups very important thing to understand how they did this because they were
[03:20:37.160 --> 03:20:41.400]  under full tyranny they were under full tyranny we have to remember that remember when i talked
[03:20:41.400 --> 03:20:46.040]  about the airports and the dogs when they added that measure for the dogs there is no reason to
[03:20:46.040 --> 03:20:53.640]  measure to add that there was no reason to suddenly have drug dogs bomb dogs there was no factor that
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:57.880]  said that that had to happen because of the fact that they can just sit there and say well
[03:20:57.880 --> 03:21:01.880]  it's another scare tactic and we're all for it and we can add it we never have to explain to the
[03:21:01.880 --> 03:21:07.240]  people why because the people would never ask people don't ask why and that's our problem
[03:21:07.240 --> 03:21:12.200]  jordan peterson talked about sultan easton said you know in the gulag he said you know i had to
[03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:17.800]  figure what my part of being in this gulag was i had to finally wrestle with the fact that i put
[03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:23.960]  myself there because i allowed all these things to happen and it really is uh herald is a force of
[03:21:23.960 --> 03:21:29.720]  nature because herald as he talks about east germany and he's seeing america fall as he sees
[03:21:29.720 --> 03:21:36.440]  this country disappearing and and what what he grew up in that is happening all over now in fact in
[03:21:36.440 --> 03:21:42.360]  east germany they had files they had they had file cabinets on people from the people that would turn
[03:21:42.360 --> 03:21:47.880]  them in and and snitch on them and the carons you know the tell on them and so this is such an
[03:21:47.880 --> 03:21:53.160]  interesting story herald joins me herald zeager and uh he speaks all over the country an amazing
[03:21:53.160 --> 03:21:57.720]  amazing author freedoms nightmare is the book you must get it it's a bookstores plus amazon
[03:21:57.720 --> 03:22:03.160]  and let me tell you if finish your story about the girl real quick uh herald your mom your your
[03:22:03.160 --> 03:22:08.920]  mother said the girl with the long braid was was there to see you yeah at first i had no idea what
[03:22:08.920 --> 03:22:15.320]  it is so uh to make the story short we started dating a year later we married and uh we are married
[03:22:15.320 --> 03:22:22.840]  now for 40 46 years now she was a christian she grew up in a christian home and that was so that
[03:22:22.840 --> 03:22:30.360]  when when we started dating that was for me a complete contrary world i had no idea i mean i was
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:37.320]  i was what i what i usually say god tapped me a couple of times on my shoulder right
[03:22:37.960 --> 03:22:44.520]  one of that was a very impressive situation we were in a in a city desal i was about i think
[03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:51.800]  i was in seventh grade high school and we went uh winstays to sunday school because we were in a
[03:22:51.800 --> 03:23:02.840]  um um um lutheran um childhood home my mom was in in in uh hospital and so we were in a
[03:23:02.840 --> 03:23:09.160]  in a lutheran childhood and they sent us to uh sunday school or winstays right after school
[03:23:09.160 --> 03:23:14.120]  and that little church where we went there that was bomb firebomb during world war two
[03:23:14.120 --> 03:23:21.480]  and the whole church burned out but the life size christ figure on the front side of the church
[03:23:21.480 --> 03:23:28.760]  starved out of a big tree was not burned the fire stopped right underneath the feet of that
[03:23:28.760 --> 03:23:36.040]  christian figure and i was i mean it was for me it was something i said this is horrible you you
[03:23:36.040 --> 03:23:40.920]  can't believe this this is this is shocking because it didn't fit with what i i had learned
[03:23:42.040 --> 03:23:48.680]  so years later then i i i get in touch with this with this girl and we're talking about things
[03:23:48.680 --> 03:23:54.440]  like that and she said why do you think that happened you are an engineer you should be able
[03:23:54.440 --> 03:24:01.720]  to think about it you should see through it you have an analytic mind use it right right so i
[03:24:01.720 --> 03:24:08.040]  read it i bought a bible which is still available in east germany they couldn't they couldn't really
[03:24:08.040 --> 03:24:13.880]  put everything out and because of west germany was there right that that that was always that
[03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:21.000]  counterpart where they had to play games with so i bought the bible went out on c trip as an
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:26.360]  engineer on a fishing trial it was usually two to three months and i read the bible cover to cover
[03:24:27.080 --> 03:24:33.880]  and when we went out this was march everything gray and gray we come back in end of may
[03:24:34.600 --> 03:24:40.600]  and everything is blooming and flowering and green and red and yellow and colors and i was
[03:24:40.600 --> 03:24:46.280]  standing there on the railing on that on a trailer and i said this can't happen by chance
[03:24:47.480 --> 03:24:53.640]  the first time i realized that there must be something more behind it so that's why i'm
[03:24:53.640 --> 03:25:01.320]  going to and uh two years later i turned my life to christ um so yeah that is how i changed
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:09.320]  so tell me how just tell me how the small groups started that the patriot groups patriots were
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:15.880]  were developing they were eager to come together they wanted this to stop this is prior to 1990
[03:25:15.880 --> 03:25:20.280]  this is in the 80s what started happening what did you start noticing people started feeling
[03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:29.000]  the same way you did so when i publicly declared that i'm a christian i was removed from my job
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:36.280]  because um they thought i might use radio systems to spy and send messages out or whatever totally
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:41.480]  stupid but that was there they always this is what what the americans don't understand
[03:25:41.480 --> 03:25:50.200]  you are always considered an enemy if you are not one of them you are an enemy that's always the
[03:25:50.200 --> 03:25:58.040]  case if you are not one of the controlled of the control group you are a controlled group
[03:25:58.680 --> 03:26:02.680]  that's that's what you always have to consider there is there's nothing in between
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:09.800]  you're either an enemy or a friend so so these groups what started kind of forming the small
[03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:15.560]  groups right like who you could count on your friends yeah we we there were a couple of people
[03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:21.640]  which i knew which i trusted with my life and that is the basic you have to look at you have to be
[03:26:21.640 --> 03:26:29.080]  really look at them and say okay if if it comes to the point he would sacrifice his life for me
[03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:35.080]  like jesus christ said your best friend or if you want to show your friendship uh is when you sacrifice
[03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:41.960]  your life right for your friends and with these guys we started to discuss and then one of them
[03:26:41.960 --> 03:26:49.400]  said hey i know some people over there who think like we okay go ahead talk to them and then the
[03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:55.480]  next one and the next one and the next one so our our group were six people which we meet once once a
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:27:02.760]  week uh as a so-called youth group in the church uh without without the pastor because the pastors
[03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:08.440]  were all they were all compromised they were all paid off they were all reporting about their church
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:17.480]  members and i have a book that is about i don't know what six inches thick which lists all of the
[03:27:17.480 --> 03:27:22.600]  compromised pastors and bishops of the Lutheran church in east germany during the stasi time so
[03:27:22.600 --> 03:27:32.840]  what we what we did was we met there we used their their facility but we were just we and so we we
[03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:40.680]  reached out every single one of us reached out to one or another guy we knew just one and said hey
[03:27:40.680 --> 03:27:47.320]  we have a group you don't tell you who it is but you go ahead and build a group like this
[03:27:47.320 --> 03:27:54.920]  with people you can trust with your life and that was a long time process when i left east germany
[03:27:54.920 --> 03:28:03.240]  in 1985 that was still growing there were still not thousands or ten thousand people in those groups
[03:28:03.240 --> 03:28:10.120]  but there were groups all over the place small groups five six eight maximum ten people where
[03:28:10.120 --> 03:28:16.840]  each of them knew another group but nobody knew all of the groups that was the key to make sure that
[03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:25.400]  if from each if a group gets fine it's it's only that group right so right now how to how to make
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:32.760]  sure that these um which we called rubber ears that were despised for the stasi paid you know for

[03:33:03.080 --> 03:33:12.040]  alex jones
[03:33:12.040 --> 03:33:16.040]  back here with you on the alex jones show and kate dally your guest host from the kate dally show
[03:33:16.040 --> 03:33:21.560]  kate dally radio dot com my guest is herald ziger what a fascinating guest because having lived
[03:33:21.560 --> 03:33:28.440]  through this sort of tyranny this is such a big help to us to know how to fight it right now and we
[03:33:28.440 --> 03:33:35.240]  should be fighting it right now before it gets as bad as east germany was um and we really do
[03:33:35.240 --> 03:33:38.840]  we're right in the throes of that so we need to understand kind of where we're at right now
[03:33:39.640 --> 03:33:44.280]  herald come come back and talk to us about so these small groups started you would start with
[03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:49.720]  maybe under 10 people you would meet often and these were people you trusted with your life
[03:33:49.720 --> 03:33:54.040]  and then you would tell them okay meet with the people that you trust with your life and these
[03:33:54.040 --> 03:34:00.040]  small groups started and then a person from each group would then know another group but the whole
[03:34:00.040 --> 03:34:05.880]  group didn't know another group just one person so that it was very kind of compartmentalized
[03:34:05.880 --> 03:34:11.160]  just like they do to us everything is compartmentalized but in this way the patriots were able to
[03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:17.640]  expand the network by knowing that they were connected they knew of each other but they didn't
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:23.960]  know exact things but these were small groups kind of like spidering out these very very small groups
[03:34:23.960 --> 03:34:29.480]  and by the way you can get a signed copy of herald's book he'll actually sign it for you and you
[03:34:29.480 --> 03:34:36.200]  can pay him directly and what is the email address that they do for that herald i already get one
[03:34:36.200 --> 03:34:46.680]  from our session yesterday so uh send me an email to hziga z i e g e r at portalmail.com
[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:53.160]  and as soon as i get the books in my hand i i just ordered a bunch of i i don't have them yet
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:59.320]  as soon as i get them in my hand i will let you know what you have to pay it's it's probably a
[03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:05.000]  a few dollars less than you pay at amazon because amazon always puts a pun off because they also
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:12.280]  they also they are so poor they need to get money and and so
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:19.400]  so right freedoms nightmare and so tell us a bit about about these spidering groups and then
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:25.560]  how you got rid of the infiltrators because the fbi and the cia are involved in just about every
[03:35:25.560 --> 03:35:30.600]  event we know this right and and they're usually they're more in spades than actual patriots
[03:35:30.600 --> 03:35:36.920]  themselves so tell us how you expose them because i think this is so brilliant so first of all we
[03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:44.840]  call we we coined that word spider uh system the spider plan system for it because the spider plan
[03:35:44.840 --> 03:35:50.280]  is actually a very good example for how these groups grew out right the spider plan puts a
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:35:57.240]  puts a rope out touch the ground and then grows roots there and then from there it goes again
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:03.080]  so that is how we that is how we grew to get the infiltrators out so we called them rubber ear
[03:36:03.080 --> 03:36:08.360]  because uh you know they were that was just uh the nickname for these people who reported to
[03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:18.120]  the stasi about even uh browsers and sisters and and and uh they reported about you i i i can't go
[03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:25.880]  into that we we don't have the time anyway so to filter them out we would create uh fake events
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:31.320]  we would say for example i would go into the collective and i would say hey tomorrow or on
[03:36:31.320 --> 03:36:40.840]  friday we will meet at the restaurant xyz and we will all have a huge sign in hand and will
[03:36:41.640 --> 03:36:48.040]  and will say uh unite germany unite germany or something like that and the only guys who would
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:56.280]  go there were the guys who were the spies because everyone in the core groups knew that that is
[03:36:56.280 --> 03:37:01.400]  stupid to do it you get arrested and you get jailed for nothing achieved you you wouldn't
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:06.760]  achieve anything right but these people they thought they have something and they would go
[03:37:06.760 --> 03:37:13.000]  there and the stasi would wait for all of us and nothing happened but the stasi knew who was the
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:20.680]  reporters who were the spies so they didn't arrest them and that was for us was okay now we know who
[03:37:20.680 --> 03:37:29.880]  you are right don't come now i love this i love this i love this because you know you're you're
[03:37:29.880 --> 03:37:34.360]  banking on the fact that these people don't have fear because they know if they get arrested they're
[03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:39.320]  going to be let go so there's something about that that they're willing to toy with that actually
[03:37:39.320 --> 03:37:43.400]  exposes them and outs them because they know nothing is going to happen to them you would be
[03:37:43.400 --> 03:37:48.440]  in fear doing that and you would know that there would be no upside of it so there's no reason for
[03:37:48.440 --> 03:37:53.640]  you to go do that but they would think that well they were proving themselves to you in their mindset
[03:37:53.640 --> 03:37:58.360]  but they also have no fear and that's something to detect from these people because they truly
[03:37:58.360 --> 03:38:04.600]  don't have any fear about getting about getting caught and usually released within 24 hours and
[03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:09.720]  so that's another great way to understand because i know i know of people in this situation that they
[03:38:09.720 --> 03:38:15.000]  posed as patriots they were released within 24 hours and then they just said oh i was just released
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:19.880]  and i don't know why no i know exactly why because they're they're infiltrators so i love that you
[03:38:19.880 --> 03:38:24.600]  guys did this and were smart enough to understand how their mindset works because they would not
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:28.760]  have been afraid and that's something to pick up on they would have showed i love this this is great
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:36.680]  yeah there was a there was another thing which we which we very well knew when when you you walk
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:43.960]  down the road and suddenly a number of people would start a brawl right in public they would you
[03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:48.520]  know they would they would have beer bottles in hand and they would they would yell at each other
[03:38:48.520 --> 03:38:55.560]  and then they would start to brawl you stood away as far as you could because that was one of the
[03:38:55.560 --> 03:39:02.280]  tricks the stansy used to lure yours i mean they had your eyes on you right they knew you were not
[03:39:02.280 --> 03:39:07.960]  one of them so they had their eyes on you they monitored you if you got close enough to that group
[03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:14.360]  which were creating some uproar or some stirrup right you were close enough they would catch the
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:22.040]  whole group including you and they would sentence you for for creating public uproar
[03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:28.200]  two or three years to jail and all the other people which which was january six is a perfect
[03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:35.160]  example of this right exactly that's why i that's why i brought that on it's the perfect example
[03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:40.840]  you get you you get initiated to do something which is obviously not
[03:39:42.520 --> 03:39:48.920]  furthering your agenda you do something right and mostly in an emotional situation right people
[03:39:48.920 --> 03:39:54.760]  get emotional and yeah that's all right we have a right to do this there is nothing wrong with
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:40:01.960]  all right it's all correct but these people are just waiting for it and you know the rope is already
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:10.280]  produced right that is what we always have to think about so using these small groups to organize
[03:40:10.280 --> 03:40:18.920]  a network country nationwide is the first step it takes time and as i said i never harvested the
[03:40:20.040 --> 03:40:26.840]  the results of that because in 1985 i was able to leave east germany on a legal basis but
[03:40:26.840 --> 03:40:33.160]  that at least the groups were already starting to connect to out the cities the world i think that
[03:40:33.160 --> 03:40:39.560]  when i left in 85 there were probably 4 000 small groups existing and that is just an estimation
[03:40:39.560 --> 03:40:45.720]  because we had no real numbers you couldn't write a letter to somebody let's say in in berlin and say
[03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:50.280]  hey guy what is our group doing can we meet somewhere or so you couldn't do that that letter
[03:40:50.280 --> 03:40:56.520]  would be open and read by people who had no business to do that and you would be you would be
[03:40:56.520 --> 03:41:02.680]  screwed right so the same was with the phone system the phone system was probably on the
[03:41:02.680 --> 03:41:10.920]  stand of 19 i don't know 33 or so i'm 34 um so you couldn't use that either it was i mean i had
[03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:19.400]  reports on my phone uh was uh money taught for i think four weeks or so during um surveillance
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:24.360]  action they did it's all in the book as i said i can't i can't explain everything here
[03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:30.840]  yeah so do we have to like let's say uh pigeons i mean i'm not quite sure with with the surveillance
[03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:35.640]  going on all the cameras all the surveillance systems when i was uh driving home from las
[03:41:35.640 --> 03:41:41.160]  vegas i noticed they installed all those new light fixtures with all the five led lights that come
[03:41:41.160 --> 03:41:47.240]  down and and surveillance cameras so with this kind of system i mean first of all you say leave
[03:41:47.240 --> 03:41:53.480]  your cell phones at home so no no nobody can be tracked where you go to meet um and you can't
[03:41:53.480 --> 03:41:57.880]  bring it with you just turn it off that's not possible because it still tracks we all know this
[03:41:57.880 --> 03:42:03.960]  and so there's we're gonna have to be very very creative in um in furthering this under i know
[03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:08.840]  there's an underground but furthering this underground to get the population and the masses
[03:42:09.560 --> 03:42:13.480]  to be able to connect with each other because how would you do it i mean it's so difficult you've
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:19.480]  got about 30 seconds before we go to break but how would you do it right now you have to avoid the
[03:42:19.480 --> 03:42:27.000]  modern um systems of communication completely even your car is tracked right uh if you have a
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:32.280]  modern car it's tracked the computer is constantly sending signals to the manufacturer or servers
[03:42:32.280 --> 03:42:39.480]  where it is and and how the condition is so small groups mean you you you you meet in small groups
[03:42:39.480 --> 03:42:45.800]  in your small area right where you use a bicycle stop using your car use a bicycle
[03:42:45.800 --> 03:42:51.240]  so Harold wait right there we're gonna we have to come back because now we have to find out how

[03:46:58.200 --> 03:47:04.200]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:47:04.200 --> 03:47:19.960]  welcome back final segment with herald ziger he is the author of freedoms nightmare he experienced
[03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:24.840]  this story he was a full-fledged communist his mother was he found out later was a spy
[03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:31.880]  for east germany and a reporting on you know people and things going on and he tells this
[03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:36.040]  story and there's so many more details in the book and so if you're wondering why we're kind of
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:42.440]  outing some of the ways in which the people expose the infiltrators there's so many more things
[03:47:42.440 --> 03:47:48.280]  inside this book that you need to see because this is truly you know they they have well-laid plans
[03:47:48.280 --> 03:47:53.960]  if we haven't figured that out by now you should um so the well-laid plans have been um have been
[03:47:53.960 --> 03:48:01.720]  well-laid for you know 150 years and now it's it's up to us to fight this it's up to the people to
[03:48:01.720 --> 03:48:07.160]  get involved to do what they need to do right now we're told a lot of narratives no it is not a china
[03:48:07.160 --> 03:48:15.000]  virus a sniffle no it's here we were in charge of that no ukraine is not at i don't think they're
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:19.960]  actually at war i actually think it's a money laundering operation we need to be able to think
[03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:25.080]  before it's illegal we need to be able to say just like herald did now wait a second here i'm
[03:48:25.080 --> 03:48:30.600]  thinking i'm using my brain we have a god-given brain and we have those god-given spiritual gifts
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:36.200]  to identify what is truth and what is not and we need to use them herald zeager's book freedoms
[03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:40.360]  nightmare there's so much packed in this book about how they obtained information from people
[03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:45.080]  how they did this under tyrannical rule you have to realize they were under more tyrannical rule
[03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:52.040]  than we are right now and they were able to free themselves of that stranglehold in east germany
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:57.160]  herald how did they do it they formed these small groups they would have a spokesman from the group
[03:48:57.160 --> 03:49:02.120]  go and meet with another group but not everybody in the group knew who the other group was because
[03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:08.120]  they wanted to keep that compartmentalized which was very very smart they set up fake events to
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:12.840]  expose the infiltrators within the group because we know how many of them are they're unamerican the
[03:49:12.840 --> 03:49:18.760]  fbi and the cia very very unamerican and will act against their own citizenry so you have to expose
[03:49:18.760 --> 03:49:24.120]  them and their total nimrods anyway i don't think that's going to be that hard to do and then what
[03:49:24.120 --> 03:49:32.200]  did these small groups then do to create the situation that they never talk about in ending east
[03:49:32.200 --> 03:49:37.960]  germany because it was the power of the people yeah they don't want people to know that they have
[03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:44.360]  power right so what what started was when the groups and again i have to say i wasn't there
[03:49:44.360 --> 03:49:50.680]  when that really went off i was already out of the country but i still had connections and and
[03:49:50.680 --> 03:49:57.960]  we watched what was going on so but what started was that they uh when when they had enough groups
[03:49:57.960 --> 03:50:04.840]  in the city they would just come together monday evening would light a candle and would march around
[03:50:04.840 --> 03:50:11.960]  the church in some cities you had several churches they would just march around every church you would
[03:50:11.960 --> 03:50:20.840]  have three or four or five of these uh marching around the church and scan the thing the slogan we
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:29.720]  are the people we are the people we are the people over and over and over again for sometimes for two
[03:50:29.720 --> 03:50:38.440]  hours um and when the first of those events happened in several cities at the same time
[03:50:38.440 --> 03:50:46.440]  this german stasi was completely shocked they had no idea that that was growing and that
[03:50:46.440 --> 03:50:53.960]  that suddenly uh like an explosion came up uh then they tried to infiltrate again using the
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:59.400]  youth pastors which were especially many of the youth pastors were actually coming out of the
[03:50:59.400 --> 03:51:08.280]  uh government controlled universities were actually heavily in favor of communism i i don't
[03:51:08.280 --> 03:51:14.520]  know how you can do that combining the bible with communism but they were and they always said we
[03:51:14.520 --> 03:51:22.200]  have to be in agreement with the socialistic agenda here because it is the right way for the
[03:51:22.200 --> 03:51:28.520]  people to do and things like that so they tried to stop that these these kind of events but that
[03:51:28.520 --> 03:51:34.920]  was too late at this time it was too late if you have already let's say in a in a 50 000
[03:51:34.920 --> 03:51:44.120]  people city uh thousand thousand 200 people who would go to an event like this within weeks of
[03:51:44.120 --> 03:51:51.480]  these events five six seven thousand people would march around the church and at the end when that
[03:51:51.480 --> 03:52:04.280]  all imploded uh so in in in late summer early fall of 1989 there were 4 000 towns or states towns or
[03:52:04.280 --> 03:52:12.520]  cities whatever you the best name would be for uh in in all over east germany so when you say
[03:52:12.520 --> 03:52:18.840]  4 000 towns this is probably even a small village with 500 people where people would
[03:52:18.840 --> 03:52:26.200]  walk around the church and would would have the light and say we are the people and in um in
[03:52:26.200 --> 03:52:36.440]  late summer early fall 1989 that turned into a different slogan we are one people and that
[03:52:36.440 --> 03:52:42.280]  was actually the beginning of the end because that was the demand for unification of germany
[03:52:42.280 --> 03:52:52.440]  and the commons party had no tool to stop that other than a military event and they actually
[03:52:52.440 --> 03:52:57.160]  ordered there are books out there you can you can buy them unfortunately only in german
[03:52:57.720 --> 03:53:02.680]  but you can get them if you if you are able to read or if you want to use a translator to to
[03:53:02.680 --> 03:53:12.920]  translate this uh two paramilitary uh two parachute battalions were ordered to leitzig which was the
[03:53:12.920 --> 03:53:20.040]  center of the protests with the largest demonstrations around two churches about 25 000 people every night
[03:53:20.840 --> 03:53:27.800]  would march around the churches there and um they were sent over there and it was planned
[03:53:27.800 --> 03:53:35.080]  to shoot down the protestors and disperse them they had the order to do that from the political
[03:53:35.080 --> 03:53:43.640]  leadership and the commander of the parachuter troops declined to execute that command and sent
[03:53:43.640 --> 03:53:53.000]  his troops home and that was the end so there is a ton of power in the masses if they do it right
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:54:01.640]  and you cannot i i always wonder about people who are sitting in in you know presenting a video on
[03:54:01.640 --> 03:54:06.840]  facebook presenting the rifle and said yeah they should come they should come i will show them
[03:54:06.840 --> 03:54:12.280]  yeah they will come for you a single guy anytime but consider that you have let's say
[03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:19.640]  what we had 80 million voters for for president trump last election which was faked right right
[03:54:19.640 --> 03:54:27.080]  so let's say half half of them are not able to do anything for you know health reasons
[03:54:27.880 --> 03:54:35.720]  they just can't we still have 40 million right now out of these 40 million whatever half of them
[03:54:35.720 --> 03:54:44.280]  can't do anything but they may be able to support a uh a uh movement right so the other 20 million
[03:54:44.280 --> 03:54:53.480]  can be they can go out they can camp in front of a capital with 25 30 000 people surrounding
[03:54:56.040 --> 03:55:00.920]  right and here's the thing if you had 10 people marching around the churches right
[03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:05.720]  wouldn't you be then wanting to go be part of that i mean look what just happened with the
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:10.600]  rut with the um with that with the what happened in kentucky with the youth you would want to be
[03:55:10.600 --> 03:55:15.640]  part of that that's very exciting to be part of it and here's the deal when we went to the capital
[03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:22.920]  they used our anger as a nation the majority of us against us you guys were going to the churches
[03:55:22.920 --> 03:55:28.920]  and this was not something where they could use use the anger against you because you were just
[03:55:28.920 --> 03:55:32.760]  literally walking around the church the people were walking around the church is saying we are
[03:55:32.760 --> 03:55:39.080]  the people there's nothing angry about they can't use it to their advantage right right and and i
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:46.520]  think if you if you go ahead and let's say you have you have 20 000 people who can camp out around
[03:55:46.520 --> 03:55:51.800]  the capital just just don't go there on sunday or saturday they don't care about what you do on a
[03:55:51.800 --> 03:55:58.680]  saturday or sunday make it for them impossible to go further on with their agenda and that means
[03:55:58.680 --> 03:56:04.760]  they cannot work they cannot do what they want to do and the other 20 million people can support
[03:56:04.760 --> 03:56:11.880]  those who can do that right that should work but we have to get them together we have to throw away
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:18.520]  all these conceptions we have oh yeah this guy is uh i don't know it's a Lutheran and this guy is a
[03:56:18.520 --> 03:56:25.320]  catholic and this guy is that no i can't do with them on oh he he wants to have flat tax no i can
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:32.440]  work with these guys no and this guy don't want it is and throw that away there is one single goal
[03:56:32.440 --> 03:56:39.560]  for my opinion one single goal the united states patio should have and that is get the united states
[03:56:39.560 --> 03:56:47.480]  on the basis of the constitution again throw out the banksters get rid of the federal reserve get rid
[03:56:47.480 --> 03:56:55.160]  of the irs if you throw out the banksters this country will survive but if you don't you want
[03:56:55.160 --> 03:57:04.760]  right we've got to stop looking for a leader to do it to guide us there's no leader you in the small
[03:57:04.760 --> 03:57:09.240]  groups they didn't have a leader they just had the will to do it we only have a couple of seconds
[03:57:09.240 --> 03:57:14.600]  left herald uh zeager the book is freedoms nightmare you can get it on amazon bookstores
